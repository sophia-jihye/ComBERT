 Item 1. Business 

Organization

Sotherly Hotels Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a self-managed and self-administered lodging real estate investment trust, or REIT, that was formed in August 2004 to own, acquire, renovate and reposition full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties located in primary markets in the mid-Atlantic and southern United States. On December 21, 2004, the Company successfully completed its initial public offering and elected to be treated as a self-advised REIT for federal income tax purposes. The Company conducts its business through Sotherly Hotels LP, its operating partnership (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;), of which the Company is the general partner. The Company owns approximately 86.8% of the partnership units in the Operating Partnership. Limited partners (including certain of the Company&#8217;s officers and directors) own the remaining Operating Partnership units.

As of March 1, 2016, our portfolio consists of twelve full-service, primarily upscale and upper-upscale hotels located in eight states with an aggregate of 3,011 rooms and approximately 160,928 square feet of meeting space. All of these hotels are wholly-owned by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership, eleven operate under the Hilton TM , Crowne Plaza TM , DoubleTree TM and Sheraton TM brands, one is an independent hotel, and all are managed on a day to day basis by MHI Hotels Services, LLC, which does business as Chesapeake Hospitality (&#8220;Chesapeake Hospitality&#8221;). 

In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT, it cannot directly manage or operate our wholly-owned hotels. Therefore, we lease our wholly-owned hotel properties to entities that we refer to as our TRS Lessees, which in turn have engaged Chesapeake Hospitality, an eligible independent management company, to manage our hotels. Our TRS Lessees are wholly-owned subsidiaries of MHI Hospitality TRS Holding, Inc. (&#8220;MHI Holding&#8221;, and collectively, &#8220;MHI TRS&#8221;). MHI TRS is a taxable REIT subsidiary for federal income tax purposes.

Our corporate office is located at 410 West Francis Street, Williamsburg, Virginia 23185. Our telephone number is (757) 229-5648.

Our Properties

In connection with the Company&#8217;s initial public offering, the Company acquired six hotel properties for aggregate consideration of approximately $15.0 million in cash, 3,817,036 units of interest in our Operating Partnership and the assumption of approximately $50.8 million in debt. The six initial hotel properties, the Hilton Philadelphia Airport, the Holiday Inn Brownstone, the Holiday Inn Downtown Williamsburg, the Hilton Wilmington Riverside, the Hilton Savannah DeSoto and the Holiday Inn Laurel West (formerly the Best Western Maryland Inn), are located in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Maryland, respectively.

On July 22, 2005, we acquired the Crowne Plaza Jacksonville Riverfront (formerly, the Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront) located in Jacksonville, Florida, for $22.0 million. 

During 2006, we sold the Holiday Inn Downtown Williamsburg for $4.75 million. We also purchased the Louisville Ramada Riverfront Inn located in Jeffersonville, Indiana for approximately $7.7 million including transfer costs and, after extensive renovations, re-opened the property in May 2008 as the Sheraton Louisville Riverside.

During 2007, through our joint venture with CRP/MHI Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of Carlyle Realty Partners V, L.P., and Carlyle, we acquired a 25.0% indirect, noncontrolling interest in the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort, a 311-room hotel in Hollywood, Florida for approximately $75.8 million including transfer costs. We also purchased a hotel formerly known as the Tampa Clarion Hotel in Tampa, Florida for approximately $13.8 million including transfer costs, which, after extensive renovations, re-opened in March 2009 as the Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore. 

During 2008, we acquired the Hampton Marina Hotel located in Hampton, Virginia for approximately $7.8 million, including transfer costs. In October 2008, the hotel was re-branded and renamed the Crowne Plaza Hampton Marina.

During 2011, after extensive renovations, we re-branded and renamed the Holiday Inn Brownstone to the DoubleTree by Hilton Raleigh Brownstone-University.

During 2013 we acquired the Crowne Plaza Houston Downtown located in Houston, Texas at an aggregate value of approximately $30.9 million, including certain closing costs.

&#160;

During 2014, we acquired the Georgian Terrace located in Atlanta, Georgia at an aggregate value of approximately $61.1 million, including certain closing costs. We also, after extensive reno vations, re-branded and renamed the Hilton Philadelphia Airport to the DoubleTree by Hilton Philadelphia Airport. 

During 2015, we acquired the remaining 75.0% interest in (i) the entity that owns the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort, and (ii) the entity that leases the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort. As a result, the Operating Partnership now has a 100% indirect ownership interest in the entities that own the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort. We also, after extensive renovations, re-branded and renamed the Crowne Plaza Jacksonville Riverfront to the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, and re-branded and renamed the Holiday Inn Laurel West to the DoubleTree by Hilton Laurel.

See Item 2 of this Form 10-K for additional detail on our properties.

Our Strategy and Investment Criteria

Our strategy is to grow through acquisitions of full-service, upscale and upper-upscale hotel properties located in the primary markets of the southern United States. We intend to grow our portfolio through disciplined acquisitions of hotel properties and believe that we will be able to source significant external growth opportunities through our management team&#8217;s extensive network of industry, corporate and institutional relationships.

Our investment criteria are further detailed below:

&#160;

&#183; 

Geographic Growth Markets: We are focusing our growth strategy on the major markets in the Southern region of the United States. Our management team remains confident in the long-term growth potential associated with this part of the United States. We believe these markets have, during the Company&#8217;s and our predecessors&#8217; existence, been characterized by population growth, economic expansion, growth in new businesses and growth in the resort, recreation and leisure segments. We will continue to focus on these markets, including coastal locations, and will investigate other markets for acquisitions only if we believe these new markets will provide similar long-term growth prospects. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Full-Service Hotels: We focus our acquisition strategy on the full-service hotel segment. Our full-service hotels fall primarily under the upscale to upper-upscale categories and include such brands as Hilton, Doubletree by Hilton, Sheraton and Crowne Plaza, as well as independent hotels affiliated with Preferred Hotels &#38; Resorts. We do not own economy hotels. We believe that full-service hotels, in the upscale to upper-upscale categories, will outperform the broader U.S. hotel industry, and thus offer the highest returns on invested capital. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Significant Barriers to Entry: We intend to execute a strategy that entails the acquisition of hotels in prime locations with significant barriers to entry. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Proximity to Demand Generators: We seek to acquire hotel properties located in central business districts for both leisure and business travelers within the respective markets, including large state universities, airports, convention centers, corporate headquarters, sports venues and office buildings. We seek to be in walking locations that are proximate to the markets&#8217; major demand generators. 

We typically define underperforming hotels as those that are poorly managed, suffer from significant deferred maintenance and capital investment and that are not properly positioned in their respective markets. In pursuing these opportunities, we hope to improve revenue and cash flow and increase the long-term value of the underperforming hotels we acquire. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a total investment that is substantially less than replacement cost of a hotel or the acquisition cost of a market performing hotel. In analyzing a potential investment in an underperforming hotel property, we typically characterize the investment opportunity as one of the following:

&#160;

&#183; 

Up-branding Opportunity: The acquisition of properties that can be upgraded physically and enhanced operationally to either qualify for repositioning through a change in brand affiliation or provide improved competitive advantage while maintaining their independent status. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Shallow-Turn Opportunity: The acquisition of an underperforming but structurally sound hotel that requires moderate renovation to re-establish the hotel in its market. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Deep-Turn Opportunity : The acquisition of a hotel that is closed or functionally obsolete and requires a restructuring of both the business components of the operations as well as the physical plant of the hotel, including extensive renovation of the building, furniture, fixtures and equipment. 

Typically, in our experience, a deep turn opportunity takes a total of approximately four years from the initial acquisition of a property to achieving full post-renovation stabilization. Therefore, when evaluating future opportunities in underperforming hotels, we 

&#160;

intend to focus on up-branding and shallow- turn opportunities, and to pursue deep-turn opportunities on a more limited basis and in joint venture partnerships if possible. 

Investment Vehicles. In pursuit of our investment strategy, we may employ various traditional and non-traditional investment vehicles: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Direct Purchase Opportunity: Our traditional investment strategy is to acquire direct ownership interests via our Operating Partnership in properties that meet our investment criteria, including opportunities that involve full-service, upscale and upper-upscale properties in identified geographic growth markets that have significant barriers to entry for new product delivery. Such properties, or portfolio of properties, may or may not be acquired subject to a mortgage by the seller or third-party. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Joint Venture/Mezzanine Lending Opportunities: We may, from time to time, undertake a significant renovation and rehabilitation project that we characterize as a deep-turn opportunity. In such cases, we may acquire a functionally obsolete hotel whose renovation may be very lengthy and require significant capital. In these projects, we may choose to structure such acquisitions as a joint venture, or mezzanine lending program, in order to avoid severe short-term dilution and loss of current income commonly referred to as the &#8220;negative carry&#8221; associated with such extensive renovation programs. We will not pursue joint venture or mezzanine programs in which we would become a &#8220;de facto&#8221; lender to the real estate community. 

Portfolio and Asset Management Strategy

We intend to ensure that the management of our hotel properties maximizes market share, as evidenced by revenue per available room (&#8220;RevPAR&#8221;) penetration indices, and that our market share yields the optimum level of revenues for our hotels in their respective markets. Our strategy is designed to actively manage our hotels&#8217; operating expenses in an effort to maximize hotel earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;Hotel EBITDA&#8221;).

Over our long history in the lodging industry we have refined many portfolio and asset management techniques that we believe provide for exceptional cash returns at our hotels. We undertake extensive budgeting due diligence wherein we examine market trends, one-time or exceptional revenue opportunities, and/or changes in the regulatory climate that may impact costs. We review daily revenue results and revenue management strategies at the hotels, and we focus on our manager&#8217;s ability to produce high quality revenues that translate to higher marginal profitability. We look for ancillary forms of revenues, such as leasing roof-top space for cellular towers and other communication devices and also look to lease space to third parties in our hotels, which may include, but are not limited to, gift shops or restaurants. We have and will continue to engage parking management companies to maximize parking revenue. Our efforts further include periodic review of property insurance costs and coverage, and the cost of real and personal property taxes. We generally appeal tax increases in an effort to secure lower tax payments and routinely pursue strategies that allow for lower overall insurance costs, such as purchasing re-insurance and participating in state-sponsored insurance pools.

We also require detailed and refined reporting data from Chesapeake Hospitality, which includes detailed accounts of revenues, revenue segments, expenses and forecasts based on current and historic booking patterns. We also believe we optimize and successfully manage capital costs at our hotels while ensuring that adequate product standards are maintained to provide a positive guest experience.

None of our hotels are managed by a major national or global hotel franchise company. Through our long history in the lodging industry, we have found that management of our hotels by management companies other than franchisors is preferable to and more profitable than management derived from the major franchise companies, specifically with respect to optimization of operating expenses and the delivery of guest service.

Our portfolio management strategy includes our effort to optimize labor costs. The labor force in our hotels is predominately non-unionized, with only one property, the DoubleTree by Hilton Jacksonville Riverfront, having a total of approximately six employees electing to participate under a collective bargaining arrangement. Further, the labor force at our hotels is eligible to receive health and other insurance coverage through Chesapeake Hospitality, which self-insures. Self-insuring has, in our opinion and experience, provided significant savings over traditional insurance company sponsored plans.

Asset Disposition Strategy. When a property no longer fits with our investment objectives, we will pursue a direct sale of the property for cash so that our investment capital can be redeployed according to the investment strategies outlined above. Where possible, we will seek to subsequently purchase a hotel in connection with the requirements of a tax-free exchange. Such a strategy may be deployed in order to mitigate the tax consequence that a direct sale may cause. 

&#160;

Our Principal Agreements 

Management Agreements

Chesapeake Hospitality is currently the management company for each of our hotels. Certain of our executive officers and certain of our directors are also directors of Chesapeake Hospitality

On December 15, 2014, we entered into a master agreement (the &#8220;Master Agreement&#8221;) and a series of individual hotel management agreements (each a &#8220;Hotel Management Agreement&#8221; and, together, the &#8220;Hotel Management Agreements&#8221;) between the Company, the operating partnership, and MHI Hospitality TRS, LLC on the one hand and Chesapeake Hospitality on the other hand, to address the scheduled expiration of the then existing master management agreement (the &#8220;MMA&#8221;) and the strategic alliance agreement (the &#8220;SA Agreement&#8221;) and to provide for ongoing management of the Company&#8217;s hotels. The Master Agreement and Hotel Management Agreements terminated and replaced the then existing MMA and individual management agreements.

The Master Agreement:

&#160;

&#183; 

expires on December 31, 2019, or earlier if all of the Hotel Management Agreements expire or are terminated prior to that date. The Master Agreement will be extended beyond 2019 for such additional periods as a Hotel Management Agreement remains in effect; 

&#160;

&#183; 

terminated the then existing SA Agreement as of December 15, 2014; 

&#160;

&#183; 

extended the term of the then existing MMA until December 31, 2014 and terminated the MMA and other individual management agreements for Tampa, Houston, and Atlanta as of such date; 

&#160;

&#183; 

caused the Hotel Management Agreements to come into effect coincident with the termination of the MMA and other individual management agreements on December 31, 2014; 

&#160;

&#183; 

requires Chesapeake Hospitality to provide dedicated executive level support for our managed hotels pursuant to certain criteria; 

&#160;

&#183; 

provides a mechanism and established conditions on which the Company will offer Chesapeake Hospitality the opportunity to manage hotels acquired by the Company in the future, pursuant to a negotiated form of single facility management agreement, with the caveat that the Company is not required to offer the management of future hotels to Chesapeake Hospitality ; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

sets an incentive management fee for each of the hotels to be managed by Chesapeake Hospitality equal to 10% of the amount by which gross operating profit, as defined in the Hotel Management Agreement, for a given year exceeds the budgeted gross operating profit for such year; provided, however, that the incentive management fee payable in respect of any such year shall not exceed 0.25% of the gross revenues of the hotel included in such calculation. 

Each of the Hotel Management Agreements has a term of five years commencing January 1, 2015, with the exception of the Hotel Management Agreement for the management of the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort, which has a term of five years commencing July 31, 2015. Each of the Hotel Management Agreements may be extended for up to two additional periods of five years subject to the approval of both parties with respect to any such extension. The agreements provide that Chesapeake Hospitality will be the sole and exclusive manager of the hotels as the agent of the lessee and at the sole cost and expense of the lessee and subject to certain operating standards. Each agreement may be terminated in connection with a sale of the related hotel. In connection with a termination upon the sale of the hotel, Chesapeake Hospitality will be entitled to receive a termination fee equal to the lesser of the management fee paid with respect to the prior twelve months or the management fees paid for that number of months prior to the closing date of the hotel sale equal to the number of months remaining on the current term of the Hotel Management Agreement. No sale termination fee will be payable in the event the Company elects to provide Chesapeake Hospitality with the opportunity to manage another comparable hotel and Chesapeake Hospitality is not precluded from accepting such opportunity. Chesapeake Hospitality is required to qualify as an eligible independent contractor in order to permit the Company to continue to operate as a real estate investment trust. 

Amounts Payable under the Management Agreements. Chesapeake Hospitality receives a base management fee, and, if the hotels exceed certain financial thresholds, an additional incentive management fee for the management of our hotels. 

&#160;

The base management fee fo r each of our initial hotels and for any subsequent hotels we directly acquire will be a percentage of the gross revenues of the hotel and will be due monthly. The applicable percentage of gross revenue for the base management fee for each of our wholly-ow ned hotels is as follows (1):

(2) 

Upon acquiring the Crowne Plaza Hollywood Beach Resort in July 2015, we entered into a single facility management agreement with Chesapeake Hospitality for the management of the hotel. The terms of the agreement provide for a base management fee of 2.00% through July 2016, 2.25% through July 2017, and 2.50% thereafter. 

( 3 ) 

In November 2013, we assumed the existing management agreement with Chesapeake Hospitality for the management of the Crowne Plaza Houston Downtown. The terms of the agreement provided for a base management fee of 2.0% and no incentive management fee. 

( 4 ) 

In January 2009, we entered a separate management agreement with Chesapeake Hospitality for the management of the Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore. The provisions of the new agreement related to base management fee were the same as those contained in the MMA. The provisions of the agreement related to the incentive management fee were the same as those contained in the MMA except that it was calculated separately and not aggregated with the other properties covered by the MMA. 

( 5 ) 

In March 2014, we entered into the Atlanta Agreement with Chesapeake Hospitality for the management of the Georgian Terrace. The terms of the agreement provided for a base management fee of 2.0% and no incentive management fee. The Atlanta Agreement was terminated in connection with the entry into the Master Agreement and Hotel Management Agreements. 

( 6 ) 

Pursuant to the MMA, the term for each of the initial properties, which included the Holiday Inn Downtown Williamsburg, was 10 years. The management company agreed to substitute the Sheraton Louisville Riverside for the Holiday Inn Downtown Williamsburg for remainder of the term of the agreement. 

The base management fee for a hotel acquired in the future which is first leased by our TRS Lessees, other than on the first day of a fiscal year, will be 2.0% for the partial year such hotel is first leased and for the first full year such hotel is managed. There is no fee cap on the base management fee.

Terminated Strategic Alliance Agreement and Management Agreements

On December 21, 2004, we entered into the now terminated ten-year SA Agreement with Chesapeake Hospitality pursuant to which (i) Chesapeake Hospitality agreed to refer to us (on an exclusive basis) hotel acquisition opportunities in the United States presented to Chesapeake Hospitality, and (ii) unless a majority of the Company&#8217;s independent directors in good faith concluded for valid business reasons that another management company should manage a hotel owned by us, we agreed to offer Chesapeake Hospitality or its subsidiaries the right to manage hotel properties that we acquired in the United States. The SA Agreement was terminated effective as of December 15, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the Master Agreement.

&#160;

Pursuant to the terms of the now terminated MMA and other individual management agreements for Tampa, Houston and Atlanta , we engaged Chesapeake Hospitality as the property manager for each of our wholly-owned hotels through December 2015 . The MMA had a term of ten (10) y ears for each initial hotels and a term of ten (10) years for each subsequently acquired hotel that became subject to the MMA. Chesapeake Hospitality benefited from the payment of management fees by us pursuant to the MMA. Chesapeake Hospitality received a base management fee equal to a percentage of each hotel&#8217;s revenues (2.0% for the first year, 2.5% for the second year and 3.0% thereafter). Additionally, pursuant to the MMA, Chesapeake Hospitality was entitled to receive certain incentive fees and proje ct management fees. For Tampa, the base management and incentive management fees were the same as thos e contained in the MMA. For Houston and Atlanta, the base management fee was e qual to 2% of the respective hotels&#8217; revenues, and there was no incentive management fee . The MMA and the individual management agreements for Tampa, Houston, and Atlanta were terminated on December 31, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the Master Agreement. 

Franchise Agreements

As of December 31, 2015, all but one of our hotels operate under franchise licenses from national hotel companies. On March 27, 2014 we purchased an independent full-service hotel in Atlanta, Georgia, which does not operate under a franchise license.

Our TRS Lessees hold the franchise licenses for our wholly-owned hotels. Chesapeake Hospitality must operate each of our hotels it manages in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreement for the hotel.

The franchise licenses generally specify certain management, operational, record keeping, accounting, reporting and marketing standards and procedures with which the franchisee must comply. Under the franchise licenses, the franchisee must comply with the franchisors&#8217; standards and requirements with respect to:

&#160;

&#183; 

training of operational personnel; 

&#160;

&#183; 

safety; 

&#160;

&#183; 

maintaining specified insurance; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the types of services and products ancillary to guest room services that may be provided; 

&#160;

&#183; 

display of signage; 

&#160;

&#183; 

marketing techniques including print media, billboards, and promotions standards; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the type, quality and age of furniture, fixtures and equipment included in guest rooms, lobbies and other common areas. 

Additionally, as the franchisee, our TRS Lessees are required to pay the franchise fees described below.

Lease Agreements 

In order for the Company to maintain qualification as a REIT, neither the Company nor the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries can operate our hotels directly. Our wholly-owned hotels are leased to our TRS Lessees, which have engaged Chesapeake Hospitality to manage the hotels. Each lease for the wholly-owned hotels has a non-cancelable term of three to ten years, subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain contingencies described in the lease.

During the term of each lease, our TRS Lessees are obligated to pay a fixed annual base rent plus a percentage rent and certain other additional charges. Base rent accrues and is paid monthly. Percentage rent is calculated by multiplying fixed percentages by gross room revenues, in excess of certain threshold amounts and is paid monthly or quarterly, according to the terms of the agreement.

Tax Status

The Company elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2004. In order to maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute, as &#8220;qualifying distributions,&#8221; at least 90.0% of its taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding its net capital gains and reduced by certain non-cash items) to its stockholders. The Company has adhered to these requirements each taxable year since its formation in 2004 and intends to continue to adhere to these requirements and maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of its taxable income (including its net capital gain) that is distributed to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and no relief provision applies, it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (as well as any applicable alternative minimum tax) and it would be disqualified from re-electing treatment as a REIT until the fifth taxable year after the year in which it failed to qualify as a REIT. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

While the Operating Partnership is generally not subject to federal and state income taxes, the unit holders of the Operating Partnership, including the Company, are subject to tax on their respective allocable shares of the Operating Partnership&#8217;s taxable income.

The Company has one taxable REIT subsidiary, MHI Holding, in which it owns an interest through the Operating Partnership. MHI Holding is subject to federal, state and local income taxes. MHI Holding has operated at a cumulative taxable loss, through December 31, 2015, of $11.8 million and in addition had deferred timing differences of approximately $0.2 million attributable to start-up expenses related to the opening of several of its hotels, which was not deductible when incurred and is being amortized over 15 years and deferred timing differences of approximately $0.5 million attributable to accrued, but not deductible, vacation and sick pay amounts. The Company has not incurred federal income taxes since its formation. The cumulative taxable loss and combined timing differences result in a net deferred tax asset of approximately $5.4 million for these cumulative deferred tax loss carryforwards.

Environmental Matters

In connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations relating to environmental protection. Under these laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on, under, or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances, or the failure to remediate such contaminated property properly, may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to borrow using such property as collateral. Furthermore, a person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of a hazardous or toxic substance at a property owned by another, or who transports such substance to or from such property, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substance released into the environment at the disposal or treatment facility. The costs of remediation or removal of such substances may be substantial, and the presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to sell such real estate or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. In connection with the ownership and operation of the hotels, we may be potentially liable for such costs.

We believe that our hotels are in compliance, in all material respects, with all federal, state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters, the violation of which would have a material adverse effect on us. We have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our present hotel properties.

&#160;

Employees 

As of March 15, 2016, we employed twelve full-time persons, all of whom work at our corporate office in Williamsburg, Virginia. All persons employed in the day-to-day operations of the hotels are employees of Chesapeake Hospitality, the management company engaged by our TRS Lessees to operate such hotels.
