(1) 

Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel opened its newly-constructed hotel in phases from May 2015 through September 2015. 

(2) 

Includes a 190-room hotel that we own and operate, and an adjacent 104-room hotel that we lease pursuant to a capital lease. 

(3) 

Under the Facilities Agreement with Hyatt Equities, L.L.C., we have the ability to provide rooms to our guests at the Hyatt Regency at Lake Tahoe upon mutually agreeable rates, as well as other amenities and services that cater to our guests and support our operations. 

We manage our casinos based on geographic regions within the United States. Accordingly, Stockman&#8217;s Casino and Grand Lodge Casino comprise a Northern Nevada business segment, while Rising Star Casino Resort and Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel are currently distinct segments. We previously managed certain casinos owned by Native American tribes and we also consider our fee-based casino development and management services as a segment, although none of our current casino properties are managed for others. 

Our mission is to maximize shareholder value. We seek to increase revenues by providing our guests with their favorite games and amenities, high-quality customer service, and appropriate customer loyalty programs. Our customers include local, value-oriented gaming customers who represent a high potential for repeat visits; generating customer satisfaction and loyalty with this segment is a critical component of our strategy. We also have drive-in tourist patrons that we can entice for repeat visits. We continuously focus on improving the operating margins of our existing properties through a combination of top-line revenue growth and careful expense management. We also assess growth and development opportunities, which can include capital investments at our existing properties, the development of new properties, and the acquisition of existing properties. 

Play at our slot machines accounts for most of our revenues and income, but we also offer a wide range of table games. We set minimum and maximum betting limits for the properties based on market conditions, customer demand and other factors. Our gaming revenues are primarily derived from a broad base of guests that includes both high and low-stakes players. 

All of our casino properties operate 24 hours each day, every day of the year. Our casino operations are managed by us. We also manage the hotel and food and beverage operations at Silver Slipper, Rising Star and Stockman's. At the Grand Lodge Casino, Hyatt Regency manages the hotel and food and beverage operations. 

2015 Highlights 

Bronco Billy's Pending Acquisition 

On September 27, 2015, through our wholly-owned subsidiary FHR-Colorado LLC, we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement to acquire the operating assets and assume certain liabilities of Bronco Billy&#8217;s Casino and Hotel (&#8220;Bronco Billy&#8217;s&#8221;) in Cripple Creek, Colorado for a purchase price of $30 million, subject to an adjustment for working capital. We intend to finance the acquisition concurrent with the refinancing of our outstanding first and second lien debt. On February 18, 2016, 

the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission approved us for the necessary licenses required for our pending acquisition of Bronco Billy&#8217;s. We expect to complete our refinancing and close on the pending acquisition in the second quarter of 2016, subject to obtaining the remaining required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is not subject to a financing or due diligence condition, though we performed substantial due diligence prior to execution of the purchase and sale agreement. The Company made a $2.5 million deposit which would be forfeited under most circumstances if the transaction is not consummated. 

Silver Slipper Hotel Completion 

In September 2015, we completed our 129-room hotel overlooking the waterfront at the Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel. The hotel opened in phases beginning in May 2015 and was fully completed in September 2015. 

Grand Lodge Casino Lease Amendment 

On November 25, 2015, we and Hyatt Equities, L.L.C. ("Hyatt") amended our lease through which we operate the Grand Lodge Casino at the Hyatt Regency Lake Tahoe Resort, Spa &#38; Casino in Incline Village, Nevada ("Hyatt Regency") to extend our relationship and work together to refurbish and improve the casino facility. The amendment included (i) an agreement for Hyatt to renovate the casino up to a maximum cost of $3.5 million and for the Company to purchase up to $1.5 million of new gaming devices and equipment, and (ii) an increase in annual rents from $1.5 million to $1.75 million in 2017 and $2 million in 2018 and thereafter. The amendment also included, among other obligations, a five-year extension of the initial term of the lease to August 31, 2023. Hyatt has an option to purchase our leasehold interests and operating assets, subject to assumption of applicable liabilities, for their fair market value, plus Grand Lodge Casino&#8217;s earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) for the twelve-month period preceding the acquisition (or pro-rated if less than twelve months remain on the lease) plus any positive working capital. Under the amendment, Hyatt agreed that it cannot exercise such extension prior to January 1, 2019. For the casino to continue in operation after such exercise, Hyatt or a replacement tenant would need to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Commission. 

&#160; 

For further information on the above, see the consolidated financial statements set forth in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221;. 

Board and Executive Transition 

On November 28, 2014, Full House, and Daniel R. Lee, Bradley M. Tirpak and Craig W. Thomas (jointly and severally, the &#8220;Shareholder Group&#8221;), entered into a Settlement Agreement (the &#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;) to resolve actions taken by the Shareholder Group to call a special meeting of the Company&#8217;s shareholders for the purpose of, among other things, nominating certain individuals to our board of directors and amending the Company&#8217;s by-laws (the &#8220;Solicitation&#8221;). 

&#32;&#32;The Settlement Agreement, and later the Amended Settlement Agreement, resulted in, among other items, the increase of our board of directors from five to eight members and related appointments, the resignation of Andre M. Hilliou and Mark J. Miller as directors, the Shareholder Group's irrevocable withdrawal of its solicitation and agreement to certain customary standstill restrictions, a mutual release of claims between the Company and the Shareholder Group, and certain reimbursements. 

On January 9, 2015, in conjunction with the amendment of our existing credit facilities, Messrs. Hilliou&#8217;s and Miller&#8217;s employment was terminated. Mr. Hilliou had been the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Miller had been its Chief Operating Officer. Pursuant to the Separation Agreements, (i) all outstanding Company restricted stock held by Messrs. Hilliou and Miller (constituting 60,000 shares of common stock held by each) accelerated and vested in full as of their resignation and (ii) in connection with their terminations of employment, Messrs. Hilliou and Miller each received cash severance payments of $644,724 and $599,830, respectively, as well as other agreed upon company-paid benefits. 

On November 28, 2014, we entered into an Employment Agreement with Mr. Lee (the &#8220;Employment Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which Mr. Lee serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer. The Employment Agreement was effective as of November 28, 2014 and expires on November 30, 2018, unless earlier terminated. 

For further information see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221;. 

Operating Properties 

&#160; 

Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel 

&#160; 

On October 1, 2012, we acquired all of the outstanding membership interests in Silver Slipper Casino Venture, LLC (which owned the Silver Slipper Casino) for approximately $72.2 million, inclusive of net working capital, fees and expenses. The Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel is situated on the far west end of the Mississippi Gulf Coast in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and has approximately 37,000 square feet of gaming space containing 955 slot machines, 29 table games and live keno. The property sits at the western end of an approximately eight-mile long white sand beach, the closest such beach to the New Orleans and Baton Rouge metropolitan areas. During the third quarter of 2015, we completed the phased opening of our newly constructed 129-room hotel, which includes nine premium gaming customer suites. We lease approximately 38 acres, consisting of the seven-acre parcel on which the Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel is situated and approximately 31 acres of marshlands. We have the right to buy out the lease; such right can be exercised between February of 2019 and October 2027. Besides its casino and hotel, the property offers a fine dining restaurant, a buffet, a quick-service restaurant and two casino bars. Its customers are primarily from communities in southern Louisiana, including the New Orleans metropolitan area, and southwestern Mississippi. 

&#160; 

Rising Star Casino Resort 

&#160; 

On April 1, 2011, we acquired all of the operating assets of Grand Victoria Casino &#38; Resort, L.P. through Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary. We paid approximately $43 million for the property, including working capital, fees and re-branding costs to rename the property as the Rising Star Casino Resort. The property is located on the banks of the Ohio River in Rising Sun, Indiana, approximately one hour from Cincinnati, Ohio, and within two hours of Indianapolis, Indiana, and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. Rising Star offers approximately 40,000 square feet of casino space, including 944 slot and video poker machines and 25 table games. Under Indiana regulations, we are allowed to have significantly greater casino capacity than we operate today, but such capacity is not needed at Rising Star for the current market demands. The Company has been exploring the possibility of relocating such excess capacity to another location within the state. This would require legislative approval and there is no certainty that such approval would be received. Rising Star also offers a contiguous 190-room hotel, a leased 104-room hotel, five dining outlets and an 18-hole Scottish links golf course. 

&#160; 

Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC leases the 104-room hotel pursuant to a capital lease agreement which expires in 2027. At any time during the lease term, we have the exclusive option to purchase the hotel at a price based upon the project&#8217;s original cost of $7.7 million, reduced by the cumulative principal payments made by the Company during the lease term. At December 31, 2015, such price would have been approximately $6.2 million plus closing costs. Upon expiration of the lease term, if we have not yet exercised our option to purchase the hotel, either (i) the Landlord has the right to sell the hotel to us, or (ii) we have the option to purchase the hotel. In either case, the purchase price is $1 plus closing costs. The lease is not guaranteed by our parent company and the interest rates embedded in the lease are lower than the interest rates of our other debt. Therefore, management expects to continue the lease to its maturity and anticipates owning the hotel thereafter. 

Northern Nevada Casino Operations 

&#160; 

Stockman&#8217;s Casino 

&#160; 

We acquired Stockman&#8217;s Casino in Fallon, Nevada on January 31, 2007, for approximately $27 million, including fees and working capital. In 2008, we sold a Holiday Inn Express that was part of the original acquisition for $7.2 million. Stockman&#8217;s Casino is located approximately one hour from Reno, Nevada and includes approximately 8,400 square feet of gaming space and 235 slot machines, 4 table games and keno. The facility has a bar, a fine dining restaurant and a coffee shop. Stockman's primarily serves the local market of Fallon and surrounding areas. 

Grand Lodge Casino 

&#160; 

On June 28, 2011, we entered into a lease with Hyatt Equities L.L.C. to operate the Grand Lodge Casino at the Hyatt Regency, and entered into an agreement with HCC Corporation to acquire the operating assets and certain liabilities related to the Grand Lodge Casino for approximately $1.4 million, including operating cash and working capital. The Grand Lodge Casino is located within Hyatt Regency in Incline Village, Nevada on the north shore of Lake Tahoe. It includes approximately 18,900 square feet of casino space featuring 255 slot machines and 20 table games, including a poker room. The Hyatt Regency is one of two AAA Four Diamond hotels in the Lake Tahoe area, and is one of only three AAA Four Diamond hotels in northern Nevada. Its customers consist of both locals and tourists visiting the Lake Tahoe area. 

The lease is secured by the Company&#8217;s interests under the lease and property, as defined, and is subordinate to the liens in the First and Second Lien Credit Facilities (defined below). The lease was recently amended and is due to expire on August 31, 2023 and includes an option for the lessor to purchase the leasehold interest and the operating assets at the Grand Lodge Casino, subject to assumption of applicable liabilities, after January 1, 2019. The lease has an option, subject to mutual agreement, to renew for an additional five-year term. 

Recent Prior Projects 

&#160; 

Buffalo Thunder Casino and Resort 

&#160; 

From September 2011 to September 2014, we advised the Pueblo of Pojoaque on the operations of Buffalo Thunder Casino and Resort in Santa Fe, New Mexico, along with the Pueblo&#8217;s Cities of Gold and other gaming facilities. In aggregate, these gaming facilities included approximately 1,200 slot machines, 18 table games (including poker) and a simulcast area. 

&#160; 

FireKeepers Casino 

&#160; 

Until March 30, 2012, we owned 50% of Gaming Entertainment (Michigan), LLC, a joint venture with RAM Entertainment, LLC, a privately-held investment company. Gaming Entertainment (Michigan), LLC had the exclusive right to provide casino management services at the FireKeepers Casino near Battle Creek, Michigan for the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of Potawatomi for seven years commencing August 5, 2009. On March 30, 2012, our joint venture which managed the FireKeepers Casino sold its interests to the FireKeepers Development Authority for $97.5 million. In addition to the $97.5 million sale price, the FireKeepers Development Authority paid RAM Entertainment, LLC and us $1.2 million each. Our gain on the sale was $41.2 million. 

&#160; 

Terminated Transactions and Agreements 

&#160; 

On March 21, 2014, we entered into an agreement with The Majestic Star Casino LLC ("Majestic Star") to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of Majestic Mississippi, LLC (&#8220;Majestic Mississippi&#8221;), which operates a casino located in Tunica, Mississippi commonly known as the Fitz Tunica Casino &#38; Hotel. On June 23, 2014, the agreement was terminated and on August 21, 2014, we settled all disputes related to this unconsummated matter by forfeiting $1.7 million in deposits. We also incurred additional acquisition related fees for this transaction including $0.6 million of aborted registration costs associated with the attempted financing of the purchase. 

On February 26, 2014, we entered into an exclusivity agreement with Keeneland Association, Inc. (&#8220;Keeneland&#8221;) to own, manage, and operate instant racing and, if authorized, traditional casino gaming at racetracks in Kentucky, subject to completion of definitive documents for each opportunity. On November 17, 2014, both parties agreed to terminate all agreements between us. The Company was reimbursed $0.2 million of costs incurred in connection with the matter. 

For further information, see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements set forth in &#8220;Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The ownership, management, and operation of gaming facilities are subject to many federal, state, provincial, tribal and/or local laws, regulations and ordinances, which are administered by the relevant regulatory agency or agencies in each jurisdiction. These laws, regulations and ordinances are different in each jurisdiction, but primarily deal with the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations, as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. 

&#160; 

We may not own, manage or operate a gaming facility unless we obtain proper licenses, permits and approvals. Applications for a license, permit or approval may generally be denied for reasonable cause. Most regulatory authorities license, investigate, and determine the suitability of any person who has a material relationship with us. Persons having material relationships include officers, directors, employees, and certain security holders. 

&#160; 

Once obtained, licenses, permits, and approvals must be renewed from time to time and generally are not transferable. Regulatory authorities may at any time revoke, suspend, condition, limit, or restrict a license for reasonable cause. License holders may be fined and, in some jurisdictions and under certain circumstances, gaming operation revenues can be forfeited. We may be unable to obtain any licenses, permits, or approvals, or if obtained, they may not be renewed or may be revoked in the future. In addition, a rejection or termination of a license, permit, or approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect in other 

jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions require gaming operators licensed in that state to receive their permission before conducting gaming in other jurisdictions. 

&#160; 

The political and regulatory environment for gaming is dynamic and rapidly changing. The laws, regulations, and procedures dealing with gaming are subject to the interpretation of the regulatory authorities and may be amended. Any changes in such laws, regulations, or their interpretations could have a negative effect on our operations and future development of gaming opportunities. Certain specific provisions applicable to us are described below. We believe that we are in material compliance with such governmental regulations in each jurisdiction in which we conduct business. 

&#160; 

Nevada Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

In order to acquire, own or lease Stockman&#8217;s Casino, the Grand Lodge Casino or any other gaming operation in Nevada, we are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, the Nevada Gaming Commission, and various local, city and county regulatory agencies. 

&#160; 

The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada gaming authorities are based upon declarations of public policy which are concerned with, among other things: 

&#8226; 

the character of persons having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming to prevent unsavory or unsuitable persons from having a direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; 

&#8226; 

establishment and application of responsible accounting practices and procedures; 

&#8226; 

maintenance of effective control over the financial practices and financial stability of licensees, including procedures for internal controls and the safeguarding of assets and revenues; 

&#8226; 

recordkeeping and reporting to the Nevada gaming authorities; 

&#8226; 

fair operation of games; and 

&#8226; 

the raising of revenues through taxation and licensing fees. 

In May 2006, we applied for registration with the Nevada Gaming Commission as a publicly traded corporation, which was granted on January 25, 2007. The registration is not transferable and requires periodic payment of fees. The Nevada gaming authorities may limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license, registration, approval or finding of suitability for any cause deemed reasonable by the licensing agency. If a Nevada gaming authority determines that we violated gaming laws, then the approvals and licenses we hold could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked, and we, and the individuals involved, could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the gaming laws at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Each type of gaming device, slot game, slot game operating system, table game or associated equipment manufactured, distributed, leased, licensed or sold in Nevada must first be approved by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and, in some cases, the Nevada Gaming Commission. We must regularly submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Gaming Control Board. Certain loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must also be reported to or approved by the Nevada Gaming Commission. 

&#160; 

Certain officers, directors and key employees are required to be, and have been, found suitable by the Nevada Gaming Commission and employees associated with gaming must be registered as gaming employees, which are subject to immediate suspension under certain circumstances. An application for suitability may be denied for any cause deemed reasonable by the Nevada Gaming Commission. Changes in specified key positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Commission. In addition to its authority to deny an application for a license, the Nevada Gaming Commission has jurisdiction to disapprove a change in position by an officer, director or key employee. The Nevada Gaming Commission has the power to require licensed gaming companies to suspend or dismiss officers, directors or other key employees and to sever relationships with other persons who refuse to file appropriate applications or whom the authorities find unsuitable to act in such capacities. 

&#160; 

The Nevada Gaming Commission may also require anyone having a material relationship or involvement with us to be found suitable or licensed, in which case those persons are required to pay the costs and fees of the Nevada Gaming Control Board in connection with the investigation. Any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of our voting securities must report the acquisition to the Nevada Gaming Commission; any person who becomes a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our voting securities is required to apply for a finding of suitability. Under certain circumstances, an &#8220;institutional investor,&#8221; as such term is defined in the regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission, which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 25% of our voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Gaming Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability requirements, provided the institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. Additionally, an institutional investor may beneficially own more than 25%, but not more than 29%, of the voting securities if the ownership percentage results from a stock repurchase program. These institutional investors may not acquire any additional shares. An institutional investor will be deemed to hold voting securities 

for investment purposes only if the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of our board of directors, any change in our corporate charter, by-laws, management, policies or operations, or any of our gaming affiliates, or any other action which the Nevada Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding our voting securities for investment purposes only. 

&#160; 

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Gaming Commission may be found unsuitable based solely on such failure or refusal. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, when requested, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any security holder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the common stock beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Gaming Commission may be guilty of a gross misdemeanor. We are subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a security holder or to have any other relationship with us, we: 

&#8226; 

pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities; 

&#8226; 

allow that person to exercise, either directly or indirectly. any voting right conferred through securities held by that person, or; 

&#8226; 

give remuneration in any form to that person. 

If a security holder is found unsuitable, then we may be found unsuitable if we fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her voting securities for cash at fair market value. 

&#160; 

The Nevada Gaming Commission may also, in its discretion, require any other holders of our debt or equity securities to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt or equity securities. The applicant security holder is required to pay all costs of such investigation. If the Nevada Gaming Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant to the regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission, we may be sanctioned, including the loss of our approvals, if, without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission, we: 

&#8226; 

pay to the unsuitable person any dividends, interest or any distribution whatsoever; 

&#8226; 

recognize any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection with such securities; 

&#8226; 

pay the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or 

&#8226; 

make any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion exchange, liquidation or similar transaction. 

We are required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada which may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Commission at any time, and to file with the Nevada Gaming Commission, at least annually, a list of our stockholders. The Nevada Gaming Commission has the power to require our stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations of the Nevada Gaming Commission. 

&#160; 

As a licensee or registrant, we may not make certain public offerings of our securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Such approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the investment merits of the securities subject to the offering. We have received a waiver of the prior approval requirement with respect to public offerings of securities subject to certain conditions. Also, changes in control through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover cannot occur without prior investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and approval by the Nevada Gaming Commission. 

&#160; 

The Nevada legislature has declared that some repurchases of voting securities, corporate acquisitions opposed by management, and corporate defense tactics affecting Nevada gaming licensees, and registered companies that are affiliated with those operations, may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to reduce the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada&#8217;s gaming industry and to further Nevada&#8217;s policy to: 

&#8226; 

assure the financial stability of corporate gaming licensees and their affiliates; 

&#8226; 

preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and 

&#8226; 

promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs. 

Because we are a registered company, approvals may be required from the Nevada Gaming Commission before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above their current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. The Nevada Gaming Control Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered company&#8217;s Board in response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control. 

&#160; 

Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered, or who is under common control with those persons, collectively, &#8220;licensees,&#8221; and who proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the Nevada Gaming Control Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $30,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board of the licensee&#8217;s participation in foreign gaming. We currently comply with this requirement. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Licensees are required to comply with the reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Gaming Control Act. A licensee is also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if it: 

&#8226; 

knowingly violates any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation; 

&#8226; 

fails to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations; 

&#8226; 

engages in any activity or enters into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect, discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada; 

&#8226; 

engages in activities or enters into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees; or 

&#8226; 

employs, contracts with or associates with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of unsuitability. 

&#160; 

In May 2006, we adopted a compliance plan, which has been amended from time to time, and appointed a compliance committee in accordance with Nevada Gaming Commission requirements. It currently consists of the following Company directors: Kenneth R. Adams (Chair and Independent Director), Carl G. Braunlich (Independent Director), Kathleen Marshall (Independent Director), W.H. Baird Garrett (Independent Director) and Daniel R. Lee. Our compliance committee meets quarterly and is responsible for implementing and monitoring our compliance with Nevada regulatory matters, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. This committee will also review information and reports regarding the suitability of potential key employees or other parties who may be involved in material transactions or relationships with us. 

&#160; 

Indiana Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

We own and operate a wholly-owned subsidiary, Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC, which acquired and operates Rising Star Casino Resort in Rising Sun, Indiana. The ownership and operation of casino facilities in Indiana are subject to extensive state and local regulation, including primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the Indiana Gaming Commission (&#8220;IGC&#8221;). The IGC is given extensive powers and duties for administering, regulating and enforcing riverboat gaming in Indiana. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Indiana Riverboat Gaming Act, as amended (the &#8220;Indiana Act&#8221;), the IGC is authorized to award up to 11 gaming licenses to operate riverboat casinos in the State of Indiana, including five to counties contiguous to Lake Michigan in northern Indiana, five to counties contiguous to the Ohio River in southern Indiana and one to a county contiguous to Patoka Lake in southern Indiana, which was subsequently relocated to French Lick, Indiana. In April 2007, the Indiana General Assembly enacted legislation that authorized the holders of two pari-mutuel racing permits located in Anderson and Shelbyville, Indiana to obtain gambling game licenses and install up to 2,000 slot machines at each facility (&#8220;racinos&#8221;). The IGC granted each horse track a five-year gaming license authorizing the use of such slot machines. Installation of slot machines beyond the statutorily authorized number is allowed with further approval by the IGC. The slot operations at the racetracks opened in June of 2008. There is no similar cap on the number of gaming positions under each riverboat license, although the installation of additional tables and slots generally requires IGC approval. Historically, the IGC has generally permitted increases in gaming capacity, provided its concerns as to security and surveillance coverage are accommodated. In November 2011, the IGC authorized Indiana Grand, located in Shelbyville, to install an additional 200 slot machines at its facility. In November 2012, the IGC authorized Hoosier Park, in Anderson, Indiana, to install an additional 200 slot machines at its facility. In 2015, the Indiana legislature passed legislation to allow table games at racetracks (which are now limited to slot machines) beginning in 2020. 

&#160; 

The Indiana Act strictly regulates the facilities, persons, associations and practices related to gaming operations pursuant to the police powers of Indiana, including comprehensive law enforcement provisions. The Indiana Act vests the IGC with the power and duties of administering, regulating and enforcing the system of riverboat gaming in Indiana. The IGC&#8217;s jurisdiction extends to every person, association, corporation, partnership and trust involved in riverboat gaming operations in Indiana. 

&#160; 

The Indiana Act requires the owner of a riverboat gaming operation to hold an owner&#8217;s license issued by the IGC. To obtain an owner&#8217;s license, the Indiana Act requires extensive disclosure of records and other information concerning an applicant. 

Applicants for licensure must submit a comprehensive application and personal disclosure forms and undergo an exhaustive background investigation prior to the issuance of a license. The applicant must also disclose the identity of every person holding an ownership interest in the applicant. The IGC has the authority to request specific information on or license anyone holding an ownership interest. An ownership interest in a licensee may only be transferred in accordance with the Indiana Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. 

&#160; 

Each license is a revocable privilege and is not a property right under the Indiana Act. An Indiana riverboat license entitles the licensee to own and operate one riverboat and gaming equipment as part of a gaming operation. The Indiana Act allows a person to hold up to 100% of up to two separate licenses. Each initial owner&#8217;s license runs for a period of five years. Thereafter, the license is subject to renewal on an annual basis upon a determination by the IGC that the licensee continues to be eligible for an owner&#8217;s license pursuant to the Indiana Act and the rules and regulations adopted thereunder. A licensee may not lease, hypothecate, borrow money against or lend money against an owner&#8217;s riverboat gaming license. An ownership interest in an owner&#8217;s riverboat gaming license may only be transferred in accordance with the regulations promulgated under the Indiana Act. Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC applied for and, on March 15, 2011, was granted the transfer of a riverboat owner&#8217;s license. Thereafter, Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC has renewed its license annually on September 15 of each year. 

&#160; 

The Indiana Act requires that a licensed owner undergo a complete investigation every three years. If for any reason the license is terminated, the assets of the riverboat gaming operation cannot be disposed of without the approval of the IGC. Furthermore, the Indiana Act requires licensees to disclose the identity of all directors, officers and persons holding a beneficial ownership interest in the licensee, and the IGC may require licensure for such persons, as well as other key employees. The IGC also requires a comprehensive disclosure of financial and operating information on licensees, their principal officers and their parent corporations. 

&#160; 

If an institutional investor acquires 5% or more of any class of voting securities, the investor is required to notify the IGC and may be subject to a finding of suitability. Institutional investors who acquire 15% or more of any class of voting securities are subject to a finding of suitability. In addition, the IGC may require an institutional investor that acquires 15% or more of certain non-voting equity units to apply for a finding of suitability. Any other person who acquires 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a licensee is required to apply for a finding of suitability. 

&#160; 

The Indiana Act prohibits contributions to a candidate for a state, legislative, or local office, to a candidate&#8217;s committee or to a regular party by the holder of a riverboat owner&#8217;s license or a supplier&#8217;s license, by a political action committee of the licensee, by an officer of a licensee, by an officer of a person that holds at least 1% interest in the licensee or by a person holding at least 1% interest in the licensee. 

&#160; 

In 2009, the Indiana General Assembly enacted legislation requiring all casino operators to submit for approval by the IGC a written power of attorney identifying a person who would serve as a trustee to temporarily operate the casino in certain rare circumstances, such as the revocation or non-renewal of any owner&#8217;s license; the denial of an owner&#8217;s license to a proposed transferee and the person attempting to sell the riverboat is unable or unwilling to retain ownership or control; or a licensed owner agrees in writing to relinquish control of the riverboat. The IGC has developed a model power of attorney granting the trustee broad and exclusive authority to exercise and perform those acts and powers concerning real and personal property transactions, litigation, insurance, employees and making transactions. The power of attorney, which each licensee is required to execute, also authorizes the trustee, on behalf of the licensee, to commence, manage, and consent to relief in a case involving the licensee under bankruptcy code without the consent of the licensee. A riverboat&#8217;s owner has 180 days after the date that the resolution is adopted to sell the riverboat and its related properties to a suitable owner who is approved by the IGC. If the owner is unable to sell the property within the timeframe, the trustee may take any action necessary to sell the property to a person who meets the requirements for licensure under the Indiana Act. During the time period that the trustee is operating the casino operations, the trustee has exclusive and broad authority over the casino gambling operations. The IGC most recently approved Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC&#8217;s power of attorney renewal on September 17, 2015. 

&#160; 

The IGC has promulgated a rule mandating that licensees maintain a cash reserve. The cash reserve is to be equal to a licensee&#8217;s average payout for a three-day period based on the riverboat&#8217;s performance during the prior calendar quarter. The cash reserve can consist of cash on hand, cash maintained in Indiana bank accounts and cash equivalents not otherwise committed or obligated. The IGC has also promulgated a rule that prohibits distributions, excluding distributions for the payment of state or federal taxes, by a licensee to its partners, shareholders, itself or any affiliated entity if the distribution would impair the financial viability of the riverboat gaming operation. 

&#160; 

The Indiana Act does not limit the maximum bet or loss per patron. Each licensee sets minimum and maximum wagers on its own games. Players must use chips or tokens as, according to the Indiana Act, wagering may not be conducted with money or other negotiable currency. No person under the age of 21 is permitted to wager, and wagers may only be taken from persons present at a licensed riverboat. 

&#160; 

Contracts to which Gaming Entertainment (Indiana) LLC is a party are subject to disclosure and approval processes imposed by Indiana regulations. A riverboat owner licensee may not enter into or perform any contract or transaction in which it transfers or receives consideration which is not commercially reasonable or which does not reflect the fair market value of the goods or services rendered or received. All contracts are subject to disapproval by the IGC. 

Through the establishment of purchasing goals, the IGC encourages minority business enterprises and women business enterprises to participate in the gaming industry. The goals must be derived from the statistical analysis of utilization studies of licensee contracts for goods and services. Failure to meet these goals will be scrutinized heavily by the IGC, and the Indiana Act authorizes the IGC to suspend, limit or revoke an owner&#8217;s gaming license or impose a fine for failure to comply with these guidelines. If a determination is made that a licensee has failed to demonstrate compliance with these guidelines, the licensee has 90 days from the date of the determination to comply. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to a 2013 amendment to the graduated wagering tax law, riverboat licensees that received Adjusted Gross Receipts (&#8220;AGR&#8221;) under $75 million are subject to a graduated wagering tax with a starting tax rate of 5% for the first $25 million of AGR and a top rate of 40% for AGR in excess of $600 million. &#8220;AGR&#8221; is the total of all cash and property received from gaming less cash paid out as winnings and uncollectible gaming receivables (not to exceed 2%). 

&#160; 

The 2013 legislation also permits riverboats and racinos to deduct amounts attributable to qualified wagering incentives from AGR. Qualified wagering incentives refers to wagers made by patrons using non-cash vouchers, coupons, electronic credits or electronic promotions offered by the licensee and are commonly referred to as &#8220;free play&#8221;. For the state fiscal years ending after June 30, 2013, and before July 1, 2016, the maximum amount of permitted deduction is $5 million. 

&#160; 

In addition to the wagering tax, an admissions tax of $3 per admission is assessed. The Indiana Act provides for the suspension or revocation of a license if the wagering and admissions taxes are not timely submitted. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to a development agreement between the Company and the City of Rising Sun, Indiana, we are required to pay annually 1.55% of AGR if $150 million or less, or 1.6% of AGR if greater than $150 million, to the Rising Sun Regional Foundation. 

&#160; 

Real property taxes are imposed on riverboats at rates determined by local taxing authorities. Income to us from Rising Star Casino Resort is also subject to the Indiana adjusted gross income tax and certain court decisions have resulted in gaming taxes not being deductible in the computation of Indiana income taxes. Sales on a riverboat and at its related amenities, other than gaming revenues, are subject to applicable use, excise and retail taxes. The Indiana Act requires a riverboat licensee to directly reimburse the IGC for the costs of gaming enforcement agents which are required to be present while gaming is conducted. 

&#160; 

A licensee may enter into debt transactions of $1 million or greater only with the prior approval of the IGC. Such approval is subject to compliance with requisite procedures and a showing that each person with whom the licensee enters into a debt transaction would be suitable for licensure under the Indiana Act. Unless waived, approval of debt transactions requires consideration by the IGC at two business meetings. The IGC, by resolution, has authorized its executive director, subject to subsequent ratification by the IGC, to approve debt transactions after a review of the transaction documents and consultation with the IGC&#8217;s Chairman and the IGC&#8217;s financial consultant. 

&#160; 

The IGC may subject a licensee to fines, suspension or revocation of its license for any act that is in violation of the Indiana Act or the regulations of the IGC or for any other fraudulent act. In addition, the IGC may revoke an owner&#8217;s license if the IGC determines that the revocation of the license is in the best interests of the State of Indiana. Limitation, conditioning, or suspension of any gaming license or approval or the directive to utilize its power of attorney could (and revocation of any gaming license or approval would) materially adversely affect us, our gaming operations and our results of operations. 

&#160; 

The Indiana Act provides that the sale of alcoholic beverages at riverboat casinos is subject to licensing, control and regulation pursuant to Title 7.1 of the Indiana Code and the rules adopted by the Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission. 

&#160; 

Mississippi Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

In order to acquire, own and operate Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel or any other gaming operation in Mississippi, we are subject to the Mississippi Gaming Control Act (&#8220;Mississippi Act&#8221;) and to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission (&#8220;MGC&#8221;), the Mississippi Department of Revenue and various local, city and county regulatory agencies. 

&#160; 

The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Mississippi gaming authorities are based upon declarations of public policy which are concerned with, among other things: 

&#8226; 

the character of persons having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming to prevent unsavory or unsuitable persons from having a direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; 

&#8226; 

the establishment and application of responsible accounting practices and procedures; 

&#8226; 

maintenance of effective control over the financial practices and financial stability of licensees, including procedures for internal controls and the safeguarding of assets and revenues, including recordkeeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports to the MGC; 

&#8226; 

the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; 

&#8226; 

providing a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees; and 

&#8226; 

ensuring that gaming licensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents. 

The Mississippi Act provides for legalized gaming in each of the 14 counties that border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River; however, gaming is legal only if the voters in the county have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county. Currently, gaming is permissible in nine of the fourteen counties and occurs in all nine counties. Historically, the Mississippi Act required gaming vessels to be located on the Mississippi River or on navigable waterways in eligible counties along the Mississippi River or in waters along the Gulf Coast shore of the eligible counties. However, more recently, the Mississippi Act has been amended to permit licensees in the three counties along the Gulf Coast to establish land-based casino operations. Due to another change to the Mississippi Act, the MGC has also permitted licensees in approved river counties to conduct gaming operations on permanent structures, provided that the majority of any such structure is located on the river side of the &#8220;bank full&#8221; line of the Mississippi River. 

We and any subsidiary we own that operates a casino in Mississippi are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the MGC. As the sole member of Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC, a licensee of the MGC, we applied for registration with the MGC as a publicly traded corporation, which was granted on September 20, 2012. As a registered, publicly-traded corporation, we are required periodically to submit financial and operating reports, and any other information that the MGC may require. If we fail to satisfy the requirements of the Mississippi Act, we and our Mississippi subsidiary, Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC, cannot own or operate gaming facilities in Mississippi. No person may receive any percentage of profits from a Mississippi gaming licensee without first obtaining the necessary licensing and approvals from the MGC. A Mississippi gaming licensee must maintain a gaming license from the MGC, subject to certain conditions, including continued compliance with all applicable state laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

There are no limitations on the number of gaming licenses that may be granted. Further, the Mississippi Act provides for 24-hour gaming operations and does not limit the maximum bet or loss per patron or the percentage of space that may be utilized for gaming. Gaming licenses are issued for a three-year period, are not transferable, and must be renewed periodically thereafter. There is no assurance that a new license can be obtained at the end of each three-year period of a license. Moreover, the MGC may, at any time, and for any cause it deems reasonable, revoke, suspend, condition, limit or restrict a license. Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel was most recently granted a renewal of its license by the MGC on June 18, 2015, effective July 20, 2015 . &#32;The license expires on July 19, 2018. 

&#160; 

If the MGC determines that we violated gaming laws, then the approvals and licenses we hold could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked, and we, our subsidiary, and the individuals involved, could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation of the gaming laws at the discretion of the MGC. Such limitation, conditioning, or suspension of any gaming license or approval could (and revocation of any gaming license or approval would) materially adversely affect us, our gaming operations and our results of operations. 

&#160; 

Certain of our officers, directors and key employees are required to be, and have been, found suitable by the MGC and employees associated with gaming must obtain work permits which are subject to immediate suspension under certain circumstances. The MGC, at its discretion, may require additional persons to file applications for findings of suitability. An application for suitability may be denied for any cause deemed reasonable by the MGC. Changes in specified key positions must 

be reported to the MGC. In addition to its authority to deny an application for a license, the MGC has jurisdiction to disapprove a change in position by an officer, director or key employee. The MGC has the power to require licensed gaming companies to suspend or dismiss officers, directors or other key employees and to sever relationships with other persons who refuse to file appropriate applications or whom the authorities find unsuitable to act in such capacities. Determinations of suitability or questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to judicial review in Mississippi. We believe that we have obtained, applied for or are in the process of applying for all necessary findings of suitability with respect to such persons affiliated with us or Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC, although the MGC, in its discretion, may require additional persons to file applications for findings of suitability. 

&#160; 

The MGC may also require anyone having a material relationship or involvement with us to be found suitable or licensed, in which case those persons are required to pay the costs and fees in connection with the investigation. At any time, the MGC has the power to investigate and require the finding of suitability of any beneficial stockholders of record. The Mississippi Act requires that any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, must report the acquisition to the MGC and such person may be required to be found suitable. Also, any person who becomes a beneficial owner of 10% or more of any class of our voting securities, as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, is required to apply for a finding of suitability by the MGC and must pay the costs and fees that the MGC incurs in conducting its investigation. If a stockholder who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information, including a list of beneficial owners. 

&#160; 

The MGC generally has exercised its discretion to require a finding of suitability of any beneficial owner of 5% of any class of voting securities of a registered corporation. However, under certain circumstances, an &#8220;institutional investor&#8221;, as defined in the Mississippi gaming regulations, which acquires more than 10%, but not more than 15%, of the voting securities of a registered corporation, as reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission, may apply for a waiver of such finding of suitability if such investor holds the securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor will be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes only if the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of our board of directors, any change in our corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations, or any of our gaming affiliates, or any other action which the MGC finds to be inconsistent with holding our voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes include (1) voting on all matters voted on by stockholders; (2) making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in the registered corporation&#8217;s management, policies or operations and (3) such other activities as the MGC may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. 

&#160; 

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the MGC may be found unsuitable based solely on such failure or refusal. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, when requested, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any security holder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the common stock beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the MGC may be guilty of a misdemeanor. We are subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a security holder or to have any other relationship with us, we: 

&#8226; 

pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities; 

&#8226; 

recognize the exercise, directly or indirectly of any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; 

&#8226; 

pay the unsuitable person any remuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in certain limited and specific circumstances; or 

&#8226; 

fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to divest himself of the securities including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of the securities for cash at fair market value. 

The MGC may require us to disclose the identities of the holders of our debt or other securities, and, in its discretion, require such holders to file applications, be investigated and be found suitable to own any debt security of a registered corporation. Although the MGC generally does not require the individual holders of such securities to be investigated and found suitable, it retains the right to do so for any reason deemed necessary by the MGC. The applicant holder of any debt securities is required to pay all costs of such investigation. 

&#160; 

If the MGC determines that a person is unsuitable to own such debt security, we may be sanctioned, including the loss of our approvals, if, without the prior approval of the MGC, we: 

&#8226; 

pay to the unsuitable person any dividends, interest or any distribution whatsoever; 

&#8226; 

recognize any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection with such securities; 

&#8226; 

pay the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or 

&#8226; 

make any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion; exchange, liquidation or similar transaction. 

Each Mississippi gaming subsidiary must maintain in Mississippi a current stock ledger with respect to the ownership of its equity securities. We also must maintain a current list of our shareholders, which must reflect the record ownership of each outstanding share of any class of our equity securities. The ledger and stockholder lists must be available for inspection by the MGC at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the MGC. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. We must also render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner. The Mississippi Act requires that certificates representing securities of a registered corporation bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to the Mississippi Act and the regulations of the MGC. On September 20, 2012, we received a waiver of this legend requirement from the MGC. The MGC has the power to impose additional restrictions on the holders of our securities at any time. 

&#160; 

Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by a registered corporation or a Mississippi gaming subsidiary must be reported to and approved by the MGC. A Mississippi gaming subsidiary may not make a public offering of its securities, but may pledge or mortgage casino facilities. A registered corporation may not make a public offering of its securities without the prior approval of the MGC if any part of the proceeds of the offering is to be used to finance the construction, acquisition, or operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes. Such approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation or approval of the investment merits of the securities subject to the offering. We have received a waiver of the prior approval requirement with respect to public offerings and private placements of securities, subject to certain conditions. 

&#160; 

A Mississippi gaming subsidiary may not guarantee a security issued by an affiliated company pursuant to a public offering, or pledge its assets to secure payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by a security issued by an affiliated company, without the prior approval of the MGC. A pledge of the stock of a Mississippi gaming subsidiary and the foreclosure of such a pledge are ineffective without the prior approval of the MGC. We have obtained approvals from the MGC for such guarantees, pledges and restrictions in connection with offerings of securities, subject to certain restrictions. 

Also, changes in control through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover cannot occur without prior investigation and approval by the MGC. 

&#160; 

The Mississippi legislature has declared that some repurchases of voting securities, corporate acquisitions opposed by management, and corporate defense tactics affecting Mississippi gaming licensees and registered corporations that are affiliated with those operations, may be harmful to stable and productive corporate gaming. The MGC has established a regulatory scheme to reduce the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Mississippi&#8217;s gaming industry and to further Mississippi&#8217;s policy to: 

&#8226; 

assure the financial stability of corporate gaming licensees and their affiliates; 

&#8226; 

preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and 

&#8226; 

promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs. 

Because we are a registered corporation, approvals may be required from the MGC before we can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above their current market price and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated. Mississippi gaming regulations also require prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a registered corporation&#8217;s board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to its stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of the registered corporation. 

&#160; 

Neither we nor Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC may engage in gaming activities in Mississippi while also conducting operations outside of Mississippi without approval of, or a waiver of such approval by, the MGC. The MGC may require determinations that there are means for the MGC to have access to information concerning us and our affiliates&#8217; out-of-state gaming operations. We have approval from the MGC for foreign gaming operations in that such approval for foreign gaming operations is automatically granted under the Mississippi regulations in connection with foreign operations (except for internet gaming activities) conducted within the 50 states or any territory of the United States, or on board any cruise ship embarking from a port located therein. The MGC requires a formal foreign gaming waiver for involvement in internet gaming. 

&#160; 

License, fees and taxes are payable to the State of Mississippi, the MGC, and the county and city in which our Mississippi subsidiary, Silver Slipper Casino Venture LLC&#8217;s gaming operations are conducted. Depending on the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly or annually. Gaming fees and tax calculations are generally based upon (1) a percentage of the gross gaming revenues received by the subsidiary operation; (2) the number of gaming devices operated by the casino; or (3) the number of table games operated by the casino. The license fee payable to the State of Mississippi is based 

upon gross revenue (generally defined as gaming receipts less payout to customers as winnings) and equals 4% of gross revenue of $50,000 or less per calendar month, 6% of gross revenue in excess of $50,000 but less than $134,000 per calendar month, and 8% of gross revenue in excess of $134,000 per calendar month. The Gaming Commission imposes a flat annual fee on each casino operator licensee, covering all investigative fees for that year associated with an operator licensee, any entity registered as a holding company or publicly traded corporation of that licensee, and any person required to be found suitable in connection with that licensee or any holding company or publicly-traded corporation of that licensee. The annual fee is based on the average number of gaming devices operated by the licensee during a twelve-month period, as reported to the MGC. The investigative fee is $325,000 for licensees with 1,500 or more gaming devices, $250,000 for licensees with 1,000 to 1,499 gaming devices, and $150,000 for licensees with less than 1,000 gaming devices. The fee is payable in four equal quarterly installments. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, the Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel operated an average of 955 gaming devices. 

&#160; 

The sale of alcoholic beverages at our Mississippi gaming operation is subject to the licensing, control and regulation by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Mississippi Department of Revenue as well as local ordinances. If alcohol regulations are violated, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division may limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license for the serving of alcoholic beverages or place such licensee on probation with or without conditions. 

&#160; 

In November 2004, Silver Slipper Casino Venture, LLC entered into a thirty-year public trust tidelands lease agreement with the State of Mississippi for certain marsh lands. Prior to Hurricane Katrina, all Gulf Coast casinos had similar tidelands leases with the State of Mississippi, generally for the lease of water bottoms under each casino when the casinos were required to be floating. Subsequent to Hurricane Katrina, the law changed to allow casinos to be built on land no further than 800 feet from the approved gaming site. Therefore, the tidelands lease expired and the Gulf Coast casinos hold &#8220;In Lieu&#8221; agreements with the State of Mississippi. The &#8220;In Lieu&#8221; agreements are in the form of a property tax assessment with the State of Mississippi, and the properties are taxed similarly to their tidelands leases as long as they occupy the land and continue gaming operations. Payments under our &#8220;In Lieu&#8221; agreement are currently approximately $473,000 per year and are subject to annual review and adjustment including consumer price index factors. 

Colorado Regulatory Matters 

On February 18, 2016, the Colorado Limited Gaming Control Commission approved us for the necessary licenses required for our pending acquisition of Bronco Billy's. We expect to complete our refinancing and close on the pending acquisition in the second quarter of 2016, subject to obtaining the remaining required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Assuming the transaction closes as expected, in future years we will provide a summary of relevant Colorado regulatory matters. 

Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws 

&#160; 

Indiana riverboat casinos are subject to regulation by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (&#8220;IDEM&#8221;). That department has regulations similar to the federal Department of Environmental Protection and maintains enforcement programs in the areas of air pollution, water and wastewater pollution and hazardous waste handling. Operating a riverboat and a golf club, we are subject to the regulation of the IDEM in our operations. The IDEM has reporting requirements and can impose fines and other penalties for violations of its regulations. While there can be criminal sanctions for serious and intentional violations of the regulations, the general penalty is a fine of up to $30,000 for each day of a violation and injunctions against continued violations and corrective orders. Rising Star Casino Resort has not been the subject of any fine or other enforcement proceeding by the IDEM. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The gaming industry is highly competitive. Gaming activities include traditional land-based casinos, riverboat and dockside gaming, casino gaming on tribal land, state-sponsored lotteries, video poker in restaurants, bars and hotels, pari-mutuel betting on horse racing, dog racing and jai alai, sports bookmaking, card rooms, and casinos at racetracks. Furthermore, competition from internet lotteries, sweepstakes, and other internet wagering gaming services, which allow their customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play Las Vegas-style casino games from home or in non-casino settings, could divert customers from our properties and thus adversely affect our business. Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel, Rising Star Casino Resort, Stockman&#8217;s Casino and Grand Lodge Casino, as well as other casinos that we may develop or acquire, compete with all these forms of gaming. We also will compete with any new forms or jurisdictions of gaming that may be legalized, as well as with other types of entertainment. Some of our competitors have more personnel and greater financial or other resources than we do. The principal methods of competition are: location, with casinos located closer to their feeder markets at an advantage; product quality, both in terms of the quality of the facilities and customer service; breadth of offerings, including the selection of casino games and other non-gaming amenities (such as a hotel) offered at the facility; and marketing, often the amount and frequency of promotions offered to guests. 

&#160; &#160; 

Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel 

&#160; 

Silver Slipper Casino &#38; Hotel is the western-most casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. It is the closest casino to most of St. Tammany Parish, one of the most affluent and fast-growing parishes in Louisiana. Louisiana law permits fifteen riverboat casinos, one land-based casino, four casinos at racetracks, and in certain areas, a limited number of slot machines at qualifying truck stops. The legislation permitting riverboat and truck stop casinos requires a local referendum and, at the time such legislation occurred, the legalization was rejected by St. Tammany Parish voters. At this time, all licenses for riverboat casinos in Louisiana have been granted and are in operation. Mississippi, which has lower gaming tax rates than Louisiana, does not have a limitation on the number of casino licenses, but requires casinos in certain southern counties to be within 800 feet of the shoreline. 

Silver Slipper competes with larger casinos located nearby in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. It also competes with casinos in Gulfport and Biloxi, Mississippi and with casinos in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Gulfport and Biloxi are 45 minutes and one hour east, respectively, of the Silver Slipper along Interstate 10. New Orleans and Baton Rouge are one and two hours, respectively, west of Silver Slipper. 

Rising Star Casino Resort 

&#160; 

The Rising Star Casino Resort in Rising Sun, Indiana is one of three riverboat casinos located on the Ohio River in southeastern Indiana, approximately one hour from Cincinnati, Ohio and within two hours of Indianapolis, Indiana and Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky. Its closest competitors are each approximately 15 miles away near bridges crossing the Ohio River. Rising Star also competes with casinos in Ohio, including Belterra Park, which opened in downtown Cincinnati in 2014, a casino-resort in French Lick, Indiana, and two racetrack casinos near Indianapolis, Indiana. 

A Kentucky Supreme Court decision in 2014 may permit a horse racing track in northern Kentucky to install slot machine-like devices. The Indiana legislature also passed legislation in 2015 to allow table games at racetracks (which are now limited to slot machines) beginning in 2020. We recently acquired land in Kentucky and are seeking permission to operate a car ferry service so customers residing in Kentucky do not have to travel additional distance and pass other casinos en route to Rising Star.

Stockman&#8217;s Casino 

&#160; 

Stockman&#8217;s Casino is located in Fallon, Nevada on Highway 50, approximately 60 miles east of Reno, Nevada, and is the largest of several casinos in Churchill County. The county&#8217;s population is approximately 25,000. A nearby source of additional customers is Naval Air Station Fallon, the United States Navy's premier air-to-air and air-to-ground training facility and home of the "Top Gun" school. While we are not aware of any significant planned expansion to gaming capacity in the Churchill County area, additional competition may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, if the naval air base closed, it would likely have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. However, the base is currently in the midst of a significant expansion.

Grand Lodge Casino 

&#160; 

Grand Lodge Casino is one of four casinos located within a five-mile radius in the North Lake Tahoe area. A fifth casino is scheduled to re-open during 2016, although such opening date has been postponed several times. 

&#160; 

Grand Lodge Casino also competes with casinos in nearby South Lake Tahoe and Reno. There are also numerous Native American casinos in California serving the Northern California market. 

Marketing 

&#160; 

Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our customer loyalty programs and specialized marketing campaigns, such as our seasonal "Christmas Casino" event at the Rising Star Casino Resort. We advertise through various channels, including radio, television, internet, billboards, newspapers and magazines, direct mail, email and social media. We also maintain websites to inform customers about our properties and utilize social media sites to promote our brands, unique events, and special deals. Our customer loyalty programs include the Silver Slipper Casino Players Club, the Rising Star Rewards Club&#8482;, the Grand Lodge Players Advantage Club&#174; and the Stockman&#8217;s Winner&#8217;s Club. Under these programs, customers earn points based on their volume of wagering that may be redeemed for various benefits, such as free play, cash back, complimentary dining, or hotel stays. 

Our properties do not have coordinated loyalty programs. We do not currently believe that it would be economically advantageous given the disparate locations of our properties. Instead, our loyalty programs focus on providing each casino's customers the amenities they most prefer.
