 Item 1. Business . 

(a) General Development of Business 

During May 2014, the board of directors of Liberty Media Corporation and its subsidiaries ( &#8220; Liberty &#8221; ) authorized management to pursue a plan to spin - off to its stockholders common stock of a wholly - owned subsidiary, Liberty Broadband Corporation ( &#8220; Liberty Broadband &#8221; ), and to distribute subscription rights to acquire shares of Liberty Broadband &#8217; s common stock (the &#8220; Broadband Spin - Off &#8221; ). At 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on November 4, 2014 the Broadband Spin-Off was completed and shares of Liberty Broadband common stock were distributed to the shareholders of Liberty as of a record date of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 29, 2014. Liberty Broadband is comprised of, among other things, (i) Liberty&#8217;s former interest in Charter Communications, Inc. (&#8220;Charter&#8221;), (ii) Liberty&#8217;s former wholly-owned subsidiary TruePosition, Inc. (&#8220;TruePosition&#8221;), (iii) Liberty&#8217;s former minority equity investment in Time Warner Cable, Inc. (&#8220;Time Warner Cable &#8221; or &#8220;TWC&#8221; ), (iv) certain deferred tax liabilities, as well as liabilities related to the Time Warner Cable written call option s and (v) initial indebtedness, pursuant to margin loans entered into prior to the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off. The Broadband Spin-Off was accounted for at historical cost due to the pro rata nature of the distribution to holders of Liberty common stock. 

In the Broadband Spin-Off, record holders of Liberty Series A, Series B and Series C common stock receive d one-fourth of a share of the corresponding series of Liberty Broadband common stock for each share of Liberty common stock held by them as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 29, 2014 ( the record date ) for the Broadband Spin-Off, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. &#160; In addition, following the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off, on December 10, 2014, stockholders received a subscription right to acquire one share of Series C Liberty Broadband common stock for every five shares of Liberty Broadband common stock they held as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time on December 4, 2014 (the rights record date) at a per share subscription price of $40.36, which was a 20% discount to the 20-trading day volume weighted average trading price of the Series C Liberty Broadband common stock following the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off. The rights offering was fully subscribed on January 9, 2015, with 17,277,224 shares of Series C common stock issued to those rightsholders exercising basic and, as applicable, oversubscription privileges. The subscription rights were issued to raise capital for general corporate purposes of Liberty Broadband. The Broadband Spin-Off and rights offering were &#160; intended to be tax-free to stockholders of Liberty and Liberty Broadband, respectively . &#160; During September 2015, Liberty entered into a closing agreement with the IRS which provided that the Broadband Spin-Off qualified for tax-free treatment. 

Spin - Off of Liberty Broadband from Liberty Media Corporation 

Following the Broadband Spin - Off, Liberty and Liberty Broadband operate as separate, publicly traded companies, and neither has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. In connection with the Broadband Spin - Off, Liberty and Liberty Broadband enter ed into certain agreements in order to govern certain of the ongoing relationships between the two companies after the Broadband Spin - Off and to provide for an orderly transition. These agreements include a reorganization agreement, a services agreement, a facilities sharing agreement and a tax sharing agreement. 

The reorganization agreement provide s for, among other things, the principal corporate transactions (including the internal restructuring) required to effect the Broadband Spin - Off, certain conditions to the Broadband Spin - Off and provisions governing the relationship between Liberty Broadband and Liberty with respect to and resulting from the Broadband Spin -Off. The tax sharing agreement provide s for the allocation and indemnification of tax liabilities and benefits between Liberty and Liberty Broadband and other agreements related to tax matters. Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement, Liberty Broadband has agreed to indemnify Liberty, subject to certain limited exceptions, for losses and taxes resulting from the Broadband Spin-Off to the extent such losses or taxes result primarily from, individually or in the aggregate, the breach of certain restrictive covenants made by Liberty Broadband (applicable to actions or failures to act by Liberty Broadband and its subsidiaries following the completion of the Broadband Spin-Off). Pursuant to the services agreement, Liberty provide s Liberty Broadband with general and administrative services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury and investor relations support. Under the facilities sharing ag reement, Liberty Broadband share s office space with Liberty and related amenities at Liberty &#8217; s corporate headquarters. Liberty Broadband will reimburse Liberty for direct, out - of - pocket expenses incurred by Liberty in providing these services and for costs that will be negotiated semi - annually.

(c) Narrative Description of Business 

Charter Communications, Inc. 

Introduction 

Charter is among the largest providers of cable services in the United States, offering a variety of entertainment, information and communications solutions to residential and commercial customers. Charter &#8217; s infrastructure consists of a hybrid of fiber and coaxial cable plant with approximately 12. 8 million estimated passings, wi th 98 % at 550 MHz or greater, 9 9 % of plant miles two - way active and 99% of plant all-digital . A national Internet Protocol &#160; &#8220; IP &#8221; infrastructure interconnects Charter &#8217; s markets. Charter was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1999. 

As of December 31 , 2015 , Charter served approximately 6.7 million residential and small and medium business customers. Charter sells its video, Internet and voice services primarily on a subscription basis, often in a bundle of two or more services, providing savings and convenience to its cu stomers. As of December 31, 2015 bundled services are available to approximately 98% of Charter &#8217; s passings, and approximately 61 % of Charter &#8217; s customers subscribe to a bundle of services. 

Charter served approx imately 4. 3 &#160; million residential video customers as of December 31, 2015 . Charter completed its all-digital rollout in 2014 and substantially all of its markets now offer over 200 HD channels and faster Internet speeds. Charter launched its Charter Spectrum&#174; brand in its all-digital markets. Digital video enables Charter &#8217; s customers to access advanced video se rvices such as high definition ( &#8220; HD&#8221; ) television, video on demand programming, an interactive program guide and digital video recorder &#8220; DVR&#8221; service. 

Charter also served approximately 5.2 million residential Internet customers as of December 31 , 2015 . Its Internet service is available in a variety of download speeds up to 100 megabits per second ( &#8220; Mbps&#8221; ) , and up to 120 Mbps in certain markets, and upload speeds of up to 5 Mbps. As of December 31 , 201 5 , approximately &#160; 89 % of Charter &#8217; s Internet customers have at least 6 0 Mbps download speed. 

Charter provided voice service to approximately 2.6 million residential customers as of December 31 , 2015 . Its voice services typically include unlimited local and long distance calling to the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, plus other features, including voicemail, call waiting and caller ID. 

Through Spectrum Business &#174; , Charter provides scalable, tailored broadband communications solutions to business and carrier organizations, such as video entertainment services, Internet access, business telephone services, data networking and fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings. As of December 31 , 2015 , Charter served approximately 671 ,000 &#160; small and medium business primary service units (&#8220;PSUs&#8221;) and 30,000 enterprise PSUs . Charter &#8217; s advertising sales division, Spectrum Reach &#174; , provides local, regional and national businesses with the opportunity to advertise in individual markets on cable television networks. 

For the year ended December 31, 201 5 , Charter generated approximately $9.8 billion in revenue, of which approximately 83% was generated from Charter &#8217; s residential video, Internet and voice services. Charter also generated revenue from providing video, Internet, voice and fiber connectivity services to commercial businesses and from the sale of advertising. Sales from res idential Internet and triple play customers (customers receiving all three service offerings, video, internet and voice) and from commercial services have contributed to the majority of Charter &#8217; s recent revenue growth. 

Charter has a history of net losses. Charter &#8217; s net losses are principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expenses, interest expenses that Charter incurs on its debt, depreciation expenses resulting from the capita l investments Charter has made, and continues to make, in its cable properties, amortization expenses related to its customer relationship intangibles and non - cash taxes resulting from increases i n its deferred tax liabilities.

Time Warner Cable Merger 

On May 23, 2015, Charter entered into an Agreement and Plan of Mergers (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Time Warner Cable Inc. ("TWC"), CCH I, LLC (&#8220;New Charter&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Charter; Nina Corporation I, Inc., Nina Company II, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of New Charter; and Nina Company III, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of New Charter, pursuant to which the parties will engage in a series of transactions that will result in Charter and TWC becoming wholly owned subsidiaries of New Charter (the &#8220; Time Warner Cable Merger &#8221;), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. After giving effect to the Time Warner Cable Merger , New Charter will be the new public company parent that will hold the operations of the combined companies. Upon consummation of the Time Warner Cable Merger , each outstanding share of TWC common stock (other than TWC stock held by Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive Corporation ( &#8220;Liberty Interactive&#8221; and together with Liberty Broadband, the "Liberty Parties")), will be converted into the right to receive $100 in cash and shares of New Charter Class A common stock ("New Charter common stock") equivalent to 0.5409 shares of Charter Class A common stock. Each stockholder of TWC will also have the option to elect to receive for each outstanding share of TWC common stock (other than TWC stock held by the Liberty Parties) $115 in cash and shares of New Charter common stock equivalent to 0.4562 shares of Charter common stock. Upon consummation of the Time Warner Cable Merger , each share of TWC common stock held by the Liberty Parties will be converted into New Charter common stock. The total enterprise value of TWC based on the estimated value of purchase price consideration is approximately $79 billion, including cash, equity and TWC debt to be assumed. The value of the consideration will fluctuate based on the number of shares outstanding and the market value of Charter's Class A common stock on the acquisition date, among other factors. In certain circumstances a termination fee may be payable by either Charter or TWC upon termination of the Time Warner Cable Merger as more fully described in the Merger Agreement. 

Bright House Transaction 

On March 31, 2015, Charter entered into a definitive Contribution Agreement (the &#8220;Contribution Agreement&#8221;), which was amended on May 23, 2015 in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, with Advance/Newhouse Partnership (&#8220;A/N&#8221;), A/NPC Holdings LLC, New Charter and Charter Communications Holdings, LLC (&#8220;Charter Holdings&#8221;), our wholly owned subsidiary, pursuant to which Charter would become the owner of the membership interests in Bright House Networks, LLC (&#8220;Bright House&#8221;) and any other assets (other than certain excluded assets and liabilities and non-operating cash) primarily related to Bright House (the &#8220;Bright House Transaction&#8221;). At closing, Charter Holdings will pay to A/N approximately $2 billion in cash and issue to A/N convertible preferred units of Charter Holdings with a face amount of $2.5 billion which will pay a 6% coupon, and approximately 34.3 million common units of Charter Holdings that are exchangeable into New Charter common stock on a one-for-one basis with a value of approximately $6 billion. 

Liberty Broadband Transaction s and Debt Financing for the Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction 

Assuming that all TWC stockholders (excluding the Liberty Parties) elect the $100 per share cash option, the cash portion of the consideration for the Time Warner Cable Merger is expected to be approximately $28 billion and the cash portion of the Bright House Transaction is approximately $2 billion. In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger , Charter and Liberty Broadband entered into an investment agreement, pursuant to which Liberty Broadband agreed to invest $4.3 billion in New Charter at the closing of the Time Warner Cable Merger to partially finance the cash portion of the Time Warner Cable Merger consideration. In connection with the Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband agreed to purchase at the closing of the Bright House Transaction $700 million of New Charter Class A common stock (or, if the TWC Transaction is not consummated prior to the completion of the Bright House Transaction, Charter Class A common stock). 

In connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger, Liberty Broadband has also entered into an agreement with Charter pursuant to which it has agreed to vote all of its shares of Charter&#8217;s Class A common stock in favor of the Time Warner Cable Merger, the issuance of the Charter Shares and any related proposals. Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive have also entered into an agreement with Charter which provides that Liberty Broadband and Liberty Interactive will exchange, in a tax-free transaction, the shares of Time Warner Cable common stock held by each company for shares of New Charter Class A common stock (subject to certain limitations). In addition, Liberty Interactive has also agreed to grant Liberty Broadband a proxy over the shares of New Charter it receives in the exchange, along with a right of first refusal with respect to the underlying New Charter shares.

&#160;

In connection with the Bright House Transaction, Liberty Broadband agreed to purchase at the closing of the Bright House Transaction $700 million of New Charter Class A common stock (or, if the Time Warner Cable Merger is not consummated prior to the completion of the Bright House Transaction, Charter Class A common stock). Liberty Broadband intends to fund its commitment to purchase up to $700 million in shares of New Charter at a per share price of $173.00 (as adjusted) in connection with the Bright House acquisition through cash on hand or other financing. As previously announced, A/N and Liberty Broadband will enter into a proxy agreement, pursuant to which A/N will grant Liberty Broadband a five-year proxy to vote shares of New Charter held by A/N, capped at 7% of New Charter&#8217;s outstanding shares. Liberty Broadband is expected to control approximately 25.01% of the aggregate voting power of New Charter following the completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger and the Bright House Transaction and is expected to be New Charter&#8217;s largest stockholder. 

Charter expects to finance the remaining cash portion of the purchase price of the Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction with additional indebtedness and cash on the companies&#8217; balance sheets. In 2015, Charter issued $15.5 billion CCO Safari II, LLC ("CCO Safari II") senior secured notes, $3.8 billion CCO Safari III, LLC ("CCO Safari III") senior secured bank loans and $2.5 billion CCOH Safari, LLC ("CCOH Safari") senior unsecured notes. Charter has remaining commitments of approximately $2.7 billion from banks to provide incremental senior secured term loan facilities and senior unsecured notes, as well as an incremental $1.7 billion revolving facility. In addition, the bank commitments provide for a $4.3 billion bridge facility if all TWC stockholders (other than the Liberty Parties) elect the $115 per share cash option, in the event Charter is unable to issue senior unsecured notes in advance of the closing of the Time Warner Cable Merger . 

Transaction-Related Commitments 

Charter has agreed to certain commitments that will be effective upon the consummation of the TWC Transaction and Bright House Transaction, including commitments in connection with the approval of the TWC Transaction and Bright House Transaction by the State of New York and commitments made to certain leading civil rights/leadership organizations. The commitments to the State of New York include commitments regarding low-income broadband offerings, maintaining existing TWC low price service offerings for a period of time after closing, building out Charter&#8217;s networks to currently unserved areas in New Charter&#8217;s footprint, enhancing broadband speeds, maintaining certain New York customer facing jobs, and investing in and enhancing customer service. The commitments to the civil rights/leadership organizations include building upon existing diversity efforts in the area of corporate governance, commitments related to employment and workforce recruitment, procurement, programming, and philanthropy and community investment, appointing one African American, one Asian American/Pacific Islander and one Latino American to Charter&#8217;s Board of Directors within two years of the close of the transaction, appointing a Chief Diversity Officer, hiring at least 10,000 new employees from the diverse communities in which New Charter will operate, working with minority-serving organizations to significantly increase spending with minority-owned business enterprises and identifying opportunities to work with minority-owned professional business, and various commitments to expand carriage and extend programming agreements on African American, Asian American and Latino programming. Charter may enter into additional commitments in connection with the Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction. 

Stockholder Approval 

The Time Warner Cable Merger was approved by stockholders of both Charter and Time Warner Cable during September 2015 and is subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions to closing. The Bright House Transaction is subject to several conditions, including the completion of the Time Warner Cable Merger (subject to certain exceptions if Time Warner Cable enters into another sale transaction) and regulatory approval. 

Regulatory Approval Process 

Charter has made all of the necessary filings of applications for the Time Warner Cable Merger &#160; and the Bright House Transaction. The FCC comment cycle closed mid-November, and Charter is working closely with the FCC and the Department of Justice to make sure they have all the information they need to evaluate the merits of the transactions. The FCC&#8217;s informal 180-day clock for approval will run to March 25, 2016 although the FCC could stop and restart the clock later if they determined to do so. Charter has received approval or authorization from all necessary state authorities except California, Hawaii and New Jersey with California currently having a schedule indicating an order being issued in June 2016. Charter has filed a motion in California seeking to expedite the timing of the California proceeding although Charter cannot predict the outcome of its efforts to seek an earlier decision. Charter has obtained approvals exceeding the threshold closing condition for franchise authorities approving the transactions. Charter has raised or received commitments for all of th e acquisition financing, and Charter will be 

I- 6 

&#160;

operationally ready to close upon obtaining regulatory approvals. Charter expect s the closing to occur in the second quarter of 2016 subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. 

Comcast Transactions 

On April 25, 2014, Charter entered into a binding definitive agreement (the &#8220;Comcast Transactions Agreement&#8221;) with Comcast Corporation (&#8220;Comcast&#8221;), which contemplated the following transactions: (1) an asset purchase, (2) an asset exchange and (3) a contribution and spin-off transaction (collectively, the &#8220;Comcast Transactions&#8221;). Pursuant to the terms of the Comcast Transactions Agreement, Comcast had the right to terminate the Comcast Transactions Agreement upon termination of the merger agreement among Comcast, TWC and Tango Acquisition Sub, Inc. (the &#8220;Comcast Merger Agreement&#8221;). On April 24, 2015, Comcast and TWC terminated the Comcast Merger Agreement, and Comcast delivered a notice of termination of the Comcast Transactions Agreement to Charter (the &#8220;Termination Notice&#8221;). As a result of the termination, proceeds from the issuance of $3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of CCOH Safari notes and $3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of CCO Safari, LLC ("CCO Safari") Term G Loans ("Term G Loans"), which were held in escrow and intended to fund the closing of the Comcast Transactions, were utilized to settle the related debt obligation in April 2015.

In certain markets, Charter has launched Spectrum Guide&#174;, a network or &#8220;cloud&#8221; based user interface with a similar look and feel of the Spectrum TV App. Spectrum Guide&#174; is designed to enable Charter&#8217;s customers to enjoy a common user interface with a state-of-the-art video experience on all of its existing and future set-top boxes. Spectrum Guide&#174; was initially introduced in 2014 and Charter plans to continue to deploy and enhance this technology in 2016. 

Internet Services 

In 201 5 , residential Internet services represented approximately 31 % of Charter&#8217;s total revenue . Approximately 96 % of Charter&#8217;s estimated passings have available DOCSIS 3.0 wideband technology, allowing Charter to offer its residential customers multiple tiers of Internet services with download speeds of up to 100 Mbps , and up to 120 Mbps in certain markets . Since going all-digital, Charter&#8217;s base Internet download speed offering is 60 Mbps, and 100 Mbps in certain markets. Charter&#8217;s Internet portal, Charter.net , &#160; provides multiple e - mail addresses . Finally, Charter Security Suite is included with Charter &#8217;s Internet services and , upon installation by customers, provides protection from computer viruses and spyware and provides parental control features. 

Accelerated growth in the number of IP devices and bandwidth used in homes has created a need for faster speeds and greater reliability. Charter is focused on providing services to fill those needs. Charter offers an in-home WiFi product permitting customers to lease a high performing wireless router to maximize their wireless Internet experience. In 2015, in anticipation of new geographies and offered commitments in the Time Warner Cable Merger and Bright House Transaction, Charter launched an out-of-home WiFi service (&#8220;Spectrum WiFi&#8221;) in four market areas permitting Internet customers to access the Internet at designated "hot spots" within a particular market. This service is available at no charge to Charter&#8217;s Internet customers. 

Voice Services 

In 2015 , residential voice services represented approximately 6% &#160; of Charter &#8217; s total revenue . Charter provides voice c ommunications services using VoIP technology to transmit digital voice signals over its network. Ch arter &#8217;s v oice service includes unlimited local and long distance calling to the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico , voicemail, call waiting, caller ID, call forwarding and other features and offers international calling either by the minute or through packages of minutes per month. For Charter v oice and video customers, caller ID on TV is also available in most areas . 

Commercial Services 

In 2015 , commercial services represented approximately 12 % of Charter &#8217; s total revenue . Commercial services offered through Spectrum Business include scalable broadband communications solutions for businesses and carrier organizations of all sizes such as Internet access, data networking, fiber connectivity to cellular towers and office buildings, video entertainment services and business telephone services. 

I- 8 

&#160;

&#183; 

Small and Medium Business. Charter offers basic coax service primarily to small (1 - 19 employees) and medium (20-199) employees businesses similar to its residential offerings . &#160; Spectrum Business includes a full range of video programming tiers and music services, coax Internet speeds of up to 100 Mbps downstream , 200 Mbps in certain markets, and up to 7 Mbps ups tream in its DOCSIS 3.0 markets. Spectrum Business also includes a set of business cloud services including web hosting, e-mail and security, and multi-line telephone services with more than 30 business features including web-based service management. 

&#183; 

Enterprise Solutions. Charter offers fiber or complex services to medium and large (200+ employees) businesses including fiber Internet with symmetrical speeds of up to 10 Gbps and voice trunking services such as Primary Rate Interface (&#8220;PRI&#8221;) and Session Initiation Protocol (&#8220;SIP&#8221;) Trunks which provide higher-capacity voice services. Charter also offers Metro Ethernet service that connects two or more locations for commercial customers with geographically dispersed locations with services up to 10 Gbps. Metro Ethernet service can also extend the reach of the customer's local area network (&#8220;LAN&#8221;) within and between metropolitan areas. In addition to the above, Charter offers large businesses with multiple sites more specialized solutions such as custom fiber networks and Metro and long haul Ethernet. Charter also offers high-capacity last-mile data connectivity services to wireless and wireline carriers, Internet Service Providers (&#8220;ISPs&#8221;) and other competitive carriers on a wholesale basis. 

Advertising Services 

In 2015 , sales of advertising represented approximately 3 % of Charter &#8217; s total revenue . &#160; Charter&#8217;s advertising sales division, Spectrum Reach&#174;, provides local, regional and national business with the opportunity to advertise in individual markets on cable television networks. Charter receives revenue from the sale of local advertising on digital advertising networks and satellite - delivered networks such as MTV &#174; , CNN &#174; and ESPN &#174; . In any particular market, Charter generally in serts local advertising on over 50 channels. In most cases, the available advertising time is sold by Charter &#8217; s sa les force, however in some markets , Charter enters into representation agreements with contiguous cable system operators under which another operator in the area will sell advertising on its behalf for a percentage of the revenue. In some markets, Charter sells advertising on behalf of other operators. 

Charter has deployed Enhanced TV Binary Interchange Format ( &#8220; EBIF&#8221; ) technology to set - top boxes in most service areas within the Charter footprint. EBIF is a technology foundation that will allow Charter to deliver enhanced and interactive television applications for advertising . From time to time, certain of Charter&#8217;s vendors, including programmers and equipment vendors, have purchased advertising from Charter. 

Pricing of Charter &#8217; s Products and Services 

Charter &#8217; s revenue is derived principally from the monthly fees customers pay for the services it provides. Charter typically charges a one - time installation fee which is sometimes waived or discounted during certain promotional periods. The prices Charter charges for its products and services vary based on the level of service the customer chooses and in some cases the geographic market. In accordance with FCC rules, the prices Charter charges for video cable - related equipment, such as set - top boxes and remote control devices, and for installation services, are based on actual costs plus a permitted rate of return in regulated markets. 

Charter &#8217;s prici ng and packaging approach emphasizes the triple play products of video, Internet and voice services and combines Charter &#8217; s most popular and competitive services in core packages at what Charter believes is a fair price. 

Charter&#8217;s Network Technology and Customer Premise Equipment 

Charter &#8217; s network includes three components: the national backbone, regional/metro networks and the &#8220; last - mile &#8221; network. Both Charter &#8217; s national backbone and regional/metro network components utilize or plan to utilize a redundant IP ring/mesh architecture. The national backbone provides connectivity from the regional demarcation points to nationally centralized content, connectivity and services. The regional/metro network components provide connectivity between the regional demarcation points and headends within a specific geographic area and enable the delivery of content and services between these network components. 

I- 9 

&#160;

Charter &#8217; s last -mile network utilizes a hybrid fiber coaxial cable ( &#8220; HFC&#8221; ) architecture, which combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable. In most systems, Charter delivers its signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a group of nodes, and uses coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes served by that node. For Charter &#8217; s fiber Internet, Ethernet, carrier wholesale, SIP and PRI commercial customers, fiber optic cable is extended from the individual nodes all the way to the customer &#8217; s site. Charter &#8217;s design standard is six strands of fiber to each node, with two strands activated and four strands reserved for spares and future services. This design standard allows these strands to be utilized for additional residential traffic capacity, and enterprise customer needs as they arise. Charter believes that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and signal quality. The design also provides two - way signal capabilities for the support of interactive services. 

HFC architecture benefits include: 

&#183; 

bandwidth capacity to enable traditional and two - way video and broadband services; 

&#183; 

dedicated bandwidth for two -way services ; and 

&#183; 

signal quality and high service reliability. 

Approximately 98 % of Charter &#8217; s estimated passings are served by systems that have bandwidth of 550 megahertz or greater and 99 % are two - way activated as of December 31, 201 5 . This bandwidth capacity enables Charter to offer digital television, Internet services, voice services and other advanced video services. 

In 201 4 , Charter completed its transition from analog to digital transmission of the channels it distributes which allows Charter to recapture bandwidth. The all - digital platform enables Charter to offer a larger selection of HD channels, faster Internet speeds and better picture quality while providing greater plant securi ty and lower transaction costs. 

For set-top boxes, Charter is implementing a video conditional access strategy utilizing its downloadable security on a set-top box specified by Charter which can be manufactured by many different manufacturers. As Charter rolls out downloadable security, it will utilize the Worldbox, and Charter is introducing Spectrum Guide &#174; in parallel to all box types with cable card and downloadable security . Worldbox, by utilizing downloadable security along with the introduction of Spectrum Guide &#174; , has reduced Charter&#8217;s incremental set-top box costs and allows for a consistent service for all of its customers and on all of their televisions with a service that is rich in HD, has modern search and discovery features and is capable of improved implementation of future enhancements. 

Management, Customer Care and Marketing 

Charter &#8217; s operations are centralized with its corporate office responsible for coordinating and overseeing operations including establishing company-wide strategies, policies and procedures. Sales and marketing, network operations, field operations, customer care, engineering, advertising sales, human resources, legal, government relations, information technology and finance are all directed at the corporate level. Regional and local field operations are responsible for servicing customers and maintenance and construction of outside plants. 

Charter continues to focus on improving the customer experience through enhanced product offerings, reliability of services, and quality of customer care . Charter has in-house domestic call centers that handle over 85% of its calls. The centers are managed centrally to ensure a consistent and satisfying customer experience. Charter also provides customers with the opportunity to interact with us through a variety of forums in addition to traditional telephonic communications, including on-line and chat. Charter utilizes its web portals to enable customers to order and upgrade services, manage their accounts, and leverage tools for self-care. Charter&#8217;s services include a new and improved Internet portal, Charter.net, making it easier for customers to manage their account, seek self-help and watch TV online. 

Charter &#8217; s marketing strategy emphasizes its bundled services through targeted direct response marketing programs to existing and potential customers and increases awareness and value of the Charter brand. In 2014, Charter rolled out Charter Spectrum&#174;, Charter&#8217;s new, national brand platform. Charter Spectrum&#174; represents Charter&#8217;s combined video, Internet and voice offering for residential customers. This new brand reflects Charter&#8217;s comprehensive approach to industry-leading products, driven by speed, performance and innovation. Charter&#8217;s marketing organization creates and executes marketing programs intended to increase customers, retain existing customers and cross-sell additional products to current customers. Charter monitors the 

I- 10 

&#160;

effectiveness of its marketing efforts, customer perception, competition, pricing, and service preferences, among other factors, to increase our responsiveness to its customers. Charter&#8217;s marketing organization also manages and directs several sales channels including direct sales, on-line, outbound telemarketing and Charter stores. 

Programming 

General 

Charter believes that offering a wide variety of programming influences a customer &#8217; s decision to subscribe to and retain its cable services. Charter relies on its experience in programming cable systems, which includes market research, customer demographics and local programming preferences to determine channel offerings in each of its markets. Charter obtains basic and premium programming from a number of suppliers, usually pursuant to written contracts. Charter &#8217; s programming contracts generally continue for a fixed period of time, usually from three to eight years, and are subject to negotiated renewal. Some programming suppliers offer financial incentives to support the launch of a channel and/or ongoing marketing support. Charter also negotiates volume discount pricing structures. Charter has more recently negotiated for additional content rights, allowing it to provide programming on - line to its authenticated customers. 

Costs 

Programming is usually made available to Charter for a license fee, which is generally paid based on the number of customers to whom Charter makes such programming available. Programming costs are usually payable each month based on calculations performed by it and are generally subject to annual cost escalations and may be subject to audits by the programmers. Programming license fees may include &#8220; volume &#8221; discounts available for higher numbers of customers, as well as discounts for channel placement or service penetration. Some channels are available without cost to Charter for a limited period of time, after which Charter pays for the programming. For home shopping channels, Charter receives a percentage of the revenue attributable to its customers &#8217; purchases, as well as, in some instances, in centives for channel placement. Charter also offers pay per view channels of movies and events that are subject to revenue split with the content provider. 

Charter &#8217; s programming costs have increased in every year it has operated in excess of customary inflationary and cost - of - living type increases. Charter expects them to continue to increase due to a variety of factors including amounts paid for retransmission consent, annual increases imposed by programmers with additional selling power as a result of media consolidation and carriage of incremental programming, including new sports services and on-line linear services and video on demand programming . In particular, programming costs are increasing as a result of significant sports programming co st increases over the past several years and &#160; the demands of large media companies who link carriage of their most popular networks to carriage and cost increases for all of their networks. In addition, contracts to purchase sports programming sometimes provide for optional additional games to be added to the service and made available on a surcharge basis during the term of the contract. Programmers continue to create new networks and migrate popular programming, such as sporting events to those networks. Spreading popular programming across more networks often results in Charter having to pay more for a suite of networks offered by any one programmer. Finally, programmers have experienced declines in demand for advertising as advertisers shift more of their marketing spend online. Charter believes this results in programmers demanding higher programming fees from them as programmers seek to recover revenue they ar e losing to online advertising. 

Federal law allows commercial television broadcast stations to make an election between &#8220; must - carry &#8221; rights and an alternative &#8220; retransmission - consent &#8221; regime. When a station opts for the retransmission - consent regime, Charter is not allowed to carry the station &#8217; s signal without the station &#8217; s permission. Continuing demands by owners of broadcast stations for cash payments at substantial increases over amounts paid in prior years in exchange for retransmission consent will increase Charter &#8217; s programming costs or require it to cease carriage of popular programming, potentially leading to a loss of customers in affected markets. 

Over the past several years, increases in Charter &#8217; s video service rates have not fully offset increasing programming costs, and with the impact of increasing competition and other marketplace factors, Charter does not expect them to do so in the foreseeable future. Although Charter passes along a portion of amounts paid for retransmission consent to the majority of its customers, its inability to fully pass these programming cost increases on to its video customers has had and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on Charter &#8217; s cash flow and operating margins associated with the video product. In order to 

I- 11 

&#160;

mitigate reductions of Charter &#8217; s operating margins due to rapidly increasing programming costs, Charter continues to review its pricing and programming packaging strategies, and plans to continue to migrate certain program services from its more highly penetrated levels of service to its less highly penetrated tiers as contracts permit , remove underperforming services and limit the launch of non - essential, new n etworks. 

Charter has programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of 201 6 . Charter will seek to renegotiate the terms of these agreements. There can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. To the extent that Charter is unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that it believes are reasonable, Charter has been, and may in the future be, forced to remove such programming channels from its line - up, which may result in a loss of customers. 

Franchises 

As of December 31, 201 5 , Charter &#8217; s systems operated pursuant to a total of approximately 3,300 franchises, permits, and similar authorizations issued by local and state governmental authorities. Such governmental authorities often must approve a transfer to another party. Most franchises are subject to termination proceedings in the event of a material breach. In addition, most franchises require Charter to pay the granting authority up to 5.0% of revenue as defined in the various agreements, which is the maximum amount that may be charged under the applicable federal law. Charter is entitled to and generally does pass this fee through to the customer. 

Prior to the scheduled expiration of most franchises, Charter generally initiates renewal proceedings with the granting authorities. This process usually takes three years but can take a longer period of time. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220; Communications Act&#8221; ), which is the primary federal statute regulating interstate communications, provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals. In connection with the franchise renewal process, many governmental authorities require the cable operator to make certain commitments, such as building out certain of the franchise areas, customer service requirements, and supporting and carrying public access channels. Historically Charter has been able to renew its franchises without incurring significant costs, although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable terms or otherwise. If Charter fails to obtain renewals of franchises representing a significant number of its customers, it could have a material adverse effect on Charter &#8217; s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or its liquidity, including Charter &#8217; s ability to comply with its debt covenants.

Ownership Interests 

We own an approximate 26% ownership interest in Charter. Under the stockholders agreement with Liberty assigned to Liberty Broadb and in the Broadband Spin-Off ( the &#8220; Charter Stockholders Agreement &#8221;) , we have the right to nominate four directors to the Charter board of directors, subject to certain exclusions and requirements. We also have the right to cause one of our nominees to serve on the nominating and corporate governance, audit and compensation and benefits committees of the board, provided they meet the independence and other qualifications for membership on those committees. In connection with the Bright House Transaction, on May 23, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement with Charter, New Charter and A/N (the &#8220;Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement&#8221;), which continues to provide us with board nomination rights. 

TruePosition, Inc. 

TruePosition was incorporated on November 24, 1992. TruePosition develops and markets technology for locating wireless phones and other wireless devices on a cellular network, enabling wireless carriers to provide public safety E - 9 - 1 - 1 services domestically and to enhance services in support of commercial applications, national security and law enforcement worldwide. &#8220; E - 9 - 1 - 1 &#8221; &#160; refers to a series of FCC mandate s requiring wireless carriers to implement and continuously improve the ability to locate callers requesting emergency services . Prior to 2015, TruePosition &#8217; s location offering was a passive network overlay system u sing its patented U - TDOA technology. &#160; In 2015, TruePosition ceased making further investment in its U-TDOA based product offering and commenced the development and marketing of TrueFix, a location offering which is an extension of Skyhook&#8217;s WiFi location technology (discussed below) that determines the location of a wireless device by matching received WiFi signals to the known locations of WiFi access points contained in a proprietary reference database. TruePosition &#8217; s location system calculates the latitude and longitude of a designated wireless telephone or transmitter and forwards the information in real time to application software. Future enhancements, including reverse geo-coding and integration with a National Emergency Address Database , may lead to refining the device location information to include a specific street address. 

TruePosition earns revenue from the sale of hardware and licensing of software required to generate location records for wireless phones and other wireless devices on a cellular network and from the design, installation, testing and commissioning of such hardware and software. In addition, TruePosition earns software maintenance revenue through the provision of ongoing technical and software support. Since 2012, TruePosition has been largely dependent on one wireless carrier, which accounted for approximately 80% - 90% of TruePosition&#8217;s overall revenue through December 31, 2015 . During September 2015, this customer gave notice that it planned to discontinue use of TruePosition&#8217;s existing U-TDOA based technology and did not intend to renew its contract, which expired on December 31, 2015. The loss of this customer will have a material adverse effect on TruePosition&#8217;s business until the TrueFix business can be established . 

I- 13 

&#160;

TruePosition &#8217; s location system s compete against a number of suppliers of both WiFi based technology solutions and other satellite and terrestrial based location technology offerings. In addition, there are a number of new location technologies in development which may further increase competition to be a location solution for new air interfaces and to meet more stringent accuracy st andards. 

On February 14, 2014, TruePosition completed the acquisition of Skyhook. Skyhook operates a global location network with more than 1 b illion geo located WiFi access points, providing hybrid wireless positioning technology and contextual location intelligence solutions worldwide. The large amount of data collected by Skyhook powers all of its pr oducts and provid es Skyhook the ability to offer location and geo-informed context to any mobile app or device. Skyhook's location-based context solutions provide a way for companies and agencies to understand consumers' mobile behavior and improve mobile customer experience, while also allowing advertisers to reach their audiences in new and relevant ways. &#160; Skyhook earns revenue from device manufacturers and application providers by enabling devices and applications to access and utilize location information from Skyhook &#8217; s location system. &#160; One of Skyhook &#8217;s significant customers did not renew its contract for 2015. As a result, Skyhook's revenue growth during 2015 was lower than anticipated . 

Regulatory Matters 

Charter 

The following summary addresses the key regulatory and legislative developments affecting the cable industry and Charter &#8217; s three primary services for both residential and commercial customers: video service, Internet service, and voice service. Cable system operations are extensively regulated by the federal government (primarily the FCC), certain state governments, and many local governments. A failure to comply with these regulations could subject Charter to substantial penalties. Charter &#8217; s business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative, or judicial rulings. Congress and the FCC have frequently revisited the subject of communications regulation and are likely to do so again in the future. 

Video Service 

Must Carry/Retransmission Consent 

There are two alternative legal methods for carriage of local broadcast television stations on cable systems. Federal &#8220; must carry &#8221; regulations require cable systems to carry local broadcast television stations upon the request of the local broadcaster. Alternatively, federal law includes &#8220; retransmission consent &#8221; regulations, by which popular commercial television stations can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for &#8220; retransmission consent, &#8221; which may be conditioned on significant payments or other concessions. Congress passed legislation in 2014 imposing certain restrictions on broadcasters&#8217; exercise of retransmission consent authority and directing the FCC to review aspects of its existing retransmission consent rules. That FCC review is on-going. Popular stations invoking &#8220; retransmission consent &#8221; have been demanding substantial compensation increases in their recent negotiations with cable operators, thereby significantly increasing Charter &#8217; s operating costs. 

Cable Equipment 

In 1996, Congress enacted a statute requiring the FCC to adopt regulations designed to assure the development of an independent retail market for &#8220;navigation devices,&#8221; such as cable set-top boxes. As a result, the FCC required cable operators to make a separate offering of security modules (i.e., a &#8220;CableCARD&#8221;) that can be used with retail navigation devices. Some of the FCC&#8217;s rules requiring support for CableCARDs were vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (&#8220;D.C. Circuit&#8221;) in 2013. The FCC had also adopted an &#8220;integration ban,&#8221; which had required cable operators to use CableCARDs in all of their new set-top boxes. In 2013, Charter received a two-year waiver from the FCC&#8217;s &#8220;integration ban,&#8221; on the condition that Charter meet certain milestones regarding downloadable security by the end of the waiver period. In December 2014, as part of the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization Act of 2014 (&#8220;STELAR&#8221;), Congress repealed the integration ban, effective December 4, 2015. STELAR also directed the FCC to establish a &#8220;working group of technical experts&#8221; to identify and report on downloadable security design options that are not unduly burdensome and that promote competition with respect to the availability of navigation devices. That group issued its report in August 2015, and comments on the report 

I- 14 

&#160;

were subsequently filed at the FCC. The expert report identified alternative proposals, but no consensus recommendation, for FCC action. On January 27, 2016, the FCC Chairman announced that he had circulated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to the other FCC commissioners for vote on February 18, 2016 and outlined his proposal regarding navigation devices. If adopted, the Chairman&#8217;s proposal would require Charter to allow navigation devices on its network if the navigation devices meet standards to be developed by a third party standard setting body envisioned by the proposed rules regardless of the manufacturer of the device. It remains uncertain what rules, if any, will ultimately be adopted and what operating or financial impact any such rules might have on Charter, including on the security of the content Charter obtains from programmers that is delivered over any third party navigation device, customer privacy and the user experience. 

Privacy and Information Security Regulation 

The Communications Act limits Charter &#8217; s ability to collect and disclose subscribers &#8217; personally identifiable information for its video, voice, and Internet services and imposes requirements to safeguard such information. Charter is subject to additional federal, state, and local laws and regulations that impose additional restrictions on the collection, use and disclosure of consumer, subscriber and employee information. Further, the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission &#8220; FTC&#8221; , and many states regulate and restrict the marketing practices of cable operators, including telemarketing and online marketing efforts. Various federal agencies, including the FTC, are now considering new restrictions affecting the use of personal and profiling data for online advertising. Charter &#8217; s operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing information security. &#160; In the event of an information security breach, such rules may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement actions with the potential of mone tary forfeitures. The FCC has used the existing authority under its privacy and security requirements for telecommunications services to bring enforcement actions against several companies (including one cable operator) for failing to protect customer data from unauthorized access by and disclosure to third parties, with settlements resulting in substantial monetary penalties . Similarly, the FTC and state attorneys general regularly bring enforcement actions against companies related to information security breaches and privacy violations. Congress and several state legislatures are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirements for Char ter&#8217;s business. 

In 2014, the National Institute for Standards and Technologies (&#8220;NIST&#8221;), in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of U.S. critical infrastructure, released a voluntary framework that provides a prioritized and flexible model for organizations to identify and manage cyber risks inherent to their business. The NIST cybersecurity framework was directed by an Executive Order and a Presidential Policy Directive issued in 2013, and it is designed to supplement, not supersede, existing cybersecurity regulations and requirements. Several government agencies have encouraged compliance with the NIST cybersecurity framework, including the FCC, which is also considering expansion of its cybersecurity guidelines or the adoption of cybersecurity requirements. 

MDUs / Inside Wiring 

The FCC has adopted a series of regulations designed to spur competition with established cable operators in multi-dwelling unit (&#8220; MDU &#8221;) complexes. These regulations allow Charter &#8217; s competitors to access certain existing cable wiring inside MDUs. The FCC also adopted regulations limit ing the ability of established cable operators, like Charter, to enter into exclusive service contracts for MDU complexes. 

Pole Attachments 

The Communications Act requires most utilities owning utility poles to provide cable systems with ac cess to poles and conduits and subjects the rates charged for this access to either federal or state regulation. In 2011 and again in 2015, the FCC amended its pole attachment rules to promote broadband deployment. The 2011 order allows for new penalties in certain cases involving unauthorized attachments, but generally strengthens the cable industry's ability to access investor-owned utility poles on reasonable rates, terms, and conditions. Additionally, the 2011 order reduces the federal rate formula previously applicable to &#8220;telecommunications&#8221; attachments to closely approximate the rate formula applicable to &#8220;cabl e&#8221; attachments. The 2015 order continues the reconciliation of rates , effectively closing the remaining &#8220;loophole&#8221; that potentially allowed for significantly higher rates for telecommunications than for &#8220;cable&#8221; attachments in certain scenarios. Neither the 2011 order nor the 2015 order directly affect the rate in states that self-regulate (rather than allow the FCC to regulate pole rates), but many of those states have substantially the same rate for cable and telecommunications attachments. 

I- 15 

&#160;

Although the 2011 and 2015 orders do not impact the status quo treatment of cable-provided VoIP service as an unclassified service eligible for the favorable cable rate, the issue has not been fully resolved by the FCC, and a potential change in classification in a pending proceeding could adversely impact Charter&#8217;s pole attachment rates in states or for periods of time in which the cable rate is or was lower than the telecommunications rate. Additionally, although the FCC&#8217;s 2015 reclassification of broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service also set forth the FCC&#8217;s intention that pole rates not increase as result, that reclassification ruling could adversely impact Charter&#8217;s pole attachment rates in states or for periods of time in which the cable rate is or was lower than the telecommunica tions rate. 

Cable Rate Regulation 

Federal law strictly limits the potential scope of cable rate regulation. Pursuant to federal law, all video offerings are universally exempt from rate regulation, except for a cable system&#8217;s minimum level of video programming service, referred to as &#8220;basic service,&#8221; and associated equipment. Rate regulation of basic service and associated equipment operates pursuant to a federal formula, with local governments, commonly referred to as local franchising authorities, primarily responsible for administering this regulation. The majority of Charter&#8217;s local franchising authorities have never certified to regulate basic service cable rates. In 2015, the FCC adopted an order (which is now under appeal) reversing its historic approach to rate regulation certifications and requiring a local franchise authority interested in regulating cable rates to first make an affirmative showing that there is no &#8220;effective competition&#8221; (as defined under federal law) in the community. Very few local franchise authorities have filed the necessary rate regulation certification, and the FCC&#8217;s 2015 order should make it more difficult for such entities to assert rate regulation in the future. 

There have been calls to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry. Confronted with rapidly incr e asing cable programming costs, it is possible that Congress may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming. Any such constraints could adversely affect Charter &#8217; s operations. 

Access Channels 

Local franchise agreements often require cable operators to set aside certain channels for public, educational, and governmental access programming. Federal law also requires cable systems to designate up to 15% of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties, who may offer programming that Charter &#8217; s customers do not particularly desire. The FCC adopted revised rules in 2007 mandating a significant reduction in the rates that operators can charge commercial leased access users &#160; and imposing additional administrative requirements that would be burdensome on the cable industry . The effect of the FCC &#8217; s revised rules was stayed by a federal court, pending a cable industry appeal and an adverse finding by the Office of Management and Budget. Although commercial leased access activity historically has been relatively limited, increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of Charter &#8217; s cable systems. 

Other FCC Regulatory Matters 

FCC regulations cover a variety of additional areas, including, among other things: (1) equal employment opportunity obligations; (2) customer service standards; (3) technical service standards; (4) mandatory blackouts of certain network and syndicated programming; (5) restrictions on political advertising; (6) restrictions on advertising in children's programming; (7) licensing of systems and facilities; (8) maintenance of public files; (9) emergency alert systems; and (1 0) disability access, including requirements governing video-description and closed-captioning. Each of these regulations restricts Charter&#8217;s business practices to varying degrees and may impose additional costs on Charter&#8217;s operations. 

Copyright 

Cable systems are subject to a federal copyright compulsory license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals. The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative proposals and administrative review and could adversely affect Charter &#8217; s ability to obtain desired broadcast programming. 

Copyright clearances for non - broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations. Cable operators also must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations.

&#160;

Franchise Matters 

Cable systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public rights - of - way. Cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. The specific terms and conditions of cable franchises vary significantly between jurisdictions. Cable franchises generally contain provisions governing cable operations, franchise fees, system construction, maintenance, technical performance, customer service standards, and changes in the ownership of the franchisee. A number of states subject cable systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agencies, such as public utility commissions. Although local franchising authorities have considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms, certain federal protections benefit cable operators. For example, federal law caps local franchise fees and includes renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees from arbitrary denials of renewal. Even if a franchise is renewed, however, the local franchising authority may seek to impose new and more onerous requir ements as a condition of renewal. &#160; Similarly, if a local franchising authority's consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system, the local franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements as a condition for providing its consent. 

The traditional cable franchising regime has undergone significant change as a result of various federal and state actions. The FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (particularly those affiliated with telephone companies) and reduce certain franchising burdens for these new entrants. The FCC adopted more modest relief for existing cable operators. 

At the same time, a substantial number of states have adopted new franchising laws. Again, these laws were principally designed to streamline entry for new competitors, and they often provide advantages for these new entrants that are not immediately available to existing cable operators. In many instances, these franchising regimes do not apply to established cable operators until the existing franchise expires or a competitor directly en ters the franchise territory. 

Internet Service 

On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order that: (1) reclassified broadband Internet service as a Title II service, (2) applied certain existing Title II provisions and associated regulations (including requiring that rates and practices be just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory, allowing complaints in court and before the FCC, imposing privacy and disability obligations, and providing broadband providers with access to poles and conduits), (3) forbore from applying a range of other existing Title II provisions and associated regulations, but to varying degrees indicated that this forbearance may be only temporary, and (4) issued new rules expanding disclosure requirements and prohibiting blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, and unreasonable interference with the ability of end users and edge providers to reach each other. The order also subjected broadband providers&#8217; Internet traffic exchange rates and practices to potential FCC oversight and created a mechanism for third parties to file complaints regarding these matters. The order has been challenged by multiple parties in the D.C. Circuit , but the rules are currently in effect. The D.C. Circuit is expected to rule on the challenge in 2016. The FCC is also considering the appropriate regulatory framework for VoIP service, including whether that service should be regulated under Title II. Charter has made certain commitments to comply with the FCC&#8217;s order in connection with the FCC&#8217;s review of Charter&#8217;s pending TWC Transactio n and Bright House Transaction. 

As the Internet has matured, it has become subject to increasing regulatory interest. Congress and federal regulators have adopted a wide range of measures directly or potentially affecting Internet use, including, for example, consumer privacy, copyright protections, defamation liability, taxation, obscenity, and unsolicited commercial e - mail. Charter &#8217; s Internet services are subject to the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (&#8220; CALEA &#8221;) requirements regarding law enforcement surveillance. These funding requirements could impose significant new costs on Charter&#8217;s high-speed Internet service. Also, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions direct certain subsidies to telephone companies deploying broadband to areas deemed to be &#8220;unserved&#8221; or &#8220;underserved.&#8221; Charter has opposed such subsidies when directed to areas that Charter serves. State and local governmental organizations have also adopted Internet-related regulations. These various governmental jurisdictions are also considering additional regulations in these and other areas, such as privacy, pricing, service and product quality, and taxation. 

The FCC is considering whether online video distributors ( &#8220;OVDs&#8221; ) that offer programming to customers with a broadband Internet connection should be classified as multichannel video programming distributors ( &#8220;MVPDs&#8221; ) , and thereby 

I- 17 

&#160;

obtaining the benefit of the program access protections available to MVPDs, as well as becoming subject to some of the regulatory requirements applicable to MVPDs. The outcome of this proceeding, which could impact how OVDs compete in the future with traditional cable service, cannot be determined at the current time. 

On January 29, 2015, the FCC, in a nation-wide proceeding evaluating whether &#8220;advanced broadband&#8221; is being deployed in a reasonable and timely fashion, increased the minimum connection speeds required to qualify as advanced broadband service to 25 Mbps for downloads and 3 Mbps for uploads. As a result, the FCC concluded that advanced broadband was not being sufficiently deployed and initiated a new inquiry into what steps it might take to encourage broadband deployment. The FCC&#8217;s 2016 Broadband Progress Report adopted on January 28, 2016 concluded that advanced broadband is not being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion. The FCC therefore may adopt additional measures affecting our broadband business. At the same time, the FCC has ongoing proceedings to allocate additional spectrum for advanced wireless service, which could provide additional wireless competition to Charter&#8217;s broadband business. 

On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted a memorandum opinion and order (Order) granting two petitions from municipalities in North Carolina and Tennessee, respectively, and preempted the challenged state laws that restrict the ability of municipalities to construct and deploy broadband systems in competition with private offerings. Although the &#160; O rder only preempt s the North Carolina and Tennessee laws at issue, municipalities in other states may seek similar relief. The Order &#160; has been appealed , and Congress might also adopt legislation expressly limiting the FCC&#8217;s authority in this area. If the Order is upheld, it could lead to increased competition from municipal-provided broadband. 

Voice Service 

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 created a more favorable regulatory environment for Charter to provide telecommunications and/or competitive voice services than had previously existed. In particular, it established requirements ensuring that competitive telephone companies could interconnect their networks with those providers of traditional telecommunications services to open the market to competition. The FCC has subsequently ruled that competitive telephone companies that support VoIP services, such as those Charter offers to its customers, are entitled to interconnection with incumbent providers of traditional telecommunications services, which ensures that Charter &#8217; s VoIP services can compete in the market. Since that time, the FCC has initiated a proceeding to determine whether such interconnection rights should extend to traditional and competitive networks utilizing IP technology, and how to encourage the transition to IP networks throughout the industry. New rules or obligations arising from these proceedings may affect Charter &#8217; s ability to compete in the provision of voice services. In 2011, the FCC released an order, which was affirmed by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2014, significantly changing the rules governing intercarrie r compensation payments for the termination of telephone traffic between carriers. That change result ed in a substantial decrease in the intercarrier compensation payments Charter receives, and those payments will continue to decrease over the multi - year transition period, which will , however, affect not only the amounts that Charter receives from other carriers but also the amounts that Charter pays to other carriers . The schedule and magnitude of these decreases, however, will vary depending on the nature of the carriers and the telephone traffic at issue, and any further rule changes . 

Further regulatory changes are being considered that could impact Charter &#8217; s voice business and that of its primary telecommunications competitors. The FCC and state regulatory authorities are considering, for example, whether certain common carrier regulations traditionally applied to incumbent local exchange carriers should be modified or reduced, and the extent to which common carrier requirements should be extended to VoIP providers. The FCC has already determined that certain providers of voice services using IP technology must comply with requirements relating to 911 emergency services &#160; (&#8220; E - 9 - 1 - 1 &#8221;) , the CALEA (the statute &#160; governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communications ) , Universal Service Fund contributions, customer privacy and Customer Proprietary Network Information issues, number portability, network outage reporting, rural call completion, disability access, regulatory fees, and discontinuance of service . In November 2014, the FCC adopted an order imposing limited back-up power obligations on providers of facilities-based fixed, residential voice services that are not otherwise line-powered, including our VoIP services. This order becomes effective in February 2016 and requires Charter to disclose certain information to customers and to make back-up power available at the point of sale. In March 2007, a federal appeals court affirmed the FCC &#8217; s decision concerning federal regulation of certain VoIP services, but declined to specifically find that VoIP service provided by cable companies , such as Charter provides, should be regulated only at the federal level. As a result, some states have begun proceedings to subject cable VoIP services to state level regulation , and at least one state has asserted jurisdiction over our VoIP services. Charter has filed a legal challenge to that state&#8217;s assertion of jurisdiction, which is now pending before a federal district court in Minnesota. Although Charter has registered with, or obtained certificates or authorizations from, the FCC and the state regulatory authorities in those states in which it offers competitive voice services in 

I- 18 

&#160;

order to ensure the continuity of its services and to maintain needed network interconnection arrangements, it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matters ultimately will be resolved. 

TruePosition 

TruePosition &#8217; s wireless phone and device location technology enables wireless carriers, governments and other enterprises to provide E - 9 - 1 - 1 services domestically and to enhance services in support of commercial applications, national security and law enforcement worldwide. The FCC &#8217; s wireless E - 9 - 1 - 1 rules apply to all wireless licensees, broadband personal communications services licensees, and certain specialized mobile radio licensees. Such carriers must provide a 911 call center, called a local public safety answering point ( &#8220; PSAP&#8221;) under FCC rules, with the telephone number of the originator of a wireless 9 - 1 - 1 call and the location of the cell site or base station transmitting the call. In addition, upon a valid request by a PSAP, such carriers must provide more precise information to the PSAP, such as the latitu de and longitude of the caller. 

The E-9-1-1 location accuracy requirements originally adopted by the FCC in 1996 applied only to 911 calls originating outdoors. Recognizing the increased use of wireless phones indoors, o n January 29, 2015, the FCC adopted indoor location accuracy rules in its Fourth Report and Order in its E-9-1-1 location accuracy proceeding to assist first responders . Under the new rules, all wireless providers generally must provide horizontal location information with 50 meter accuracy for 40 percent of all wireless 911 calls within two years of the effective date of the Fourth Report and Order ( April 30, 2015 ), and for 80 percent of all wireless calls, within six years of the effective date. Wireless providers also must meet specific requirements for the provision of vertical location information for wireless 911 calls within three-to-eight years of the effective date. Smaller wireless providers may have additional time to comply with certain of the horizontal and vertical benchmarks. 

Various U.S and foreign regulatory requirements apply, or may apply in the future, to the global positioning technologies and services offered by Skyhook. Skyhook &#8217; s use of personal information must comply with all applicable consumer and data protection laws in the United States and abroad. Legislatures and regulatory agencies in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere continue to implement additional consumer and data protection requirements. 

Competition 

Charter 

Charter faces competition for both residential and commercial customers in the areas of price, service offerings, and service reliability. In its residential business, Charter competes with other providers of video, high - speed Internet access, voice services, and other sources of home entertainment. In its commercial business, Charter competes with other providers of video, high- speed Internet access and related value - added services, fiber solutions, business telephony, and Ethernet services. Charter operates in a competitive business environment, which can adversely affect the results of its business and operations. Charter cannot predict the impact on it of broadband servi ces offered by its competitors. 

In terms of competition for customers, Charter views itself as a member of the broadband communications industry, which encompasses multi - channel video for television and related broadband services, such as high - speed Internet, voice, and other interactive video services. In the broadband communications industry, Charter &#8217; s principal competitors for video services are direct broadcast satellite (&#8220; DBS &#8221;) and telephone companies that offer video services. Charter &#8217; s principal competitors for high - speed Internet services are the broadband services provided by telephone companies, including both traditional DSL, fiber - to - the - node, and fiber - to - the - home offerings. Charter &#8217; s principal competitors for voice services are established telephone companies, other telephone service providers, and other carriers, including VoIP providers. At this time, Charter does not consider other traditional cable operators to be significant competitors in its overall market, as overbuilds are infrequent and geographically spotty (although in any particular market, a cable operator overbuilder would likely be a significant competitor at the local level). Charter could, however, face additional competition from other cable operators if they began distributing video over the Internet to customers residing outside their current territories. 

I- 19 

&#160;

Charter&#8217;s key competitors include: 

DBS 

Direct broadcast satellite is a significant competitor to cable systems. The two largest DBS providers now serve more than 3 3 million subscribers nationwide. DBS service allows the subscriber to receive video services directly via satellite using a dish antenna. 

Video compression technology and high powered satellites allow DBS providers to offer more than 315 digital channels. In 201 5 , major DBS competitors were especially competitive with promotional pricing for more basic services. While Charter continues to believe that the initial investment by a DBS customer exceeds that of a cable customer, the initial equipment cost for DBS has decreased substantially, as the DBS providers have aggressively marketed offers to new customers of incentives for discounted or free equipment, installation, and multiple units. DBS providers are able to offer service nationwide and are able to establish a national image and branding with standardized offerings, which together with their ability to avoid franch ise fees of up to 5% of revenue and property tax, leads to greater efficiencies and lower costs in the lower tiers of service. Charter believes that cable-delivered v ideo on demand and s ubscription video on demand services, which include HD programming, are superior to DBS service, because cable headends can provide communication to deliver many titles which customers can access and control independently, whereas DBS technology can only make available a much smaller number of titles with DVR-like customer control. DBS providers have also made attempts at deployment of Internet access services via satellite, but those services have been technically constrained and of limited appeal. 

Telephone Companies and Utilities 

Incumbent telephone companies, including AT&#38;T , Inc. (&#8220;AT&#38;T&#8221;) and Verizon Communications Inc. (&#8220;Verizon&#8221;) , offer video and other services in competition with Charter, and Charter expects they will increasingly do so in the future. These companies are able to offer and provide two-way video, data services and digital voice services that are similar to Charter&#8217;s in various portions of their networks. In the case of Verizon, its high-speed data services (fiber optic service (&#8220;FiOS&#8221;)) offer speeds as high as or higher than Charter&#8217;s. In addition, these companies continue to offer their traditional telephone services, as well as service bundles that include wireless voice services provided by affiliated companies. Based on internal estimates, Charter believes that AT&#38;T (excluding DirecTV) and Verizon are offering video services in areas serving approximately 3 5 % and 4%, respectively, of its estimated passings and Charter has experienced customer losses in these areas. AT&#38;T and Verizon have also launched campaigns to capture more of the multiple dwelling unit &#160; (&#8220; MDU &#8221;) market. When AT&#38;T or Verizon have introduced or expanded their offering of video products in Charter&#8217;s market areas, Charter has seen a decrease in its video revenue as AT&#38;T and Verizon typically roll out aggressive marketing and discounting campaigns to launch their products. &#160; Moreover , in July 2015, AT&#38;T completed its acquisition of DirectTV, the nation&#8217;s largest DBS provider. This transaction create d an even larger competitor for Charter&#8217;s video services that has the ability to expand its video service offering s to include bundled wireless offerings. 

In addition to incumbent telephone companies obtaining video franchises or alternative video authorizations, they have been successful through various means in reducing or streamlining the video franchising requirements applicable to them. They have had success at the federal and state level in securing FCC rulings and statewide video franchise laws that facilitate telephone company entry into the video marketplace. Because telephone companies have been successful in avoiding or reducing franchise and other regulatory requirements that remain applicable to cable operators like Charter, their competitive posture has been enhanced in some areas . The large scale entry of incumbent telephone companies as direct competitors in the video marketplace has adversely affected the profitability and valuation of Charter&#8217;s cable systems. 

Most telephone companies, including AT&#38;T and Verizon, which already have plant, an existing customer base, and other operational functions in place (such as billing and service personnel), offer Internet access via traditional DSL service. DSL service allows Internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds greater than those formerly available over conventional telephone lines. Charter believes DSL service is an alternative to its high-speed Internet service and is often offered at prices lower than its Internet services, although typically at speeds lower than the speeds Charter offers. DSL providers may currently be in a better position to offer voice and data services to businesses since their networks tend to be more extensive in commercial areas. Charter expects DSL to remain a significant competitor to its high-speed Internet services. 

I- 20 

&#160;

Many large incumbent telephone companies also provide fiber-to-the-node or fiber-to-the-home services in select areas of their footprints. Fiber-to-the-node networks can provide faster Internet speeds than conventional DSL, but still cannot typically match Charter&#8217;s Internet speeds. Charter&#8217;s primary fiber-to-t he-node competitor is AT&#38;T&#8217;s U- verse. The competition from AT&#38;T U-verse is expected to intensify over time as AT&#38;T completed an expansion in 2015 based on plan s an nounced in late 2012 and entered into additional expansion commitments in connection with its acquisition of DirecTV in 2015 . Fiber-to- the-home networks, however, can provide Internet speeds equal to or greater than Charter&#8217;s current Internet speeds. Veriz on&#8217;s FiOS is the primary fiber- to-the-home competitor , although AT&#38;T has also begun fiber-to-the-home builds as well . 

Charter&#8217;s voice service competes directly with the voice services of incumbent telephone companies and other carriers, including Internet-based VoIP providers, for both residential and commercial voice service customers. Because Charter offers voice services, it is subject to considerable competition from such companies and other telecommunications providers, including wireless providers with an increasing number of consumers choosing wireless over wired telephone services. The telecommunications and voice services industry is highly competitive and includes competitors with greater financial and personnel resources, strong brand name recognition, and long-standing relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. Moreover, mergers, joint ventures and alliances among Charter&#8217;s competitors have resulted in providers capable of offering video cable television, Internet, and voice services in direct competition with Charter. 

Additionally, Charter is subject to limited competition from utilities and/or municipal utilities (collectively, &#8220; Utilities &#8221; ) that possess fiber optic transmission lines capable of transmitting signals with minimal signal distortion. 

Traditional Overbuilds 

Cable systems are operated under non - exclusive franchises historically granted by state and local authorities. More than one cable system may legally be built in the same area. Franchising authorities may grant a second franchise to another cable operator that may contain terms and conditions more favorable than those afforded to Charter. Well - financed businesses from outside the cable industry, such as public utilities that already possess fiber optic and other transmission lines in the areas they serve, have in some cases become competitors. There are a number of cities that have constructed their own cable systems, in a manner similar to city - provided utility services. There also has been interest in traditional cable overbuilds by private companies not affiliated with established local exchange carriers , including Google Fiber . Constructing a competing cable system is a capital intensive process which involves a high degree of risk. Charter believes that in order to be successful, a competitor &#8217; s overbuild would need to be able to serve the homes and businesses in the overbuilt area with equal or better service quality, on a more cost - effective basis than Charter can. Any such overbuild operation would require access to capital or access to facilities already in place that are capable of delivering cable television programming. Charter cannot predict the extent to which additional overbuild situations may occur. 

Broadcast Television 

Cable television has long competed with broadcast television, which consists of television signals that the viewer is able to receive without charge using an &#8220; off - air &#8221; antenna. The extent of such competition is dependent upon the quality and quantity of broadcast signals available through &#8220; off - air &#8221; reception, compared to the services provided by the local cable system. Traditionally, cable television has provided higher picture quality and more channel offerings than broadcast television. However, the recent licensing of digital spectrum by the FCC now provides traditional broadcasters with the ability to deliver HD television pictures and multiple digital - quality program streams, as well as advanced digital services such as subscription video and data transmission. 

Internet Delivered Video 

Internet access facilitates the streaming of video, including movies and television shows, into homes and businesses. Online video services include those offered by Hulu, Netflix, Amazon and Apple. Increasingly, content owners are using Internet - based delivery of content directly to consumers, some without charging a fee to access the content. Further, due to consumer electronic innovations, consumers are able to watch such Internet - delivered content on televisions, personal computers, tablets, gaming boxes connected to televisions and mobile devices. In 2015, HBO and CBS began selling their programming direct to consumers over the Internet. DISH Network launched Sling TV which include s ESPN among other programming, and Sony launched Playstation Vue which include s &#160; 85+ TV channels. Charter views online video distributors as complementary and has 

I- 21 

&#160;

developed a cloud-based guide that can incorporate Internet delivered video. Charter believes some customers have chosen or will choose to receive video over the Internet rather than through its video on demand and subscription video services, thereby reducing Charter &#8217; s video revenue which may be offset by increases in Charter&#8217;s Internet revenue . Charter cannot predict the impact that Internet delivered video will have on its revenue and adjusted EBITDA as technologies continue to evolve. 

Private Cable 

Additional competition is posed by satellite master antenna television systems, or SMATV systems, serving MDUs, such as condominiums, apartment complexes, and private residential communities. Private cable systems can offer improved reception of local television stations, and many of the same satellite - delivered program services that are offered by cable systems. Although disadvantaged from a programming cost perspective, SMATV systems currently benefit from operating advantages not available to franchised cable systems, including fewer regulatory burdens and no requirement to service low density or economically depressed communities. The FCC previously adopted regulations that favor SMATV and private cable operators serving MDU complexes, allowing them to continue to secure exclusive contracts with MDU owners. This regulatory disparity provides a competitive advantage to certain of Charter &#8217; s current and potential competitors. 

Other Competitors 

Local wireless Internet services operate in some markets using available unlicensed radio spectrum. Various wireless phone companies are now offering third and fourth generation (3G and 4G) wireless high - speed Internet services with fifth generation (5G) and faster services on the horizon . In addition, a growing number of commercial areas, such as retail malls, restaurants and airports, offer Wi - Fi Internet service. Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized Wi -Fi Internet access networks. Operators are also marketing PC cards and &#8220; personal hotspots &#8221; offering wireless broadband access to their cellular networks. These service options offer another alternative to cable - based Internet access. &#160; In addition, certain wireless carriers, including T-Mobile and Verizon, are exempting certain video traffic from data charges thus encouraging video over the Internet. 

TruePosition 

TruePosition faces competition from a number of suppliers of both WiFi based technology solutions and other wireless location technologies, such as GPS, OTDOA and Terrestrial Beacons, which provide similar location - based product and services to TruePosition. Although TruePosition &#8217;s products are in part comple men tary to GPS, in that UTDOA and WiFi can operate in areas where GPS is not currently available due to lack of connection to satellites, solutions such as OTDOA and Terrestrial Beacons may also operate in environments where GPS signals are blocked. In addition, Skyhook faces competition from Google, HERE and smaller regional or niche market competitors as providers of location - based services , products and contextual information . 

Seasonality and Cyclicality 

Charter 

Charter&#8217;s business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Its results are impacted by the seasonal nature of customers receiving its cable services in college and vacation markets. Charter&#8217;s revenue is subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Its U.S. advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season. U.S. advertising revenue is also cyclical, benefiting in even-numbered years from advertising related to candidates running for political office and issue-oriented advertising.
