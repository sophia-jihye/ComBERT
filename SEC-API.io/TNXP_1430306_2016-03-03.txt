&#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160;

Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp., together with its subsidiaries (collectively &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;Tonix&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company dedicated to the invention and development of next-generation medicines. Our most advanced drug development programs are directed toward disorders affecting the central nervous system, or CNS, and include FM and post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. These disorders are characterized by chronic disability, inadequate treatment options, high utilization of healthcare services, and significant economic burden. We have assembled a management team with significant industry experience to lead the development of our product candidates. We complement our management team with a network of scientific, clinical, and regulatory advisors that includes recognized experts in the fields of FM, PTSD and other central nervous system disorders.

&#160; 

Our lead product candidate, TNX-102 SL (cyclobenzaprine HCl sublingual tablets) is in Phase 3 clinical development as a potential treatment for FM. In addition, TNX-102 SL is in Phase 2 clinical development as a potential treatment for PTSD. Our nonclinical pipeline includes a development program for the treatment of alcohol use disorders, or AUD, as well as two biodefense development programs for protection from smallpox virus and from radiation injury. We hold worldwide development and commercialization rights to all of our product candidates.

&#160;

Our clinical-stage product candidates are as follows:

&#160; 

TNX-102 SL 

&#160;

TNX-102 SL is a small, rapidly disintegrating tablet containing cyclobenzaprine, or CBP, for sublingual administration and transmucosal absorption. We are developing TNX-102 SL for two indications:

&#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Fibromyalgia . Fibromyalgia is a debilitating syndrome that occurs in five to 15 million U.S. adults and is associated with a substantial negative impact on social and occupational function, including disrupted relationships with family and friends, social isolation, reduced activities of daily living and leisure activities, avoidance of physical activity, and loss of career or inability to advance in careers or education. Many patients fail to adequately respond to the medications approved for FM, or discontinue therapy due to poor tolerability. Prescription pain and sleep medications not approved for FM are frequently taken for symptomatic relief, despite the lack of evidence that such medications provide a meaningful or durable therapeutic effect.

&#160; 

Post-traumatic stress disorder . An estimated 8.4 million adults in the U.S. suffer from PTSD, a chronic disorder that is characterized by avoidance, emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and sleep disturbances. People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive, violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide. Many patients fail to adequately respond to the medications approved for PTSD. Antidepressants, sedative-hypnotics and antipsychotics not approved for PTSD are commonly prescribed despite generally weak evidence in support of their use.

&#160; 

TNX-201 

&#160;

TNX-201 is an oral formulation of dexisometheptene mucate that we were developing for episodic tension-type headache, or ETTH. On February 16, 2016, we announced that we discontinued development of TNX-20 1 because it lacked efficacy. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our objective is to develop and commercialize our product candidates. The principal components of our strategy are to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Develop TNX-102 SL for multiple central nervous system disorders . We currently are pursuing the development of TNX-102 SL for two separate indications, FM and PTSD. Our broad development strategy is designed to explore the clinical potential of TNX-102 SL in disorders that are underserved by currently available medications and represent large unmet medical needs; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Maximize the commercial potential of TNX-102 SL . We plan to commercialize TNX-102 SL for indications including FM and PTSD either on our own or through collaboration with partners. We believe TNX-102 SL can be marketed to U.S. physicians either by an internal sales force that we will build or by a contract sales organization, which we would engage. An alternative strategy would be to enter into partnership agreements with drug companies that already have significant marketing capabilities in the same, or similar, therapeutic areas. If we determine that such a strategy would be more favorable than developing our own sales capabilities, we would seek to enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the commercialization of TNX-102 SL; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Pursue a broad intellectual property strategy to protect our product candidates . We are pursuing a broad patent strategy for our product candidates, and we endeavor to generate new patent applications as supported by our innovations and conceptions as well as to advance their prosecution. In the case of TNX-102 SL, we own patents and patent applications protecting its composition-of-matter, certain methods of its use, its formulation, and its pharmacokinetic properties. We plan to opportunistically apply for new patents to protect TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Provide value propositions to merit market demand and reimbursement for our product candidates . We are designing the development programs for our product candidates to demonstrate their value propositions to patients, prescribers, and third-party payors. In the case of TNX-102 SL, we have been engaged in market research and commercial assessment activities, the results of which we may use to inform future commercial strategy. We plan to continue these activities in tandem with our clinical development of TNX-102 SL and to conduct similar work in relation to our other product candidates as they advance in their development; and &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Pursue additional indications and commercial opportunities for our product candidates . We will seek to maximize the value of TNX-102 SL, and our other product candidates by pursuing other indications and commercial opportunities for such candidates. For example, we own rights related to the development and commercialization of CBP for generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and fatigue related to disordered sleep. &#160; 

Disease and Market Overview 

&#160;

Our product candidates address disorders that are not well served by currently available therapies and represent large potential commercial market opportunities. Background information on the disorders and related commercial markets that may be addressed by our clinical-stage product candidates is set forth below.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Fibromyalgia 

&#160;

FM is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. The peak incidence of FM occurs between 20-50 years of age, and 80-90% of diagnosed patients are female. FM may have a substantial negative impact on social and occupational function, including disrupted relationships with family and friends, social isolation, reduced activities of daily living and leisure activities, avoidance of physical activity, and loss of career or inability to advance in career or education. According to published estimates, there are approximately five to fifteen million people suffering from FM in the U.S. (Vincent et al, Arthritis Care Res 2013;65:786-792; Lawrence et al, Arthritis Rheum 2008;58:26-35). Based on our market research, we believe that sales in the U.S. of FDA-approved medications for FM were approximately $1.2 billion in 2014, representing approximately 5.6 million prescriptions.

&#160;

According to a report by Frost and Sullivan that we commissioned, despite the availability of approved medications, the majority of patients fail therapy due to either insufficient efficacy or poor tolerability, or both. Prescription pain and sleep medications are frequently prescribed off-label for symptomatic relief, despite the lack of evidence that such medications provide a meaningful or durable therapeutic benefit, and many of these medications carry significant safety risks and risk of dependence.

&#160;

Post-traumatic Stress Disorder 

&#160;

PTSD is a chronic syndrome that may develop after a person is exposed to one or more traumatic events, such as warfare, sexual assault, serious injury, or threat of imminent death. The core symptom clusters of PTSD are avoidance, emotional numbing, hyperarousal, and intrusion, where the triggering event is commonly re-experienced by the individual through intrusive, recurrent recollections, flashbacks, and nightmares. People with PTSD suffer significant impairment in their daily functioning, including occupational activities and social relations, and are at elevated risk for impulsive violent behaviors toward others and themselves, including suicide. Of those who experience significant trauma, approximately 20% of women and 8% of men develop PTSD. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the prevalence rate of PTSD in the military population is higher than that among civilians. As of 2009, there were approximately 500,000 veterans receiving treatment for PTSD in the Veterans Health Administration, or VHA. Based on March 2014 VHA data, approximately 20% of military personnel involved in recent conflicts were seen at VHA facilities for potential or provisional PTSD.

&#160;

The medications currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of PTSD show little evidence of a treatment effect in men, lack evidence of efficacy in those for whom the traumatic event was combat-related, and carry suicidality warnings. Sleep disturbances are central features of PTSD and are predictive of disease severity, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation, yet are resistant to the approved medications and present a difficult therapeutic challenge. Current PTSD treatments include off-label use of anxiolytics, sedative-hypnotics, and antipsychotics, many of which lack reliable evidence of efficacy, and have significant safety liabilities and dependence risk.

&#160;

Our Product Candidates 

&#160;

We currently are focused on developing a portfolio of product candidates, including one product candidate in clinical development for registration in two indications. We believe that our product candidates offer innovative therapeutic approaches and may provide significant advantages relative to current therapies. The following table summarizes our most advanced product candidates, for which we plan to complete the required clinical and nonclinical studies to support their NDA filings:

&#160;

Product Candidate &#160; Indication &#160; Stage of Development &#160; Commercialization Rights TNX-102 SL &#160; Fibromyalgia &#160; Phase 3 &#160; Worldwide TNX-102 SL &#160; Post-traumatic stress disorder &#160; Phase 2 &#160; Worldwide &#160; 

TNX-102 SL 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

TNX-102 SL is a sublingual tablet formulation of CBP that efficiently delivers CBP across the oral mucosal membrane into the systemic circulation. We are developing TNX-102 SL for fibromyalgia and post-traumatic stress disorder. We own all rights to TNX-102 SL in all geographies, and we bear no obligations to third-parties for any future development or commercialization.

&#160;

Excipients used in TNX-102 SL are approved for pharmaceutical use. Some of the excipients were specially selected to promote a local oral environment that facilitates mucosal absorption of CBP.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

TNX-102 SL contains 2.8 mg of CBP. We selected this dose with the goal of providing a balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability that would be acceptable as a first-line therapy and for long-term use, and in patient populations characterized by burdensome symptoms and sensitivity to medications.

&#160;

TNX-102 SL is a serotonin 2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist as well as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, and we refer to it as a Serotonin and Norepinephrine receptor Antagonist and Reuptake Inhibitor, or SNARI. In FM, pregabalin is believed to exert its clinical benefit primarily by blocking calcium channels, and both duloxetine and milnacipran are believed to exert their clinical benefit mainly by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. In PTSD, both paroxetine and sertraline are believed to exert their clinical benefit primarily by blocking serotonin reuptake. As such, TNX-102 SL acts upon cellular receptors that play important roles in the treatment of FM and PTSD, including the receptors that mediate serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TNX-102 SL also acts upon other receptors in the central nervous system not targeted by products approved for these indications, including the serotonin 2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors.

&#160;

CBP is the active ingredient of two products that are approved in the U.S. for the treatment of muscle spasm: FLEXERIL &#174; (oral immediate-release tablet, 5 mg and 10 mg dosage forms) and AMRIX &#174; (oral extended-release capsule, 15 mg and 30 mg dosage forms). FLEXERIL brand of cyclobenzaprine immediate-release tablet has been discontinued since May 2013. There are numerous generic versions of cyclobenzaprine immediate-release tablets on the market. CBP-containing products are not indicated for the treatment of FM or PTSD. CBP-containing products are approved for short term use (two to three weeks) only. Immediate-release, or IR, CBP tablets are recommended for three times per day dosing, which results in relatively stable blood levels of CBP after several days of treatment. Extended-release CBP capsules taken once a day mimic, and flatten, the pharmacokinetic profile of three times per day immediate-release CBP tablets.

&#160;

We designed TNX-102 SL to be administered once-daily at bedtime and intended for long-term dosing regimen. We believe the selected dose of TNX-102 SL and its pharmacokinetic profile will enable it to achieve a desirable balance of efficacy, safety, and tolerability in FM and PTSD. Our Phase 1 comparative trials showed that, on a dose-adjusted basis, TNX-102 SL results in faster systemic absorption and significantly higher plasma levels of CBP in the first hour following sublingual administration relative to oral immediate-release CBP tablets. In clinical studies, TNX-102 SL, 2.8 mg was generally well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported in these studies. Some subjects experienced transient numbness of the tongue after TNX-102 SL administration.

&#160;

We expect that any applications we submit to the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for approval of TNX-102 SL will be submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, for product candidates containing an active ingredient that is similar or identical to an already approved product. In general, the development timeline for a 505(b)(2) New Drug Application, or NDA, is shorter and less expensive than an NDA developed under Section 505(b)(1), which is for new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have never been approved in the United States. Currently, we are pursuing the development of TNX-102 SL for two separate indications. These indications are fibromyalgia, for which TNX-102 SL is in Phase 3 development, and post-traumatic stress disorder, for which TNX-102 SL is in Phase 2 development. We believe that TNX-102 SL has the potential to provide clinical benefit to these and possibly other CNS indications that are underserved by currently marketed products.

&#160; 

TNX-102 SL &#8211; Fibromyalgia Program 

&#160;

We are developing TNX-102 SL for the treatment of FM under an effective investigational new drug, or IND, application. Our therapeutic approach to FM was initially supported by results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of TNX-102 immediate release capsules, or TNX-102 capsules, which we have also referred to as VLD CBP (Moldofsky et al, J Rheumatol 2011;38:2653-63). This study demonstrated significant decreases in pain and other symptoms in patients treated with TNX-102 capsules daily between dinner and bedtime for eight weeks. This study also demonstrated that treatment with TNX-102 capsules led to a significant improvement in objective measures of sleep quality, which we believe relates to the mechanism by which CBP leads to improvement of FM symptoms.

&#160;

Clinical Development Plan 

&#160;

At an End-of-Phase 2/Pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in February 2013, we discussed the design of our clinical program, including the acceptability of the pivotal study design and the proposed registration plan, to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM. On the basis of our discussions with the FDA, we believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies would provide sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety to support FDA approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Phase 2b &#8220;BESTFIT&#8221; Study 

&#160;

In September 2013, we commenced enrollment of our BESTFIT trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in FM. We reported preliminary top line results from the BESTFIT trial in September 2014. In the BESTFIT trial, 205 patients with FM were randomized at 17 U.S. centers to treatment with either TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg or placebo sublingual tablets at bedtime daily for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure of the BESTFIT trial was the mean change in week 12 average daily pain intensity from baseline on the 11-point Numeric Rating Scale, using a daily telephonic diary. In the BESTFIT trial, TNX-102 SL did not achieve statistical significance in the primary outcome measure (p=0.172). However, the trial demonstrated that TNX-102 SL had a statistically significant effect on pain as measured by a 30% responder analysis of the primary pain data (p=0.033), in which a responder is defined as a subject for whom pain intensity was reduced by at least 30% at week 12 as compared to baseline. The 30% response rate in the final analysis was 34.0% in the active treatment arm as compared to 20.6% in the control arm. The BESTFIT trial also showed statistically significant improvements with TNX-102 SL in the declared secondary analyses of the Patient Global Impression of Change (p=0.025) and the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire-Revised, or FIQ-R (p=0.014). The study showed statistically significant improvement with TNX-102 SL on measures of sleep quality, including the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, or PROMIS, Sleep Disturbance instrument (p=0.005). In addition, statistically significant improvements with TNX-102 SL were observed on several FIQ-R items (pain, sleep quality, anxiety, stiffness, and sensitivity) as well as on the overall symptom subdomain.

&#160;

TNX-102 SL was well tolerated in the BESTFIT trial. Among patients randomized to the active and control arms, 86% and 83%, respectively, completed the 12-week dosing period. The most common adverse events were local in nature, with transient tongue or mouth numbness occurring in 44% of participants on TNX-102 SL vs. 2% on placebo, and bitter taste in 8% on TNX-102 SL compared to none on placebo. These local adverse events did not appear to affect either rates of retention of study participants or their compliance with taking TNX-102 SL. Systemic adverse events were similar between TNX-102 SL and placebo. No serious adverse events were reported.

&#160; 

Phase 3 &#8220;AFFIRM&#8221; Study 

&#160;

Following our report of the results of the BESTFIT trial, we requested guidance from the FDA on our proposed use of a 30% pain responder analysis as the primary efficacy endpoint in a prospective Phase 3 registration program. In January 2015, we announced receipt of the written guidance, whereby the FDA accepted our proposal to use a 30% pain responder analysis as the primary efficacy endpoint to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of FM.

&#160;

In the second quarter of 2015, we commenced the AFFIRM trial, a 500 patient, randomized, double-blind trial comparing TNX-102 SL to placebo (1:1 ratio), in which study medication is administered sublingually once daily at bedtime for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the AFFIRM trial is the FDA-agreed upon 30% pain responder analysis. We expect to report top line results from the AFFIRM trial in the third quarter of 2016.

&#160;

Long-Term Safety Exposure Study 

&#160;

In August 2015, we completed Study F203, a 12-month open-label extension study of TNX-102 SL in patients who had completed the BESTFIT study. The goal of Study F203 was to obtain the prerequisite long-term safety exposure data to support a New Drug Application, or NDA, filing for TNX-102 SL for the management of FM, a chronic medical condition. We believe that we have sufficient long-term exposure data from F203 to support an NDA filing for TNX-102 SL.

&#160;

Bioequivalence Pharmacokinetic Study (F105) 

&#160;

We have completed the clinical phase of a Phase 1 bioequivalence pharmacokinetic study (F105) that compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of single-doses of TNX-102 SL, 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at two facilities: the facility used to produce study medication for our Phase 2b BESTFIT study and the facility used to produce study medication for our ongoing Phase 3 AFFIRM study and the to-be-marketed product. The study demonstrated that the TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg tablets manufactured at the two different facilities are bioequivalent. 

&#160;

Prospective Phase 3 &#8220;REAFFIRM&#8221; Study 

&#160;

In the second quarter of 2016, we plan to commence the REAFFIRM trial, a second randomized, double-blind Phase 3 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL, to support product registration. We currently expect that the size and design of the REAFFIRM trial will be similar to that of the AFFIRM trial.

&#160; 

Open-label Extension Study for AFFIRM and REAFFIRM 

&#160;

Patients who successfully complete the AFFIRM or REAFFIRM studies are or will be eligible to enroll into the three-month open label extension study, or Study F303. Study F303 is designed to capture additional safety and efficacy information after the patients completed the three month double-blind randomized treatment.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Prospective Multi-dose Pharmacokinetic Study 

&#160;

Since TNX-102 SL will be submitted as a 505(b)(2) NDA using CBP 5 mg IR tablets as our reference product, we plan to study TNX-102 SL, 2.8 mg in comparison to CBP 5 mg IR tablets in a multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study. The results of this study will provide information regarding blood levels of CBP at steady state after repeated dosing of CBP 5 mg IR tablet and TNX-102 SL. We expect the data from this study to serve as a &#8216;bridge&#8217; to enable us to use the reference product labeling information to support the TNX-102 SL NDA.

&#160;

Nonclinical Development 

&#160;

In addition to the clinical studies necessary to support the TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA filing for the management of fibromyalgia, we proposed, and the FDA has accepted, our nonclinical data package to support the NDA filing, as the NDA requires nonclinical information that is not completely available in the reference product labeling. In 2014, we completed dose-ranging studies to identify the doses for the chronic toxicity studies requested by the FDA to augment the nonclinical information in the CBP labeling which will be used to support the TNX-102 SL labeling for long-term use. In January 2015, we engaged an FDA-certified Good Laboratory Practices laboratory to conduct a six-month repeated-dose toxicology study of TNX-102 in rats and a nine-month repeated-dose toxicology study in dogs required for the NDA filing and to support Phase 3 clinical studies outside the U.S. The in-life portion of these studies has been completed and reports are being prepared. Based on the prescribing information of AMRIX and FLEXERIL (discontinued since May 2013) and the post-marketing surveillance information, there is no evidence of abuse for CBP. As a result, the FDA has advised that we will not have to assess the abuse potential of TNX-102 SL for the TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA submission.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

The TNX-102 SL drug product manufactured for our Phase 2b BESTFIT study was manufactured in a small-scale current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, facility that is licensed to manufacture clinical trial materials, but not equipped for large-scale commercial production. For Phase 3 trials and for the commercial product, we have engaged a commercial cGMP facility that is capable of manufacturing the registration batches to support the NDA. The product&#8217;s comparability is supported by the bioequivalence results of the single-dose pharmacokinetic study (F105).

&#160;

Other NDA Requirements 

&#160;

We have an Agreed Initial Pediatric Study Plan, or iPSP, with the FDA. The iPSP contains (i) an agreement whereby we will submit a protocol to conduct a single dose, open-label pharmacokinetic study in adolescent patients (13-17 years of age) with fibromyalgia before our NDA filing and (ii) a partial waiver of the requirement to submit pediatric assessments of TNX-102 SL per Section 505B(a)(4)(A)(i) of the FDCA. A Final Pediatric Study Plan requirement will be determined at the time of the NDA approval.

&#160;

Based our discussions with the FDA and the FDA official meeting minutes, we will not have to conduct special populations (geriatric and renal/hepatic impaired), drug-drug interaction or cardiovascular safety studies to support the NDA filing. Due to the well-established safety profile of CBP at much higher doses than we proposed for FM, the FDA has not requested a risk management plan or medication guide for this product.

&#160;

Regulatory Strategy 

&#160;

We expect to register TNX-102 SL with the FDA through the provisions of Section 505(b)(2). This regulatory pathway may help to accelerate product development and reduce overall business risk. The 505(b)(2)-based product development plan for TNX-102 SL is designed to leverage the safety data that have been generated by other manufacturers for CBP-containing products and accepted by the FDA in support of their product registrations, in addition to the safety data we generate. TNX-102 SL contains significantly less CBP than other marketed products that contain CBP. We believe that the nonclinical safety data package from these products, together with their marketing experience, will provide an adequate safety margin to support TNX-102 SL development and marketing application for FM.

&#160;

If NDA approval of TNX-102 SL is granted, in addition to the three-year marketing exclusivity provided by law, we expect this product to be protected by patents that extend through at least 2021, during which time it should not be subject to generic substitution. We plan to continue to support the TNX-102 SL program with new patent applications as we obtain data from the clinical evaluation of our new formulation in healthy human subjects and in FM patients. For example, we have recently filed patent applications on TNX-102 SL which, if issued, would be expected to provide protection from generic substitution until at least 2033.

&#160; 

TNX-102 SL &#8211; Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Program 

&#160;

We are developing TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD under a separate IND, cleared by the FDA in June 2014, and we are currently conducting our AtEase trial, a Phase 2 clinical trial of TNX-102 SL in military-related PTSD. Patients who successfully complete the AtEase study are eligible to enroll into a three-month open-label extension study (P202).

&#160;

Parallels between Fibromyalgia and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder 

&#160;

The clinical presentations of FM and PTSD share a number of similarities and clinical overlap. For example, in a survey of males with PTSD or major depression, 49% of PTSD patients met the American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM compared to 5% of major depression patients (Amital et al, J Psychosom Res 2006;61:663-669). Conversely, in a different survey of FM patients, 57% of the patients had symptoms associated with PTSD (Cohen et al, Semin Arthritis Rheum 2002;32:38-50).

&#160;

As with FM, a core feature of PTSD is sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbances are believed to exacerbate daytime symptoms of PTSD, including irritability, poor concentration, and diminished interest in significant activities. The sleep disturbances of PTSD, which include nightmares and night terrors, may be more pronounced than those typically experienced by FM patients.

&#160;

Development Rationale 

&#160; 

Our rationale for developing TNX-102 SL for treatment of PTSD is supported by the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Results from our BESTFIT study, which showed that treatment with TNX-102 SL resulted in: 1) an observed statistically significant improvement of FM, a separate but related central nervous system disorder having significant overlap with PTSD (Chrousos, 2009); 2) an observed statistically significant improvement in sleep quality in FM, which is similarly impaired in PTSD and central to the neuropathology (Germain, 2013); and 3) statistically significant improvements in anxiety and sensory sensitivity, symptoms that are of particular relevance to PTSD. &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; In research from peer-reviewed scientific publications, we have identified a number of compounds that are antagonists of the serotonin 2A and/or alpha-1 adrenergic receptors that have been shown to have beneficial effects in treating PTSD. Therefore, it is our belief that TNX-102 SL, a serotonin 2A and alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist, will have a therapeutic effect in treating PTSD. &#160; 

Clinical Development Plan 

&#160;

Phase 2 &#8220;AtEase&#8221; Study 

&#160;

In the first quarter of 2015, we commenced the AtEase trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week Phase 2 trial of TNX-102 SL in approximately 240 patients with military-related PTSD. In the AtEase study, patients are randomized in a 2:1:2 ratio to TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg, TNX-102 SL 5.6 mg, or placebo, respectively, sublingually once daily at bedtime. This trial is being conducted at approximately 25 U.S. centers. In December 2015, we announced that enrollment in AtEase has completed.

&#160;

The primary objective of the AtEase trial is to evaluate the efficacy of TNX-102 SL 2.8 mg as compared to placebo sublingual tablet following 12 weeks of treatment using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). If the AtEase study achieves success in its primary outcome measure, it could serve as one of the two pivotal studies required to establish sufficient evidence of efficacy and safety to support the approval of TNX-102 SL for PTSD. We expect to report top line results from the AtEase study in the second quarter of 2016.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

The TNX-102 SL drug product manufactured for our Phase 2 AtEase trial was manufactured in a small-scale cGMP facility that is licensed to manufacture clinical trial materials, but not equipped for large-scale commercial production. For Phase 3 trials and for the commercial product, we have engaged a commercial cGMP facility that is capable of manufacturing the registration batches to support the NDA. The product&#8217;s comparability is supported by the bioequivalence results of single-dose pharmacokinetic study (F105). An End-of-Phase 2 Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Meeting has been held in February 2016 to discuss the quality data requirement for the NDA filing. As of the date of this filing, we have not received the FDA official minutes from the meeting.

&#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Regulatory Strategy 

&#160;

We expect to register TNX-102 SL in PTSD with the FDA through the provisions of Section 505(b)(2). The FDA approvals of paroxetine and sertraline for treating PTSD established a regulatory approval pathway for symptom reduction in PTSD. Based on our communications with the FDA to date, we believe that positive results from two adequate, well-controlled efficacy and safety studies and long-term (six- and 12-month) safety exposure studies (F203 and P202) would support FDA approval of TNX-102 SL for the management of PTSD.

&#160;

We plan to meet with the FDA after we complete the AtEase study to further discuss our development plan for TNX-102 SL for PTSD, including the proposed design of the registration program that would be required to support approval of an NDA for this indication. If we achieve our primary outcome measure in the AtEase study, it could qualify as one of the two studies required to support the NDA. We expect that we can use the long-term safety exposure data generated by our clinical development of TNX-102 SL in FM (F203) to supplement the long-term safety exposure data required for the PTSD NDA.

&#160;

If the results from the AtEase study are positive, we plan to seek Fast Track Development and/or Breakthrough Therapy designation for TNX-102 SL in PTSD. The Breakthrough Therapy designation process is a relatively new and uncertain process for drugs intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition, the preliminary clinical evidence of which indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies, in which the majority of requests for designation have been denied.

&#160;

TNX-201 &#8211; Episodic Tension-type Headache Program 

&#160;

We were developing TNX-201 for the treatment of episodic tension-type headache under an IND cleared by the FDA in October 2014. ETTH is the most common type of headache, estimated to account for over 60% of headaches. In the second quarter of 2015, we initiated a single-dose Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial to evaluate the ability of TNX-201 140 mg to improve headache pain as well as its tolerability in patients with ETTH. This trial was conducted at approximately 10 U.S. centers and randomized approximately 150 patients to receive TNX-201 140 mg or placebo capsules. This trial assessed efficacy following a dose of study medication according to a variety of measures at several time points, including the difference between the two study arms in the number of subjects who report complete relief from their headache pain at two hours. This study was designed to test the activity and tolerability of TNX-201 to support possible future efficacy and safety studies. We reported top line results from this study on February 16, 2016. Since TNX-201 failed to show any efficacy, we abandoned development of TNX-201.

&#160;

Additional Product Candidates 

&#160;

We also have a pipeline of other product candidates, including TNX-301. TNX-301 is a fixed dose combination drug product, or CDP, containing two FDA-approved drugs, disulfiram and selegiline. We intend to develop TNX-301 CDP under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA as a potential treatment for AUD, and we have commenced development work on TNX-301 formulations. We held a Pre-IND Meeting with the FDA in February 2016 to discuss the clinical development of TNX-301 for AUD. As of the date of this filing, we have not received the FDA official minutes from the meeting.

&#160;

In addition, we own rights to intellectual property on two biodefense technologies: one relating to the development of novel smallpox vaccines; and the other to the development of protective agents against radiation exposure. We have begun non-clinical research and development on these programs. The FDA Animal Efficacy Rule provides a mechanism for product licensure when human efficacy studies are not feasible or ethical. As a result, the licensure of these biodefense products in the U.S. may not require human efficacy studies, which we believe will reduce our development costs and risks compared to the development of other NCEs or new biologic candidates.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. We believe that key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety, tolerability, reliability, price and reimbursement level. Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors&#8217; drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Further, the development of new treatment methods for the conditions we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete.

&#160;

The markets for medicines to treat FM, PTSD and other CNS conditions are well developed and populated with established drugs marketed by large and small pharmaceutical, biotechnology and generic drug companies. Eli Lilly (Cymbalta), Forest Laboratories (Savella), and Pfizer (Lyrica) market FDA approved drugs for FM. Cymbalta lost its U.S. patent exclusivity in December 2013. GlaxoSmithKline (Paxil) and Pfizer (Zoloft) market FDA approved drugs for PTSD. Paxil and Zoloft lost their U.S. patent exclusivities in 2003 and 2006, respectively.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A number of companies are developing prescription medications for FM, including Allergan, Daiichi Sankyo, Meda, Merck, Pfizer, RiboCor and Theravance. Clinical trials in the U.S. are registered with the FDA and reported on the website www.clinicaltrials.gov. Medications that are used off-label for the treatment of FM include gabapentin; anti-depressants, such as amitriptyline, venlafaxine, and trazodone; muscle relaxants, such as cyclobenzaprine; tramadol; opioids; and benzodiazepine, as well as non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics.

&#160;

A number of companies are developing prescription medications for PTSD, including Actavis, Bionomics, Johnson and Johnson, Lundbeck, Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Merck, Otsuka, and Pfizer. Medications that are used off-label for the treatment of PTSD include anti-depressants, such as nefazodone and trazodone; the antihistamine cyproheptadine; and certain atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine and risperidone.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We believe that we have an extensive patent portfolio and substantial know-how relating to TNX-102 SL and our other product candidates. Our patent portfolio, described more fully below, includes claims directed to TNX-102 SL compositions and methods of use. As of March 1, 2016, we are either the owner of record of or own the contractual right to five issued U.S. patents and 26 issued non-U.S. patents. We are actively pursuing an additional 17 U.S. patent applications, of which six are provisional and 11 are non-provisional, five international patent applications, and 70 non-U.S./non-international patent applications.

&#160;

We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including our proprietary technology platform, our product candidates, and our processes. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our products, their methods of use and processes of manufacture, and any other technology to which we have rights, where available and when appropriate. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business.

&#160;

Our success will depend on 1) the ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights in commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, 2) the validity and enforceability of our patents, 3) the continued confidentiality of our trade secrets, and 4) our ability to operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

&#160;

We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be certain that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221;

&#160;

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the first non-provisional priority application. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent.

&#160;

The term of a U.S. patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the statutory 20-year term of the patent for the approved product if the active ingredient has not been previously approved in the U.S. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and some other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application, or NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.

&#160;

The patent portfolios for our proprietary technology platform and our three most advanced product candidates as of March 1, 2016 are summarized below.

&#160;

&#160;

Biodefense Technology 

&#160;

We own the rights to develop a potential biodefense technology, which is a new vaccine candidate against smallpox. With respect to the smallpox vaccine candidate, we own U.S. non-provisional Patent Application No. 14,207,727 and related intellectual property rights. The smallpox vaccine technology relates to proprietary forms of live vaccinia vaccines which may be safer than ACAM2000, the only currently available replication competent, live vaccinia vaccine to protect against smallpox disease. We believe that this technology, after further development, may be of interest to biodefense agencies in the U.S. and other countries.

&#160; 

Trade Secrets 

&#160;

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to rights in related or resulting inventions and know-how.

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160;

We have approximately 15 employees dedicated to research and development. We anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase several fold as we continue our late-stage clinical development of TNX-102 SL and advance other candidates in our pipeline. We need to raise additional capital to fund our development plans and there is no certainty that we will be successful in continuing to attract new investments. Our research and development operations are located in New York, NY, San Diego, CA, San Jose, CA, Dublin, Ireland and Montreal, Canada. We have used, and expect to continue to use, third parties to conduct our nonclinical and clinical studies.

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We have contracted with third-party cGMP-compliant contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of TNX-102 SL drug substances and drug products for investigational purposes, including nonclinical and clinical testing. For TNX-102 SL, we have engaged a cGMP facility for manufacturing of to-be-marketed product for Phase 3 clinical and commercial. Our manufacturing operations are managed and controlled in Dublin, Ireland.

&#160;

All of our compounds are small molecules, synthesized using industry standard processes, and our drug products are formulated using commercially available pharmaceutical grade excipients.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The FDA and other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory agencies impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, approval, labeling, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drug products. These agencies regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our product candidates. The regulatory approval process is generally lengthy and expensive, with no guarantee of a positive result. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunctive relief including partial or total suspension of production, or withdrawal of a product from the market.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, manufacture, promotion and distribution of dr ugs in the United States under the FDCA and other statutes and implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before prescription drug product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practice regulations; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s regulations, including Good Clinical Practices, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; submission to the FDA of an NDA for drug products, or a Biologics Drug Application, or BLA, for biologic products; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; satisfactory completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug. &#160; 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

&#160; 

Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and other animal studies. The results of nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after an IND is submitted. The IND also includes one or more protocols for the initial clinical trial or trials and an investigator&#8217;s brochure. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions relating to the proposed clinical trials as outlined in the IND and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such cases, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before any clinical trials can begin. Clinical trial holds also may be imposed at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements. An independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each of the clinical centers proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the consent form signed by the trial participants and must monitor the study until completed. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified medical investigators according to approved protocols that detail the objectives of the study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor participant safety. Each protocol for a U.S. study is submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

&#160; 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap, or be combined. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into healthy human volunteers. In Phase 1 clinical trials, the product candidate is typically tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and pharmacodynamics. &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Phase 2 clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the product candidate for specific, targeted indications; to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 2 clinical trials, in particular Phase 2b trials, can be undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. The size of Phase 3 clinical trials depends upon clinical and statistical considerations for the product candidate and disease, but sometimes can include several thousand patients. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. &#160; 

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. 

&#160;

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Clinical testing must satisfy extensive FDA regulations. Reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted for serious and unexpected adverse events. Success in early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later-stage clinical trials. The FDA, an IRB or we may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

&#160; 

New Drug Applications 

&#160;

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical trials, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. An NDA also must contain extensive manufacturing information, as well as proposed labeling for the finished product. An NDA applicant must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in accordance with cGMP. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality product within specifications approved by the FDA. The manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the final product. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. Prior to approval, the FDA will conduct an inspection of the manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP.

&#160;

The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information and is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After an application is filed, the FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers them carefully when making decisions. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA may issue a complete response letter, which may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require us to conduct Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety or efficacy questions are raised after the product reaches the market.

&#160;

Section 505(b) NDAs 

&#160;

There are two types of NDAs: the Section 505(b)(1) NDA, or full NDA, and the Section 505(b)(2) NDA. We intend to file Section 505(b)(2) NDAs for TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD, and for certain other products, that might, if accepted by the FDA, save time and expense in the development and testing of our product candidates. We may need to file a Section 505(b)(1) NDA for certain other products in the future. A full NDA is submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, and must contain full reports of investigations conducted by the applicant to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the drug. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for a drug for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant was not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has no right of reference from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. A Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted based in whole or in part on published literature or on the FDA&#8217;s finding of safety and efficacy of one or more previously approved drugs, which are known as reference drugs. Thus, the filing of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may result in approval of a drug based on fewer clinical or nonclinical studies than would be required under a full NDA. The number and size of studies that need to be conducted by the sponsor depends on the amount and quality of data pertaining to the reference drug that are publicly available, and on the similarity of and differences between the applicant&#8217;s drug and the reference drug. In some cases, extensive, time-consuming, and costly clinical and nonclinical studies may still be required for approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA.

&#160;

Our drug approval strategy for our new formulations of approved chemical entities is to submit Section 505(b)(2) NDAs to the FDA. As such, we plan to submit NDAs under Section 505(b)(2) for TNX-102 SL for FM and PTSD. The FDA may not agree that this product candidate is approvable for FM or PTSD as Section 505(b)(2) NDAs. If the FDA determines that Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are not appropriate and that full NDAs are required for TNX-102 SL, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for TNX-102 SL could substantially and materially increase, and TNX-102 SL might be less likely to be approved. If the FDA requires full NDAs for TNX-102 SL, or requires more extensive testing and development for some other reason, our ability to compete with alternative products that arrive on the market more quickly than our product candidates would be adversely impacted. If CBP-containing products are withdrawn from the market by the FDA for any reason, we may not be able to reference such products to support our anticipated TNX-102 SL 505(b)(2) NDA, and we may be required to follow the requirements of Section 505(b)(1).

&#160;

&#160; 18 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Patent Protections 

&#160;

An applicant submitting a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must certify to the FDA with respect to the patent status of the reference drug upon which the applicant relies in support of approval of its drug. With respect to every patent listed in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book, which is the FDA&#8217;s list of approved drug products, as claiming the reference drug or an approved method of use of the reference drug, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) there is no patent information listed in the orange book for the reference drug; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date; (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the product in the Section 505(b)(2) NDA; or (5) if the patent is a use patent, that the applicant does not seek approval for a use claimed by the patent. If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (1), (2) or (5), FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may be made effective immediately upon successful FDA review of the application, in the absence of marketing exclusivity delays, which are discussed below. If the applicant files a certification to the effect of clause (3), the Section 505(b)(2) NDA approval may not be made effective until the expiration of the relevant patent and the expiration of any marketing exclusivity delays.

&#160;

If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant provides a certification to the effect of clause (4), referred to as a paragraph IV certification, the applicant also must send notice of the certification to the patent owner and the holder of the NDA for the reference drug. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the notification may prevent the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA for 30 months from the date of the receipt of the notification unless the court determines that a longer or shorter period is appropriate because either party to the action failed to reasonably cooperate in expediting the action. However, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA before the 30 months have expired if a court decides that the patent is invalid or not infringed, or if a court enters a settlement order or consent decree stating the patent is invalid or not infringed.

&#160;

Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years certain brand-name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA&#8217;s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA&#8217;s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged in court, the FDA may be required to change its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and it is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of the new product. Moreover, even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition.

&#160; 

Marketing Exclusivity 

&#160;

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, thereby delaying a Section 505(b)(2) product from entering the market. The FDCA provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for an NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety. This exclusivity prohibits the submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for any drug product containing the active ingredient during the five-year exclusivity period. However, submission of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA that certifies that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed, as discussed above, is permitted after four years, but if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA may automatically be stayed until 7&#189; years after the NCE approval date. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes, including, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug, or for a new use, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of another full NDA; however, as discussed above, an applicant submitting a full NDA under Section 505(b)(1) would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

&#160;

Other types of exclusivity in the United States include orphan drug exclusivity and pediatric exclusivity. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation. Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a study.

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are similar to full NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(1) in that they are entitled to any of these forms of exclusivity if they meet the qualifying criteria. They also are entitled to the patent protections described above, based on patents that are listed in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book in the same manner as patents claiming drugs and uses approved for NDAs submitted as full NDAs.

&#160; 

Breakthrough Therapy Designation 

&#160; 

On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, was signed. FDASIA Section 902 provides for a new drug designation &#8211;Breakthrough Therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy is a drug: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition; and &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. &#160; 

If a drug is designated as Breakthrough Therapy, the FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug. In the event that our AtEase study of TNX-102 SL in PTSD is successful, we will request Breakthrough Therapy designation for TNX-102 SL. The Breakthrough Therapy designation process is relatively new, and the majority of requests for designation have been denied. We cannot predict the likelihood of success in seeking Breakthrough Therapy designation. 

&#160; 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and after approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs. In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and the effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized. Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; record-keeping requirements; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; reporting of adverse experiences with the drug; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; reporting on advertisements and promotional labeling; &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; drug sampling and distribution requirements; and &#160; 

&#160; &#8226; complying with electronic record and signature requirements. &#160; 

In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals as well as consumers, including to industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.

&#160;

The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions, restitution and disgorgement of profits, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications, and criminal prosecution resulting in fines and incarceration. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.

Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 

&#160;

In September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007, or FDAAA, became law. This legislation grants significant new powers to the FDA, many of which are aimed at improving drug safety and assuring the safety of drug products after approval. In particular, the new law authorizes the FDA to, among other things, require post-approval studies and clinical trials, mandate changes to drug labeling to reflect new safety information, and require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies for certain drugs, including certain currently approved drugs. In addition, the new law significantly expands the federal government&#8217;s clinical trial registry and results databank and creates new restrictions on the advertising and promotion of drug products. Under the FDAAA, companies that violate these and other provisions of the new law are subject to substantial civil monetary penalties.

&#160; 

The FDA has not yet implemented many of the provisions of the FDAAA, so we cannot predict the impact of the new legislation on the pharmaceutical industry or our business. However, the requirements and changes imposed by the FDAAA may make it more difficult, and more costly, to obtain and maintain approval for new pharmaceutical products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products. In addition, the FDA&#8217;s regulations, policies and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
