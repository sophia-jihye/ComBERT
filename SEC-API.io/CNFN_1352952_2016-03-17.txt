Overview 

&#160; 

We own and operate CAKE and getcake.com, a marketing technology that provides a comprehensive suite of innovative marketing intelligence tools. Our powerful software-as-a service, or SaaS, is an enterprise solution that has been an industry standard for advertisers, networks, publishers and agencies to measurably improve and optimize digital spend. We currently have over 500 customers driving billions of consumer actions monthly through the CAKE enterprise platform. 

&#160; 

On September 30, 2014, we announced a new product offering purpose built for brand advertisers to unify the tracking, attribution and optimization of digital marketing spend across search, display, email, video, social, affiliate and other marketing channels. CAKE for Advertisers allows brands to move beyond the confines of siloed data to track, attribute and optimize digital marketing campaigns in real-time. In 2015, the product was enhanced to include machine learning, multi-touch attribution capabilities. These new capabilities enhance our existing rules-driven attribution to programmatically allow marketers to analyze complex customer journeys; enabling planning and marketing course correction decisions to drive better return on investment of advertising spend. 

&#160; 

The CAKE SaaS proprietary marketing platform is used by some of the world&#8217;s leading companies and largest customer-base of enterprise performance marketing networks and advertisers. CAKE&#8217;s solutions are based on reliable, feature rich technology and are bolstered by the industry&#8217;s leading customer service and top tier technology partners-assuring the highest level of uptime. 

&#160; 

On January 5, 2016, Gartner, Inc. updated its coverage of us and once again named us as a Vendor to Watch in its &#8220;Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs&#8221; report. This research is intended for chief marketing officers (CMOs), chief marketing technologists and other digital marketing leaders involved in the selection of core systems to support digital marketing business requirements. According to Gartner, we have hub-like real-time multichannel data management and onboarding capabilities. CAKE is for enterprise performance marketers looking to optimize lead generation and customer acquisition through affiliate and direct marketing channels. 

&#160; 

Our revenue model is based on a monthly license fee, a usage fee (based on volume of clicks, impressions, or leads), a training and implementation fee, and in certain cases, professional services fees and royalties. Clients purchase annual or monthly subscriptions with an additional usage fee. A majority of our revenue is derived from clients in the United States but we have seen a 16% year on year growth in our client base outside of the United States. During November 2012, we formed Cake Marketing UK Ltd, or the Subsidiary, a private limited company, which is our wholly-owned subsidiary located in the United Kingdom in order to better provide our services in the European market. 

&#160; 

Our business is currently headquartered in Newport Beach, California, with operations in Santa Monica, California, and London, England, allowing us to provide global support to our client base. The CAKE platform supports multiple languages and currencies so online marketers can track the performance of their marketing campaigns and better target their digital spend on a global scale. 

&#160; 

Our training, support personnel, hosting and cloud-based infrastructure contribute to our cost of operating the business. We anticipate more spending in these areas while we continue to grow, and we can foresee some savings in infrastructure cost due to economies of scale. In addition, development resources were required to continue to enhance the products. Those resources were used to extend our software platform and to create specific integrations to third party technologies that include, but are not limited to, Google AdWords, Bing Ads, YouTube, Facebook, DoubleClick and Marketo. 

&#160; 

We intend to continue to grow revenues by investing in sales, marketing, and product development and innovation. We allocated a portion of our marketing budget to being present at tradeshows, writing for and participating in industry publications, and providing the support documentation required by sales initiatives. Additional efforts will be made to speak at industry events and write for online publications, increasing awareness of the CAKE suite of products and the thought leadership driving product development.

Industry and Market Opportunity 

&#160;

&#9679; 

International Data Corporation, or IDC, cloud research predicted that spending on public IT cloud services would reach $47.4 billion in 2013 and is expected to be more than $107 billion in 2017. Over the 2013&#8211;2017 forecast period, IDC believes public IT cloud services will have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.5%, five times that of the industry overall. 

&#9679; 

IDC predicts that by 2016, $1 out of every $5 spent on software will be spent on cloud-based software. 

&#9679; 

The mobile SaaS market is expected to grow to $16.6 billion by 2016, with a compound annual growth rate of 29.5%, according to Strategy Analytics. 

&#9679; 

Global spending on advertising is expected to grow from $480 billion in 2012 to $619 billion in 2017, according to Magna Global. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Additional Characteristics 

&#160; 

Managing online marketing campaigns is still a costly proposition. CPMs (cost per thousand impressions) tend to be slightly higher than other traditional media. Accordingly, customer acquisition costs can easily become astronomical, if left unchecked. Risks associated with customer acquisition costs are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Anonymity of customer base : It is extremely difficult to identify the demographics, geographics, and psychographics of online users, even with existing search tools, which may leave paid leads unutilized; 

&#9679; 

Fraudulent procurement or creation of customer leads : Some publishers provide fraudulent data to advertisers to increase their revenue, which artificially increases customer acquisition costs without increasing revenues; 

&#9679; 

Performance of online marketing programs is poorly measured and not automated: For example, campaign costs based on clicks and conversions are measured at the campaign period without any controls. Additionally, there is no immediate feedback on determining which banners are more effective than others; and 

&#9679; 

Information about online campaigns between advertisers and affiliates is not automated, which may lead to inefficient relationships: Advertisers rely largely on affiliates to acquire customers. However, advertisers are unable to provide timely information about their campaigns to affiliates and advertisers do not receive timely information about each affiliate&#8217;s productivity per campaign. 

&#160; 

The business environment for our SaaS platform is characterized as follows: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Larger advertisers are evaluating mission-critical software, such as ours, to manage their online performance-based initiatives. Such companies are factoring whether it is more beneficial to them to either develop their own technology or license it from third-parties, such as us; 

&#9679; 

As the online performance-based market grows, there are new entrants as solution providers, who are competing mostly on price and less on richness of features and performance tools; 

&#9679; 

We believe that our existing and potential customer base continues to look for more measurable results in their online performance-based growth; and 

&#9679; 

We believe there are opportunities to increase our number of clients globally where companies are adopting and implementing online performance-based initiatives. 

&#160; 

Our Solutions 

&#160; 

We believe that our business depends upon the continuing increase of consumer and business use of the Internet and mobile devices as primary tools to facilitate research, communications and transactions.

&#9679;

&#160; 

We use our internal sales force to market CAKE to online marketers. Additionally we market our software through www.getcake.com, and by attending industry trade shows and events. Our clients utilize our software to provide performance-based marketing services to corporations worldwide. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our employees are required to execute confidentiality and non-use agreements that transfer any rights they may have in copyrightable works or patentable technologies to us. In addition, prior to entering into discussions with potential business partners or customers regarding our business and technologies, we generally require that such parties enter into nondisclosure agreements with us. If these discussions result in a license or other business relationship, we also generally require that the agreement setting forth the parties&#8217; respective rights and obligations include provisions for the protection of our intellectual property rights. For example, the standard language in our agreements provides that we retain ownership of all patents and copyrights in our technologies and requires our customers to display our copyright and trademark notices. As of December 31, 2015, we do not have any registered or pending patents or trademarks, except for a Service Mark (Reg. No. 4,225,522) issued on October 16, 2012 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office which consists of geometric shapes arranged to resemble a multi-layered slice of cake. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

CAKE&#39;s products have specific competitors in each of the channels that we track and support. Competitors in the affiliate tracking industry include TUNE/HasOffers and HitPath. Impact Radius is a privately-held company with a performance and direct response advertising platform focused on retail tracking. Competitors in the mobile tracking sector include TUNE/Mobile App Tracking. 

&#160; 

Competitors for CAKE for Advertisers are specific to the product&#8217;s functionality. For attribution, our competitors include Google/Adometry, AOL/Convertro and VisualIQ. For analytics and data visualization competitors include Oragami Logic and Becken. For advertisers that advertise within an affiliate channel, but that want direct relationships with their publishers, Conversant (acquired by ADS) and Rakuten offer service-based solutions, but do not provide software. 

&#160; 

Our SaaS competitors have significantly greater capital, technology, resources, and brand recognition than we do. We differentiate from our competition by providing an enterprise suite of SaaS, cloud-based marketing intelligence solutions. Most competitors have single channel solutions or have a services model. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Although there are currently relatively few laws and regulations directly applicable to our software and the Internet, it is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and elsewhere. The adoption of restrictive laws or regulations could slow or otherwise affect Internet growth and the development or usage of our software. The application of existing laws and regulations governing Internet and software issues such as property ownership, libel and personal privacy is also subject to substantial uncertainty. There can be no assurance that current or new government laws and regulations, or the application of existing laws and regulations (including laws and regulations governing issues such as property ownership, taxation, defamation and personal injury) will not expose us to significant liabilities, slow Internet growth and the development or usage of our software or otherwise hurt us financially. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

During 2015 and 2014, we incurred research and development expenses of approximately $4,630,000 and $2,485,000, respectively, in order to further enhance our CAKE software. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 94 full-time employees, including all of our executive officers. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relationships with our employees to be good.
