 Item 1. Business 

The Company 

&#160; 

Griffon Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Griffon&#8221;) is a diversified management and holding company that conducts business through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Griffon oversees the operations of its subsidiaries, allocates resources among them and manages their capital structures. Griffon provides direction and assistance to its subsidiaries in connection with acquisition and growth opportunities as well as in connection with divestitures. In order to further diversify, Griffon also seeks out, evaluates and, when appropriate, will acquire additional businesses that offer potentially attractive returns on capital. 

&#160; 

Headquartered in New York, N.Y., the Company was founded in 1959 and is incorporated in Delaware. Griffon is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol GFF. 

&#160; 

Griffon currently conducts its operations through three reportable segments: 

&#8226; 

Home &#38; Building Products ("HBP") consists of two companies, The AMES Companies, Inc. (&#8220;AMES&#8221;) and Clopay Building Products Company, Inc. (&#8220;CBP&#8221;). HBP revenue accounted for 53% &#32;of Griffon&#8217;s consolidated revenue in 2016 &#32;and 2015 &#32;and 49% &#32;in 2014 : 

&#9702; 

AMES, founded in 1774, is the leading U.S. manufacturer and a global provider of long-handled tools and landscaping products for homeowners and professionals. AMES&#8217; revenue was 26% &#32;of Griffon&#8217;s consolidated revenue in 2016 , 27% &#32;in 2015 &#32;and 25% &#32;in 2014 . 

&#9702; 

CBP, in business since 1964, is a leading manufacturer and marketer of residential and commercial garage doors and sells to professional dealers and some of the largest home center retail chains in North America. CBP&#8217;s revenue was 27% , 26% &#32;and 24% &#32;of Griffon&#8217;s consolidated revenue in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

&#8226; 

Telephonics Corporation ("Telephonics"), founded in 1933, is recognized globally as a leading provider of highly sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and communications solutions for defense, aerospace and commercial customers. Telephonics&#8217; revenue was 22% &#32;of Griffon&#8217;s consolidated revenue in 2016 &#32;and 21% &#32;in both 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

&#8226; 

Clopay Plastic Products Company, Inc. ("PPC"), incorporated in 1934, is a global leader in the development and production of embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films for hygienic, health-care and industrial products and sells to some of the world's largest consumer products companies. PPC revenue was 25% , 26% &#32;and 30% of Griffon&#8217;s consolidated revenue in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

We are focused on acquiring, owning and operating businesses in a variety of industries. We are long-term investors that have substantial experience in a variety of industries. Our intent is to continue the growth of our existing segments and diversify further through investments and acquisitions. 

As a result of the decline in the U.S. housing market, in May 2008, we announced the divestiture of our Installation Services business, which was consummated by September 2008. In September 2008, Griffon strengthened its balance sheet by raising $248,600 in equity through a common stock rights offering and a related investment by GS Direct L.L.C., an affiliate of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Since that time, Griffon has continued to refine and enhance the strategic direction and operating performance of its companies, while strengthening its balance sheet. During this period, Griffon has grown revenue and earnings through organic growth, cost containment and acquisitions, while returning capital to its shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. 

On September 30, 2010, Griffon purchased AMES for $542,000 in cash. Subsequently, Griffon acquired three businesses complementary to AMES: the pots and planters business of Southern Sales &#38; Marketing ("Southern Patio"), Northcote Pottery ("Northcote") and the Australian Garden and Tools division of Illinois Tool Works, Inc. ("Cyclone"). 

On October 17, 2011, AMES acquired Southern Patio for approximately $23,000. Southern Patio, is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of landscape accessories. 

In January 2013, AMES announced its intention to close certain U.S. manufacturing facilities and consolidate affected operations primarily into its Camp Hill and Carlisle, PA locations. These actions, which were completed at the end of the first quarter of 2015, improved manufacturing and distribution efficiencies, allowed for in-sourcing of certain production previously performed by third party suppliers, and improved material flow and absorption of fixed costs. Management continues to estimate that AMES' initiative resulted in annualized cash savings exceeding $10,000. Realization of savings began in the 2015 second quarter. 

On December 31, 2013, AMES acquired Northcote, founded in 1897 and a leading brand in the Australian outdoor planter and decor market, for approximately $22,000. 

&#160; 

On May 21, 2014, AMES acquired Cyclone for approximately $40,000. Cyclone offers a full range of quality garden and hand tool products sold under various leading brand names including Cyclone&#174;, Nylex&#174; and Trojan&#174;, designed to meet the requirements of both the Do-it-Yourself and professional trade segments. The Northcote and Cyclone acquisitions complement Southern Patio and add to AMES' existing lawn and garden operations in Australia. 

From August 2011 through September 30, 2016, Griffon repurchased 20,300,298 shares of its common stock, for a total of $259,420 or $12.78 per share. This includes the repurchase of 15,855,854 shares on the open market, as well as the December 10, 2013 repurchase of 4,444,444 shares from GS Direct for $50,000. In each of August 2011, May 2014, March 2015, July 2015, and August 2016, Griffon's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50,000 of Griffon's outstanding common stock. Under these authorizations, the Company may purchase shares in the open market, including pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan, or in privately negotiated transactions. At September 30, 2016, $51,637 &#32;remains under Board repurchase authorizations. 

From October 2008 through September 30, 2016, Griffon's Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP") purchased 4,013,459 shares of Griffon's common stock, for a total of $44,973 or $11.21 per share. At September 30, 2016, the ESOP holds allocated and unallocated shares totaling 5,380,595, or 12% of Griffon's outstanding shares, with a related loan balance of $34,150 , net of issuance costs. Subsequent to September 30, 2016 and through November 11, 2016, Griffon's ESOP purchased 548,912 &#32;shares of common stock for a total of $9,213 &#32;or $16.78 &#32;per share. The remaining amount available on the authorization is $1,695 . 

On November 17, 2011, the Company began declaring quarterly dividends. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company declared and paid dividends per share of $0.20, $0.16 and $0.12, respectively, for a total of $22,725 dividends paid during the period. 

On November 16, 2016, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per share, payable on December 22, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 5, 2016. 

During 2014, Griffon issued $600,000 of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022, the proceeds of which were used to redeem $550,000 of 7.125% senior notes due 2018. On May 18, 2016, the Company completed an add-on offering of $125,000 principal amount of 5.25% Senior Notes due 2022; as of that date, outstanding Senior Notes due 2022 totaled $725,000. 

In January 2016, Griffon launched its new website, www.griffon.com. 

On March 22, 2016, Griffon amended its Revolving Credit Facility to increase borrowing availability from $250,000 to $350,000, extend its maturity date from March 13, 2020 to March 22, 2021 and modify certain other provisions of the facility. 

Griffon also has outstanding $100,000 principal amount of 4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2017, with a current conversion rate of 70.1632 shares of Griffon&#8217;s common stock per $1 principal amount of notes, which corresponds to a conversion price of $14.25 per share. On July 14, 2016, Griffon announced that it will settle, upon conversion, up to $125,000 of the conversion value in cash, with amounts in excess of $125,000, if any, to be settled in shares of Griffon common stock. 

On October 15, 2015, CBP announced plans to expand its manufacturing facility in Troy, Ohio. The expansion reflects increased customer demand for its core products, and its success in bringing new technologies to market. The project includes improvements to its existing one million square foot building, as well as adding 200,000 square feet and new manufacturing equipment. The project is substantially complete. 

During April 2016, PPC announced a Sof-flex&#174; breathable film investment which will expand breathable film capacity in North America, Europe and Brazil, increase our extrusion and print capacity, and enhance our innovation and technology capabilities. We expect the project to be completed in fiscal 2018. This investment will allow PPC to maintain and extend its technological advantage and allow us to differentiate ourselves from competitors, while meeting increasing customer demand for lighter, softer, more cost effective and more environmentally friendly products. 

Griffon makes available, free of charge through its website at www.griffon.com , its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as soon as reasonably practicable after such materials are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;).

Home &#38; Building Products 

&#160; 

Home &#38; Building Products consists of two companies, AMES and CBP, described below. 

&#160; 

AMES 

&#160; 

AMES, founded in 1774, is the leading United States ("U.S.") manufacturer and a global provider of long-handled tools and landscaping products that make work easier for homeowners and professionals. AMES employs approximately 1,700 &#32;employees. 

&#160; 

Brands 

&#160; 

AMES' brands are among the most recognized across primary product categories in the North American and Australian long-handled tools and landscaping product markets. Our brand portfolio includes AMES&#174;, True Temper&#174;, Garant&#174;, UnionTools&#174;, Hound Dog&#174;, Westmix&#8482;, Cyclone&#174;, Southern Patio&#174;, Northcote Pottery&#8482;, Nylex&#174;, Kelso&#8482;, Darby&#8482; and Dynamic Design&#8482;, as well as contractor-oriented brands including Razor-Back&#174; Professional Tools and Jackson&#174; Professional Tools. This strong portfolio of brands enables AMES to build and maintain long-standing relationships with leading retailers and distributors. In addition, given the breadth of its brand portfolio and product category depth, AMES is able to offer specific, differentiated branding strategies for key retail customers. These strategies have focused on enhancement of brand value, with the goal of de-commoditizing AMES products through the introduction of identity and functionality elements that will make each top brand unique, attractive and visually recognizable by the consumer. The visual brand transformation of the AMES&#174; and Razor-Back&#174; brands were completed in 2015 and the True Temper&#174; line roll-out was completed in 2016. In addition to the brands listed, AMES also sells private label branded products further enabling channel management and customer differentiation. 

Products 

&#160; 

AMES manufactures and markets a broad portfolio of long-handled tools and landscaping products. This portfolio is anchored by four core product categories: long handle tools, wheelbarrows, snow tools, and decorative plastic and ceramic pots and planters. As a result of brand portfolio recognition, high product quality, industry leading service and strong customer relationships, AMES has earned market-leading positions in its four core product categories. The following is a brief description of AMES' primary product lines: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Long Handled Tools: &#32;An extensive line of engineered tools including shovels, spades, scoops, rakes, hoes, cultivators, weeders, post hole diggers, scrapers, edgers and forks, marketed under leading brand names including AMES&#174;, True Temper&#174;, UnionTools&#174;, Garant&#174;, Cyclone&#174; and Kelso&#8482;, as well as contractor-oriented brands including Razor-Back&#174; and Jackson&#174;. 

&#8226; 

Wheelbarrows: AMES designs, develops and manufactures a full line of wheelbarrows and lawn carts, primarily under the AMES&#174;, True Temper&#174;, Jackson&#174; Professional Tools, UnionTools&#174;, Garant&#174; and Westmix&#8482; brand names. The products range in size, material (poly and steel), tray form, tire type, handle length and color based on the needs of homeowners, landscapers and contractors. 

&#8226; 

Snow Tools: A complete line of snow tools is marketed under the True Temper&#174;, Garant&#174; and Union Tools&#174; brand names. The snow tool line includes shovels, pushers, roof rakes, sled sleigh shovels, scoops and ice scrapers. 

&#8226; 

Planters and Lawn Accessories: AMES is a designer, manufacturer and distributor of indoor and outdoor planters and accessories, sold under the Southern Patio&#174;, Northcote Pottery&#8482; and Dynamic Design&#8482; brand names, as well as various private label brands. The range of planter sizes (from 6 to 32 inches) is available in various designs, colors and materials. On October 17, 2011, Griffon acquired the Southern Patio&#174; pots and planters business. Southern Patio&#174; is a leading designer and marketer of decorative landscape products. Southern Patio and Dynamic Design have been integrated to leverage Southern Patio&#8217;s capabilities, enhance AMES' product offering in the U.S. pots and planters category and enable AMES to improve its innovation and speed to market in this category. 

&#8226; 

Striking Tools: Axes, picks, mattocks, mauls, wood splitters, sledgehammers, pry bars and repair handles make up the striking tools product line. These products are marketed under the True Temper&#174;, Cyclone&#174;, Garant&#174;, Jackson&#174; Professional Tools and Razor-Back&#174; Professional Tools brand names. 

&#8226; 

Hand Tools: Hammers, screwdrivers, pliers, adjustable wrenches, handsaws, tape measures, levels, clamps, and other traditional long-handled tools make up this product line. These products are marketed under the Trojan&#174;, Cyclone&#174; and Supercraft&#174; brand names. In addition, gardening hand tools, such as trowels, cultivators, weeders and other specialty garden hand tools, are marketed under the AMES&#174; brand name. 

&#8226; 

Pruning: The pruning line is made up of pruners, loppers, shears and other tools sold primarily under the True Temper&#174;, Cyclone&#174; and Garant&#174; brand names. 

&#8226; 

Garden Hose and Storage: AMES offers a wide range of manufactured and sourced garden hoses and hose reels under the AMES&#174;, NeverLeak&#174;, Nylex&#174; and Jackson&#174; Professional Tools brand names. 

Customers 

&#160; 

AMES sells products throughout North America, Australia and Europe through (1) retail centers, including home centers and mass merchandisers, such as The Home Depot, Inc. (&#8220;Home Depot&#8221;), Lowe&#8217;s Companies Inc. (&#8220;Lowe&#8217;s&#8221;), Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ("Walmart"), Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited, Costco Wholesale Corporation, Rona Inc., Bunnings Warehouse ("Bunnings") and Woodies; (2) wholesale chains, including hardware stores and garden centers, such as Ace, Do-It-Best and True Value Company; and (3) industrial distributors, such as W.W. Grainger, Inc. and ORS Nasco. 

&#160; 

Home Depot, Lowe's and Bunnings are significant customers of AMES. The loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the AMES business and on Griffon. 

&#160; 

Product Development 

&#160; 

AMES product development efforts focus on both new products and product line extensions. Products are developed through in-house industrial design and engineering staffs to introduce new products and product line extensions timely and cost effectively. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

AMES' sales organization is structured by distribution channel in the U.S., and by country internationally. In the U.S., a dedicated team of sales professionals is provided for each of the large retail customers. Offices are maintained adjacent to each of the three largest customers&#8217; headquarters, supported by dedicated in-house sales analysts. In addition, sales professionals are assigned to domestic, wholesale and industrial distribution channels. Sales teams located in Canada, Australia and Ireland handle sales in each of their respective regions. In Australia, a dedicated team of sales professionals is provided for the largest retail customer. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

&#160; 

AMES' primary raw material inputs include resin (primarily polypropylene and high density polyethylene), wood (mainly ash, hickory and poplar logs) and steel (hot rolled and cold rolled). In addition, some key materials and components are purchased, such as heavy forged components and wheelbarrow tires; most final assembly is completed internally in order to ensure consistent quality. All raw materials are generally available from a number of sources. 

Competition 

&#160; 

The long-handled tools and landscaping product industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Most competitors consist of small, privately-held companies focusing on a single product category. Some competitors, such as Fiskars Corporation in the hand tool and pruning tool market and Truper Herramientas S.A. de C.U. in the long-handled and garden tool space, compete in various tool categories. Suncast Corporation competes in the hose reel and accessory market, and more recently in the long-handled plastic snow shovel category and Swan Hose competes in the garden hose market. In addition, there is competition from imported or sourced products from China, India and other low-cost producing countries, particularly in long-handled tools, wheelbarrows, planters, striking tools and pruning tools. 

&#160; 

The principal factors by which AMES differentiates itself and provides the best value to customers are innovation, service, quality, and product performance. AMES' size, depth and breadth of product offering, category knowledge, research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) investment, service and its ability to react to sudden changes in demand from seasonal weather patterns, especially during harsh winter months, are competitive advantages. Offshore manufacturers lack sufficient product innovation, capacity, proximity to market and distribution capabilities to service large retailers to compete in highly seasonal, weather related product categories. 

Manufacturing &#38; Distribution 

&#160; 

AMES has two distribution facilities in the U.S., a 1.2 million square foot facility in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and a 400,000 square foot facility in Reno, Nevada. Finished goods are transported to these facilities from its manufacturing sites by both an internal fleet, as well as over the road trucking and rail. Additionally, light assembly is performed at the Carlisle and Reno locations. Distribution centers are also maintained in Canada, Australia and Ireland. AMES has a combination of internal and external, and domestic and foreign manufacturing sources from which it sources products for sale in the markets it serves. 

&#160; 

In January 2013, AMES undertook to close certain of its U.S. manufacturing facilities and consolidate affected operations primarily into its Camp Hill and Carlisle, PA locations. The actions, completed at the end of the 2015 first quarter, improved manufacturing and distribution efficiencies, allowed for in-sourcing of certain production previously performed by third party suppliers, and improved material flow and absorption of fixed costs. AMES' initiative resulted in annual cash savings exceeding $10,000. Realization of savings began in the 2015 second quarter. 

Clopay Building Products 

&#160; 

Since 1964, CBP has grown, organically and through tuck-in acquisitions, to become the leading manufacturer and marketer of residential and commercial garage doors, and among the largest manufacturers of commercial sectional doors, in the U.S. In addition, CBP manufactures a complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to complement its popular residential garage door styles. The majority of CBP&#8217;s sales come from home remodeling and renovation projects, with the balance from new residential housing construction and commercial building markets. Sales into the home remodeling market are driven by the aging of the housing stock, existing home sales activity, and the trends of improving both home appearance and energy efficiency. CBP employs approximately 1,500 &#32;employees. 

&#160; 

According to the U.S. census, calendar year 2016 new construction single-family home starts will increase &#32;by 5% . The repair and remodel market rose 4% for the trailing twelve months ending September 2016, with modest growth expectations for the balance of the calendar year. The commercial segment saw spending fall 10% for the year (according to estimates from McGraw Hill Construction Dodge). According to industry sources, the residential and commercial sectional garage door market for calendar year 2015 was estimated to be $1,900,000 , an increase &#32;of $50,000 &#32;over the prior year. 

Brands 

&#160; 

CBP brings over 50 years of experience and innovation to the garage door industry. Our market-leading brands include Clopay&#174;, America&#8217;s Favorite Garage Doors&#174;, Holmes Garage Door Company&#174; and IDEAL Door&#174;. Clopay is the only residential garage door brand to hold the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. 

&#160; 

Products and Service 

&#160; 

CBP manufactures a broad line of residential sectional garage doors with a variety of options, at varying prices. CBP offers garage doors made primarily from steel, plastic composite and wood, and also sells related products, such as garage door openers manufactured by third parties. 

&#160; 

CBP also markets commercial sectional doors, which are similar to residential garage doors, but are designed to meet the more demanding performance specifications of a commercial application. 

&#160; 

CBP has a complete line of entry door systems uniquely designed to complement its popular residential garage door styles. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

CBP is currently the exclusive supplier of residential garage doors throughout North America to Home Depot and Menards. The loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on CBP&#8217;s and Griffon&#8217;s business. CBP distributes its garage doors directly to customers from its manufacturing facilities and through its distribution centers located throughout the U.S. and Canada. These distribution centers allow CBP to maintain an inventory of garage doors near installing dealers and provide quick-ship service to retail and professional dealer customers. 

Product Development 

&#160; 

CBP product development efforts focus on both new products and improvements to existing products. Products are developed through in-house design and engineering staffs. 

&#160; 

CBP operates a technical development center where its research engineers design, develop and implement new products and technologies and perform durability and performance testing of new and existing products, materials and finishes. CBP continually improves its garage door offerings through these development efforts, focusing on characteristics such as strength, design and energy efficiency. Also at this facility, the process engineering team works to develop new manufacturing processes and production techniques aimed at improving manufacturing efficiencies and ensuring quality-made products. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

The CBP sales and marketing organization supports our customers, consults on new product development and aggressively markets garage door solutions, with a primary focus on the North American market. CBP maintains a strong promotional presence, in both traditional and digital media. CBP developed a web application that guides consumers through an easy to use visualization and pricing program, allowing them to select the optimal door for their home. 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

&#160; 

The principal raw material used in CBP&#8217;s manufacturing is galvanized steel. CBP also utilizes certain hardware components, as well as wood and insulated foam. All raw materials are generally available from a number of sources. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The garage door industry includes several large national manufacturers and many smaller, regional and local manufacturers. CBP competes on the basis of service, quality, price, brand awareness and product design. 

&#160; 

CBP&#8217;s brand names are widely recognized in the building products industry. CBP believes that it has earned a reputation among installing dealers and retailers for producing a broad range of innovative, high-quality doors with industry leading lead times. CBP&#8217;s market position and brand recognition are key marketing tools for expanding its customer base, leveraging its distribution network and increasing its market share. 

&#160; 

Distribution 

&#160; 

CBP distributes its products through a wide range of distribution channels. CBP owns and operates a national network of 50 &#32;distribution centers. Additionally, products are sold to approximately 2,000 &#32;independent professional installing dealers and to major home center retail chains. CBP maintains strong relationships with its installing dealers and believes it is the largest supplier of residential garage doors to the retail and professional installing channels in North America. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

CBP has substantially completed a 200,000 square foot expansion of its state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Troy, Ohio. This expansion reflects increased customer demand for its core products, and CBP's success in bringing new technologies to market. The Troy facility now has 1.23 million square feet of combined manufacturing and office space. CBP&#8217;s Russia, Ohio facility provides additional production capacity, particularly for specialized and custom products. 

Telephonics Corporation 

&#160; 

Telephonics, founded in 1933, is recognized globally as a leading provider of highly sophisticated intelligence, surveillance and communications solutions that are deployed across a wide range of land, sea and air applications. Telephonics designs, develops, manufactures and provides logistical support and lifecycle sustainment services to defense, aerospace and commercial customers worldwide. In 2016, approximately 70% &#32;of the segment&#8217;s sales were to the U.S. Government and agencies thereof, as a prime or subcontractor, 27% &#32;to international customers and 3% &#32;to U.S. commercial customers. Telephonics is headquartered in Farmingdale, New York and currently employs approximately 1,200 &#32;people. 

Telephonics is organized into four primary business lines: Radar Systems, Communications and Surveillance, Systems Engineering and Commercial Products. Radar Systems specializes in maritime surveillance, search and rescue, and weather surveillance solutions. Communications and Surveillance Systems provides intercommunication systems with wireless extensions that distribute voice and data on a variety of platforms, Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) interrogators, border surveillance systems and Air Traffic Management (ATM) products. Telephonics&#8217; Systems Engineering Group (SEG) provides highly technical threat and radar systems engineering as well as analytic support to a wide range of customers, including the United States Missile Defense Agency and Ballistic Missile Defense Program. Commercial Products specializes in wireless intercommunications systems, ATM 

automation products and commercial audio products. TLSI, or Telephonics Large Scale Integration, a part of Commercial Products, is a full-service designer and provider of high-voltage, high-temperature, low-power, mixed-signal System-on-Chip (SoC) and custom Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). 

To meet the unique challenges of operating in an increasingly complex industry that is faced with continued economic and budgetary pressure on U.S. defense procurement, Telephonics has adapted its core surveillance and communications products, typically used by the U.S. government and its agencies, to meet the needs of international customers in both defense and commercial markets. Telephonics' two largest product lines include maritime surveillance radar and aircraft intercommunication management systems and as Telephonics continues to concentrate on adjacent markets to grow these product lines both domestically and internationally, the company remains focused on delivering high-quality products and services that protect military personnel and civilian interests world-wide. 

Telephonics&#8217; leading-edge products and services are well-positioned to address the needs of a fully integrated and modernized battlefield with an emphasis on providing complete situational awareness to the warfighter whether on the ground, in the air or at sea, providing timely, secure and accurate intelligence. Telephonics anticipates that the need for secure, integrated surveillance and communications capabilities will continue to increase as the U.S. and foreign militaries expand their role in fighting terrorism both at home and abroad. Telephonics has also invested in design and development of technologies focused on advanced intelligence and surveillance sensors with applications in both manned and unmanned systems, as well as border and perimeter security markets. 

&#160; 

Telephonics is a partner in Mahindra Telephonics Integrated Systems, a Joint Venture (JV) with Mahindra Defense Systems in India. The business is focused on providing the Indian defense and civil sectors with surveillance, communications and IFF systems. The JV also intends to provide ATM, border and perimeter security and other surveillance technologies to meet emerging demands. 

Programs and Products 

&#160; 

Based on long-established relationships supported by existing contractual arrangements, Telephonics is a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin Corporation ("Lockheed Martin"), The Boeing Company ("Boeing"), Northrop Grumman Corporation ("Northrup Grumman"), MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd., Airbus Military, Airbus Helicopters, Leonardo (Agusta Westland) Helicopters, and SAAB, and is at times a prime contractor to the U.S. Department of Defense. The significance of each of these customers to Telephonics&#8217; revenue fluctuates on an annual basis, based on the timing and funding of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) contract award, and the technological scope of the work required. The significant contraction and consolidation in the U.S. and international defense industry provides opportunities for established first-tier suppliers to capitalize on existing relationships with major prime contractors and to play a larger role in defense systems development and procurement for the foreseeable future. 

&#160; 

Telephonics continues to direct resources towards border surveillance and critical infrastructure security initiatives. These opportunities represent strategic advances for Telephonics by enabling it to expand its core technical expertise into the nascent and growing border and perimeter security markets, both in the U.S. and abroad. With many of these programs, system specifications and operational and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by demanding delivery schedules. Telephonics believes that the technological capabilities that these systems encompass will also be able to serve and protect the most complex borders. 

&#160; 

In 2016, Telephonics was awarded a contract from Oshkosh Defense, LLC for NetCom&#8482; Vehicle Intercommunications Systems to be integrated onto the company's Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. The faster and more agile JLTV will replace a portion of the military's current fleet of up-armored HMMWVs. With the additional capabilities of NetCom, these vehicles will further enhance the situational awareness and safety of U.S. troops via clear and secure communications. 

In 2015, Telephonics continued to focus its resources in commercial markets, and was successful in receiving a contract award from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority via the Long Island Railroad, as well as continued performance under existing contracts and additional awards from the Federal Aviation Administration. We believe these recent customer relationships will position Telephonics to continue growing in these adjacent commercial markets through leveraging its core technology and production capabilities. 

Backlog 

The funded backlog for Telephonics approximated $420,000 &#32;at September 30, 2016 , compared to $442,000 &#32;at September 30, 2015 . Approximately 71% &#32;of the current backlog is expected to be filled during 2017 . 

Backlog represents the dollar value of funded orders for which work has not been performed. Backlog generally increases with bookings and converts into revenue as we incur costs related to contractual commitments or the shipment of product. The decrease in backlog was primarily attributed to the timing of various international contract awards associated with radar and surveillance opportunities that were not received by the end of the reporting period. Given the nature of our business and a larger dependency on international customers, our bookings, and therefore our backlog, is impacted by the longer maturation cycles resulting in delays in the timing and amounts of such awards, which are subject to numerous factors, including fiscal constraints placed on customer budgets; political uncertainty; the timing of customer negotiations; and the timing of governmental approvals. 

Customers 

&#160; 

The U.S. Government, through prime contractors like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, is a significant customer of Telephonics. The loss of the U.S. Government or any of its prime contractors as a customer could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics&#8217; business. Notwithstanding the significance of Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, Telephonics sells to a diverse group of other domestic and international defense industry contractors, as well as others who use Telephonics products for commercial use. 

&#160; 

Telephonics participates in a range of long-term defense and non-military government programs, both in the U.S. and internationally. Telephonics has developed a base of installed products that generate significant recurring revenue from product enhancements and retrofits, as well as providing spare parts and customer support. Due to the inherent complexity of these electronic systems, Telephonics believes that its incumbent status on major platforms provides a competitive advantage in the selection process for platform upgrades and enhancements. Furthermore, Telephonics believes that its ability to leverage and apply its advanced technology to new platforms provides a competitive advantage when bidding for new business. 

&#160; 

Research and Development ("R&#38;D") 

&#160; 

In order to continue to offer affordable solutions that provide relevant and required features, Telephonics works closely with prime customers to ensure that there is a future market for its products by investing R&#38;D funds in desired enhancements. Telephonics continually updates its core technologies through internally funded R&#38;D while coordinating with customers at the earliest stages of new program development in an effort to provide solutions well in advance of its competitors. Internally funded R&#38;D costs include basic and applied research initiatives, development activities, and other conceptual formulation studies. Telephonics is a technological leader in its core markets and pursues new growth opportunities by leveraging its systems design and engineering capabilities, and incumbent position, on key platforms. 

&#160; 

In addition to products for defense programs, Telephonics' technology is also used in commercial applications such as airborne weather, search and rescue radar, and air traffic management systems. Telephonics&#8217; reputation for innovative product design and engineering capabilities, especially in the areas of voice and data communications, radio frequency design, digital signal processing, networking systems, inverse synthetic aperture radar and analog, digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits, will continue to enhance its ability to secure, retain and expand its participation in defense programs and commercial opportunities. 

&#160; 

Telephonics often designs its products to exceed customers&#8217; minimum specifications, providing its customers with greater performance, flexibility, and value. Telephonics believes that early participation and communication with its customers in the requirements definition stages of new program development increases the likelihood that its products will be selected and integrated as part of a total system solution. 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

Telephonics has technical business development personnel who act as the focal point for its marketing activities and sales representatives who introduce its products and systems to customers worldwide. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Telephonics competes with major manufacturers of electronic information and communication systems, as well as several smaller manufacturers of similar products. Telephonics endeavors to design high quality and reliable products with greater performance and flexibility than its competitors while competing on the basis of technology, innovative solutions, and price. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing Facilities 

&#160; 

Telephonics&#8217; facilities are located in the U.S., primarily in New York. Telephonics also maintains a Technical Support Services Center in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, which supports aircraft integration and upgrade activities in addition to providing support services to customers. 

&#160; 

Clopay Plastic Products 

&#160; 

PPC traces its history to the 1860s as a paper wholesaler, and was incorporated under the Clopay name in 1934 when it was primarily a manufacturer of paper products. In the 1950s, PPC expanded its product line to include extruded plastic products, and today PPC is a global leader in the development and production of embossed, laminated and printed specialty plastic films for hygienic, health-care and industrial products. Products include thin gauge embossed and printed films, elastomeric films, laminates of film and non-woven fabrics, and perforated films and non-wovens. These products are used as moisture barriers in disposable infant diapers, adult incontinence products and feminine hygiene products, protective barriers in single-use surgical and industrial gowns, drapes and equipment covers, fluid transfer/distribution layers in absorbent products, components to enhance comfort and fit in infant diaper and adult incontinence products, packaging for hygienic products, house wrap and other products. PPC products are sold through a direct sales force, primarily to multinational consumer and medical products companies. PPC employs approximately 1,500 &#32;employees. 

&#160; 

The markets in which PPC participates have been affected by several key trends over the past five years . These trends include increased use of disposable products in developing countries and favorable demographics, including increasing immigration in major global economies. Other trends representing significant opportunities include the continued demand for innovative products such as cloth-like, breathable, laminated and printed products, and large consumer products companies&#8217; needs for global supply partners. Certain breathable film patents in the U.S. held by other companies are set to expire in calendar 2016, which is expected to create new opportunities in breathable film diaper and adult incontinence markets. Notwithstanding positive trends affecting the industry, product design changes by the customer can change the products manufactured by PPC and associated demand. 

&#160; 

PPC believes that its business development activities targeting major multinational and regional producers of hygiene, healthcare and related products, and its investments in its technology development capability and capacity increases, will lead to additional sales of new and related products. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

PPC specialty plastic film is a thin-gauge film engineered to provide certain performance characteristics and is manufactured from polymer resins. A laminate is the combination of a plastic film and a woven or non-woven fabric. These products are produced using both cast and blown extrusion and various laminating processes. High speed, multi-color custom printing of films, customized embossing patterns, siliconization and proprietary perforation technology further differentiate our products. Specialty plastic film products typically provide a unique combination of performance characteristics, such as breathability, barrier properties, fluid flow management, elastic properties, processability and aesthetic appeal that meet specific, proprietary customer needs. 

Customers 

&#160; 

PPC largest customer is The Procter &#38; Gamble Company (&#8220;P&#38;G&#8221;), which has accounted for approximately half of PPC's revenue over the last five years . The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on each of PPC's and Griffon's business. Notwithstanding the significance of P&#38;G, PPC sells to a diverse group of other leading consumer, health care and industrial companies. 

&#160; 

Product Development 

&#160; 

PPC is an industry leader in the research, design and development of specialty plastic film and laminate products. PPC operates a technical center where polymer chemists, scientists and engineers work independently, and in partnership with customers to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications. 

&#160; 

PPC's R&#38;D efforts have resulted in many inventions covering embossing patterns, improved processing methods, product formulations, product applications and other proprietary technology. Products developed include microporous breathable films and cost-effective printed films and laminates. Microporous breathability provides for moisture vapor transmission and airflow while maintaining barrier properties resulting in improved comfort and skin care. Elastic laminates provide the user with improved comfort and fit. Printed films and laminates provide consumer preferred aesthetics, such as softness and visual appeal. Perforated films and non-wovens provide engineered fluid transfer with unique softness and aesthetics. Siliconization provides a mechanism 

to release hygiene product from film without damaging the product. PPC holds a number of patents for its specialty film and laminate products and related manufacturing processes. While patents play a significant role, PPC believes that its proprietary know-how and the knowledge, ability and experience of its employees are more significant to its long-term success. 

During April 2016, PPC announced a Sof-flex&#174; breathable film investment which will expand breathable film capacity in North America, Europe and Brazil, increase our extrusion and print capacity, and enhance our innovation and technology capabilities. We expect the project to be completed in fiscal 2018. These investments will allow PPC to maintain and extend its technological advantage and allow us to differentiate ourselves from competitors, while meeting increasing customer demand for lighter, softer, more cost effective and more environmentally friendly products. 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

PPC sells its products primarily in North America, Europe, and South and Central America with additional sales in Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. PPC primarily utilizes an internal direct sales force, with senior management actively participating in developing and maintaining close contacts with customers. 

&#160; 

PPC seeks to expand its market presence by providing innovative products and services to major international consumer products companies. Specifically, PPC believes that it can continue to increase its North American sales and expand internationally through ongoing product development and enhancement, and by marketing its technologically-advanced films, laminates and printed films for use in all of its markets. Operations in Germany and Brazil, and most recently in Asia, provide a strong platform for additional sales growth in international markets. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Suppliers 

&#160; 

Plastic resins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, and non-woven fabrics are the basic raw materials used in the manufacture of substantially all PPC products. The price of resin has fluctuated dramatically over the past five years &#32;primarily due to volatility in oil and natural gas prices, foreign exchange and producer capacity. PPC customer contracts generally provide for adjusting selling prices based on underlying resin costs on a delayed basis. Resins are purchased in pellet form from several suppliers. Sources for raw materials are believed to be adequate for current and anticipated needs. 

Competition 

&#160; 

PPC has a number of competitors, some of whom are larger, in the specialty plastic films and laminates market. PPC competes on quality, service and price using its technical expertise, product development capabilities and broad international footprint to enhance its market position, build and maintain long-term customer relationships and meet changing customer needs. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Specialty plastic film and laminate products are manufactured using high-speed equipment designed to meet stringent tolerances. The manufacturing process consists of melting a mixture of polymer resins and additives, and forcing this mixture through a combination of die and rollers to produce thin films. Laminates of films and non-wovens are manufactured by a variety of techniques to meet customer needs. In addition, films and laminates can be printed. 

&#160; 

PPC's U.S. manufacturing facilities are in Augusta, Kentucky and Nashville, Tennessee from which it sells plastic films and laminates throughout the U.S. and various parts of the world. 

&#160; 

PPC has two manufacturing facilities in Germany from which it sells plastic films throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa. PPC also has operations in Brazil and China, which manufacture plastic hygienic and specialty films. PPC's international operations provide a platform to broaden participation in Europe, the Middle East, South America and Asia and strengthen PPC's position as a global supplier. 

During the third quarter of 2016, PPC recorded $5,900 in restructuring charges, primarily related to headcount reductions at PPC's Dombuhl, Germany facility, other location headcount reductions and the shutdown of PPC's Turkey facility. The Dombuhl charges are related to an optimization plan that will drive innovation and enhance our industry leading position in printed breathable backsheet. The facility will be transformed into a state of the art hygiene products facility focused on breathable printed film and siliconized products. In conjunction with this effort, our customer base will be streamlined, and we will dispose of old assets and reduce overhead costs, allowing for gains in efficiencies. 

Griffon Corporation 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

Griffon and its subsidiaries employ approximately 6,000 &#32;people located primarily throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, Brazil, Australia and China. Approximately 200 &#32;of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements in the U.S., with the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations), and the United Food &#38; Commercial Workers International Union. Additionally, approximately 200 &#32;employees in Canada are represented by the Trade Union Advisory Committee. Griffon believes its relationships with its employees are satisfactory. 

Generally, the total number of employees of Griffon and its subsidiaries does not significantly fluctuate throughout the year. However, acquisition activity or the opening of new branches or lines of business may increase the number of employees or fluctuations in the level of Griffon's business activity, which could in turn require staffing level adjustments in response to actual or anticipated customer demand. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Griffon&#8217;s operations are subject to various environmental, health, and employee safety laws and regulations. Griffon believes that it is in material compliance with these laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with environmental laws has not materially affected, and is not expected to materially affect, Griffon&#8217;s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position in the future. Nevertheless, Griffon cannot guarantee that, in the future, it will not incur additional costs for compliance or that such costs will not be material. 

&#160; 

Telephonics, which sells directly and indirectly to the U.S. government, is subject to certain regulations, laws and standards set by the U.S. government. Additionally, Telephonics is subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, and other Inspectors General. These agencies review a contractor&#8217;s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor&#8217;s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor&#8217;s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems. 

Customers 

&#160; 

A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon&#8217;s consolidated revenue. In 2016 : 

a. 

The U.S. Government and its agencies, through prime and subcontractor relationships, represented 16% of Griffon&#8217;s consolidated revenue and 70% of Telephonics' revenue. 

b. 

P&#38;G represented 13% of Griffon&#8217;s consolidated revenue and 51% of PPC revenue. 

c. 

Home Depot represented 13% of Griffon&#8217;s consolidated revenue and 24% of HBP's revenue. 

&#160; 

No other customer accounted for 10% &#32;or more of consolidated revenue. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon&#8217;s largest customers and our relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to change and may fluctuate materially. The loss of all or a portion of volume from any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on Griffon&#8217;s financial results, liquidity and operations. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Historically, Griffon&#8217;s revenue and income were lowest in our first &#32;and fourth &#32;quarters ending December 31, &#32;and September 30, &#32;respectively, and highest in our second &#32;and third &#32;quarters ending March 31, &#32;and June 30, &#32;respectively, primarily due to the seasonality of AMES' business. In 2016, 56% &#32;of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 56% &#32;in 2015 and 58% &#32;in 2014. CBP&#8217;s business is driven by residential renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter. Griffon's revenue is expected to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. 

&#160; 

Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during peak gardening season. AMES' sales volume can be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, 

hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES products, such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.

&#160; 

For geographic financial information, see the Reportable Segment footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

&#160; 

Griffon&#8217;s non-U.S. businesses are primarily in Germany, Canada, Brazil, Australia and China. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Griffon&#8217;s businesses are encouraged to improve existing products as well as develop new products to satisfy customer needs; expand revenue opportunities; maintain or extend competitive advantages; increase market share and reduce production costs. R&#38;D costs, not recoverable under contractual arrangements, are charged to expense as incurred. R&#38;D costs for Griffon were $26,200 &#32;in 2016 , $25,600 &#32;in 2015 &#32;and $23,400 &#32;in 2014 . 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Griffon follows a practice of actively protecting and enforcing its proprietary rights in the U.S. and throughout the world where Griffon&#8217;s products are sold. All intellectual property information presented in this section is as of September 30, 2016. 

&#160; 

Trademarks are of significant importance to Griffon&#8217;s HBP business. With 50 years of experience and innovation in the garage door industry, and with Clopay being the only residential garage door brand to hold the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, CBP has a significant level of goodwill in its strong family of brands, including: Clopay&#174;, America&#8217;s Favorite Garage Doors&#174;; Holmes Garage Door Company&#174; and IDEAL Door&#174;. Principal global and regional trademarks used by AMES include AMES&#174;, True Temper&#174;, Garant&#174;, UnionTools&#174;, Hound Dog&#174;, Westmix&#8482;, Cyclone&#174;, Southern Patio&#174;, Northcote Pottery&#8482;, Kelso&#8482;, Dynamic Design&#8482;, Razor-Back&#174; Professional Tools and Jackson&#174; Professional Tools. The HBP business has approximately 793 &#32;registered trademarks and approximately 109 &#32;pending trademark applications around the world. PPC uses the Clopay&#174; trademark in addition to its 7 other brand names, and holds 80 registered trademarks and 4 pending trademark applications around the world. Griffon&#8217;s rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and registered. 

&#160; 

Patents are significant to PPC. Technology evolves rapidly in the plastics business, and PPC's customers are constantly striving to offer products with innovative features at a competitive price to the end consumer. As a result, PPC constantly seeks to offer new and innovative products to its customers. PPC has 19 &#32;issued patents and 12 pending patent applications in the U.S., and 120 &#32;corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, primarily covering breathable and elastic polymer films and laminates for use in personal hygiene applications, as well as innovative technologies that are extensions of our core capabilities. Patents are also important to our HBP business. CBP holds 20 &#32;issued patents in the U.S., as well as 14 &#32;corresponding foreign patents, primarily related to garage door system components. AMES protects its designs and product innovation through the use of patents, and currently has 267 &#32;issued patents and 40 &#32;pending patent applications in the U.S., as well as 233 &#32;and 30 &#32;corresponding foreign patents and patent applications, respectively. Design patents are generally valid for fourteen years, and utility patents are generally valid for twenty years, from the date of filing. Our patents are in various stages of their terms of validity. 

&#160; 

In the government and defense business, formal intellectual property rights are of limited value. Therefore, our Telephonics business tends to hold most of its important intellectual property as trade secrets, which it protects through the use of contract terms and carefully restricting access to its technology.
