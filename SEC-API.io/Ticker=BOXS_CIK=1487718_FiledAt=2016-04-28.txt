Business Overview 

&#160; 

With the merger with U-Vend Canada, Inc. on January 7, 2014, the Company entered the business of developing, marketing and distributing various self-serve electronic kiosks and mall/airport co-branded islands throughout North America. The Company seeks to place its kiosks in high-traffic host locations such as big box stores, restaurants, malls, airports, casinos, universities, and colleges. Currently, the Company leases, owns and operates their kiosks but intends to also provide the kiosks, through a distributor relationship, to the entrepreneur wanting to own their own business. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s &#8220;next-generation&#8221; vending kiosks incorporate advanced wireless technology, creative concepts, and ease of management. Our kiosks have been designed to be tech-savvy and can be managed on line 24 hours a day/7 days a week, accepting traditional cash input as well as credit and debit cards. Host locations and suppliers have been drawn to this distribution concept of product vending based on the advantages of reduced labor and lower product theft as compared to non-kiosk merchandising platforms. 

&#160;

Currently, the Company distributes a novelty ice cream product, Mini Melts, through a network of over 120 advanced vending kiosks. The Company takes a solutions development approach for the marketing of products through a variety of kiosk offerings. This approach has the ability to add digital LCD monitors to most makes and models of their kiosk program. This allows the digital advertising as a national and/or local loop basis and a corresponding additional revenue stream for the Company. 

&#160;

In February 2015, the Company announced entering into an exclusive five year North American sponsorship and licensing agreement with the National Hockey League (&#8220;NHL&#8221;) for the development, manufacturing and marketing of novelty ice cream products. The Company has branded the product line Frozen Pond Premium Ice Cream. This is the first consumer product the Company has taken from concept to market and will seek to establish a distribution network for the sale of the product throughout Canada and the United States. 

&#160;
