I. Bone-Induction Artificial Bone 

&#160;

BIAB has completed over 200 animal tests, 5000 clinical trail tests, and was approved by the State Food and Drug Administration of China ("SFDA") in 2006. The BIAB won the second prize of 2007 China National Natural Science. VSD also has been approved by SFDA in 2006. 

&#160;

BIAB is a bionic porous repairing bone material which is made of calcium phosphate through a special process. Its composition and structure is similar with the natural mineral of human bone, which stands for its predominant biocompatibility, biological activity and biological safety. It helps to absorb human self's BMP growth factor; it also regulates gene function to induct bone regeneration, shorter the convalescence, and meet the target of repairing bone defect permanently. The advanced artificial bone is used: (i) in repairing traumatic bone defects; (ii) in repairing bone defect after complete removal of bone tissue as required in the treatment of certain diseases including bone tumor, bone tuberculosis, chronic osteomyelitis, osteofibrous dysplasia, delayed union, nonunion, and false joint fracture; (iii) for treatment of bone loss or bone defects caused by congenital malformation; (iv) as a filling material for spinal fusion, joint fusion, and orthopedic bone grafting; and (v) as a filling material for bone grafting fusion and decompressive laminectomy. 

&#160;

Product Characteristics: 

&#160;

The BIAB provides three-dimensional support structure and the physical and chemical composition which is similar to the body's natural bone mineral. They reassembled in human body's environment. It can help lead the fibrous tissue and bone marrow stromal stem cells to grow into the porous of the material, thus obtains the essential multipotent mesenchymal cells for bone formation and provide the growth support of cells. 

&#160;

The human body fluid contains BMP and other growth factors, but the content is too low, and is not enough to cause induction phenomena happen. The specific composition and structure of BIAB provides the growth factor with binding sites. The material implanted could selectively enrich and adsorb the bone growth factors in the blood and fluid of human body. The implantation of growth factor in the microenvironment will induce mesenchymal cells to the osteoblasts differentiation and new bone growth threshold. Under the synergistic effect of bone induction of signaling molecules and biological environment, BIAB can promote bone gene up-regulation, enhance down-stream gene function, and regulate cell movement in the direction of bone differentiation. 

&#160;

As the cells and nutrients transfer through the porous structure, the BMP growth factors cause the formation and maturation of new bone within the Bone-induction artificial bone. The implanted materials are thus gradually replaced with new bone, and the new bone finishes growth and ossification. 

&#160;

This innovative material provides several benefits: 

&#160;

1. Optimizes bone conduction performance.

2. Precise osteo-induction.

3. Rapid bone formation.

4. Suitable biodegradation absorption and ossification.

5. Long-term safety of implantation.

II. Vacuum Sealing Drainage 

&#160;

VSD was approved by the SFDA in 2006. It is made of polyvinyl alcohol aqueous gelatin foam: a three-dimensional porous structure, which is non ciliated, and exhibits strong water absorption characteristics. It is hydrophilic and has excellent thermal insulation capabilities as compared with other vacuum sealing drainage specialty foams. VSD has good histocompatibility and will not adhere to a wound. VSD aids skin creation around a wound bed with minimal vulnus. The dressing material acts as a drug carrier with strong bactericidal characteristics, and the gelatin protein promotes the growth of granulation, accelerating wound healing. It can be used in the surgery of burns, orthopedics, trauma repair, plastic, and general surgery. 

&#160;

Product Characteristics: 

&#160;

Advantages: 

&#160;

1. Good treatment effect. VSD allows an individualized complete treatment plan, which fully ensures the effect of clinical treatment. VSD basically eliminates adverse events such as clinical wound blowing and drainage tube blocking, leading to excellent treatment reliability;

2. Easy to operate. Using VSD is as simple as changing a fresh dressing for the wound; the material does not adhere with the wound, which avoids secondary vulnus;

3. Large range of indications; innovation of operation, especially for large size wound treatments.

III. Cancer Detection Scanning Technology 

&#160;

The Company is also licensed to conduct research and development of BioMark's cancer detection scanning technology. The technology uses biomarkers for the early detection of cancers. In the event that the research and development of BioMark's cancer detection scanning technology provides marketable technology, the Company shall have the right of first refusal to a license to market, sell and distribute such cancer detection scanning technology. 

&#160;

BioMark's cancer detection scanning technology provides innovative techniques and assay analysis to increases early detection of tumors in the latent growth phase.

&#183; 

Those who are most aware of the dangers of specific cancers are also those most able and likely to pay for early screening, detection and treatment. 

&#183; 

High awareness of these diseases among health care professionals and among the general population. 

&#183; 

Cancer has become one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality in the world, and recently overtook heart disease as the leading cause of death for Americans. 

&#183; 

Close to 20 million people in Europe and the U.S. live with cancer today and approximately 2.6 million new cases are diagnosed each year. 

&#183; 

The number of new cases diagnosed each year is increasing mainly as a result of demographics, because most types of solid cancer are typically diseases of the elderly. 

&#183; 

More than 6 million people around the world die of cancer every year, and one of two men and one of three women will develop cancer in their lifetimes. The overall annual costs associated with malignancies currently amount to $107 billion (Source: Biomarkers in Oncology, June 29, 2004).

&#183; 

Increased popularity of wellness centers throughout the world &#8212; interest and demand for preventative medicine 

&#160;

Market for Diagnostic Equipment 

&#160;

&#183; 

Worldwide market for diagnostics was estimated to be $28.6 billion in 2005. U.S. accounted for $11.2 billion. 

&#183; 

Diagnostic testing in hospitals accounts for 60% of revenue from diagnostics; reference labs account for 32% 

&#183; 

Low compliance with diagnostic-based quality measures was linked to up to 34,000 avoidable deaths and $900 million in avoidable healthcare costs in the U.S., according to the National Committee for Quality Assurance
