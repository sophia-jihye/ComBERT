Gulf Power &#32;is a Florida corporation that has had a continuous existence since it was originally organized under the laws of the State of Maine on November 2, 1925. Gulf Power was admitted to do business in Florida on January 15, 1926, in Mississippi on October 25, 1976, and in Georgia on November 20, 1984. Gulf Power became a Florida corporation after being domesticated under the laws of the State of Florida on November 2, 2005. 

Mississippi Power &#32;was incorporated under the laws of the State of Mississippi on July 12, 1972, was admitted to do business in Alabama on November 28, 1972, and effective December 21, 1972, by the merger into it of the predecessor Mississippi Power Company, succeeded to the business and properties of the latter company. The predecessor Mississippi Power Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine on November 24, 1924 and was admitted to do business in Mississippi on December 23, 1924 and in Alabama on December 7, 1962. 

In addition, Southern Company owns all of the common stock of Southern Power Company, which is also an operating public utility company. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power Company is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware on January 8, 2001. Together with its subsidiaries, Southern Power is admitted to do business in the States of Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas. 

Southern Company also owns all of the outstanding common stock or membership interests of SouthernLINC Wireless, Southern Nuclear, SCS, Southern Holdings, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. SouthernLINC Wireless provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and markets these services to the public and also provides wholesale fiber optic solutions to telecommunication providers in the Southeast. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's nuclear plants and is currently developing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. SCS is the Southern Company system service company providing, at cost, specialized services to Southern Company and its subsidiary companies.

The Southern Company System 

Traditional Operating Companies 

The traditional operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional operating companies' generating facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the State of Georgia's integrated transmission system, see "Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern Power" herein. 

Agreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered into from time to time for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional operating companies have entered into voluntary reliability agreements with the subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation, Florida Electric Power Coordinating Group, and Tennessee Valley Authority and with Duke Energy Progress, Inc., Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, South Carolina Electric &#38; Gas Company, and Virginia Electric and Power Company, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs, emergency operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The traditional operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast (including some of those referred to above) to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional operating companies are represented on the National Electric Reliability Council. 

The utility assets of the traditional operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system, or power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional operating companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from power pool transactions with third parties. 

Southern Company, each traditional operating company, Southern Power, Southern Nuclear, SEGCO, and other subsidiaries have contracted with SCS to furnish, at direct or allocated cost and upon request, the following services: general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance and treasury, tax, information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communication, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and power pool transactions. Southern Power and SouthernLINC Wireless have also secured from the traditional operating companies certain services which are furnished at cost and, in the case of Southern Power, which are subject to FERC regulations. 

Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have a contract with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has a contract with Southern Nuclear to develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See "Regulation &#8211; Nuclear Regulation" herein for additional information. 

Southern Power 

The term "Southern Power" when used herein refers to Southern Power Company and its subsidiaries while the term "Southern Power Company" when used herein refers only to the parent company. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions, including acquisitions and sales of assets, construction of new power plants, and 

I-2 

&#160; &#160; Index to Financial Statements 

entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load serving entities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power&#8217;s ability to execute its growth strategy and to construct generating facilities. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; OVERVIEW &#8211; "Business Activities" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein. 

Southern Power Company owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the power pool, and has other wholly-owned subsidiaries, two of which are Southern Renewable Energy, Inc. (SRE) and Southern Renewable Partnerships, LLC (SRP), which were created to own and operate renewable projects either wholly or in partnership with third parties, such as Turner Renewable Energy, LLC (TRE), First Solar Inc. (First Solar), or Recurrent Energy, a subsidiary of Canadian Solar Inc. (Recurrent), which are not included in the power pool. In addition, Southern Power Company has other subsidiaries either with natural gas and biomass generating facilities or pursuing additional natural gas generation and other development opportunities. 

Since 2010, SRE and TRE, through Southern Turner Renewable Energy, LLC (STR), a jointly-owned subsidiary owned 90% by SRE, has acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of eight solar projects that own the following solar photovoltaic facilities: Adobe, Apex, Campo Verde, Cimarron, Granville, Macho Springs, Morelos, and Spectrum. In December 2015, STR entered into a purchase agreement with Solar Frontier Americas Holding LLC, the developer of the Calipatria solar project, to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of Calipatria Solar, LLC (Calipatria), which closed on February 11, 2016. Additionally, in December 2015, SRE acquired 100% of all the outstanding membership interests of Kay Wind, LLC, which owns and operates the Kay Wind facility. In September 2015, SRE entered into a purchase agreement with Apex Clean Energy Holdings, LLC, the developer of the Grant Wind project, to acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of Grant Wind, LLC (Grant Wind), which is expected to close in March 2016 when the project reaches commercial operation. 

In 2014 and 2015, SRP acquired 100% of the outstanding class A membership interests of seven partnership entities that own the following solar photovoltaic facilities: Desert Stateline (which is being completed in eight phases), Garland, Imperial Valley, Lost Hills Blackwell, North Star, Roserock, and Tranquillity. Imperial Valley was placed in service in 2014; Lost Hills Blackwell, North Star, and three of the eight phases of Desert Stateline were placed in service in 2015; and phases four and five of Desert Stateline were placed in service in January and February 2016, respectively. Garland, Roserock, Tranquillity, and the remaining three phases of Desert Stateline are expected to be placed in service later in 2016. SRP is entitled to 51% of all cash distributions from the partnership entities and the respective partner who holds the class B membership interests (either First Solar or Recurrent) is entitled to 49% of all cash distributions. In addition, Southern Power is entitled to substantially all of the federal tax benefits with respect to the seven partnership entities. 

In December 2014, Southern Power announced that it will build an approximately 146-MW solar photovoltaic facility, Sandhills, in Taylor County, Georgia. During the first half of 2015, Southern Power Company acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of five entities that were subsequently merged with Southern Power Company for the construction of five solar photovoltaic facilities in Georgia as follows: Decatur County, Decatur Parkway, Butler, Butler Solar Farm, and Pawpaw. Decatur County and Decatur Parkway were placed in service in late 2015; Butler Solar Farm was placed in service in February 2016; and Pawpaw, Sandhills, and Butler are expected to be placed in service during 2016. 

The entire output of each of the renewable facilities is contracted under long-term PPAs as shown below in the table of PPAs as of December 31, 2015. See Item 2 &#8211; Properties, Note 2 to the financial statements of Southern Power in Item 8 herein, and Note 12 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Southern Power" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions and construction projects. 

As of December 31, 2015, Southern Power had 9,595 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation (including 2,110 MWs owned by its subsidiaries), after taking into consideration its equity ownership percentage of the solar facilities. With the inclusion of the PPAs and capacity associated with the solar facilities currently under construction and the acquisitions of Calipatria and Grant Wind, all as discussed above, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power has an average of 75% of its available demonstrated capacity covered for the next five years (through 2020) and an average of 70% of its available demonstrated capacity covered for the next 10 years (through 2025). 

Southern Power&#8217;s natural gas and biomass sales are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block 

I-3 

&#160; &#160; Index to Financial Statements 

sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer&#8217;s capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer&#8217;s own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers&#8217; resources when economically viable. 

Southern Power&#8217;s solar and wind sales are also through long-term PPAs, but do not have a capacity charge. Instead the customers purchase the entire energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge. 

The following tables set forth Southern Power&#8217;s existing PPAs as of December 31, 2015:

These amounts include the amounts for the traditional operating companies (as detailed in the table above) as well as the amounts for Southern Power and the other subsidiaries. See "Other Businesses" herein for additional information. 

(b) 

Reflects cost estimates for environmental regulations. These estimated expenditures do not include any potential compliance costs that may arise from the EPA&#8217;s final rules and guidelines or subsequently approved state plans that would limit CO 2 emissions from new, existing, and modified or reconstructed fossil-fuel-fired electric generating units or costs associated with closure in place or by other methods and ground water monitoring of ash ponds in accordance with the CCR Rule. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL &#8211; "Environmental Matters &#8211; Environmental Statutes and Regulations" and FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY &#8211; "Capital Requirements and Contractual Obligations" of Southern Company and each traditional operating company in Item 7 herein for additional information. 

(c) 

Includes approximately $0.8 billion for potential acquisitions and/or construction of new generating facilities. 

The construction programs are subject to periodic review and revision, and actual construction costs may vary from these estimates because of numerous factors. These factors include: changes in business conditions; changes in load projections; changes in environmental statutes and regulations; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules; changes in generating plants, including unit retirements and replacements and adding or changing fuel sources at existing units, to meet regulatory requirements; changes in FERC rules and regulations; PSC approvals; changes in the expected environmental compliance program; changes in legislation; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment, and materials; project scope and design changes; storm impacts; and the cost of capital. In addition, there can be no assurance that costs related to capital expenditures will be fully recovered. Additionally, planned expenditures for plant acquisitions may vary due to market opportunities and Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy. 

In addition, the construction program includes the development and construction of new generating facilities with designs that have not been finalized or previously constructed, including first-of-a-kind technology, which may result in revised estimates during construction. The ability to control costs and avoid cost overruns during the development and construction of new facilities is subject to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, changes in labor costs and productivity, adverse weather conditions, shortages and inconsistent quality of equipment, materials, and labor, contractor or supplier delay, non-performance under construction, operating, or other agreements, operational readiness, including specialized operator training and required site safety programs, unforeseen engineering or design problems, start-up activities (including major equipment failure and system integration), and/or operational performance (including additional costs to satisfy any operational parameters ultimately adopted by any PSC). 

See "Regulation &#8211; Environmental Statutes and Regulations" herein for additional information with respect to certain existing and proposed environmental requirements and PROPERTIES &#8211; "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information concerning Alabama Power's, Georgia Power's, and Southern Power's joint ownership of certain generating units and related facilities with certain non-affiliated utilities.

Fuel Supply 

The traditional operating companies' and SEGCO's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas and coal. Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; RESULTS OF OPERATION &#8211; "Electricity Business &#8211; Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" of Southern Company and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; RESULTS OF OPERATION &#8211; "Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" of each traditional operating company in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2013 through 2015. 

The traditional operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their coal burn requirements in 2016. These agreements have terms ranging between one and five years. In 2015, the weighted average sulfur content of all coal burned by the traditional operating companies was 0.95% sulfur. This sulfur level, along with banked and purchased sulfur dioxide allowances, allowed the traditional operating companies to remain within limits set by Phase I of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) under the Clean Air Act. In 2015, the Southern Company system did not purchase any sulfur dioxide allowances, annual nitrogen oxide emission allowances, or seasonal nitrogen oxide emission allowances from the market. As any additional environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure that the traditional operating companies remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL &#8211; "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company, each traditional operating company, and Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information on environmental matters. 

SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2016, SCS has contracted for 457 billion cubic feet of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms up to 15 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units. 

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have numerous contracts covering a portion of their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication. These contracts have varying expiration dates and most of them are for less than 10 years. Management believes sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to preclude the impairment of normal operations of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units. 

Changes in fuel prices to the traditional operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See "Rate Matters &#8211; Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" herein for additional information. Southern Power's PPAs (excluding solar and wind) generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel. 

Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power under "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs" in Item 8 herein for additional information. 

Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern Power 

The territory in which the traditional operating companies provide electric service comprises most of the states of Alabama and Georgia, together with the northwestern portion of Florida and southeastern Mississippi. In this territory there are non-affiliated electric distribution systems that obtain some or all of their power requirements either directly or indirectly from the traditional operating companies. As of December 31, 2015, the territory had an area of approximately 120,000 square miles and an estimated population of approximately 17 million. Southern Power sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market, primarily to investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load serving entities. 

Alabama Power is engaged, within the State of Alabama, in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission, distribution, and sale of such electricity, at retail in approximately 400 cities and towns (including Anniston, Birmingham, Gadsden, Mobile, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to 14 municipally-owned electric 

I-8 

&#160; &#160; Index to Financial Statements 

distribution systems, 11 of which are served indirectly through sales to AMEA, and two rural distributing cooperative associations. Alabama Power owns coal reserves near its Plant Gorgas and uses the output of coal from the reserves in its generating plants. Alabama Power also sells, and cooperates with dealers in promoting the sale of, electric appliances. 

Georgia Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission, distribution, and sale of such electricity within the State of Georgia, at retail in over 600 communities (including Athens, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Macon, Rome, and Savannah), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale currently to OPC, MEAG Power, Dalton, various EMCs, and non-affiliated utilities. 

Gulf Power is engaged, within the northwestern portion of Florida, in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission, distribution, and sale of such electricity, at retail in 71 communities (including Pensacola, Panama City, and Fort Walton Beach), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to a non-affiliated utility. 

Mississippi Power is engaged in the generation and purchase of electricity and the transmission, distribution, and sale of such electricity within 23 counties in southeastern Mississippi, at retail in 123 communities (including Biloxi, Gulfport, Hattiesburg, Laurel, Meridian, and Pascagoula), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to one municipality, six rural electric distribution cooperative associations, and one generating and transmitting cooperative. 

For information relating to KWH sales by customer classification for the traditional operating companies, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; RESULTS OF OPERATIONS of each traditional operating company in Item 7 herein. Also, for information relating to the sources of revenues for Southern Company, each traditional operating company, and Southern Power, reference is made to Item 7 herein. 

The RUS has authority to make loans to cooperative associations or corporations to enable them to provide electric service to customers in rural sections of the country. As of December 31, 2015, there were 71 electric cooperative organizations operating in the territory in which the traditional operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale. 

One of these organizations, PowerSouth, is a generating and transmitting cooperative selling power to several distributing cooperatives, municipal systems, and other customers in south Alabama and northwest Florida. As of December 31, 2015, PowerSouth owned generating units with approximately 2,100 MWs of nameplate capacity, including an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Alabama Power's Plant Miller Units 1 and 2. PowerSouth's facilities were financed with RUS loans secured by long-term contracts requiring distributing cooperatives to take their requirements from PowerSouth to the extent such energy is available. See PROPERTIES &#8211; "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for details of Alabama Power's joint-ownership with PowerSouth of a portion of Plant Miller. Alabama Power has a 15-year system supply agreement with PowerSouth to provide 200 MWs of capacity service with an option to extend and renegotiate in the event Alabama Power builds new generation or contracts for new capacity. 

Alabama Power and Gulf Power have entered into separate agreements with PowerSouth involving interconnection between their respective systems. The delivery of capacity and energy from PowerSouth to certain distributing cooperatives in the service territories of Alabama Power and Gulf Power is governed by the Southern Company/PowerSouth Network Transmission Service Agreement. The rates for this service to PowerSouth are on file with the FERC. 

Four electric cooperative associations, financed by the RUS, operate within Gulf Power's service territory. These cooperatives purchase their full requirements from PowerSouth and SEPA (a federal power marketing agency). A non-affiliated utility also operates within Gulf Power's service territory and purchases its full requirements from Gulf Power. 

Mississippi Power has an interchange agreement with SMEPA, a generating and transmitting cooperative, pursuant to which various services are provided. 

As of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 65 municipally-owned electric distribution systems operating in the territory in which the traditional operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale. 

As of December 31, 2015, 48 municipally-owned electric distribution systems and one county-owned system received their requirements through MEAG Power, which was established by a Georgia state statute in 1975. MEAG Power serves these requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and purchases from other resources. MEAG Power also has a pseudo scheduling and services agreement with Georgia Power. Dalton serves its requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and through purchases from Georgia Power and Southern Power through a service agreement. See PROPERTIES &#8211; "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information. 

Georgia Power has entered into substantially similar agreements with Georgia Transmission Corporation, MEAG Power, and Dalton providing for the establishment of an integrated transmission system to carry the power and energy of all parties. The agreements require an investment by each party in the integrated transmission system in proportion to its respective share of the aggregate system load. See PROPERTIES &#8211; "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information. 

I-9 

&#160; &#160; Index to Financial Statements 

Southern Power assumed or entered into PPAs with some of the traditional operating companies, investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load serving entities. See "The Southern Company System &#8211; Southern Power" above and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL &#8211; "Power Sales Agreements" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information concerning Southern Power's PPAs. 

SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional operating companies, also has a contract with SEPA providing for the use of the traditional operating companies' facilities at government expense to deliver to certain cooperatives and municipalities, entitled by federal statute to preference in the purchase of power from SEPA, quantities of power equivalent to the amounts of power allocated to them by SEPA from certain U.S. government hydroelectric projects. 

Competition 

The electric utility industry in the U.S. is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the early primary agents of change was the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which allowed IPPs to access a utility's transmission network in order to sell electricity to other utilities. 

The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements, service, and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political, and environmental considerations, taxation, and supply. 

The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, all areas within existing municipal limits were assigned to the primary electric supplier therein. Areas outside of such municipal limits were either to be assigned or to be declared open for customer choice of supplier by action of the Georgia PSC pursuant to standards set forth in this Act. Consistent with such standards, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 KWs may exercise a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the supplier of its choice. 

Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued "Grandfather Certificates" of public convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a "Grandfather Certificate," the utility holding such certificate may, without further certification, extend its lines up to five miles; other extensions within that area by such utility, or by other utilities, may not be made except upon a showing of, and a grant of a certificate of, public convenience and necessity. Areas included in such a certificate that are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be served by the holder of the certificate, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC. 

Generally, the traditional operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as self-generation (as described below) and distributed generation technologies, as well as other factors. 

Southern Power competes with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales primarily in the Southeastern U.S. wholesale market. The needs of this market are driven by the demands of end users in the Southeast and the generation available. Southern Power's success in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of Southern Power's plants, availability of transmission to serve the demand, price, and Southern Power's ability to contain costs. 

As of December 31, 2015, Alabama Power had cogeneration contracts in effect with nine industrial customers. Under the terms of these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess energy generated by such companies. During 2015, Alabama Power purchased approximately 201 million KWHs from such companies at a cost of $4 million. 

As of December 31, 2015, Georgia Power had contracts in effect with 24 small power producers whereby Georgia Power purchases their excess generation. During 2015, Georgia Power purchased 804 million KWHs from such companies at a cost of $60 million. Georgia Power also has PPAs for electricity with six cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to meet minimum capacity output. During 2015, Georgia Power purchased 285 million KWHs at a cost of $25 million from these facilities. 

Also during 2015, Georgia Power purchased energy from three customer-owned generating facilities. These customers provide only energy to Georgia Power and make no capacity commitment and are not dispatched by Georgia Power. During 2015, Georgia Power purchased a total of 34 million KWHs from the three customers at a cost of approximately $1 million. 

I-10 

&#160; &#160; Index to Financial Statements 

As of December 31, 2015, Gulf Power had agreements in effect with various industrial, commercial, and qualifying facilities pursuant to which Gulf Power purchases "as available" energy from customer-owned generation. During 2015, Gulf Power purchased 211 million KWHs from such companies for approximately $6 million. 

As of December 31, 2015, Mississippi Power had one cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation. During 2015, Mississippi Power did not purchase any excess generation from this customer. 

Seasonality 

The demand for electric power generation is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. At the traditional operating companies and Southern Power, the demand for power peaks either during the summer or winter months, with market prices reflecting the demand of power and available generating resources at that time. As a result, the overall operating results of Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power have historically sold less power when weather conditions are milder. 

Regulation 

State Commissions 

The traditional operating companies are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs. The PSCs have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See "Territory Served by the Traditional Operating Companies and Southern Power" and "Rate Matters" herein for additional information. 

Federal Power Act 

The traditional operating companies, Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and, therefore, are subject to the rate, financial, and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an "at cost standard" for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS and Southern Nuclear. The FERC is also authorized to establish regional reliability organizations which enforce reliability standards, address impediments to the construction of transmission, and prohibit manipulative energy trading practices. 

Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric developments. As of December 31, 2015, among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,667,000 KWs and 18 existing Georgia Power generating stations having an aggregate installed capacity of 1,087,296 KWs. 

In 2013, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for Alabama Power's seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin). Alabama Power filed a petition requesting rehearing of the FERC order granting the relicense seeking revisions to several conditions of the license. The Alabama Rivers Alliance, American Rivers, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, and the Atlanta Regional Commission have also filed petitions for rehearing of the FERC order. 

In 2013, Alabama Power filed an application with the FERC to relicense the Holt hydroelectric project located on the Warrior River. The current Holt license expired on August 31, 2015. Since the FERC did not act on Alabama Power's new license application prior to the expiration of the existing license, the FERC issued to Alabama Power an annual license authorizing continued operation of the project under the terms and conditions of the expired license until action is taken on the new license. 

On December 17, 2015, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for the Martin Dam project located on the Tallapoosa River. The Alabama Rivers Alliance, American Rivers, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, and the Atlanta Regional Commission have filed petitions for rehearing of the FERC order. 

In 2015, Georgia Power initiated the process of developing an application to relicense the Wallace Dam project on the Oconee River. The current Wallace Dam project license will expire on June 1, 2020. 

Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2027, for the Rocky Mountain Plant, a pure pumped storage facility of 847,800 KW capacity. See PROPERTIES &#8211; "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information. 

Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the years 2023-2035 in the case of Alabama Power's projects and in the years 2020-2044 in the case of Georgia Power's projects. 

I-11 

&#160; &#160; Index to Financial Statements 

Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the original licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain requirements that could result in additional costs. 

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 

Nuclear Regulation 

Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC is responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the environment, protecting and safeguarding nuclear materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national security, and assuring conformity with antitrust laws. 

The NRC licenses for Georgia Power's Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 expire in 2034 and 2038, respectively. The NRC licenses for Alabama Power's Plant Farley Units 1 and 2 expire in 2037 and 2041, respectively. The NRC licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 expire in 2047 and 2049, respectively. 

In 2012, the NRC issued combined construction and operating licenses (COLs) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Receipt of the COLs allowed full construction to begin. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL &#8211; "Retail Regulatory Matters &#8211; Nuclear Construction" of Georgia Power in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Retail Regulatory Matters &#8211; Georgia Power &#8211; Nuclear Construction" and Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters &#8211; Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information. 

See Notes 1 and 9 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power in Item 8 herein for information on nuclear decommissioning costs and nuclear insurance. 

Environmental Statutes and Regulations 

The electric utilities' operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air, water, and land resources. Compliance with these existing environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions or through market-based contracts. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will be recovered. 

Compliance with federal environmental statutes and resulting regulations has been, and will continue to be, a significant focus for Southern Company, each traditional operating company, Southern Power, and SEGCO. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations may be changed or new laws and regulations may be adopted or otherwise become applicable to the Southern Company system, including laws and regulations designed to address air quality, water, CCRs, global climate change, or other environmental and health concerns, as well as wildlife and endangered species conservation. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL &#8211; "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company and each of the traditional operating companies in Item 7 herein for additional information about environmental issues, including, but not limited to, proposed and final regulations related to air quality, water, CCRs, and greenhouse gases. Also see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL &#8211; "Environmental Matters" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information about environmental issues and climate change regulation. 

The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy, including potential unit retirement and replacement decisions, and future environmental capital expenditures will be affected by the final requirements of new or revised environmental regulations; the time periods over which compliance with regulations is required; individual state implementation of regulations, as applicable; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules and any additional rulemaking activities in response to legal challenges and court decisions; the cost, availability, and existing inventory of emissions allowances; the impact of future changes in generation and emissions-related technology and costs; and the fuel mix of the electric utilities. Compliance costs may arise from existing unit retirements, installation of additional environmental controls, upgrades to the transmission system, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, and adding or changing fuel sources for certain existing units. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. Such expenditures could affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered on a timely basis through regulated rates or long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional operating 

I-12 

&#160; &#160; Index to Financial Statements 

companies or market-based rates for Southern Power. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for electricity, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Also see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL &#8211; "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company, each of the traditional operating companies, and Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. 

Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations relating to air, water, and land resources or other environmental and health concerns could significantly affect the Southern Company system. Although new or revised environmental legislation or regulations could affect many areas of the electric utilities' operations, the full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Additionally, many of the electric utilities' commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity. See "Construction Program" herein for additional information. 

Rate Matters 

Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans 

The rates and service regulations of the traditional operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout their respective retail service territories. Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon KWHs used and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally, Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms and cost of service, however, are subject to final state PSC approval. 

The traditional operating companies recover their respective costs through a variety of forward-looking, cost-based rate mechanisms. Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions. These fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or on schedules as required by the respective PSCs. Approved environmental compliance, storm damage, and certain other costs are recovered at Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective PSCs. Certain similar costs at Georgia Power are recovered through various base rate tariffs as approved by the Georgia PSC. Costs not recovered through specific cost recovery mechanisms are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through annual, formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at Georgia Power and Gulf Power through base rate proceedings.

The traditional operating companies and Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized by the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL &#8211; "FERC Matters" of each of the registrants in Item 7 herein for information on the traditional operating companies' and Southern Power Company's market-based rate authority and a pending FERC proceeding relating to this authority.

Through 2015, capacity revenues represented the majority of Gulf Power's wholesale earnings. Gulf Power had long-term sales contracts to cover 100% of its ownership share of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (205 MWs) and these capacity revenues represented 82% of total wholesale capacity revenues for 2015. Due to the expiration of a wholesale contract at the end of 2015 and future expiration dates of the remaining wholesale contracts for the unit, Gulf Power currently has contracts to cover 34% of the unit for 2016 and 27% of the unit through 2019. Although Gulf Power is actively evaluating alternatives relating to this asset, including replacement wholesale contracts, the expiration of the contract in 2015 and the scheduled future expiration of the remaining contracts will have a material negative impact on Gulf Power's earnings in 2016 and may continue to have a material negative impact in future years. In the event some portion of Gulf Power's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 is not subject to a replacement long-term wholesale contract, the proportionate amount of the unit may be sold into the power pool or into the wholesale market. 

Mississippi Power serves long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and municipalities located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 21.0% of Mississippi Power's operating revenues in 2015 and are largely subject to rolling 10-year cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers. 

Integrated Resource Planning 

Each of the traditional operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix of resources to meet the existing and future demand requirements of its customers. See "Environmental Statutes and Regulations" above for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of the traditional operating companies. 

Certain of the traditional operating companies periodically file IRPs with their respective state PSC as discussed below. 

Georgia Power 

Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electrical needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct. 

See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Retail Regulatory Matters &#8211; Georgia Power &#8211; Rate Plans," "&#8211; Integrated Resource Plan," and "&#8211; Nuclear Construction" and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters &#8211; Rate Plans," "&#8211; Integrated Resource Plan," and "&#8211; Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information. 

Gulf Power 

Annually by April 1, Gulf Power must file a 10-year site plan with the Florida PSC containing Gulf Power's estimate of its power-generating needs in the period and the general location of its proposed power plant sites. The 10-year site plans submitted by the state's electric utilities are reviewed by the Florida PSC and subsequently classified as either "suitable" or "unsuitable." The Florida PSC then reports its findings along with any suggested revisions to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for its consideration at any subsequent electrical power plant site certification proceedings. Under Florida law, any 10-year site plans submitted by an electric utility are considered tentative information for planning purposes only and may be amended at any time at the discretion of the utility with written notification to the Florida PSC. 

Gulf Power's most recent 10-year site plan was classified by the Florida PSC as "suitable" in November 2015. Gulf Power's most recent 10-year site plan and environmental compliance plan identify environmental regulations and potential legislation or regulation that would impose mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL &#8211; "Environmental Matters &#8211; Environmental Statutes and Regulations &#8211; Air Quality," "&#8211; Environmental Statutes and Regulations &#8211; Coal Combustion Residuals," and "&#8211; Global Climate Issues" of Gulf Power in Item 7 herein. Gulf Power continues to evaluate the economics of various potential planning scenarios for units at certain Gulf Power coal-fired generating plants as EPA and other regulations develop. 

On February 6, 2015, Gulf Power announced plans to retire its coal-fired generation at Plant Smith Units 1 and 2 (357 MWs) by March 31, 2016, as a result of the cost to comply with environmental regulations imposed by the EPA. In connection with this retirement, Gulf Power reclassified the net carrying value of these units from plant in service, net of depreciation, to other utility plant, net. The net book value of these units at December 31, 2015 was approximately $62 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2015, Gulf Power filed a petition with the Florida PSC requesting permission to create a regulatory asset for the 

I-14 

&#160; &#160; Index to Financial Statements 

remaining net book value of Plant Smith Units 1 and 2 and the remaining inventory associated with these units as of the retirement date. The retirement of these units is not expected to have a material impact on Gulf Power's financial statements as Gulf Power expects to recover these amounts through its rates; however, the ultimate outcome depends on future rate proceedings with the Florida PSC and cannot be determined at this time. 

Mississippi Power 

Mississippi Power's 2010 IRP indicated that Mississippi Power plans to construct the Kemper IGCC to meet its identified needs, to add environmental controls at Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, to defer environmental controls at Plant Watson Units 4 and 5, and to continue operation of the combined cycle Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL &#8211; "Environmental Matters &#8211; Environmental Statutes and Regulations &#8211; Air Quality" and "&#8211; Global Climate Issues" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 herein. In August 2014, Mississippi Power entered into a settlement agreement with the Sierra Club that, among other things, required the Sierra Club to dismiss or withdraw all pending legal and regulatory challenges to the Kemper IGCC and the flue gas desulfurization system project at Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, which also occurred in August 2014. In addition, and consistent with Mississippi Power&#8217;s ongoing evaluation of recent environmental rules and regulations, Mississippi Power agreed to retire, repower with natural gas, or convert to an alternative non-fossil fuel source Plant Sweatt Units 1 and 2 (80 MWs) no later than December 2018. Mississippi Power also agreed that it would cease burning coal or other solid fuel at Plant Watson Units 4 and 5 (750 MWs) and begin operating those units solely on natural gas no later than April 2015 (which occurred on April 16, 2015), and cease burning coal and other solid fuel at Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (200 MWs) and begin operating those units solely on natural gas no later than April 2016. 

For information regarding Mississippi Power's construction of the Kemper IGCC, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS &#8211; FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL &#8211; "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 herein. 

The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
