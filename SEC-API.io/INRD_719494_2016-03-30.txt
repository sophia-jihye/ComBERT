&#160; 

Defense and Aerospace 

&#160;

This market consists of sales to OEM defense electro-optical systems and subsystems manufacturers, manufacturers of non-military satellite-based electro-optical systems and subsystems, and direct sales to governments where the products have the same end-use.

&#160;

End-use applications for the Company&#8217;s products in the defense and aerospace sector include military laser systems, military electro-optical systems, satellite-based systems, and missile warning sensors and systems that protect aircraft. The dollar volume of shipments of product within this sector depends in large measure on the U.S. Defense Department budget and its priorities, that of foreign governments, the timing of their release of contracts to their prime equipment and systems contractors, and the timing of competitive awards from this customer community to the Company.

&#160;

Defense/Aerospace sales represented approximately 33.8% and 34.6% of sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Sales increased by approximately $185,000 or 5.5% from 2014. The increase in 2015 is primarily due to shipments to a new customer in this market.

&#160;

The Company believes that the defense and aerospace sector will continue to represent a significant market for the Company&#8217;s products and offers an ongoing opportunity for growth given the Company&#8217;s capabilities in specialty crystal, glass and metal precision optics.

This market consists principally of customers who are OEM manufacturers of industrial, medical, and R&#38;D lasers which the Company serves as an OEM supplier of standard and custom optical components and laser accessories, as well as a number of smaller customers in other markets that are not currently large enough to list individually.

&#160;

Sales in this market decreased in 2015 as a percentage of sales, compared to 2014 from 22.8% to 19.2%, down $202,000. This was primarily attributable to lower sales to one large customer who experienced integration issues during the relocation of its operations to a new factory location.

&#160; 

Universities and National Laboratories 

&#160;

These sales consist of product sales directly to researchers at various educational and research institutions and through distributors into that market. Sales to customers within the University and National Laboratories market consist primarily of the Company&#8217;s legacy systems, Pockels cells and related repairs. Sales in 2015 increased by $205,000 and as a percentage of total sales to 8.7% compared to 7.3% in 2014. This was primarily attributable to an increase in order volume from one National Lab who received increased government funding in 2015.

&#160; 

Major Customers 

&#160;

Historically, the Company&#8217;s sales have been concentrated within a small number of customers, although the top customers have varied from year to year.

&#160;

In 2015, the Company had sales to three major customers which accounted for approximately 29% of sales. One customer, a division of a major U.S. defense industry corporation who manufactures electro-optical systems for U.S. and foreign governments accounted for 10.3% of 2015 sales. The two other customers were foreign- based manufacturers of process control and metrology equipment whose sales represented 10.4% and 8.3% of sales, respectively. The same three customers represented 13.5%, 4.2% and 2.8 %, of sales in 2014, respectively.

&#160;

Sales to the Company&#8217;s top five customers represented approximately 42.6% and 45.4% of sales, in 2015 and 2014, respectively. These customers are all OEM manufacturers either within the defense, process control and metrology or laser systems sector.

&#160; 

Export Sales 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s export sales are primarily to customers in Europe, Israel, Asia and Japan and amounted to approximately 25.2%, and 19.2% of product sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160; 

Long-Term Contracts 

&#160;

Certain of the Company&#8217;s agreements with customers provide for periodic deliveries at fixed prices over a long period of time. In such cases, the Company negotiates to obtain firm price commitments, as well as cash advances from its customers for the purchase of the materials necessary to fulfill the order.

&#160; 

Marketing and Business Development 

&#160;

The Company markets its products domestically, through the coordinated efforts of the sales, marketing and customer service teams.

&#160;

The Company has moved towards a strategy of utilizing these combined sales and marketing resources for cross-selling all products, across all business lines. This strategy is well suited to the diverse and fragmented markets that utilize photonic technologies.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Independent sales agents are used in countries in major non-U.S. markets, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Israel, and Japan.

&#160;

Sales and marketing efforts to promote our product lines and our participation in trade shows, internet-based marketing, media and non-media advertising and promotion, and management of international sales representatives and distributor relationships are coordinated at the corporate level under the auspices of the Vice President, Sales and Marketing.

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s order backlog at December 31, 2015 was $5,195,092. The Company&#8217;s order backlog as of December 31, 2014 was $6,455,000, respectively.

&#160;

We anticipate shipping a majority of the present backlog during fiscal year 2016. However, our backlog at any given date may consist of orders with delivery schedules that extend beyond twelve months into the future or that may be subject to adjustment or cancellation.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Within each product category in which the Company&#8217;s business units are active, there is competition.

&#160;

Changes in the photonics industry have had an effect on suppliers of custom optics. As end users have introduced products requiring large volumes of optical components, suppliers have responded either by staying small and carving out niche product areas, or by ramping up manufacturing capacity and modernizing their manufacturing methods to meet higher volume production rates. Additionally, the availability of an increasingly large variety of inventoried inexpensive catalog optics has led some OEM manufacturers to &#8220;design in&#8221; these low-cost solutions rather than utilizing custom designed and manufactured products.

&#160;

Competition for the Company&#8217;s crystal devices and instrumentation is more limited and the Company&#8217;s laser devices are considered to be high quality and generally offer a combination of features not available elsewhere. As a result of the Company&#8217;s in-house crystal growth capability, this area of the business is highly vertically integrated, providing a competitive advantage over other suppliers.

&#160;

For crystal products, the market is highly competitive. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors who supply non-linear optical crystals are located overseas, and can offer significantly reduced pricing for some crystal materials. On many occasions, the quality of the crystal component drives the ultimate performance of the component or instrument into which it is installed. Quality and technical support are considered to be valuable attributes for a crystal supplier by some, but not all, OEM customers.

&#160;

Our metal optics product line has several key competitors who are larger and better equipped to compete on high volume work. There are also several large and small competitors who compete with our products on large form factor optics. The Company has made recent inroads within this competitive landscape, and is building brand awareness in the marketplace.

&#160;

Although price is a principal factor in many product categories, competition is also based on product design, performance, customer confidence, quality, delivery, and customer service. Based on its performance to date, the Company believes that it can continue to compete successfully, although no assurances can be given in this regard.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of the close of business on March 18, 2016, the Company had 68 employees.

&#160;

Patents and Licenses 

&#160;

The Company mainly relies on its manufacturing and technological expertise, know-how and trade secrets in addition to its patents, to maintain its competitive position in the industry. The Company takes precautionary and protective measures to safeguard its technical design and manufacturing processes. The Company executes nondisclosure agreements with its employees and, where appropriate, with its customers, suppliers and other associates.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

Foreign sales of certain of the Company&#8217;s products to certain countries may require export licenses from the United States Department of Commerce. Such licenses are obtained when required. All requested export licenses of Inrad Optics products have been granted or deemed not-required.

&#160;

International Traffic in Arms Regulations (&#8220;ITAR&#8221;) governs much of the Company&#8217;s domestic defense sector business, and the Company is capable of handling its customers&#8217; technical information under these regulations. Inrad Optics, Inc. is registered with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, and utilizes a supplier base of similarly registered companies.

&#160;

There are no other federal regulations or any unusual state regulations that directly affect the sale of the Company&#8217;s products other than those environmental compliance regulations that generally affect companies engaged in manufacturing operations in New Jersey.
