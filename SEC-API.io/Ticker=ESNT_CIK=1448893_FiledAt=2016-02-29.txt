 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are an established and growing private mortgage insurance company. We were formed to serve the U.S. housing finance industry at a time when the demands of the financial crisis and a rapidly changing business environment created the need for a new, privately funded mortgage insurance company. We had an estimated 12.0% &#32;Market Share for the year ended December 31, 2015 . We believe that our success in acquiring customers and growing our insurance in force has been driven by the unique opportunity we offer lenders to partner with a well-capitalized mortgage insurer, unencumbered by business originated prior to the financial crisis, that provides fair and transparent claims payment practices, and consistency and speed of service. 

Private mortgage insurance plays a critical role in the U.S. housing finance system. Essent and other private mortgage insurers provide credit protection to lenders and mortgage investors by covering a portion of the unpaid principal balance of a mortgage and certain related expenses in the event of a default. In doing so, we provide private capital to mitigate mortgage credit risk, allowing lenders to make additional mortgage financing available to prospective homeowners. 

Private mortgage insurance helps extend affordable home ownership by facilitating the sale of low down payment loans into the secondary market. Two U.S. Federal government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which we refer to collectively as the GSEs, purchase residential mortgages from banks and other lenders and guaranty mortgage-backed securities that are offered to investors in the secondary mortgage market. The GSEs are restricted by their charters from purchasing or guaranteeing low down payment loans, defined as loans with less than a 20% down payment, that are not covered by certain credit protections. Private mortgage insurance satisfies the GSEs' credit protection requirements for low down payment loans, supporting a robust secondary mortgage market in the United States. 

Our primary U.S. mortgage insurance subsidiary, Essent Guaranty, Inc., received its certificate of authority from the Pennsylvania Insurance Department in July 2009. We subsequently acquired our mortgage insurance platform from a former private mortgage insurance industry participant and in 2010, became the first private mortgage insurer to be approved by the GSEs since 1995. We are licensed to write mortgage guaranty coverage in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 

We had master policy relationships with approximately 1,300 &#32;customers as of December 31, 2015 . Our top ten customers represented approximately 36.6% , 42.6% &#32;and 49.6% &#32;of our NIW on a flow basis for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. We have a highly experienced, talented team of 366 employees as of December 31, 2015 . Our holding company is domiciled in Bermuda and our U.S. insurance business is headquartered in Radnor, Pennsylvania. We operate additional underwriting and service centers in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Irvine, California. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we generated NIW of approximately $26.2 billion &#32;(including approximately $0.3 billion &#32;in NIW written on a bulk basis), $24.8 billion &#32;(including approximately $1.8 billion &#32;in NIW written on a bulk basis) and $21.2 billion , respectively, and as of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately $65.2 billion &#32;of insurance in force. The insurer financial strength rating of Essent Guaranty, Inc. is Baa2 &#32;with a stable &#32;outlook by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ &#32;with a stable &#32;outlook by Standard &#38; Poor's Rating Services. 

We also offer mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance through our wholly-owned Bermuda-based subsidiary, Essent Reinsurance Ltd., which we refer to as "Essent Re." As of December 31, 2015 , Essent Re provided insurance and reinsurance in connection with GSE risk-share transactions covering approximately $156.3 million &#32;of risk on mortgage loans in reference pools associated with Freddie Mac's Agency Credit Insurance Structure (ACIS) and Fannie Mae's Credit Insurance Risk Transfer (CIRT) programs. Essent Re has also reinsured 25% of Essent Guaranty, Inc.'s GSE-eligible mortgage insurance NIW originated since July 1, 2014 under a quota share reinsurance agreement. 

Our Industry 

U.S. Mortgage Market 

The U.S. residential mortgage market is one of the largest in the world, with over $9.95 trillion &#32;of debt outstanding as of September 30, 2015, and includes a range of private and government-sponsored participants. Private industry participants include mortgage banks, mortgage brokers, commercial, regional and investment banks, savings institutions, credit unions, REITs, mortgage insurers and other financial institutions. Public participants include government agencies such as the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA, the Veterans Administration, or VA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development program and the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, as well as government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The overall U.S. residential mortgage market encompasses both primary and secondary markets. The primary market consists of lenders originating home loans to borrowers, and includes loans made to support home purchases, which are referred to as purchase originations, and loans made to refinance existing mortgages, which are referred to as refinancing originations. The secondary market includes institutions buying and selling mortgages in the form of whole loans or securitized assets, such as mortgage-backed securities. 

GSEs 

The GSEs are the largest participants in the secondary mortgage market, buying residential mortgages from banks and other primary lenders as part of their government mandate to provide liquidity and stability in the U.S. housing finance system. According to the Federal Reserve, the GSEs held or guaranteed approximately $4.5 trillion , or 45.3% , of total U.S. residential mortgage debt as of September 30, 2015 . Their charters generally prohibit the GSEs from purchasing a low down payment loan unless that loan is insured by a GSE-approved mortgage insurer, the mortgage seller retains at least a 10% participation in the loan or the seller agrees to repurchase or replace the loan in the event of a default. Historically, private mortgage insurance has been the preferred method utilized to meet this GSE charter requirement. As a result, the private mortgage insurance industry in the United States is driven in large part by the business practices and mortgage insurance requirements of the GSEs. 

Mortgage Insurance 

Mortgage insurance plays a critical role in the U.S. residential mortgage market by facilitating secondary market sales and by providing lenders and investors a means to diversify their exposures and mitigate mortgage credit risk. Mortgage insurance is provided by both private companies, such as Essent, and government agencies, such as the FHA and the VA. From 1996 &#32;through 2015 , an average of 22.3% &#32;of total annual mortgage origination volume utilized mortgage insurance. 

Mortgage insurance industry volumes are influenced by total mortgage originations, and the mix between purchase and refinancing originations. Historically, mortgage insurance utilization has been meaningfully higher in purchase originations compared to refinancing originations. In 2015 , total U.S. residential mortgage origination volume was estimated at $1.63 trillion , comprised of $881 billion &#32;of purchase originations and $749 billion &#32;of refinancing originations. In recent years, historically low interest rates and special refinance programs, such as HARP, have caused refinancing volume to significantly outpace purchase originations. Purchase originations are expected to account for an increasing percentage of the overall mortgage market as the economic recovery and favorable housing market fundamentals stimulate growth in home buying activity, and a rising interest rate environment slows refinancing volume. 

The following graph provides detail on trends in total residential mortgage originations and the breakdown of the market between purchase and refinancing volume.

Financial Crisis and Recovery 

The severe economic and housing market dislocation experienced during the recent financial crisis had a profound impact on our industry. Incumbent insurers experienced record high claims activity and sustained significant financial losses, resulting in depleted capital positions. Three private mortgage insurers who wrote more than $125 billion of NIW, accounting for approximately 36% of total private mortgage insurance market NIW in 2007, have since exited the market, and several other insurers were forced to raise capital to repair their balance sheets and remain in operation. Although certain remaining incumbent insurers continue to deal with legacy challenges, the ongoing improvement of housing market fundamentals and the high credit quality of post-crisis new business are expected to support improved growth and profitability in the private mortgage insurance sector post-crisis. 

Prior to the financial crisis, private mortgage insurers accounted for the majority of the insured mortgage origination market. In 2007, private mortgage insurance represented 77.3% of insured mortgages and covered 15.5% of the total residential mortgage origination volume. During the financial crisis, government agencies began to insure an increasing percentage of the market as incumbent private insurers came under significant financial stress. By 2009, private mortgage insurance represented only 15.4% of the insured mortgage market and covered 4.1% of the total residential mortgage origination volume. 

The private mortgage insurance industry, however, has continued to recover, more than doubling its share of the total insured market since 2009 and thereby leading to higher private mortgage insurance penetration of the total mortgage origination market. In 2015, private mortgage insurance increased to an estimated 35% &#32;of the total insured market and covered 14% &#32;of the total mortgage origination volume. These gains have been driven in part by the improved financial position of incumbent insurers, the influx of private capital into the sector to support post-crisis entrants such as Essent, and aggregate increase since 2010 in the mortgage insurance premium rates and upfront fees charged for FHA insurance, even after giving effect to the 50 basis point decrease in FHA mortgage insurance rates announced in January 2015. 

The charts below detail the relative share of the insured mortgage market covered by public and private participants, and historical NIW trends in the mortgage insurance market and private mortgage insurance penetration rates, which represents private mortgage insurance NIW to total U.S. residential mortgage origination volume.

Source: Inside Mortgage Finance, except for total originations for the purpose of calculating private mortgage insurance penetration, which is based on Mortgage Bankers Association. For 2011 through 2015, private mortgage insurance penetration includes private mortgage insurance HARP NIW. 

We view HARP as a modification of the coverage on existing insurance in force, and therefore when estimating our Market Share based on NIW, we exclude HARP NIW from total industry NIW. However, HARP is included as part of total industry NIW when showing private mortgage insurance penetration for the industry. 

Competition 

The private mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Private mortgage insurers generally compete on the basis of underwriting guidelines, pricing, terms and conditions, financial strength, reputation, customer relationships, the strength of management and field organizations, the effective use of technology, and innovation in the delivery and servicing of insurance products. The private mortgage insurance industry currently consists of seven active private mortgage insurers, including Essent and each of Arch Mortgage Insurance Company, Genworth Financial Inc., Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation, National Mortgage Insurance Corporation, Radian Guaranty Inc. and United Guaranty Corporation. 

We and other private mortgage insurers compete directly with Federal and state governmental and quasi-governmental agencies that provide mortgage insurance, principally, the FHA and, to a lesser degree, the VA. As discussed above, the FHA's 

share of the mortgage insurance market increased as a result of the financial crisis and since 2009 has decreased as the private mortgage insurance industry has recovered and FHA premiums have increased in the aggregate. In addition to competition from the FHA and the VA, we and other private mortgage insurers currently face limited competition from state-sponsored mortgage insurance funds in several states, including California and New York. From time to time, other state legislatures and agencies consider expanding the authority of their state governments to insure residential mortgages. 

Our industry also competes with products designed to eliminate the need for private mortgage insurance, such as "piggyback loans," which combine a first lien loan with a second lien in order to meet the 80% loan-to-value threshold required for sale to the GSEs without certain credit protections. In addition, we compete with investors willing to hold credit risk on their own balance sheets without credit enhancement and, in some markets, with alternative forms of credit enhancement such as structured finance products and derivatives. 

Our Products and Services 

Mortgage Insurance 

In general, there are two principal types of private mortgage insurance, primary and pool. 

Primary Mortgage Insurance 

Primary mortgage insurance provides protection on individual loans at specified coverage percentages. Primary mortgage insurance is typically offered to customers on individual loans at the time of origination on a flow (i.e., loan-by-loan) basis, but can also be written in bulk transactions (in which each loan in a portfolio of loans is insured in a single transaction). A substantial majority of our policies are primary mortgage insurance. 

Customers that purchase our primary mortgage insurance select a specific coverage level for each insured loan. To be eligible for purchase by a GSE, a low down payment loan must comply with the coverage percentages established by that GSE. For loans not sold to the GSEs, the customer determines its desired coverage percentage. Generally, our risk across all policies written is approximately 25% &#32;of the underlying primary insurance in force, but may vary from policy to policy between 6% and 35% coverage. 

We file our premium rates with the insurance departments of the 50 states and the District of Columbia as required. Premium rates cannot be changed after the issuance of coverage and premiums applicable to an individual loan are based on a broad spectrum of risk variables including coverage percentages, loan-to-value, or LTV, loan and property attributes, and borrower risk characteristics. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations&#8212;Net Premiums Written and Earned" and "&#8212;Key Performance Indicators&#8212;Average Premium Rate." 

Premium payments for primary mortgage insurance coverage are typically made by the borrower. Mortgage insurance paid directly by the borrower is referred to as borrower-paid mortgage insurance, or "BPMI." If the borrower is not required to pay the premium, then the premium is paid by the lender, who may recover the premium through an increase in the note rate on the mortgage or higher origination fees. Loans for which premiums are paid by the lender are referred to as lender-paid mortgage insurance, or "LPMI." In either case, the payment of premium to us generally is the legal responsibility of the insured. 

Premiums are generally calculated as a percentage of the original principal balance and may be paid as follows: 

&#8226; monthly, where premiums are collected on a monthly basis over the life of the policy; 

&#8226; in a single payment, where the entire premium is paid upfront at the time the mortgage loan is originated; 

&#8226; annually, where premiums are paid in advance for the subsequent 12 months; or 

&#8226; on a "split" basis, where an initial premium is paid upfront along with subsequent monthly payments. 

As of December 31, 2015 , substantially all of our policies are monthly or single premium policies. 

In general, we may not terminate mortgage insurance coverage except in the event there is non-payment of premiums or certain material violations of our mortgage insurance policies. The insured may cancel mortgage insurance coverage at any time at their option or upon mortgage repayment. GSE guidelines generally provide that a borrower meeting certain conditions may require the mortgage servicer to cancel mortgage insurance coverage upon the borrower's request when the principal balance of the loan is 80% or less of the property's current value. The Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, or HOPA, also requires the automatic termination of BPMI on most loans when the LTV ratio, based upon the original property value and 

amortized loan balance, reaches 78%, and provides for cancellation of BPMI upon a borrower's request when the LTV ratio, based on the current value of the property, reaches 80%, upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in HOPA. In addition, some states impose their own mortgage insurance notice and cancellation requirements on mortgage loan servicers. 

Pool Insurance 

Pool insurance is typically used to provide additional credit enhancement for certain secondary market and other mortgage transactions. Pool insurance generally covers the excess of the loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that exceeds the claim payment under the primary coverage, if such loan has primary coverage, as well as the total loss on a defaulted mortgage loan that did not have primary coverage. Pool insurance may have a stated aggregate loss limit for a pool of loans and may also have a deductible under which no losses are paid by the insurer until losses on the pool of loans exceed the deductible. In another variation, generally referred to as modified pool insurance, policies are structured to include an exposure limit for each individual loan as well as an aggregate loss limit or a deductible for the entire pool. 

Master Policy 

We issue a master policy to each customer approved as a counterparty by our risk department before accepting their applications for insurance. The master policy, along with its related endorsements and certificates, sets forth the general terms and conditions of our mortgage insurance coverage, including loan eligibility requirements, coverage terms, policy administration, premium payment obligations, exclusions or reductions in coverage, conditions precedent to payment of a claim, claim payment requirements, subrogation and other matters attendant to our coverage. 

Mortgage insurance master policies generally protect mortgage insurers from the risk of material misrepresentations and fraud in the origination of an insured loan by establishing the right to rescind coverage in such event. Effective for mortgage insurance applications received after October 10, 2014, the GSEs, in coordination with the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, have instituted new minimum standards for mortgage insurer master policies. Under these new minimum standards, master policies must provide rescission relief for loans that remain current up to 36 months after origination and that have not experienced more than two late payments of 30 days or more and have never been 60 days late, and are permitted to provide rescission relief after 12 payments provided the mortgage insurer can independently validate the representations for which it intends to give rescission relief. The standards require that the master policies reserve rescission rights with respect to fraud committed by the insured or those under its control and certain patterns of fraud. Our master policy forms satisfy these standards. See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212; Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, including actions or decisions to decrease or discontinue the use of mortgage insurance or changes in the GSEs' eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers, could reduce our revenues or adversely affect our profitability and returns " elsewhere in this Annual Report and "&#8212;Regulation&#8212;Direct U.S. Regulation&#8212;GSE Qualified Mortgage Insurer Requirements" below. 

Contract Underwriting 

In addition to offering mortgage insurance, we provide contract underwriting services on a limited basis. As a part of these services, we assess whether data provided by the customer relating to a mortgage application complies with the customer's loan underwriting guidelines. These services are provided for loans that require private mortgage insurance, as well as for loans that do not require private mortgage insurance. Under the terms of our contract underwriting agreements with customers and subject to contractual limitations on liability, we agree to indemnify the customer against losses incurred in the event that we make an underwriting error which materially restricts or impairs the saleability of a loan, results in a material reduction in the value of a loan or results in the customer being required to repurchase a loan. The indemnification may be in the form of monetary or other remedies, subject to per loan and annual limitations. See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212; We face risks associated with our contract underwriting business." 

Bermuda-Based Insurance and Reinsurance 

We offer mortgage-related insurance and reinsurance through Essent Re, a Class 3A insurance company licensed pursuant to Section 4 of the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978. As of December 31, 2015 , Essent Re provided insurance or reinsurance in connection with GSE risk-share transactions covering approximately $156.3 million &#32;of risk on mortgage loans in reference pools associated with ACIS and CIRT programs. Essent Re has also reinsured 25% of Essent Guaranty, Inc.'s GSE-eligible mortgage insurance NIW originated since July 1, 2014 under a quota share reinsurance agreement.

Customers 

Our customers consist of originators of residential mortgage loans, such as regulated depository institutions, mortgage banks, credit unions and other lenders. We classify our customers into two broad categories and target our marketing efforts based on the customer's operating model and whether decisions to select a mortgage insurance provider are made centrally, or at the field or customer branch level: 

&#8226; 

Centralized &#8212;Centralized customers make decisions regarding the placement and allocation of mortgage insurance among their approved private mortgage insurers at the corporate level. Generally, these customers consist of the larger, national mortgage originators which originate loans across multiple states, but there are several regional and mid-size lenders which use this method as well. 

&#8226; 

Decentralized &#8212;Decentralized customers make mortgage insurance purchasing decisions at the field or branch level. These customers generally are more prevalent with regional and mid-size lenders which originate mortgages in a smaller geographic footprint, but are also seen, on a limited basis, among some national lenders. 

We seek to maintain strong institutional relationships with all our customers. We provide them with ongoing risk, sales, training, service and product development support. We maintain regular and ongoing dialogue with our customers to develop an in-depth understanding of their strategies and needs, to share market perspectives and industry best practices, and to offer tailored solutions and training where necessary on a local level. 

The following table provides detail on the percentage of our total NIW generated by centralized and decentralized customers, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 .

We had master policy relationships with approximately 1,300 &#32;customers as of December 31, 2015 . 

As we have grown, we have successfully diversified our customer base. Our top ten customers generated 36.6% &#32;of our NIW on a flow basis during the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared to 42.6% &#32;and 49.6% &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , one customer, Wells Fargo , exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenue. The loss of any of our larger customers could have a material adverse impact on us and our business. See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212; Our revenues, profitability and returns would decline if we lose a significant customer ." 

Sales and Marketing 

Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to help us establish and maintain in-depth, quality customer relationships. We organize our sales and marketing efforts based on our centralized and decentralized customer segmentation, giving additional consideration to a customer's geographic location and whether its lending footprint is national or regional in nature. 

We emphasize a collaborative approach with our customers that includes a number of educational offerings and joint product development and marketing initiatives: 

&#8226; 

Regular Portfolio and Risk Management Reviews. We conduct periodic insured mortgage portfolio reviews with customers, including detailed loan performance metrics. 

&#8226; 

Joint Product Development and Marketing Initiatives. We emphasize the development of specialized products and programs that provide increased opportunities for customers and address targeted segments of the market. We recognize the value in developing new products collaboratively with our customers. We also work closely with customers to understand their strategic priorities and business objectives while identifying opportunities that will enhance and complement the customers' marketing activities. 

&#8226; 

Customer Service, Support and Trainings. We have an experienced and knowledgeable customer services team that strives to provide premier service to our customers. We dedicate service representatives to our customers so they can establish relationships with their customer peers and become thoroughly familiar with unique customer systems, processes and service needs. We have developed mortgage industry training courses that are offered to our customers as a value added service. We have an experienced team that maintains the course materials so that they are relevant and current and who facilitate training sessions for our customers. 

We have an experienced team of national and regional account managers strategically deployed nationwide that markets our mortgage insurance products and support services. 

We assign national account managers to each of the national lenders, providing a point of communication between us and the customer's senior management team. These professionals are responsible for the development and execution of sales and marketing strategies aimed at growing customer volumes and ensuring each customer's needs are understood and helping them to pursue their strategies. The national account managers also coordinate the direct communication of customers with our underwriting and risk management groups to provide a continual flow of information between the organizations. 

We also have regional account managers and dedicated support staff operating in eight defined geographic regions. Our regional account managers play a similar role to our national account managers with respect to customer relationship management, education and customer training, serving as our primary point of contact for small and mid-sized regional lenders operating in a given territory. Regional account managers also support our national account team by assisting with our efforts to directly market and service the branch locations of certain national lenders. 

We support our national and regional sales force, and improve their effectiveness in acquiring new customers, by raising our brand awareness through advertising and marketing campaigns, website enhancements, electronic communication strategies and sponsorship of industry and educational events. 

We continue to build our sales force by hiring qualified mortgage professionals who generally have well-established relationships with industry-leading lenders and significant experience in both mortgage insurance and mortgage lending. Our approach is reflected in and supported by our compensation structure, pursuant to which we have successfully implemented a non-commission-based structure that includes an equity ownership program, which we believe aligns their efforts with our long-term corporate objectives, including providing better customer service and better risk selection. 

Information Technology 

We have a highly automated business that relies on information technology. We accept insurance applications through electronic submission and issue electronic insurance approvals. In order to facilitate this process, we establish direct connections to the origination and servicing systems of our customers and servicers, which may require a significant upfront investment. We also provide our customers secure access to our web-based mortgage insurance ordering and servicing systems to facilitate transactions. 

We continue to upgrade and enhance our systems and technology, including: 

&#8226; 

investing in new customer-facing technology that enables our customers to transact business faster and easier, whether over an internet browser or through direct system-to-system interfacing with our customers' loan origination and servicing systems; 

&#8226; 

integrating our platform with third-party technology providers used by our customers in their loan origination process and for ordering mortgage insurance; 

&#8226; 

developing and implementing a business rules engine that automatically enforces our eligibility guidelines and pricing rules at the time the mortgage insurance application is submitted; and 

&#8226; 

implementing advanced business process management software that focuses on improving our underwriting productivity and that may also be used to improve our quality assurance and loss management functions. 

We believe that our technology, together with our information technology team, greatly enhances our operating efficiency and creates competitive advantages. This team is experienced in large-scale project delivery, including mortgage insurance administration systems and the development of web-enabled servicing capabilities. Technology costs are managed by standardizing our technology infrastructure, consolidating application systems, managing project execution risks and using contract employees as needed. 

Underwriting 

We have established underwriting guidelines that we believe protect our balance sheet and result in the insurance of high quality business. Most applications for mortgage insurance are submitted to us electronically, and we rely upon the lender's representations and warranties that the data submitted is true and correct when making our insurance decision. Our underwriting guidelines incorporate credit eligibility requirements that, among other things, restrict our coverage to mortgages that meet our requirements with respect to borrower FICO scores, maximum debt-to-income levels, maximum LTV ratios and documentation requirements. Our underwriting guidelines also limit the coverage we provide for mortgages made with certain high risk features, including those for cash-out refinance, second homes or investment properties. 

We regularly seek to enhance our underwriting guidelines through extensive data gathering, detailed loan level risk analysis, and assessments of trends in key macroeconomic factors such as housing prices, interest rates and employment. We utilize proprietary models that enable us to assess individual loan risks with a high degree of granularity and set pricing for our 

policies within a risk-adjusted return framework. See "&#8212;Risk Management" below. We have adopted a balanced underwriting approach, which considers our risk analysis, return objectives and market factors. 

At present, our underwriting guidelines are broadly consistent with those of the GSEs. Many of our customers use the GSEs' automated loan underwriting systems, Desktop Underwriter&#174; and Loan Prospector&#174;, for making credit determinations. We accept the underwriting decisions made by the GSEs' underwriting systems, subject to certain additional limitations and requirements. We monitor the GSEs for updates to these systems, and may engage in a deeper review for the more substantive releases. Our reviews may result in the maintenance or implementation of additional eligibility requirements. In addition, the performance results of loans scored via automated underwriting systems are monitored within our portfolio management protocols. 

Our primary mortgage insurance policies are issued through one of two programs: 

&#8226; 

Delegated Underwriting. We delegate to eligible customers the ability to underwrite the loans based on agreed-upon underwriting guidelines. To perform delegated underwriting, customers must be approved by our risk management group. See "&#8212;Risk Management&#8212;Loan Life Cycle Risk Management" below. Some customers prefer to assume underwriting responsibilities because it is more efficient within their loan origination process. Because this delegated underwriting is performed by third parties, we regularly perform quality assurance reviews on a sample of delegated loans to assess compliance with our guidelines. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 62% &#32;of our insurance in force had been originated on a delegated basis, compared to 65% &#32;as of December 31, 2014 . See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212; Our delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims ." 

&#8226; 

Non-Delegated Underwriting. Customers who choose not to participate in, or do not qualify for, our delegated underwriting program submit loan files to us so that we may reach a decision as to whether we will insure the loan. In addition, customers participating in our delegated underwriting program may choose not to use their delegated authority, and instead may submit loans for our independent underwriting. Some customers prefer our non-delegated program because we assume underwriting responsibility and will not rescind coverage if we make an underwriting error, subject to the terms of our master policy. We seek to ensure that our employees properly underwrite our loans through quality assurance sampling, loan performance monitoring and training. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 38% &#32;of our insurance in force had been originated on a non-delegated basis, compared to 35% &#32;as of December 31, 2014 . 

We maintain primary underwriting centers in Radnor, Pennsylvania, Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Irvine, California. We believe that the geographical distribution of our underwriting staff allows us to make underwriting determinations across different time zones and to best serve customers across the United States. Although our employees conduct the substantial majority of our non-delegated underwriting, we engage underwriters on an outsourced basis from time to time in order to provide temporary underwriting capacity. 

Risk Management 

We have established risk management controls throughout our organization and have a risk management framework that we believe reduces the volatility of our financial results and capital position. The risk committee of our board of directors has formal oversight responsibility for the risks associated with our business and is supported by a management risk committee, chaired by our Chief Risk Officer, comprised of all senior members of our executive management team. 

We believe that our risk management framework encompasses all of the major risks we face, including our mortgage insurance portfolio, investment risk, liquidity risk and regulatory compliance risk, among others. The majority of our risk analysis is directed toward the risks embedded in our mortgage insurance portfolio. As such, we have established a risk management approach that analyzes the risk across the full life cycle of a mortgage, into what we term the "loan life cycle." 

Loan Life Cycle Risk Management 

We generally break down the loan life cycle risk management process into three components: 

&#8226; 

Customer qualification &#8212;customer review and approval process; 

&#8226; 

Policy acquisition &#8212;loan underwriting, valuation and risk approval; and 

&#8226; 

Portfolio management &#8212;loan performance and lender monitoring with continuous oversight through the settlement of a claim. 

Customer qualification involves a process in which we diligence a potential customer's financial resources, operational practices, management experience and track record of originating quality mortgages prior to formalizing a customer relationship. We leverage the experience of our management team to pre-screen lenders prior to formally engaging and performing a lender qualification review. Once engaged, our counterparty risk management team conducts a lender qualification review with oversight from the management risk committee. Approved lenders are subject to clear parameters regarding underwriting delegation status, credit guideline requirements and variances and collateral thresholds and volume mix expectations for loan diversification. 

The policy acquisition process involves the establishment of underwriting guidelines, pricing schedules and aggregate risk limits. See "&#8212;Underwriting" above. These guidelines and schedules are coded in our credit risk rule engine which is utilized to screen each loan underwritten, and are constructed to ensure prudent risk acquisition with adequate return on capital. These guidelines and schedules are maintained and periodically reviewed by our risk management team and adjusted to reflect the most current risk assessment based on ongoing experience in the insurance portfolio as well as industry loan quality trends. 

The portfolio management process involves two main functions, quality assurance, or QA, reviews, and a comprehensive surveillance protocol, in order to provide customers timely feedback that fosters high quality loan production. Through our QA process, we review a statistically significant sample of individual mortgages from our customers to ensure that the loans accepted through our underwriting process meet our pre-determined eligibility and underwriting criteria. The QA process allows us to identify trends in lender underwriting and origination practices, as well as to back-test underlying reasons for delinquencies, defaults and claims within our portfolio. The information gathered from the QA process is incorporated into our policy acquisition function and is intended to prevent continued aggregation of underperforming risks. Our surveillance protocol maintains oversight over customer and vendor activities, industry dynamics, production trends and portfolio performance. The portfolio management process also involves loss mitigation aimed to reduce both frequency and severity of non-performing risk. See "&#8212;Defaults and Claims" below. 

Modeling and Analytics 

Our risk management professionals are supported by substantial data analysis and sophisticated risk models. We have a dedicated modeling and analytics team which is responsible for delivering actionable models, tools, analysis and reporting to inform our credit underwriting and pricing decisions. The team analyzes mortgage, financial, economic and housing data to develop proprietary behavioral models that help us assess credit, prepayment and loss severity trends and collateral valuation models to help inform business decisions. Performance and profitability are evaluated across customers and products to identify the emergence of potential weaknesses and adverse risks. Geographic housing market analysis also is utilized in establishing market restrictions for certain products and segments. We utilize an economic capital framework to evaluate risk-adjusted returns. We also perform stress tests on our portfolio to analyze how our book of business may perform under adverse scenarios. We believe that our economic capital framework and stress testing analysis helps to inform our optimal capitalization targets, allowing us to prudently manage and protect our balance sheet. 

Defaults and Claims 

Defaults 

The default and claim cycle for a mortgage insurance policy begins with receipt of a default notice from the servicer. We consider a loan to be in default when we are notified by the servicer that the borrower has missed at least two consecutive monthly payments. Defaults may occur for a variety of reasons including death or illness, divorce or other family problems, unemployment, changes in economic conditions, declines in property values that cause the outstanding mortgage amount to exceed the value of a home or other events. 

We expect servicers to make timely collection efforts on borrowers who have defaulted, and to attempt to restore the defaulted mortgage, and our mortgage insurance coverage, to current status. If the servicer cannot restore a borrower to current status, the servicer may be able to offer the borrower a forbearance or loan modification alternatives. Where these alternatives cannot cure the default, the servicer is responsible for pursuing remedies for the default, including foreclosure or acceptable foreclosure alternatives, certain of which, such as short sales and deeds in lieu of foreclosure, require our prior approval under the terms of our master policy. We have delegated limited authority to the GSEs' and their servicers to exercise some of these alternatives. Among other requirements, servicers operate under protocols established by the GSEs. See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks 

Relating to Our Business&#8212; If servicers fail to adhere to appropriate servicing standards or experience disruptions to their businesses, our losses could unexpectedly increase ."

We have experienced a low level of defaults to date. This is due, in part, to the weighted average life of our mortgage insurance portfolio being 17.3 months as of December 31, 2015 , whereas the peak default period for insured mortgage loans has historically been three to six years after loan origination. As a result, we do expect default levels to increase as our portfolio seasons. We believe that in recent years the underwriting practices in the industry have improved substantially and that the quality of mortgage loans originated has been high. Consequently, we expect that the default rate and losses on the business we have underwritten to date will be favorable in comparison to the default rate and losses experienced by the mortgage insurers that wrote business in 2009 and prior years. 

Claims 

Defaulted mortgages that are not cured turn into claims. The insured customer must acquire title to the property before submitting a claim. The time in which a customer may acquire title to a property through foreclosure varies, depending on the state in which the property is located. Historically, on average, mortgage insurers do not receive a request for claim payment until approximately 18 months following a default on a first-lien mortgage. This time lag has increased in recent years as the industry has experienced a slowdown in foreclosures (and, consequently, a slowdown in claims submitted to mortgage insurers) largely due to foreclosure moratoriums imposed by various government entities and lenders and increased scrutiny within the mortgage servicing industry on the foreclosure process. 

Upon review and determination that a claim is valid, we generally have the following three settlement options: 

&#8226; 

Percentage option&#8212;determined by multiplying the claim amount by the applicable coverage percentage, with the customer retaining title to the property. The claim amount is defined in the master policy as consisting of the unpaid loan principal, plus past due interest, subject to a defined maximum, and certain expenses associated with the default; 

&#8226; 

Third-party sale option&#8212;pay the amount of the claim required to make the customer whole, commonly referred to as the "actual loss amount" (not to exceed our maximum liability as outlined under the percentage option), following an approved sale; or 

&#8226; 

Acquisition option&#8212;pay the full claim amount and acquire title to the property. 

We believe there are opportunities to mitigate losses between the time a loan defaults and the ultimate loss we may experience. Because of the small number of defaults and filed claims in our insurance portfolio to date, our opportunities to pursue these activities have been limited. However, we expect both defaulted loan counts and claim filings to increase as our portfolio grows and matures, expanding the potential benefit from these loss mitigation activities. Our loss mitigation and claims area is led by seasoned personnel supported by default tracking and claims processing capabilities within our integrated platform. Our loss mitigation staff is also actively engaged with our servicers and the GSEs with regard to appropriate servicing and loss mitigation practices. 

Investment Portfolio 

Our investment portfolio, including cash, comprises the largest single component of our balance sheet, representing 88.6% &#32;of our total assets at December 31, 2015 . Our primary objectives with respect to our investment portfolio are to preserve capital, generate investment income and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover operating expenses and pay future insurance claims. As of December 31, 2015 , predominately all of our investment securities were rated investment-grade. 

We have adopted and our board of directors has approved an investment policy that defines specific limits for asset sectors, single issuer, credit rating, asset duration, industry and geographic concentration and eligible and ineligible investments. Our senior management is responsible for the execution of our investment strategy and compliance with the adopted investment policy, and review investment performance and strategy with the investment committee of the board of directors on a quarterly basis. 

Our current strategy for the investment portfolio is focused primarily on the following: selecting investment-grade, fixed income securities; maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet expected and unexpected financial obligations; mitigating interest rate risk through management of asset durations; continuously monitoring investment quality; and restricting investments to assets that are highly correlated to the residential mortgage market. 

We engage external asset managers to assist with the trading, investment research, investment due diligence and portfolio allocation within the guidelines that we have set. Approximately 92.3% &#32;of our investment assets, excluding cash, were managed by external managers as of December 31, 2015 . Assets not managed by external managers include securities on deposit with state regulatory agencies in connection with the insurance licenses and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agencies. To date, we have not used any derivatives to hedge any investment or business risks that we are currently assuming. We measure investment performance against market benchmarks on both total return and return volatility dimensions. 

See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Financial Condition&#8212;Investments" for information regarding the performance of our investment portfolio. 

Regulation 

Direct U.S. Regulation 

We are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by Federal regulators and state insurance departments. State regulations are principally designed for the protection of the public and our insured policyholders, rather than for the benefit of investors. Although their scope varies, state insurance laws generally grant broad supervisory powers to agencies or to officials to examine insurance companies and to enforce rules or to exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business. 

GSE Qualified Mortgage Insurer Requirements 

Pursuant to their charters, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase or guaranty low down payment loans insured by entities that they determine to be qualified mortgage insurance companies. Our primary insurance subsidiary, Essent Guaranty, Inc., is currently approved by both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a mortgage insurer. 

The FHFA, as the conservator of the GSEs, has the authority to establish the priorities of the GSEs and to control and direct their operations. The FHFA has established a strategic plan for the GSEs, including the development by the GSEs of aligned counterparty risk management standards for mortgage insurers that include uniform master policy and eligibility requirements. 

Effective for mortgage insurance applications received after October 10, 2014, the GSEs have instituted minimum standards for mortgage insurer master policies, including standards relating to limitations of a mortgage insurer's rescission rights. We have received all necessary state approvals and have implemented our new master policy forms as required by the GSEs. See "&#8212;Our Products and Services&#8212;Mortgage Insurance&#8212;Master Policy" above. 

Effective December 31, 2015, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, at the direction of the FHFA, implemented new coordinated Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements, which we refer to as the "PMIERs." The PMIERs represent the standards by which private mortgage insurers are eligible to provide mortgage insurance on loans owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The PMIERs include financial strength requirements incorporating a risk-based framework that require approved insurers to have a sufficient level of liquid assets from which to pay claims. The PMIERs also include enhanced operational performance expectations and define remedial actions that apply should an approved insurer fail to comply with these requirements. As of December 31, 2015 , Essent Guaranty, Inc., our GSE-approved mortgage insurance company, was in compliance with the PMIERs. 

State Insurance Regulation 

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required by the insurance regulatory authority of its state of domicile, and the insurance regulatory authority of each other jurisdiction in which they are licensed to transact business, to make various filings with those insurance regulatory authorities and with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, or NAIC, including quarterly and annual financial statements prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles. We are licensed to write mortgage insurance in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Most states also regulate transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates and have restrictions on transactions that have the effect of inducing lenders to place business with the insurer. For a description of limits on dividends payable to Essent Group Ltd. from our insurance subsidiaries, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources" and Note 10 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements entitled "Dividends Restrictions" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

In general, state regulation of our insurance business relates to: 

&#8226; 

licenses to transact business; 

&#8226; 

producer licensing; 

&#8226; 

approval of policy forms; 

&#8226; 

approval of premium rates; 

&#8226; 

limits on insurable loans; 

&#8226; 

quarterly, annual and other reports on our financial condition; 

&#8226; 

the basis upon which assets and liabilities must be stated; 

&#8226; 

requirements regarding contingency reserves; 

&#8226; 

minimum capital levels and adequacy ratios; 

&#8226; 

limitations on the types of investment instruments which may be held in our investment portfolio; 

&#8226; 

special deposits of securities; 

&#8226; 

limits on dividends payable; 

&#8226; 

advertising compliance; 

&#8226; 

establishment of reserves; 

&#8226; 

claims handling; 

&#8226; 

hazardous financial condition; and 

&#8226; 

enterprise risk management. 

Mortgage insurance premium rates are regulated to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition in the insurance marketplace. Any increase in premium rates must be actuarially justified, generally on the basis of the insurer's loss experience, expenses and future trend analysis. The general mortgage default experience may also be considered. Premium rates are subject to review and approval protocols maintained, and may be the subject of examination, by state regulators. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources" for information about regulations governing our capital adequacy, information about our current capital and our expectations regarding our future capital position. 

The insurance holding company laws and regulations of Pennsylvania, the state in which our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, regulate, among other things, certain transactions between Essent Group Ltd., our insurance subsidiaries and other parties affiliated with us and certain transactions involving our common shares, including transactions that constitute a change of control of Essent Group Ltd. and, consequently, a change of control of our insurance subsidiaries. Specifically, these laws and regulations require that, before a person can acquire direct or indirect control of an insurer domiciled in the state, prior written approval must be obtained from the Pennsylvania Insurance Department. The Pennsylvania Insurance Department is required to consider various factors, including the financial strength of the acquirer, the integrity and management experience of the acquirer's board of directors and executive officers, and the acquirer's plans for the future operations of the reinsurer or insurer. Pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, "control" over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing, 10% or more of the voting securities of that reinsurer or insurer. Indirect ownership includes ownership of our common shares. 

State insurance law, and not Federal bankruptcy law, would apply to any insolvency or financially hazardous condition of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. 

During 2012, the NAIC established a Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Working Group, which we refer to as the "MGIWG," to determine and make recommendations to the NAIC's Financial Condition Committee regarding what, if any, changes are deemed necessary to the solvency regulation of mortgage guaranty insurers. The MGIWG has advanced a draft revised Model Act and has engaged with certain industry members developing a risk-sensitive analytical model to assess and establish capital adequacy levels. The MGIWG has advised us that it would like to conclude its work in 2016. 

Statutory Accounting 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with state-regulated statutory accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. It also requires disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

We are required to establish statutory accounting contingency loss reserves in an amount equal to 50% of our net earned premiums. These amounts generally cannot be withdrawn for a period of 10 years, except as permitted by applicable insurance law and regulations. With regulatory approval, a mortgage guaranty insurance company may make early withdrawals from the contingency reserve when incurred losses exceed 35% of net premiums earned in a calendar year. For further information, see Note 16 &#32;to our consolidated financial statements entitled "Statutory Accounting" included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Federal Mortgage-Related Laws and Regulations 

Certain Federal laws directly or indirectly affect private mortgage insurers. Private mortgage insurers are impacted indirectly by Federal laws and regulations affecting mortgage originators and lenders, purchasers of mortgage loans, such as the GSEs, and governmental insurers such as the FHA and the VA. For example, changes in Federal housing laws and regulation or other laws and regulations that affect the demand for private mortgage insurance may have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, mortgage origination and servicing transactions are subject to compliance with various Federal and state laws, including the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the 

Truth In Lending Act, or TILA, the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, or HOPA, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Among other things, these laws and their implementing regulations prohibit payments for referrals of settlement service business, require fairness and non-discrimination in granting or facilitating the granting of credit, govern the circumstances under which companies may obtain and use consumer credit information, define the manner in which companies may pursue collection activities, and provide for other consumer protections. 

Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which we refer to as the Dodd-Frank Act, amended certain provisions of TILA and RESPA that may have a significant impact on our business prospects. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, a Federal agency created by the Dodd-Frank Act, is charged with implementation and enforcement of these provisions. On January 10, 2014, the CFPB implemented a final rule regarding ability-to-repay, or ATR, and Qualified Mortgage, or QM, standards. Effective December 24, 2015, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Housing and Urban Development adopted a joint final rule to implement the Qualified Residential Mortgage, or QRM, regulations as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB has also published final residential mortgage servicing rules providing for amendments to Regulation Z (promulgated pursuant to TILA) and RESPA. 

Qualified Mortgage Regulations&#8212;Ability To Repay Requirements 

The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products and services under Federal law, including residential mortgages. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB is authorized to issue regulations governing a loan originator's determination that, at the time a loan is originated, the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. The Dodd-Frank Act provides for a statutory presumption that a borrower will have the ability to repay a loan if the loan has characteristics satisfying the QM definition. Creditors who violate the ATR standard can be liable for all interest and fees paid by the borrower as well as actual and statutory damages. Furthermore, the borrower may assert this as a defense by recoupment or set off without regard to any statute of limitation in any foreclosure action initiated by or on behalf of the creditor, assignee or any holder of the mortgage. 

Pursuant to the CFPB's final rule regarding QMs, which we refer to as the QM Rule, a loan is deemed to be a QM if it meets certain specified requirements, including if: 

&#8226; 

the term of the mortgage is less than or equal to 30 years; 

&#8226; 

there is no negative amortization, interest only or balloon features; 

&#8226; 

the lender properly documents the loan in accordance with the requirements; 

&#8226; 

the total "points and fees" do not exceed certain thresholds, generally 3%; and 

&#8226; 

the total debt-to-income ratio does not exceed 43%. 

The QM Rule provides a "safe harbor" for QM loans with annual percentage rates, or APRs, below the threshold of 150 basis points over the Average Prime Offer Rate, or APOR, and a "rebuttable presumption" for QM loans with an APR above that threshold. 

The Dodd-Frank Act separately granted statutory authority to HUD (for FHA-insured loans), the VA (for VA-guaranteed loans) and certain other government agency insurance programs to develop their own definitions of a qualified mortgage in consultation with CFPB. In 2013, HUD adopted a separate definition of a qualified mortgage for loans insured by the FHA. The VA developed its QM definition in 2014. Under both the FHA's and the VA's QM standards, certain loans which would not qualify as QM loans in the conventional market would still be deemed to be QM loans if insured or guaranteed by FHA or VA. As a result, lenders may favor the use of FHA or VA insurance to achieve the legal protections of a making a QM loan through these agencies, even if the same loan could be made at the same or lower cost to the borrower using private mortgage insurance, which could adversely impact our business. To the extent that the other government agencies adopt their own 

definitions of a QM which are more favorable to lenders and mortgage holders than those applicable to the market in which we operate, our business may be adversely affected. 

The QM Rule also provides for a second, temporary category that allows for more flexible underwriting requirements. To qualify under the temporary QM definition, a mortgage must meet the general product feature requirements and be eligible to be purchased or guaranteed by either of the GSEs (while they remain under FHFA conservatorship), the FHA, the VA, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development program. This temporary QM category expires on January 10, 2021, or earlier if the Federal agencies issue their own qualified mortgage rules or, with respect to GSEs, if the FHFA's conservatorship ends. Since January 10, 2014, the GSEs have limited their purchases to loans that meet certain QM criteria, namely loans that are fully amortizing, have terms of 30 years or less, and have points and fees representing 3% or less of the total loan amount. 

Under the QM Rule, mortgage insurance premiums that are payable by the consumer at or prior to consummation of the loan are includible in the calculation of points and fees unless, and to the extent that the up-front premiums, or UFPs, are (i) less than or equal to the UFPs charged by the FHA, and (ii) are automatically refundable on a pro rata basis upon satisfaction of the loan. Our borrower-paid single premium products, both refundable and non-refundable, may be includible within the points and fees calculation under the QM Rule. As noted above, the QM Rule includes a limitation on points and fees in excess of 3% of the total loan amount. Because inclusion of mortgage insurance premiums in the calculation of points and fees will reduce the capacity for other points and fees in order for lenders to comply with the cap, mortgage originators may be less likely to utilize borrower-paid single premium mortgage insurance products. Even where the mortgage insurance premium is not directly included in the calculation of points and fees, it may limit the ability of the lender to charge other points and fees. The treatment of mortgage insurance premiums as a component of the points and fees calculation, or the potential indirect impact of mortgage insurance premiums on the total points and fees, may be a key determinant of whether a loan is in the safe harbor, receives a rebuttable presumption of ability to repay, or receives no presumption. As a result, the QM Rule may decrease demand for certain of our single premium products and may increase demand for monthly, annual and "split" premium mortgage insurance products that do not impact or have a smaller impact on the points and fees. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations&#8212;Persistency and Business Mix." 

Although some large lenders have announced plans to originate loans that do not qualify as QMs, we expect that most lenders will continue to be reluctant to make non-QM loans because they will not be entitled to the presumption against civil liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, and mortgage investors may be reluctant to purchase mortgages or mortgage-backed securities that are not QMs due to potential assignee liability for such loans. As a result, we believe that the QM regulations will have a direct impact on establishing a subset of borrowers who can meet the regulatory standards and will directly affect the willingness of lenders and mortgage investors to extend mortgage credit and therefore the size of the residential mortgage market. Our business prospects and operating results could be adversely impacted if, and to the extent that, the QM regulations reduce the size of the origination market, reduce the willingness of lenders to extend low down payment credit, favor alternatives to private mortgage insurance such as government mortgage insurance programs, or change the mix of our business in ways that may be unfavorable to us. See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212; Our business prospects and operating results could be adversely impacted if, and to the extent that, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's ("CFPB") final rule defining a qualified mortgage ("QM") reduces the size of the origination market or creates incentives to use government mortgage insurance programs." 

Qualified Residential Mortgage Regulations&#8212;Risk Retention Requirements 

The Dodd-Frank Act generally requires an issuer of an asset-backed security or a person who organizes and initiates an asset-backed transaction (a "securitizer") to retain at least 5% of the risk associated with securitized mortgage loans, although in some cases the retained risk may be allocated between the securitizer and the mortgage originator. This risk retention requirement does not apply to a mortgage loan that is a "qualified residential mortgage," or a "QRM," or that is insured or guaranteed by the FHA or other specified Federal agencies. 

The QRM regulations, which became effective on December 24, 2015, align the definition of a QRM loan with that of a QM loan. Given the alignment of the QRM definition to QM, unless the QRM or QM definitions are revised we expect little or no adverse impact to our current business from the final QRM standards. If, however, the QRM definition is changed (or the QM definition is amended) in a manner that is unfavorable to us, such as to give no consideration to mortgage insurance in computing LTV or to require a large down payment for a loan to qualify as a QRM, the attractiveness of originating and securitizing loans with lower down payments may be reduced, which may adversely affect the future demand for mortgage insurance. See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212; The amount of insurance we write could be adversely affected by the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act's risk retention requirements and the definition of Qualified Residential Mortgage ("QRM"). " 

Mortgage Servicing Rules 

The Dodd-Frank Act amended and expanded upon mortgage servicing requirements under TILA and RESPA, and in 2014 the CFPB amended Regulation Z (promulgated pursuant to TILA) and Regulation X (promulgated pursuant to RESPA) to conform these regulations accordingly. Included within these rules are new or enhanced requirements for handling escrow accounts, responding to borrower assertions of error and inquiries from borrower, special handling of loans that are in default, and loss mitigation in the event of borrower default. A provision of the required loss mitigation procedures prohibits the loan holder or servicer from commencing foreclosure until 120 days after the borrower's delinquency. Complying with the new rules could cause the servicing of mortgage loans to become more burdensome and costly than it had been prior to the implementation of these rules. As to servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies, these rules could contribute to delays in realization upon collateral and have an adverse impact on resolution of claims. 

Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 

The Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, or HOPA, provides for the automatic termination, or cancellation upon a borrower's request, of private mortgage insurance upon satisfaction of certain conditions. HOPA requires that lenders give borrowers certain notices with regard to the automatic termination or cancellation of mortgage insurance. These provisions apply to borrower-paid mortgage insurance for purchase money, refinance and construction loans secured by the borrower's principal dwelling. FHA and VA loans are not covered by HOPA. Under HOPA, automatic termination of mortgage insurance would generally occur when the mortgage is first scheduled to reach an LTV of 78% of the home's original value, assuming that the borrower is current on the required mortgage payments. A borrower who has a "good payment history," as defined by HOPA, may generally request cancellation of mortgage insurance when the LTV is first scheduled to reach 80% of the home's original value or when actual payments reduce the loan balance to 80% of the home's original value, whichever occurs earlier. If mortgage insurance coverage is not cancelled at the borrower's request or by the automatic termination provision, the mortgage servicer must terminate mortgage insurance coverage by the first day of the month following the date that is the midpoint of the loan's amortization, assuming the borrower is current on the required mortgage payments. 

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 

Mortgage insurance generally may be considered to be a "settlement service" for purposes of RESPA under applicable regulations. Subject to limited exceptions, RESPA prohibits persons from giving or accepting anything of value in connection with the referral of a settlement service. RESPA authorizes the CFPB, the U.S. Department of Justice, state attorneys general and state insurance commissioners to bring civil enforcement actions, and also provides for criminal penalties and private rights of action. In the past, a number of lawsuits have challenged the actions of private mortgage insurers under RESPA, alleging that the insurers have violated the referral fee prohibition by entering into captive reinsurance arrangements or providing products or services to mortgage lenders at improperly reduced prices in return for the referral of mortgage insurance, including the provision of contract underwriting services. In addition to these private lawsuits, other private mortgage insurance companies have received "Civil Investigative Demands" from the CFPB as part of its investigation to determine whether mortgage lenders and mortgage insurance providers engaged in acts or practices in connection with their captive mortgage insurance arrangements in violation of the RESPA, the Consumer Financial Protection Act and the Dodd-Frank Act. Our primary insurance subsidiary received such an inquiry from the CFPB in January 2012; however, we do not currently have nor have we ever had any such captive reinsurance arrangements. In April 2013, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida approved consent orders issued by the CFPB against four other private mortgage insurers relating to captive reinsurance, and a settlement with a fifth private mortgage insurer was announced in November 2013. Under the settlements as approved, the mortgage insurers agreed to end the challenged practices, pay monetary penalties, and be subject to monitoring by the CFPB and are required to make reports to the CFPB in order to ensure their compliance with the provisions of the orders. Although we did not participate in the practices that were the subject of the CFPB investigation, the private mortgage industry and our insurance subsidiaries are, and likely will continue to be, subject to substantial Federal and state regulation, which has increased in recent years as a result of the deterioration of the housing and mortgage markets in the U.S. Increased Federal or state regulatory scrutiny could lead to new legal precedents, new regulations or new practices, or regulatory actions or investigations, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. 

SAFE Act (Mortgage Loan Originator Licensing) 

The SAFE Act requires mortgage loan originators to be licensed and/or registered with the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System and Registry, or the NMLS. The NMLS is a database established by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators. Among other things, the database was established to support the licensing of mortgage loan originators by each state. As part of this licensing and registration process, loan originators who are employees of institutions other than depository institutions or certain of their subsidiaries that are 

regulated by a Federal banking agency, must generally be licensed under the SAFE Act guidelines enacted by each state in which they engage in loan originator activities and registered with the NMLS. The SAFE Act generally prohibits employees of a depository institution (including certain of their subsidiaries that are regulated by a Federal banking agency) from originating residential mortgage loans without first registering with the NMLS and maintaining that registration. Certain of our underwriters are licensed pursuant to the SAFE Act. 

Privacy and Information Security 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, or GLB, imposes privacy requirements on financial institutions, including obligations to protect and safeguard consumers' nonpublic personal information and records, and limitations on the re-use of such information. Federal regulatory agencies have issued the Interagency Guidelines Establishing Information Security Standards, or "Security Guidelines," and interagency regulations regarding financial privacy, or "Privacy Rule," implementing sections of GLB. The Security Guidelines establish standards relating to administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure the security, confidentiality, integrity, and the proper disposal of consumer information. The Privacy Rule limits a financial institution's disclosure of nonpublic personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless certain notice requirements are met and the consumer does not elect to prevent or "opt out" of the disclosure. The Privacy Rule also requires that privacy notices provided to customers and consumers describe the financial institutions' policies and practices to protect the confidentiality and security of the information. With respect to our business, GLB is enforced by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and state insurance regulators. Many states have enacted legislation implementing GLB and establishing information security regulation. Many states have enacted privacy and data security laws which impose compliance obligations beyond GLB, including obligations to protect social security numbers and provide notification in the event that a security breach results in a reasonable belief that unauthorized persons may have obtained access to consumer nonpublic information. 

Fair Credit Reporting Act 

The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, as amended, or FCRA, imposes restrictions on the permissible use of credit report information. FCRA has been interpreted by some FTC staff and Federal courts to require mortgage insurance companies to provide "adverse action" notices to consumers in the event an application for mortgage insurance is declined or offered at less than the best available rate for the loan program applied for on the basis of a review of the consumer's credit. We provide such notices as required. Although we have not been involved, there has been class action litigation over these FCRA adverse action notices involving the mortgage insurance industry, including court-approved settlements. 

Housing Finance Reform 

Presently, the Federal government plays a dominant role in the U.S. housing finance system through the involvement of the GSEs and the FHA, VA and Ginnie Mae. There is broad policy consensus toward the need for private capital to play a larger role and government credit risk to be reduced. However, to date there has been a lack of consensus with regard to the specific changes necessary to return a larger role for private capital and how small the eventual role of government should become. Since the GSEs were placed into conservatorship in September 2008, there have been a wide ranging set of GSE and secondary market reform advocacy proposals put forward, including nearly complete privatization and elimination of the role of the GSEs, recapitalization of the GSEs and a number of alternatives that combine a Federal role with private capital, some of which eliminate the GSEs and others of which envision an on-going role for the GSEs. Since 2011, a number of comprehensive GSE/secondary market legislative reform bills have also been introduced or discussed in the U.S. Congress, differing with regard to the future role of the GSEs, the overall structure of the secondary market and the role of the Federal government within the mortgage market. In addition, the size, complexity and centrality of the GSEs to the current housing finance system and the importance of housing to the economy make the transition to any new housing finance system difficult. 

The placement of the GSEs into the conservatorship of the FHFA increases the likelihood that the U.S. Congress will address the role and purpose of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market and potentially legislate structural and other changes to the GSEs and the functioning of the secondary mortgage market. New Federal legislation could reduce the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the GSEs as credit enhancement, eliminate the requirement altogether or otherwise alter or eliminate the role of the GSEs, and thereby materially affect our ability to compete, demand for our products and the profitability of our business. 

There can be no assurance that other Federal laws and regulations affecting these institutions and entities will not change, or that new legislation or regulations will not be adopted that will adversely affect the private mortgage insurance industry. See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212; Legislative or regulatory actions or decisions to change the role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, or changes to the charters of the GSEs with regard to the use of credit enhancements generally and private mortgage insurance specifically, could reduce our revenues or adversely affect our profitability and 

returns " and "&#8212; Changes in the business practices of the GSEs, including actions or decisions to decrease or discontinue the use of mortgage insurance or changes in the GSEs' eligibility requirements for mortgage insurers, could reduce our revenues or adversely affect our profitability and returns. " 

Mortgage Insurance Tax Deduction 

In 2006, Congress enacted the private mortgage insurance tax deduction in order to foster homeownership. The deduction was enacted on a temporary basis and it expired at the end of 2011. Since 2011, the private mortgage insurance tax deduction has been extended three times, most recently for 2015 and through December 31, 2016. Legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time to extend the deduction for mortgage insurance premiums permanently, however, we cannot predict whether the tax deduction will be made permanent and if not, whether it will be extended for tax years after 2016. 

FHA Reform 

We compete with the single-family mortgage insurance programs of the FHA, which is part of HUD. The most recent FHA report to Congress dated November 16, 2015 &#32;on the financial status of the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, or MMIF, showed the capital reserve ratio of the MMIF at 2.07% , just above the Congressionally mandated required minimum level of 2%. As a result of the financial improvements in the condition of the MMIF over the past few years and the stated desire to support the housing recovery, the FHA reduced its mortgage insurance premiums by 50 basis points in January 2015. 

Federal Insurance Office 

On December 9, 2013, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Federal Insurance Office released a report entitled "How to Modernize and Improve the System of Insurance Regulation in the United States." This report, which was mandated by Title V of the Dodd-Frank Act, states that that mortgage insurance is "interconnected with other aspects of the federal housing finance system" and will be "an important component of any reform package as an alternative way to place private capital in front of any taxpayer risk." Given this role, the report recommends "national solvency and business practice standards" for mortgage insurers to ensure "confidence in the solvency and performance of housing finance." To the extent any such Federal oversight or standards as may be established exceed the current standards and oversight represented by the overlay of FHFA and GSE-driven eligibility requirements and the direct prudential and solvency regulatory and supervisory oversight of state insurance commissioners, it may adversely affect the results of our business operations. 

Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 

We employ an in-house lobbyist in order to engage in the public policy debates that have been referred to herein, and accordingly have registered with the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives as required by the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The Lobbying Disclosure Act requires initial registration and periodic reports relative to an organization's Federal lobbying activities and expenditures. 

Basel III 

In 1988, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which we refer to as the "Basel Committee," developed the Basel Capital Accord, which we refer to as "Basel I," which set out international benchmarks for assessing banks' capital adequacy requirements. In 2005, the Basel Committee issued Basel II, which, among other things, governs the capital treatment of mortgage insurance purchased and held on balance sheet by banks in respect of their origination and securitization activities. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approved publication of the Basel III Rules, which govern almost all U.S. banking organizations regardless of size or business model. The Basel III Rules revise and enhance the Federal banking agencies' general risk-based capital, advanced approaches and leverage rules. The Basel III Rules became effective on January 1, 2014, with a mandatory compliance date of January 1, 2015 for banking organizations other than advanced approaches banking organizations that are not savings and loan holding companies. On January 1, 2014, most banking organizations became required to begin a multi-year transition period to the full implementation of the new capital framework. The effective date and compliance period, and the beginning of the transitional period, is January 1, 2014 for advanced approaches banking organizations that are not savings and loan holding companies. 

The Federal banking agencies' proposed rule to implement Basel III in the United States would have made extensive changes to the capital requirements for residential mortgages. In addition, the proposed rule would have eliminated existing capital recognition for certain low down payment mortgages if covered by mortgage insurance. After consideration of extensive comments with regard to the proposed capital rules for residential mortgages, the Federal banking agencies revised the Basel III 

Rules to retain the treatment for residential mortgage exposures under the general risk-based capital rules and the treatment of mortgage insurance. Consistent with such rules, the Basel III Rules assign a 50% or 100% risk weight to loans secured by one-to-four-family residential properties. Generally, residential mortgage exposures secured by a first lien on a one-to-four family residential property that are prudently underwritten and that are performing according to their original terms receive a 50% risk weighting. All other one-to-four family residential mortgage loans are assigned a 100% risk weight. The Basel III Rules continue to afford FHA-insured loans a lower risk weighting than low down payment loans insured with private mortgage insurance, and Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities are afforded a lower risk weighting than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities. 

If implementation of the Basel III Rules increases the capital requirements of banking organizations with respect to the residential mortgages we insure, it could adversely affect the size of the portfolio lending market, which in turn would reduce the demand for our mortgage insurance. If the Federal banking agencies revise the Basel III Rules to reduce or eliminate the capital benefit banks receive from insuring low down payment loans with private mortgage insurance, or if our bank customers believe that such adverse changes may occur at some time in the future, our current and future business may be adversely affected. In addition, with regard to the separate Basel III Rules applicable to general credit risk mitigation for banking exposures, insurance companies engaged predominantly in the business of providing credit protection, such as private mortgage insurance companies, are not eligible guarantors, which could affect our business prospects. 

See "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8212; The implementation of the Basel III Capital Accord, or other changes to our customers' capital requirements, may discourage the use of mortgage insurance ." 

Banking Regulation 

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., which holds interests in us both directly and through its affiliates, is a bank holding company and regulated as a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act, or the BHC Act. Due to the size of its voting and economic interests in us, we are deemed to be controlled by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., and are therefore considered to be a non-bank subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., under the BHC Act. As a result, although we do not engage in banking operations, we are subject to regulation, supervision, examination and potential enforcement action by the Federal Reserve and to certain banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. In addition, we are subject to the examination authority of, and may be required to submit reports to, the CFPB because we are an affiliate of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, which is an insured depository institution with more than $10 billion in assets. The bank regulatory framework is intended primarily to protect depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the safety and soundness of depository institutions and the financial system as a whole, rather than our shareholders. Because of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s status as a bank holding company, we have agreed to certain restrictions on our activities imposed by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. that are intended to facilitate its compliance with the BHC Act. For a discussion of these restrictions, see "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence" elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

We will remain subject to this regulatory regime until The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is no longer deemed to control us for bank regulatory purposes, which we do not generally have the ability to control and which will not occur until The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. has significantly reduced its voting and economic interests in us. We cannot predict the ownership level at which the Federal Reserve would consider us no longer to be controlled by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 

The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its non-bank subsidiaries, including Essent, generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a bank holding company or a financial holding company under the BHC Act. The scope of services we may provide to our customers is limited under the BHC Act to those which are (i) financial in nature or incidental to financial activities (including insurance underwriting and selling insurance as agent or broker such as our activity of offering private mortgage insurance and reinsurance coverage for single-family mortgage loans), or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and which do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. Any failure of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on our activities and our growth. In particular, our permissible activities could be further restricted to only those that constitute banking or activities closely related to banking. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s loss of its financial holding company status could be caused by several factors, including any failure by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s bank subsidiaries to remain sufficiently capitalized, by any examination downgrade of one of The Goldman Sachs Group's bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act broadened the requirements for maintaining financial holding company status by also requiring the holding company to remain well capitalized and well managed. We have no ability to prevent such occurrences from happening nor can we control whether The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. remains well capitalized and well managed. 

The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over us, including the power to prohibit us from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve's opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting our business. The Federal Reserve may approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthened the Federal Reserve's supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company's non-bank affiliates. 

There are limits on the ability of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s bank subsidiaries to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with us. In general, any loans to us from a bank subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. must be on market terms and secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and are limited to 10% of the lending bank's capital stock and surplus. Statutory changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act will place certain additional restrictions on transactions between us and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. in the future, which we do not expect to be material to us. 

Bermuda Insurance Regulation 

The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended, or the Insurance Act, regulates the insurance business of our Bermuda-based reinsurance subsidiary, Essent Reinsurance Ltd., and provides that no person may carry on any insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, or the BMA. In deciding whether to grant registration, the BMA has broad discretion to act as it thinks fit in the public interest. The BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise to operate an insurance business. In addition, the BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether a person who proposes to control 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% (as applicable) of the voting powers of a Bermuda-registered insurer or its parent company is a fit and proper person to exercise such degree of control. 

The continued registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to the applicant complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose from time to time. The Insurance Act also grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. 

The Insurance Act imposes on Bermuda insurance companies solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements. Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework are set forth below. 

Classification of Insurers 

The Insurance Act distinguishes between insurers carrying on long-term business, insurers carrying on special purpose business and insurers carrying on general business. There are six classifications of insurers carrying on general business (Classes 1, 2, 3, 3A, 3B, and 4) with Class 1 insurers subject to the lightest regulation and Class 4 insurers subject to the strictest regulation. 

Essent Reinsurance Ltd., which is incorporated in Bermuda to carry on general insurance and reinsurance business, is registered as a Class 3A insurer in Bermuda and is regulated as such under the Insurance Act. We are not, however, licensed in Bermuda to carry on long-term business. Long-term business broadly includes life insurance and disability insurance with terms in excess of five years. General business broadly includes all types of insurance that is not long-term business. 

Cancellation of Insurer's Registration 

An insurer's registration may be cancelled by the BMA on certain grounds specified in the Insurance Act. Failure of the insurer to comply with its obligations under the Insurance Act or if, the BMA believes that the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles, would be such grounds. 

Principal Representative 

An insurer is required to maintain a principal office in Bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda. For the purpose of the Insurance Act, Essent Reinsurance Ltd.'s principal representative is Kane (Bermuda) Limited and its principal office for these purposes is the offices of Kane. Without a reason acceptable to the BMA, an insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal representative, and the principal representative may not cease to act as such, unless 30 days' notice in writing to the BMA is given of the intention to do so. It is the duty of the principal representative to forthwith 

notify the BMA where the principal representative believes there is a likelihood of the insurer (for which the principal representative acts) becoming insolvent or that a reportable "event" has, to the principal representative's knowledge, occurred or is believed to have occurred. Examples of such a reportable "event" include failure by the insurer to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon the insurer by the BMA relating to a solvency margin or a liquidity or other ratio. Within 14 days of such notification to the BMA, the principal representative must furnish the BMA with a written report setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to the principal representative. 

Independent Approved Auditor 

A Class 3A insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will annually audit and report on the insurer's financial statements prepared under generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards, statutory financial statements and statutory financial returns each of which are required to be filed annually with the BMA. The auditor must be approved by the BMA as the independent auditor of the insurer. If the insurer fails to appoint an approved auditor or at any time fails to fill a vacancy for such auditor, the BMA may appoint an approved auditor for the insurer and shall fix the remuneration to be paid to the approved auditor within 14 days, if not agreed sooner by the insurer and the auditor. 

Loss Reserve Specialist 

A Class 3A insurer is required to submit an opinion of its approved loss reserve specialist with its statutory financial return in respect of its losses and loss expenses provisions. The loss reserve specialist will normally be a qualified casualty actuary and must be approved by the BMA. 

Annual Financial Statements 

A Class 3A insurer is required to prepare annual GAAP financial statements and statutory financial statements. The Insurance Act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of statutory financial statements (which include, in statutory form, a balance sheet, income statement, a statement of capital and surplus, and notes thereto). The statutory financial statements include detailed information and analysis regarding premiums, claims, reinsurance and investments of the insurer. An insurer is required to file with the BMA the annual GAAP financial statements and statutory financial statements within four months from the end of the relevant financial year (unless specifically extended). The statutory financial statements do not form part of the public records maintained by the BMA but the GAAP financial statements are available for public inspection. 

Annual Statutory Financial Return 

An insurer is required to file with the BMA a statutory financial return no later than four months after its financial year end (unless specifically extended). The statutory financial return includes, among other matters, a report of the approved independent auditor on the statutory financial statements of the insurer, a general business solvency certificate, the statutory financial statements themselves and the opinion of the loss reserve specialist. The principal representative and at least two directors of the insurer must sign the solvency certificate. The directors are required to certify whether the minimum solvency margin has been met, and the independent approved auditor is required to state whether in its opinion it was reasonable for the directors to so certify. Where an insurer's accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the Insurance Act, a statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return. The statutory financial return is not available for public inspection. 

Minimum Solvency Margin, Enhanced Capital Requirement and Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions 

A Class 3A insurer must maintain at all times a solvency margin and an enhanced capital requirement in accordance with the provisions of the Insurance Act. Each year the insurer is required to file with the BMA a capital and solvency return within four months of its relevant financial year end (unless specifically extended). The prescribed form of capital and solvency return comprises the insurer's Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement model, a schedule of fixed income investments by rating categories, a schedule of net loss and loss expense provisions by line of business, a schedule of premiums written by line of business, a schedule of risk management and a schedule of fixed income securities. 

The Insurance Act mandates certain actions and filings with the BMA if a Class 3A insurer fails to meet and/or maintain its enhanced capital requirement or solvency margin including the filing of a written report detailing the circumstances giving rise to the failure and the manner and time within which the insurer intends to rectify the failure. A Class 3A insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if in breach of its enhanced capital requirement, solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach. Where an insurer fails to meet its solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, it is prohibited from declaring or paying any 

dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the BMA. Class 3A insurers must obtain the BMA's prior approval for a reduction by 15% or more of the total statutory capital as set forth in its previous year's financial statements. These restrictions on declaring or paying dividends and distributions under the Insurance Act are in addition to those under the Companies Act which apply to all Bermuda companies. 

Minimum Liquidity Ratio 

The Insurance Act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business. An insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities. Relevant assets include cash and time deposits, quoted investments, unquoted bonds and debentures, first liens on real estate, investment income due and accrued, accounts and premiums receivable and reinsurance balances receivable. 

There are certain categories of assets which, unless specifically permitted by the BMA, do not automatically qualify as relevant assets, such as unquoted equity securities, investments in and advances to affiliates and real estate and collateral loans. 

The relevant liabilities are total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities less deferred income tax and sundry liabilities (by interpretation, those not specifically defined). 

Supervision, Investigation and Intervention 

The BMA may appoint an inspector with powers to investigate the affairs of an insurer if the BMA believes that an investigation is required in the interests of the insurer's policyholders or potential policyholders. In order to verify or supplement information otherwise provided to the inspector, the BMA may direct an insurer to produce documents or information relating to matters connected with its business. 

An inspector may examine on oath any past or present officer, employee or insurance manager of the insurer under investigation in relation to its business and apply to the court in Bermuda for an order that other persons may also be examined on any matter relevant to the investigation. It shall be the duty of any insurer in relation to whose affairs an inspector has been appointed and of any past or present officer, employee or insurance manager of such insurer, to produce to the inspector on request all books, records and documents relating to the insurer under investigation which are in its or his custody or control and otherwise to give to the inspector all assistance in connection with the investigation which it or he is reasonably able to give. 

If it appears to the BMA that there is a risk of an insurer becoming insolvent, or that it is in breach of the Insurance Act or any conditions imposed upon its registration, the BMA may, among other things, direct the insurer (1) not to take on any new insurance business, (2) not to vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase its liabilities, (3) not to make certain investments, (4) to realize certain investments, (5) to maintain or transfer to the custody of a specified bank, certain assets, (6) not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions or to restrict the making of such payments (7) to limit its premium income, (8) not to enter into any specified transaction with any specified persons or persons of a specified class, (9) to provide such written particulars relating to the financial circumstances of the insurer as the BMA thinks fit, (10) to obtain the opinion of a loss reserve specialist and to submit it to the BMA and (11) to remove a controller or officer. 

Disclosure of Information 

In addition to powers under the Insurance Act to investigate the affairs of an insurer, the BMA may require certain information from an insurer (or certain other persons) to be produced to the BMA. Further, the BMA has been given powers to assist other regulatory authorities, including foreign insurance regulatory authorities, with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda but subject to restrictions. For example, the BMA must be satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities of the foreign regulatory authority. Further, the BMA must consider whether cooperation is in the public interest. The grounds for disclosure are limited and the Insurance Act provides for sanctions for breach of the statutory duty of confidentiality. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 366 &#32;employees, including 362 &#32;employees based in the United States and 4 &#32;employees in Bermuda. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good. We also periodically engage contractors who provide services to us on a temporary basis.
