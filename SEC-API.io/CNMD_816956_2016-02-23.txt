General 

&#160; 

CONMED Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1970. CONMED is a medical technology company that provides surgical devices and equipment for minimally invasive procedures. The Company&#8217;s products are used by surgeons and physicians in a variety of specialties including orthopedics, general surgery, gynecology, neurosurgery and gastroenterology. Headquartered in Utica, New York, the Company&#8217;s 3,400 &#32;employees distribute its products worldwide from several manufacturing locations. 

We have historically used strategic business acquisitions and exclusive distribution relationships to diversify our product offerings, increase our market share in certain product lines, realize economies of scale and take advantage of growth opportunities in the healthcare field. 

&#160; 

We are committed to offering products with the highest standards of quality, technological excellence and customer service. Substantially all of our facilities have attained certification under the ISO international quality standards and other domestic and international quality accreditations. 

&#160; 

Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports are accessible free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website ( http://www.conmed.com ) as soon as practicable after such materials have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Our SEC filings are also available for reading and copying at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site (http:/www.sec.gov) containing reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. 

&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our principal objectives are to improve the quality of surgical outcomes and patient care through the development of innovative medical devices, the refinement of existing products and the development of new technologies which reduce risk, trauma, cost and procedure time. We believe that by meeting these objectives we will enhance our ability to anticipate and adapt to customer needs and market opportunities, and provide shareholders with superior investment returns. We intend to achieve future growth and earnings through the following initiatives: 

&#8226; 

Introduction of New Products and Product Enhancements. We continually pursue organic growth through the development of new products and enhancements to existing products. We seek to develop new technologies which improve the durability, performance and usability of existing products. In addition to our internal research and development efforts, we receive new ideas for products and technologies, particularly in procedure-specific areas, from surgeons, inventors and other healthcare professionals. 

&#8226; 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions. We pursue strategic acquisitions, distribution and similar arrangements in existing and new growth markets to achieve increased operating efficiencies, geographic diversification and market penetration. Targeted companies have historically included those with proven technologies and established brand names which provide potential sales, marketing and manufacturing synergies. This includes the January 4, 2016 acquisition of SurgiQuest, Inc. ("SurgiQuest") as further described in Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#8226; 

Realize Manufacturing and Operating Efficiencies. We continually review our production systems for opportunities to reduce operating costs, consolidate product lines or identical process flows, reduce inventory requirements and optimize existing processes. Our vertically integrated manufacturing facilities allow for further opportunities to reduce overhead, increase operating efficiencies and capacity utilization. 

&#8226; 

Geographic Diversification. We believe that significant growth opportunities exist for our surgical products outside the United States. Principal foreign markets for our products include Europe, Latin America and Asia/Pacific Rim. Critical elements of our future sales growth in these markets include leveraging our existing relationships with foreign surgeons, hospitals, third-party payers and foreign distributors (including sub-distributors and sales agents), maintaining an appropriate presence in emerging market countries and continually evaluating our routes-to-market. 

&#8226; 

Active Participation in the Medical Community. We believe that excellent working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry enable us to gain an understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives, trends and emerging opportunities. Active participation allows us to quickly respond to the changing needs of physicians and patients. In addition, we are an active sponsor of medical education both in the United States and internationally, offering training on new and innovative surgical techniques as well as other medical education materials for use with our products.

Orthopedic Surgery 

A significant portion of our business is derived from sales in our orthopedic surgery product lines, including sports medicine, powered surgical instruments, and sports biologics and tissue. These lines are marketed under a number of brands, including Hall &#174; , CONMED Linvatec &#174; , Concept &#174; &#32;and Shutt &#174; . 

We offer a comprehensive range of devices and products to repair injuries which have occurred in the articulating joint areas of the body. Many of these injuries are the result of sports related events or similar traumas. Our sports medicine products include powered resection instruments, arthroscopes, reconstructive systems, tissue repair sets, metal and bioabsorbable implants as well as related disposable products and fluid management systems. It is our standard practice to place some of these products, such as shaver consoles and pumps, with certain customers at no charge in exchange for commitments to purchase disposable products over certain time periods. This capital equipment is loaned and subject to return if certain minimum single-use purchases are not met. Single-use products include products such as shaver blades, burs and pump tubing. We have benefited from the introduction of new arthroscopic products and technologies, such as bioabsorbable screws, &#8220;push-in&#8221; and &#8220;screw-in&#8221; suture anchors and resection shavers. 

In sports medicine, we compete with Smith &#38; Nephew, plc; Arthrex, Inc.; Stryker Corporation; Johnson &#38; Johnson: DePuy Mitek, Inc. and Zimmer Biomet, Inc. 

Our powered instruments offering is sold principally under the Hall &#174; &#32;Surgical brand name, for use in large and small bone orthopedic, arthroscopic, oral/maxillofacial, podiatric, plastic, ENT, neurological, spinal and cardiothoracic surgeries. Our newest product is the Hall 50&#8482; Powered Instrument System, specifically designed to meet the requirements of most orthopedic applications. The modularity and versatility of the Hall 50&#8482; Powered Instrument System allows a facility to purchase a single power system to perform total joint arthroplasty, trauma, arthroscopy and some small bone procedures. 

In powered instruments, our competition includes Stryker Corporation; Medtronic plc, (Midas Rex and Xomed divisions); Johnson &#38; Johnson: DePuy Synthes, Inc.; MicroAire Surgical Instruments, LLC, and Zimmer Holdings, Inc. 

As more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on January 3, 2012, the Company entered into the Sports Medicine Joint Development and Distribution Agreement (the "JDDA") with Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (&#8220;MTF&#8221;) to obtain MTF's worldwide promotion rights with respect to allograft tissues within the field of sports medicine and related products. Under the terms of this agreement, we are now the exclusive worldwide promoter of these allograft tissues, which includes the reconstruction and/or replacement of tendon, ligament, cartilage or menisci, along with the correction of deformities within the extremities. 

General Surgery 

Our general surgery product line offers a large range of products in the areas of advanced surgical, endoscopic technologies, and critical care. 

Our advanced surgical product offering includes an extensive line of state-of-the-art electrosurgical generators, handpieces, smoke management systems and accessories. Our endomechanical instrumentation products offer a full line of instruments including trocars, suction irrigation devices, graspers, scissors and dissectors used in minimally invasive surgery. We offer a unique and premium uterine manipulator called VCARE &#174; &#32;for use in increasing the efficiency of laparoscopic hysterectomies and other gynecologic laparoscopic procedures. Our competition includes Medtronic plc: Covidien; Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc.; ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH; Megadyne; Johnson &#38; Johnson: and Applied Medical Resources Corporation. 

On January 4, 2016, we acquired SurgiQuest for $265 million in cash (on a cash-free, debt-free basis). SurgiQuest develops, manufactures and markets the AirSeal &#174; &#32;System, the first integrated access management technology for use in laparoscopic 

and robotic procedures. This proprietary and differentiated access system is complementary to our current advanced surgical offering. 

Our endoscopic technologies offering includes a comprehensive line of minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic products used in conjunction with procedures which require flexible endoscopy. This offering includes mucosal management devices, forceps, scope management accessories, bronchoscopy devices, dilatation, stricture management devices, hemostasis, biliary devices and polypectomy. Our competition includes Boston Scientific Corporation - Endoscopy; Cook Medical, Inc.; Merit Medical Endotek; Olympus, Inc.; STERIS Corporation - U.S. Endoscopy; and EndoChoice, Inc. 

Our critical care offering includes a line of vital signs and cardiac monitoring products including pulse oximetry sensors, ECG electrodes &#38; accessories, and cardiac defibrillation &#38; pacing pads. We also offer a complete line of suction instruments and tubing that are used throughout all areas of the hospital as well as in Ambulatory Surgery Centers and the emergency medical market. In addition, we offer a line of IV products for use in the critical care areas of the hospital and the emergency medical market. This offering's competition includes Medtronic plc: (Covidien Ltd) and 3M Company. 

Surgical Visualization 

Our surgical visualization product line offers imaging systems for use in minimally invasive orthopedic and general surgery procedures including 2DHD and 3DHD vision technologies. Competition includes Smith &#38; Nephew, plc; Arthrex, Inc.; Stryker Corporation; Olympus, Inc.; Richard Wolf and Karl Storz GmbH. 

International 

Maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth plan. Our products are sold in over 100 foreign countries. International sales efforts are coordinated through local country dealers (including sub-distributors or sales agents) or through direct in-country sales. We distribute our products through sales subsidiaries and branches with offices located in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In these countries, our sales are denominated in the local currency and amounted to approximately 34% &#32;of our total net sales in 2015 . In the remaining countries where our products are sold through independent distributors, sales are denominated in United States dollars. 

Competition 

We compete in orthopedic, surgical visualization and general surgery medical device markets across the world. Our competitors range from large manufacturers with multiple business units to smaller manufacturers with limited product offerings. We believe we have appropriate product offerings and adequate market share to compete effectively in these markets. The global markets are constantly changing due to technological advances. We seek to closely align our research and development with our key business objectives, namely developing and improving products and processes, applying innovative technology to the manufacture of products for new global markets and reducing the cost of producing core products. 

The breadth of our product lines in our key product areas enables us to meet a wide range of customer requirements and preferences. This has enhanced our ability to market our products to surgeons, hospitals, surgery centers, group purchasing organizations ("GPOs"), integrated delivery networks ("IDNs") and other customers, particularly as institutions seek to reduce costs and minimize the number of suppliers. 

Marketing 

A significant portion of our products are distributed domestically directly to more than 6,000 hospitals and other healthcare institutions as well as through medical specialty distributors. We are not dependent on any single customer and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in 2015, 2014 and 2013 . 

A significant portion of our U.S. sales are to customers affiliated with GPOs, IDNs and other large national or regional accounts, as well as to the Veterans Administration and other hospitals operated by the Federal government. For hospital inventory management purposes, some of our customers prefer to purchase our products through independent third-party medical product distributors. 

Our employee sales representatives are specially trained in our various product offerings. Each employee sales representative is assigned a defined geographic area and compensated on a commission basis or through a combination of salary and commission. The sales force is supervised and supported by either area directors or district managers. In certain geographies, 

sales agent groups are used in the United States to sell our orthopedic products. These sales agent groups are paid a commission for sales made to customers while home office sales and marketing management provide the overall direction for marketing and positioning of our products. Our sales professionals provide surgeons and medical personnel with information relating to the technical features and benefits of our products. 

Our health systems organization is responsible for interacting with large regional and national accounts (e.g. GPOs, IDNs, etc.). We have contracts with many such organizations and believe that the loss of any individual group purchasing contract will not materially impact our business. In addition, all of our sales professionals are required to work closely with distributors where applicable and maintain close relationships with end-users. 

We sell to a diversified base of customers around the world and, therefore, believe there is no material concentration of credit risk. 

Manufacturing 

Raw material costs constitute a substantial portion of our cost of production. Substantially all of our raw materials and select components used in the manufacturing process are procured from external suppliers. We work closely with multiple suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. As a consequence of best supply chain practices, new product development and acquisitions, we often form strategic partnerships with key suppliers. As a consequence of these supplier partnerships, components and raw materials may be sole sourced. Due to the strength of these suppliers and the variety of products we provide, we do not believe the risk of supplier interruption poses an overall material adverse effect on our financial and operational performance. We schedule production and maintain adequate levels of safety stock based on a number of factors, including experience, knowledge of customer ordering patterns, demand, manufacturing lead times and optimal quantities required to maintain the highest possible service levels. Customer orders are generally processed for immediate shipment and backlog of firm orders is therefore not considered material to an understanding of our business. 

Research and Development 

New and improved products play a critical role in our continued sales growth. Internal research and development efforts focus on the development of new products and product technological and design improvements aimed at complementing and expanding existing product lines. We continually seek to leverage new technologies which improve the durability, performance and usability of existing products. In addition, we maintain close working relationships with surgeons, inventors and operating room personnel who often make new product and technology disclosures, principally in procedure-specific areas. For clinical and commercially promising disclosures, we seek to obtain rights to these ideas through negotiated agreements. Such agreements typically compensate the originator through payments based upon a percentage of licensed product net sales. Annual royalty expense approximated $2.3 million , $2.6 million &#32;and $2.7 million &#32;in 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 

Amounts expended for Company research and development were approximately $27.4 million , $27.8 million &#32;and $25.8 million &#32;during 2015, 2014 and 2013 , respectively. 

Intellectual Property 

Patents and other proprietary rights, in general, are important to our business. We have rights to intellectual property, including United States patents and foreign equivalent patents which cover a wide range of our products. We own a majority of these patents and have exclusive and non-exclusive licensing rights to the remainder. In addition, certain of these patents have currently been licensed to third parties on a non-exclusive basis. We believe that the development of new products and technological and design improvements to existing products will continue to be of primary importance in maintaining our competitive position. 

Government Regulation and Quality Systems 

The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by numerous agencies and legislative bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and comparable foreign counterparts. In the United States, these regulations were enacted under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments, and the regulations issued or proposed thereunder. 

The FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulations set forth requirements for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records, provide for on-site inspection of our facilities and continuing review by the FDA. Many of our products are also subject to industry-defined standards. Authorization to commercially market our products in the U.S. is granted by the FDA under a procedure referred to as a 510(k) pre-market notification. This process requires us to notify the FDA 

of the new product and obtain FDA clearance before marketing the device. We believe that our products and processes presently meet applicable standards in all material respects. 

Medical device regulations continue to evolve world-wide. Products marketed in the European Union and other countries require preparation of technical files and design dossiers which demonstrate compliance with applicable international regulations. As government regulations continue to change, there is a risk that the distribution of some of our products may be interrupted or discontinued if they do not meet the country specific requirements. 

We market our products in numerous foreign countries and therefore are subject to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards, sterilization, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import laws and onsite inspection by independent bodies with the authority to issue or not issue certifications we may require to be able to sell products in certain countries. Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in these countries are similar to those of the FDA. The member countries of the European Union have adopted the European Medical Device Directives, which create a single set of medical device regulations for all member countries. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in the European Union to maintain quality system certifications through European Union recognized Notified Bodies. These Notified Bodies authorize the use of the CE Mark allowing free movement of our products throughout the member countries. Requirements pertaining to our products vary widely from country to country, ranging from simple product registrations to detailed submissions such as those required by the FDA. We believe that our products and quality procedures currently meet applicable standards for the countries in which they are marketed. 

As noted above, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) and foreign regulatory agencies or notified bodies for, among other things, conformance to Quality System Regulation and Current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;CGMP&#8221;) requirements and foreign or international standards. During the third quarter of 2013, the FDA inspected our Centennial, Colorado manufacturing facility and issued a Form 483 with observations on September 20, 2013. We subsequently submitted responses to the Observations, and the FDA issued a Warning Letter on January 30, 2014 relating to the inspection and the responses to the Form 483 Observations. Accordingly, we undertook corrective actions. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the FDA again inspected our Centennial, Colorado manufacturing facility and, on November 18, 2014, issued a Form 483 with eight observations, three of which the FDA characterized as repeat observations. On December 10, 2014, we responded to the Form 483 Observations. We have received some additional questions from the FDA and responded to these questions on April 25, 2015. The remediation costs to date have not been material, although there can be no assurance that responding to the Form 483 observations or a future inspection by the FDA will not result in an additional Form 483 or warning letter, or other regulatory actions, which may include consent decrees or fines. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 3,400 &#32;full-time employees, including approximately 2,300 &#32;in operations, 140 &#32;in research and development and the remaining in sales, marketing and related administrative support. We believe that we have good relations with our employees and have never experienced a strike or similar work stoppage. None of our domestic employees are represented by a labor union.
