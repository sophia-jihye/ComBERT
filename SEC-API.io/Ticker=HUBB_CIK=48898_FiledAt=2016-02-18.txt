Electrical Segment 

&#160; 

The Electrical segment ( 70% &#32;of consolidated revenues in 2015 , and 71% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 2013 ) is comprised of businesses that sell stock and custom products including standard and special application wiring device products, rough-in electrical products, connector and grounding products, lighting fixtures and controls, as well as other electrical equipment. The products are typically used in and around industrial, commercial and institutional facilities by electrical contractors, maintenance personnel, electricians and telecommunications companies. In addition, certain businesses design and manufacture a variety of high voltage test and measurement equipment, industrial controls and communication systems used in the non-residential and industrial markets. Many of these products are designed such that they can also be used in harsh and hazardous locations where a potential for fire and explosion exists due to the presence of flammable gasses and vapors. Harsh and hazardous products are primarily used in the oil and gas (onshore and offshore) and mining industries. There are also a variety of lighting fixtures, wiring devices and electrical products that have residential and utility applications. 

&#160;

These products are primarily sold through electrical and industrial distributors, home centers, retail and hardware outlets, lighting showrooms and residential product oriented internet sites. Special application products are sold primarily through wholesale distributors to contractors, industrial customers and original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;). High voltage products are sold primarily by direct sales to customers through our sales engineers. Hubbell maintains a sales and marketing organization to assist potential users with the application of certain products to their specific requirements, and with architects, engineers, industrial designers, OEMs and electrical contractors for the design of electrical systems to meet the specific requirements of industrial, non-residential and residential users. Hubbell is also represented by independent manufacturers&#8217; sales agents for many of its product offerings.

Lighting Products 

&#160; 

Hubbell manufactures and sells lighting fixtures and controls for indoor and outdoor applications. The markets served include non-residential and residential. For the non-residential market the Company typically targets products that would be considered specification grade and this market includes retrofitting and re-lighting projects for commercial and industrial properties. A fast growing trend within the lighting industry is the adoption of light emitting diode (&#8220;LED&#8221;) technology as the light 

&#160;

source. LED technology is both energy efficient and long&#8211;lived and as a result offers customers the economic benefits of lower energy and maintenance costs. The Company has a broad array of LED-luminaire products within its portfolio and the majority of new product development efforts are oriented towards expanding those offerings. Examples of these lighting products or applications include: 

&#8226; 

Canopy lights 

&#8226; 

Parking lot/parking garage fixtures 

&#8226; 

Decorative landscape fixtures 

&#8226;

Power Segment 

&#160; 

The Power segment ( 30% &#32;of consolidated revenues in 2015 , and 29% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 2013 ) consists of operations that design and manufacture various distribution, transmission, substation and telecommunications products primarily used by the electrical utility industry. In addition, certain of these products are used in the civil construction and transportation industries. Products are sold to distributors and 

&#160;

directly to users such as electric utilities, telecommunication companies, pipeline and mining operations, industrial firms, construction and engineering firms. While Hubbell believes its sales in this area are not materially dependent upon any customer or group of customers, a substantial decrease in purchases by electrical utilities would affect this segment.

Information Applicable to All General Categories 

&#160; 

International Operations 

&#160; 

The Company has several operations located outside of the United States. These operations manufacture, assemble and/or procure and market Hubbell products and service both the Electrical and Power segments. 

&#160; 

As a percentage of total net sales, shipments from foreign operations directly to third parties were 11% &#32;in 2015 , 14% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 16% &#32;in 2013 , with the Canadian and UK operations representing approximately 34% &#32;and &#32; 24% , respectively, of 2015 &#32;total international net sales. Mexico represents 11% of total 2015 international net sales, while Switzerland and Brazil each represent 10% of 2015 &#32;total international sales. See also Note 20 - Industry Segments and Geographic Area Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors relating to manufacturing in and sourcing from foreign countries. 

Customers 

The Company does not have any customers whose annual consolidated purchases exceed 10 percent of it's total net sales in 2015, 2014 nor 2013. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

Raw materials used in the manufacture of Hubbell products primarily include steel, aluminum, brass, copper, bronze, plastics, phenolics, zinc, nickel, elastomers and petrochemicals. Hubbell also purchases certain electrical and electronic components, including solenoids, lighting ballasts, printed circuit boards, integrated circuit chips and cord sets, from a number of suppliers. Hubbell is not materially dependent upon any one supplier for raw materials used in the manufacture of 

&#160;

its products and equipment, and at the present time, raw materials and components essential to its operation are in adequate supply. However, some of these principal raw materials are sourced from a limited number of suppliers. See also Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

&#160; 

Patents 

&#160; 

Hubbell has approximately 1,650 active United States and foreign patents covering many of its products, which expire at various times. While Hubbell deems these patents to be of value, it does not consider its business to be dependent upon patent protection. Hubbell also licenses products under patents owned by others, as necessary, and grants licenses under certain of its patents. 

&#160; 

Working Capital 

&#160; 

Inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable levels, payment terms and, where applicable, return policies are in accordance with the general practices of the electrical products industry and standard business procedures. See also Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

Substantially all of the backlog existing at December 31, 2015 &#32;is expected to be shipped to customers in 2016 . Backlog of orders believed to be firm at December 31, 2015 &#32;was approximately $319.4 million &#32;compared to $333.7 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 . Although this backlog is important, the majority of Hubbell&#8217;s revenues result from sales of inventoried products or products that have short periods of manufacture. 

&#160; 

HUBBELL INCORPORATED &#160; - Form 10-K 

Competition 

&#160; 

Hubbell experiences substantial competition in all categories of its business, but does not compete with the same companies in all of its product categories. The number and size of competitors vary considerably depending on the product line. Hubbell cannot specify with precision the number of competitors in each product category or their relative market position. However, some of its competitors are larger companies with substantial financial and other resources. Hubbell considers product performance, reliability, quality and technological innovation as important factors relevant to all areas of its business, and considers its reputation as a manufacturer of quality products to be an important factor in its business. In addition, product price, service levels and other factors can affect Hubbell&#8217;s ability to compete. 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and development expenditures represent costs to discover and/or apply new knowledge in developing a new product or process, or in bringing about significant improvement in an existing product or process. Research and development expenses are recorded as a component of Cost of goods sold. Expenses for research and development were approximately 2% &#32;of Cost of goods sold for each of the years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . 

&#160; 

&#160;

Environment 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to various federal, state and local government requirements relating to the protection of employee health and safety and the environment. The Company believes that, as a general matter, its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury to its employees and its customers&#8217; employees and that the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances are in accordance with environmental laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Like other companies engaged in similar businesses, the Company has incurred or acquired through business combinations, remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and is a party to product liability and other lawsuits and claims associated with environmental matters, including past production of product containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. However, considering past experience and reserves, the Company does not anticipate that these matters will have a material impact on earnings, capital expenditures, financial condition or competitive position. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 15 &#8212; Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , Hubbell had approximately 16,200 &#32; salaried and hourly employees of which approximately 8,300 of these employees, or 51%, are located in the United States. &#32; Approximately 2,150 of these U.S. employees are represented by 16 labor unions. Hubbell considers its labor relations to be satisfactory.

Reclassification of Common Stock 

&#160; 

On December 23, 2015, the Company completed the reclassification of its dual-class common stock into a single class of Common Stock (the &#8220;Reclassification&#8221;). 

The Reclassification, among other benefits, simplified the Company's capital structure, better aligned voting rights with economic interests of all shareholders, and has eliminated the ability of the Louie E. Roche Trust and the Harvey Hubbell Trust (collectively, the &#8220;Trusts&#8221;), which, prior to the Reclassification, collectively owned 3,488,460 shares of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the &#8220;Class A common stock&#8221;), representing approximately 49% of Class A common stock then outstanding, and approximately 36% of the total voting power of the Company's shareholders, to effectively prevent the approval of any matter that comes before the shareholders that requires, under Connecticut law, the approval of holders of two-thirds of the voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock. 

Following the filing of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company with the Secretary of the State of Connecticut, the Reclassification became effective at 11:59 p.m. on December 23, 2015 (the "Effective Time"), at which time (i) each holder of Class A common stock as of immediately prior 

&#160;

to the Effective Time became entitled to receive cash in the amount of $28.00 for each share of Class A common stock held ("Class A Cash Consideration") and (ii) each share of Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and each share of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class B common stock"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was reclassified into one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.01 per share and having one vote per share upon all matters brought before any meeting of the shareholders (the "Common Stock"). 

Trading in the Class A common stock and Class B common stock ceased after markets closed on December 23, 2015 and trading in the Company's single class of Common Stock commenced on the New York Stock Exchange on December 24, 2015, under the ticker "HUBB". 

Additional information about the Reclassification is included in the Company's current reports on Form 8-K filed on August 24, 2015 and December 23, 2015 and the Company's registration statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-206898), initially filed with the SEC on September 11, 2015, and declared effective on November 23, 2015.
