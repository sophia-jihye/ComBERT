History 

&#160;

Mountain High Acquisitions Corp. (&#8220;Mountain High,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Colorado on September 22, 2010, under the name Wireless Attachments, Inc.

&#160;

From September 22, 2010 and before the Share Exchange (as described below), the Company had been in the research and development phase. We intended to develop solar cloth membranes and solar charging units for outdoor active wear that convert sunlight into electrical power that could be used for charging and operating mobile devices, such as the iPhone and iPod.

&#160;

On March 6, 2014, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Share Exchange Agreement&#8221;) with Canna-Life Corporation, a Colorado corporation whose primary business was to hold, develop and manage real property (&#8220;Canna-Life&#8221;), the shareholders of Canna-Life (the &#8220;Canna-Life Shareholders&#8221;), and the controlling stockholders of the Company (the &#8220;WAI Controlling Stockholders&#8221;). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 8,104,000 (100%) shares of common stock of Canna-Life from the Canna-Life Shareholders (the &#8220;Canna-Life Shares&#8221;) and in exchange issued 8,104,000 restricted shares of its common stock to the Canna-Life Shareholders (the &#8220;Company Shares&#8221;). As a result of the Share Exchange, Canna-Life became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company carried on the business of Canna-Life as its primary business. The Share Exchange Agreement contained customary representations, warranties and conditions to closing. The closing of the Share Exchange (the &#8220;Closing&#8221;) occurred on March 6, 2014 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;).

&#160;

On March 11, 2014, the Company&#8217;s name was changed from Wireless Attachments, Inc. to Mountain High Acquisitions Corp. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s ticker symbol, as of the open of business on March 12, 2014, changed from &#8220;WRSS&#8221; to &#8220;MYHI.&#8221;

&#160;

Business of the Company after the Acquisition of Canna-Life Corporation 

&#160;

Mountain High initially started as a strategic real estate investment firm whose primary focus was acquiring and equipping commercial facilities to be leased to and utilized by the commercial marijuana industry in Colorado. The Company does not and will not grow, harvest, distribute or sell cannabis or any substances that violate United States law or the Controlled Substances Act. Mountain High was poised to become one of the largest holders of properties zoned and approved for use by the commercial marijuana industry in Colorado. See below for subsequent changes to the direction of the Company

&#160;

As Mountain High&#8217;s new focus was to hold, develop and manage real property, the research and development efforts initiated by Wireless Attachments, Inc. were terminated.

&#160;

On February 8 2015, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the &#8220;Share Exchange Agreement&#8221;) with Greenlife BiotanX, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;GBX&#8221;), and the controlling stockholders of GBX (the &#8220;GBX Shareholders&#8221;). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 1,000,000 (100%) shares of common stock of GBX from the GBX (the &#8220;GBX Shares&#8221;) and in exchange issued 25,000,000 restricted shares of its common stock to the GBX Shareholders (the &#8220;MYHI Shares&#8221;). As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, GBX became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Share Exchange Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and conditions to closing. The closing of the Share Exchange (the &#8220;Closing&#8221;) was to occur on February 8, 2015 (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;). On April 30, 2015 the Share Exchange Agreement was modified to reflect a change in the number of share being issued to GBX Shareholders from 25,000,000 shares to 10,000,000. The transaction closed May 22, 2015.

&#160;

On April 1, 2015 the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Freedom Feed &#38; Seed Inc. (the &#8220;FSF Share Exchange Agreement&#8221;). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company acquired 75,000 (100%) shares of common stock of FSF from FSF (the &#8220;FSF Shares&#8221;) and in exchange issued 31,429,000 restricted shares of its common stock to the FSF Shareholders (the &#8220;MYHI Shares&#8221;). As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, FSF became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Share Exchange Agreement contained customary representations, warranties and conditions to closing. The transaction closed on May 19, 2015.

&#160;

Subsequent to the above transaction, FSF and MYHI enter into a Rescission Agreement (the &#34;RA&#34;) on June 30, 2015 rescinding the Exchange Agreement. As provided in the RA all MYHI shares issued to FSF were to be returned to MYHI and cancelled and MYHI was to return all FSF shares received to FSF. FSF had until August 1, 2015 to return the MYHI shares, at which point the RA granted the Secretary of MYHI the power to cancel the shares in total as attorney-in-fact for the holders of the MYHI shares. As of March 31, 2016, none of the shares had been cancelled. On April 25, 2016, 28,604,173 of the shares were returned and cancelled. A hold has been placed on the remaining 2,824,827 outstanding shares by our transfer agent.

&#160;

On April 30, 2015, the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement to sell Canna-Life Corporation (the &#34;CL Agreement&#34;) to Evolution Equities Corporation and Alan Smith.(&#34;Purchasers&#34;) Under the terms of the CL Agreement the Company will sell 8,104,000 (100%) of its shares of Canna-Life and execute a note Payable for $80,000 to Evolutions Equities Corporation in exchange for the extinguishment of $490,416 of debt due to the Purchasers at March 31, 2016 and $1.00 cash.

Property Acquisitions 

&#160;

On April 30, 2014, Canna-Life Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Master Property Purchase and Sale Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with Deep Blue Enterprises, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company that was the successor in interest to New Alternatives Consulting LLC (&#8220;Deep Blue&#8221;). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, the Company was to acquire interests in those certain properties commonly known as the &#8220;Isabelle Property,&#8221; which is located in Lafayette, Boulder County, Colorado, the &#8220;Pueblo Property,&#8221; which is located in Avondale, Pueblo County, Colorado, and the &#8220;Madison St. Property,&#8221; which is located in Denver, Denver County, Colorado (collectively referred to herein as the &#8220;Properties&#8221;). As consideration for the acquisition of Deep Blue&#8217;s interests in the Properties, the Company was to pay to Deep Blue an aggregate of Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($12,500,000). The Company remitted $850,000 to meet the initial payment requirements of the Agreement. However, as valuations for this type of property declined, the Company decided in August 2014 to cease making the required payments and to allow the Agreement to expire. The Company decided not to pursue recovery of the payments due to the cost of a protracted legal process and the unlikely event of recovery of the payments should the Company win a judgment. The $850,000 was written off in the year ending March 31, 2015.

&#160;

On April 30, 2015, the Company entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement to sell Canna-Life Corporation (the &#34;CL Agreement&#34;) to Evolution Equities Corporation and Alan Smith.(&#34;Purchasers&#34;).
