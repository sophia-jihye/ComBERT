 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

OVERVIEW 

Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; "our," &#8220;Caladrius&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), through its subsidiary, PCT, LLC, a Caladrius Company TM ("PCT"), is a leading provider of development and manufacturing services to the cell therapy industry (which includes cell-based gene therapy). PCT has significant cell therapy-specific experience and expertise, an expansive list of noteworthy clients and significant revenue growth over the past two years. Notably, PCT and Hitachi Chemical Co. America, Ltd. and Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd. ( collectively "Hitachi Chemical") recently entered into a strategic collaboration to accelerate the creation of a global commercial cell therapy development and manufacturing enterprise with deep engineering expertise. Caladrius leverages both its internal specialized cell therapy clinical development expertise and PCT&#8217;s prowess to select and develop early-stage cell therapy candidates with the intention of partnering these candidates post proof-of-concept in man to both generate value for our shareholders and to expand PCT&#8217;s client base. Our current product candidate, CLBS03, is a T regulatory cell (&#8220;Treg&#8221;) clinical Phase 2 therapy targeting adolescents with recent-onset type 1 diabetes. 

Cell Therapy Development and Manufacturing 

PCT is a leading cell therapy development and manufacturing provider (often called a contract development and manufacturing organization, or "CDMO"), specializing in cell and cell-based gene therapies. PCT offers high-quality development and manufacturing capabilities (e.g., current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) manufacturing systems and facilities), quality systems, cell and tissue processing, logistics, storage and distribution) and engineering solutions (e.g., process and assay development, optimization and automation) to clients with therapeutic candidates at all stages of development. PCT produces clinical supplies and ultimately, intends also to produce commercial product for its clients. PCT has worked with over 100 clients and produced over 20,000 cell therapy products since it was founded seventeen years ago. PCT&#8217;s manufacturing services are designed to reduce the capital investment and time required by clients to advance their development programs compared to conducting process development and manufacturing in-house. PCT has demonstrated regulatory expertise, including the support of over 50 U.S. and European Union ("EU") regulatory filings for clients, and expertise across multiple cell types and therapeutic applications, including immunotherapy (e.g. CAR-T therapies), neuro/endocrine therapies, hematopoietic replacement and tissue repair/regeneration. PCT offers a complete development pathway for its clients, with services supporting preclinical through commercial phase, all underpinned by timely process optimization and automation support. We currently operate facilities qualified under cGMPs in each of Allendale, New Jersey and Mountain View, California, including EU-compliant production capacity. On March 11, 2016, PCT entered into a strategic collaboration and license agreement with Hitachi Chemical to accelerate the creation of a global commercial cell therapy development and manufacturing enterprise with deep engineering expertise. PCT is positioned to expand its capacity both in the United States and internationally, as needed. As the industry continues to mature and a growing number of cell therapy companies approach commercialization, we believe that PCT is well positioned to serve as an external manufacturing partner of choice for commercial-stage cell therapy companies. 

CLBS03 

We are developing strategically, through the utilization of our core development and manufacturing expertise, a product candidate that is an innovative therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus ("TID"). This therapy is based on a proprietary platform technology for immunomodulation. We have selected as an initial target the unmet medical need of pediatric patients who are newly diagnosed with T1D. This program is based on the use of T regulatory cells ("Tregs") to treat diseases caused by imbalances in an individual's immune system. This novel approach seeks to restore immune balance by enhancing Treg number and function. Tregs are a natural part of the human immune system and regulate the activity of T effector cells; the cells that are responsible for protecting the body from viruses and other foreign antigens. When Tregs function properly, only harmful foreign materials are attacked by T effector cells. In autoimmune disease, however, it is thought that deficient Treg activity and numbers permit the T effector cells to attack the body's own beneficial cells. In the case of T1D, there are currently no curative treatments, only lifelong insulin therapy, which often does not prevent serious co-morbidities. Two Phase 1 clinical trials of this technology in T1D demonstrated safety and tolerance, feasibility of manufacturing, an implied durability of effect and an early indication of efficacy through the preservation of beta cell function. In the first quarter of 2016 we expect to commence patient enrollment in the first of two cohorts in The Sanford Project: T-Rex Study, a Phase 2 prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our Treg product candidate, CLBS03, in adolescents with recent onset T1D. After the three-month follow-up of the first cohort of 18 patients, which is expected in early 2017, an initial safety analysis of the data and early analysis of immunological biomarkers will be undertaken. Satisfactory evaluation of the safety of the initial cohort as agreed by us, our independent Data Safety Monitoring Board and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") will then prompt the enrollment of the remaining 93 patients. A subsequent interim analysis of efficacy is planned after approximately 50% of patients 

reach the six-month follow-up milestone. We have entered into a strategic collaboration with Sanford Research to support the execution of this trial. Sanford Research is a U.S.-based non-profit research organization that supports an emerging translational research center focused on finding a cure for T1D. 

Additional Technology Platforms 

&#160; 

Our broad intellectual property portfolio of cell therapy assets includes notable programs available for out-licensing and partnering in order to continue their clinical development. These include platforms using tumor cell/dendritic cell technology for immuno-oncology and CD34 technology for ischemic repair. Both have the benefit of promising Phase 2 clinical data and are applicable to multiple indications. The immuno-oncology platform is based on our extensive intellectual property portfolio and includes CLBS20, a candidate for metastatic melanoma which was investigated in two Phase 2 trials and recently in a discontinued Phase 3 clinical trial. With respect to our ischemic repair platform, we are actively exploring a program to develop CLBS12 (a candidate for critical limb ischemia "CLI") under Japan's favorable regenerative medicine law and seeking to collaborate on CLBS 12 with development and/or manufacturing partners. In January 2016, we out-licensed our CD34 technology to SPS Cardio, LLC for chronic heart failure and acute myocardial infarction (candidate CLBS10) in India and other designated territories and non-major world markets outside the United States. Furthermore, a cell-derived dermatological product technology for topical skin application was out-licensed in February 2016 to AiVita Biomedical, Inc. ("AiVita"), which it intends to distribute through ALPHAEON Corporation. Finally, our Treg immune modulation platform has potential applications across multiple autoimmune and allergic diseases beyond TID for which we are exploring partnering opportunities, including steroid-resistant asthma, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, graft versus host disease, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. 

Our long term strategy focuses on advancing cell-based therapies to the market and assisting patients suffering from life-threatening medical conditions. Coupling our clinical development expertise with our process development and manufacturing capabilities, we believe we are positioned to realize potentially meaningful value increases within our own proprietary pipeline based on demonstration of proof-of-concept in man as well as process and manufacturing advancements.

PCT: A PREMIER CELL THERAPY SERVICE PROVIDER 

Through our subsidiary, PCT, we provide high quality manufacturing capabilities and innovative engineering solutions in the development of cell-based therapies. Our strategy is to leverage our core expertise in the support of cell therapy developers, biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical companies that recognize our ability to improve their manufacturing processes and to provide value-added manufacturing services. 

We operate two state-of-the-art, accredited and certified U.S. facilities, one in Allendale, New Jersey, and one in Mountain View, California. We are seeking to expand our manufacturing facilities internationally. 

Our in-house expertise provides us with know-how and resources to cost-effectively and efficiently develop our own selected cell therapy product candidates, as well as to translate our own proprietary technologies into stable, reproducible, well-characterized, commercially viable cell therapy products candidates for clients. We believe that this expertise provides us with an advantage in the advancement and development of our own product candidates. With respect to those product candidates to date, including our CLBS03 Phase 2 product candidate, all manufacturing has been carried out by our in-house team. 

On March 11, 2016, PCT entered into a global collaboration with Hitachi Chemical that includes licensing, development and equity components. As part of the collaboration, Hitachi Chemical has purchased a 19.9% equity interest in PCT for $19.4 million. We retain the remaining 80.1% ownership of PCT. In addition, PCT has licensed its cell therapy technology and know-how to Hitachi Chemical for cell therapy manufacturing in certain Asian territories, including Japan, where the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ("PMDA") has introduced more favorable legislation to stimulate the growth of regenerative medicine development in Japan. Under the license agreement, Hitachi Chemical will pay PCT $5.6 million in upfront and fee driven payments, each of which is expected to be achieved in 2016. In addition, Hitachi Chemical will pay service fees and royalties on contract revenue in those territories. Under the license arrangement, Hitachi Chemical is responsible for all capital and operational expenses associated with establishment and operation of the Asian business on which PCT is entitled to royalty payments. Outside of the license agreement, PCT and Hitachi Chemical have agreed to explore the establishment of a joint venture in Europe. By leveraging this expanded footprint, we believe PCT's clients will gain access to the cell and cell-based gene therapy markets of tomorrow, where we expect engineering solutions to process optimization and automation will play a seminal role worldwide. 

Our Experience and Expertise 

Our management team has extensive and unique experience in domestic and internationally regulated cell therapy development, including contract research, development and manufacturing across a broad range of science, technologies and process operations. Members of our management include recognized and credentialed experts in all aspects of clinical and product development, characterization, manufacturing, delivery and use, of cellular products and have extensive experience designing, validating and operating cGMP/GLP cell therapy manufacturing facilities. 

PCT's expertise is focused on advancing product candidates from conception through commercialization by reducing manufacturing risks, shortening the time to regulatory approval and lowering the overall costs of a clinical development program. With its established facilities and infrastructure, PCT offers expertise at all stages of the product development lifecycle and cost-effective development and manufacturing services that meet applicable quality standards. 

During its approximately 17 years in operation, PCT has produced more than 20,000 different cell therapy products based on many cell types, including neuronal and skin based cells for brain and spinal cord repair, myoblasts, mesenchymal cells and bone marrow derived cells for heart disease, T cells (such as T Regulatory cell, CAR-T and TCR therapies), tumor, dendritic cells and monocytes for cancer treatment, cord blood, peripheral blood, bone marrow CD34 selected cells for transplantation and islet cells for diabetes. 

PCT's expertise is in high quality delivery of cell therapy, including: 

&#8226; 

Manufacturing: Manufacturers of cell therapy-based products and specifically those manufacturing patient-specific cell therapies, face a number of challenges, including limited unit sizes and process scalability, short processing turnaround times and stringent and evolving regulatory requirements. PCT addresses these challenges by leveraging its established cGMP infrastructure and quality systems. 

&#8226; 

Innovation and Engineering: We develop innovative long-term solutions to the unique challenges of cell therapy manufacturing through our Center for Innovation &#38; Engineering. We accelerate the use of automation, integration, closed processing and other strategies to address scale up, cost of goods, quality control and robustness of manufacturing process. In order to utilize our expertise and further reduce cost of goods sold for products, PCT continually seeks innovation drivers, including new opportunities for automation in its manufacturing operations. 

&#8226; 

Manufacturing Development: PCT develops, optimizes, implements and validates various aspects of cell therapy product and process development. PCT also provides analytical development, such as the creation of quality assays. 

&#8226; 

Cell and Tissue Processing: PCT provides cost-effective cell processing services that meet current Good Tissue Practices ("cGTP") standards. 

Over the next several years, we anticipate that the number of companies in the cell therapy field will continue to increase and the relative distribution of stage of development of the therapeutics will continue to shift towards Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials 

and into commercial distribution if regulatory approvals are obtained. As this industry continues to develop and mature, we believe PCT is well positioned to capture a meaningful share of this potentially larger, more profitable market. To meet this coming demand, we are exploring opportunities to expand internationally. 

Improving Deliverability of Cell Therapy Products through PCT's Center for Innovation &#38; Engineering 

As the field of regenerative medicine matures and an increasing number of products reach the marketplace, valuable lessons are being learned about the strengths and weaknesses of various business models that may allow for therapies to be delivered to large numbers of patients. At our Center for Innovation &#38; Engineering, we are thinking beyond current practices to accelerate the use of automation, integration and other engineering strategies to address the important issues of scale up, cost of goods, and improved robustness of manufacturing process in anticipation of commercial production. 

We are applying engineering principles to transition cell therapy science to manufacturing at scale and applying development by design principles, as well as structured development methodology focused on unit operations to increase the chance of successful commercial-scale manufacturing. In addition to building our internal core of engineering and innovation expertise, we are partnering with solutions providers and academic institutions to leverage existing expertise and develop novel closed systems, single-use disposables, automation, and integration. In this way, we believe that we will be able to support the manufacture of high quality products at a reasonable cost of goods and meet product demand in a scalable manner as it grows throughout the commercial life of the therapeutic. For example, we are collaborating with Invetech Pty Ltd, ("Invetech") to develop a new closed processing system for cell therapy manufacturing whereby Invetech has provided system design and engineering development and we have developed applications for performing closed cell processing manipulations. 

Facilities 

With more than 50,000 square feet in its Allendale, New Jersey and Mountain View, California facilities, PCT is a cGMP cell therapy center of excellence with facilities on both the east and the west coasts of the United States. These facilities include 5,500 square feet of controlled environment rooms ("CERs" or "clean rooms") that are unidirectional-flow, negative-pressure, and International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") designation 7 ("ISO7") classified and ISO 6/EU Grade B, which allows products to be sent to the EU for clinical trials. We are currently in the process of increasing our clean room capacity at the Allendale facility by 60% while developing and implementing cell therapy-specific pharmaceutical grade quality systems to support commercial manufacturing for the United States and Europe, with the build-out expected to complete in 2016. Each CER has controlled access, live facility and equipment monitoring with automated alarm call-out, dedicated HVAC systems and an uninterruptible power supply ("UPS") connection maintained by an external diesel-fueled back-power generator. Each facility also contains cell and tissue cryogenic storage rooms with controlled access, live facility and equipment monitoring with automated alarm call-out, and UPS connection to ensure high levels of quality control and risk mitigation for product storage. 

Our facilities are accredited by the Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy ("FACT"), hold all requisite licensures, are registered with the FDA as human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products ("HCT/Ps") facilities and maintain cGMP compliant quality systems. The Allendale facility also has been designed to be compliant with European Medicines Agency ("EMA") standards for the manufacture of human cells for therapeutic use. 

Competition 

PCT's manufacturing business faces competition from other third party contract manufacturers as well as more general competition from companies and academic and research institutions that may choose to self-manufacture rather than utilize a contract manufacturer. Two of the larger third party contract manufacturer competitors in the field of cell therapy are Lonza Group Ltd. and WuXi AppTec. Both of these companies are well-established manufacturers with financial, technical, research and development and sales and marketing resources that are significantly greater than those of PCT. In addition, both companies have international capabilities that we do not currently possess, though we are pursuing such. We also face competition from a number of other manufacturers that are somewhat smaller in size and have fewer resources than does PCT. 

More generally, we face competition inherent in any third party manufacturer's business: namely, that potential customers may instead choose to invest in their own facilities and infrastructure. To be successful, we will need to convince potential customers that PCT's capabilities can mitigate their risk of high product cost of goods due to the potential for idle capacity, are more innovative, of higher-quality and more cost-effective than could be achieved through internal manufacturing and that our experience and expertise is unique in the industry. Our ability to achieve this and to successfully compete against other manufacturers will depend, in large part, on our success in expanding PCT's commercial manufacturing-ready capacity and by developing superior automation technologies that improve both the quality and profitability associated with cell therapy manufacturing. 

Cell Processing and Storage 

We provide cell therapy processing and storage services in support of stem cell transplant programs at select hospitals throughout the country on a contract basis, where such hospitals do not have their own laboratory and processing services. Such services are provided in compliance with cGMP standards, consistent with applicable national standards. 

OVERVIEW OF THE CELL THERAPY FIELD 

Regenerative medicine is defined as the process of replacing or regenerating human cells, tissues or organs to restore normal function. Among the categories of therapeutic technology platforms within this field are cell therapy; tissue engineering; tools, devices and diagnostics and aesthetic medicine. In 2016, the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine recognizes over 670 regenerative medicine companies worldwide, which includes gene and cell therapy developers, and over 630 clinical trials. 

All living complex organisms start as a single cell that replicates, differentiates (matures) and perpetuates in an adult organism. Cell therapy is the process that uses cells to prevent, treat or cure disease, or regenerate damaged or aged tissue. To date, the most common type of cell therapy has been the replacement of mature, functioning cells through blood and platelet transfusions. Since the 1970s, first bone marrow and then blood and umbilical cord-derived stem cells have been used to restore bone marrow, as well as blood and immune system cells damaged by the chemotherapy and radiation that are used to treat many cancers. These types of cell therapies are standard of practice world-wide and are typically reimbursed by insurance. 

There are two general classes of cell therapies: Autologous and Allogeneic. When cells are collected from a person (donor) and are ultimately transplanted into, or used to develop a treatment solely for that patient (recipient) with or without modification, the treatment paradigm is known as &#8220;autologous&#8221; cell therapy. In cases in which the donor and the recipient are not the same individual, the procedures are referred to as &#8220;allogeneic&#8221; cell therapy. Patient-Specific Cell Therapy ("PSCT") includes all autologous cell therapies as well as allogeneic cell therapies in which a specific donor's cells are used for a specific matched recipient's treatment. Our immune modulation program, and much of the business of PCT, focuses on PSCTs. Autologous cells offer a low likelihood of rejection by the patient. In the case of some allogeneic cell therapies, also known as Off-The-Shelf Therapy ("OSCT"), donor cells are expanded many fold in tissue culture and large banks of cells are frozen in individual aliquots that may result in treatments for many different people. 

Various cell therapies are in clinical development for an array of human diseases, including autoimmune, oncologic, neurologic and orthopedic diseases, among other indications. While no assurances can be given regarding future medical developments, we believe that the field of cell therapy holds the promise to better the human experience and minimize or ameliorate the pain and suffering from many common and often life-threatening diseases and/or from the process of aging. 

CELL THERAPY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT 

Immune Modulation (T Regulatory Cell Program) &#32; 

Our T Regulatory Cell program is based on a technology platform derived in part from intellectual property created from research performed at the University of California, San Francisco ("UCSF") and is pursuing the development of cell therapies designed to use autologous immune cells as a therapeutic product to treat disorders of the immune system. Many immune-mediated diseases are a result of an imbalance between immune effector and regulatory mechanisms, whereby pro-inflammatory cells and cytokines eventually go unchecked and mistakenly attack beneficial cells in the body. Our T regulatory cell therapy represents a novel approach to restoring immune balance by enhancing Treg number and function to control pathologic immune responses. 

Clinical Development 

Through world-wide patent licenses, we have secured the rights to a broad patent estate within the Treg field, including IP related to TID. T1D, also known as insulin dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes, is caused by the autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. We have established a collaboration with UCSF and the laboratories of Drs. Jeffrey Bluestone and Qizhi Tang, experts in the field of Tregs and immune tolerance, to develop CLBS03, autologous ex-vivo expanded polyclonal Tregs, for the treatment of T1D. This collaboration , &#32;comprising a data license and patent license, has advanced our Treg Program to a Phase 2 trial, expected to initiate in the first quarter of 2016, to evaluate the efficacy of autologous Tregs in T1D. A Phase 1 open-label uncontrolled dose escalation study of autologous Treg immunotherapy for T1D was funded by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and conducted by Dr. Stephen Gitelman at UCSF and Dr. Kevan Harold at Yale University, in collaboration with Dr. Bluestone. Results were published by Dr. Gitelman in Science Translational Medicine in November 2015. 

The clinical trial provided preliminary safety and feasibility data that support developing a novel therapy for the treatment of T1D with the goal of inducing immune tolerance and preserving pancreatic beta cell function. The investigators reported that, in the clinical trial, 14 patients between 18 and 45 years of age with a mean duration of disease of 10 months received a single infusion of one of four doses of autologous expanded Tregs. The majority of adverse events reported were mild. There were three serious adverse events, or SAEs: two were deemed unrelated by the investigator and a third SAE of grade 3 pre-syncope was deemed unlikely related. Common side effects included mild infections. Infused Tregs peaked in circulation three to seven days after infusion and were detectable at up to twelve months. The average levels of stimulated C-peptide, an indicator of pancreatic islets beta cell function that was measured in the clinical trial as a safety biomarker, for some patients remained stable from baseline for as long as two years post treatment. These data suggest that the treatment was manageable and did not adversely affect residual beta cell function. The Tregs were observed to be highly functional and long lived in treated individuals. 

While the U.S. Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to evaluate safety and tolerability in adults who suffered T1D for various durations, supportive evidence of the utility of Tregs for T1D in humans was provided by a study of pediatric patients 5 to 18 years of age with new onset T1D, as published in the July 2014 issue of Clinical Immunology. In that open label non-randomized study conducted in Poland, Marek-Trzonkowska, et al. , reported that treatment with expanded autologous Tregs preserved function of pancreatic beta cells and reduced the need for exogenous insulin in the majority of patients treated. Through 12 months of follow-up, about 66% of the 12 children treated were in remission according to study specified criteria, compared to only 20% of 10 concurrent controls. In addition, two or about 17% of Treg treated children achieved complete insulin independence, while none of the children in the control group achieved this endpoint. Importantly, the study utilized a Treg based product similar to CLBS03 and provided additional information on the safety and feasibility of this approach in new onset children with T1D. 

In the first quarter of 2016 we expect to commence patient enrollment in the T-Rex Study, a Phase 2 prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of our Treg product candidate, CLBS03, in adolescents with recent onset T1D. We have entered into a strategic collaboration with Sanford Research to support the execution of this trial. Sanford Research is a non-profit research organization that is part of Sanford Health and supports an emerging translational research center focused on finding a cure for T1D. The T-Rex study is expected to enroll a total of 111 subjects in two cohorts comprising of 18 patients and 93 patients, respectively. An initial safety analysis of the data and early analysis of immunological markers will occur after the treatment and the three month follow-up visit of the first 18 patients is completed, which is expected in early 2017. Satisfactory evaluation of the safety of the initial cohort as agreed by us, our independent Data Safety Monitoring Board and the FDA will then prompt the enrollment of the remaining 93 patients. An interim efficacy analysis is expected after approximately 50% of patients reach the six month follow-up milestone. 

Market Opportunity and Competition 

In 2015, The &#32; International Diabetes Foundation Atlas , 7th Ed., reported an estimated 86,000 children younger than 15 develop T1D annually worldwide, with annual increase in incidence of about 3%. In the United States, a SEARCH for National Diabetes Statistic Report, 2014 cites an annual incidence of 18,436 in individuals less than 20 years of age. T1D inflicts a significant economic cost on the U.S. healthcare system, estimated at $14.4 billion annually, and it is expected that a therapeutic that can modify the course of T1D will potentially achieve significant cost savings, and thus command high market penetration and premium pricing. The market for T1D is expected to continue to be dominated by insulin replacement therapies. Other novel approaches, however, including immune modulatory agents such as CLBS03, are expected to progressively penetrate the market in the near term. 

Currently, there are no approved therapies for T1D but only treatments designed to address the symptoms of the disease. There are many agents in development targeting the modification of the course of the disease. Current approaches in development can be broadly divided into immune modulatory agents aiming to improve metabolic function by rescuing insulin producing beta cells, or regenerative agents that are aiming to replace beta cells. The pipeline for all novel agents is skewed towards early development, including ultra-low dosing of Interleukin-2, which increases the number of tolerogenic cells and which has been advanced to phase 2 by ILTOO Pharma. Also in early development are beta-cell replacement therapies, such as that of ViaCyte, Inc., which employ technologies that protect transplanted beta-cells from immune attack. 

TECHNOLOGY OUT-LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES 

Immuno-Oncology (Tumor Cell/Dendritic Cell Technology) 

It has been well established that the human immune system can provide a powerful response in the treatment of cancer if the immune system can be properly &#8220;educated&#8221; to attack cancerous cells while leaving the normal tissue unharmed. It is thought that many recurrences of cancers treated with the standard of care are the result of tumor or cancer initiating cells (commonly 

referred to as &#8220;cancer stem cells&#8221;) that evade the initial therapy and initiate tumor re-growth. Targeting tumor or cancer initiating cells after medically induced tumor regression remains a seminal goal of cancer therapeutics. It is believed by some that eradication of such cells could lead to long-term disease-free survival, better overall survival and potential cures. The treatment paradigm in oncology, however, was transformed during 2015 by accelerating adoption of multiple immune checkpoint inhibitors used as monotherapy and in combination treatments. Therefore, we recently discontinued our Phase 3 clinical investigation of CLBS20, a candidate based on this technology, for the treatment of metastatic melanoma as a monotherapy. Our emphasis regarding CLBS20 is now to secure a partner or an out-licensing arrangement with a third party to continue the development of CLBS 20 as a combination therapy. We believe that this proprietary tumor cell/dendritic cell technology has the capability to be a potent immunotherapy for other oncology indications, such as ovarian cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer and hepatocellular cancer. &#32; 

Immuno-Oncology Intellectual Property 

We own the following intellectual property: 

&#8226; 

Portfolio of one foreign issued patent (Singapore), nine granted U.S. patents, approximately 16 U.S. pending patent applications and approximately 85 foreign. pending patent applications covering most facets of the dendritic cell vaccine product and manufacture process, including: 

&#8226; 

Pluripotent Germ Lay Origin Antigen Presenting Cancer Vaccine; 

&#8226; 

Antigen-presenting cancer vaccines, methods of manufacturing vaccines and methods of treating disease using the vaccines; 

&#8226; 

Methods of making individualized high purity carcinoma initiating (stem) cells for target indications 

&#8226; 

The portfolio is international in scope, including filings in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Singapore, China, Korea and Canada. 

Market Opportunity and Competition 

The melanoma therapeutics market across the U.S., EU and Japan was estimated to be $950 million in 2012 and is expected to grow to reach $2.75 billion by 2022, according to Decision Resources' Malignant Melanoma 2013 report. The field of developing treatments for melanoma is highly competitive. Several recently approved approaches have demonstrated improved clinical benefits in melanoma, including ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and anti-PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab (Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck, respectively). These products represent a new class of &#8220;immunotherapeutics&#8221; and have novel mechanisms of action targeting immune checkpoints. BRAF enzyme inhibitors include vemurafenib, marketed by Roche and dabrafenib from GlaxoSmithKline. Also recently approved is trametinib, a mitogen-activated protein kinase ("MEK") from GlaxoSmithKline. These therapies target critical intracellular protein pathways. In addition to the immune checkpoint modulators, several companies, including Amgen, Northwest Biotherapeutics, ImmunoCellular Therapeutics and Argos Therapeutics are developing therapeutic vaccines that act by priming a person&#8217;s immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. 

Ischemic Repair (CD34 Cell Technology) 

Our CD34 Cell technology has led to the development of therapeutic candidates designed to address diseases and conditions caused by ischemia. Ischemia occurs when the supply of oxygenated blood to healthy tissue is restricted. Through the administration of CD34 cells, we seek to promote the development and formation of new blood vessels and thereby eliminate the ischemic condition. We believe that conditions caused by underlying ischemic injury can improve through our CD34 cell technology. Published reports provide preliminary evidence that CD34 cell therapy is safe and can exert significant therapeutic effects in patients with CLI, a condition in which blood flow to the legs is severely impaired, causing pain and non-healing ulcers and, ultimately, potentially resulting in the need for amputation. Prior studies have shown benefits of CD34 cell therapy that included pain relief, ulcer healing and reduced amputation rates. Conditions such as CLI are often difficult to study in large randomized controlled programs and Japan&#8217;s new Regenerative Medicine Law is designed to advance regenerative medicine therapies such as these. The new regulations support conditional approval when there is data to show sufficient safety and some preliminary evidence of efficacy. We have explored how best to work within the Japanese Regenerative Medicine Law framework to advance this and potentially other programs through extensive consultations with the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ("PMDA"). These consultations have led to an agreement on the design for a 35-patient clinical trial for which we are seeking a partnership to fund execution. We have secured manufacturing space in Kobe, Japan to evaluate a potential CD34 cell therapy program in CLI and a small team of regulatory professionals in Japan who work with us in all interactions with the PMDA and Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare ("MHLW"). 

The goal of CLBS12 is to prevent the serious adverse consequences of no-option CLI (cases where there is no longer the potential for other treatment beyond amputation) by extending the time of continuous CLI free status through improved blood flow in the affected limb. We also believe a CD34 product would have potential in treating chronic heart failure ("CHF"). Published reports have provided evidence that CD34 cells administered into the coronary arteries of patients with CHF can improve survival compared to patients treated with standard medical therapy. 

In mid 2015, we entered into an agreement with SPS Cardio, LLC to out-license the patent and commercialization rights to our CD34 ischemic repair technology for the indications of acute myocardial infarction ("AMI") and CHF in selected non-U.S. territories. SPS is a venture capital firm that will fund this technology&#8217;s further development in these indications and designated countries. SPS intends to initiate, and subsequently to enroll and complete, a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial in India for the treatment of CHF. This trial will be conducted under internationally-accepted norms of cGMP and in such a fashion that the data will be acceptable for use as part of regulatory submissions to the FDA and other international regulatory authorities. We will be eligible to receive royalties together with a milestone upon successful development and commercialization of any product eventually sold in the territories. 

We believe that the platform technology is also potentially applicable across several other indications including ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ("STEMI"), non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ("N-STEMI"), stroke, claudication, refractory angina and Syndrome X.

&#8226; 

Issued and pending claims can be applied to broad range of conditions caused by underlying ischemia, including: AMI, chronic myocardial ischemia post-AMI; chronic heart failure; critical limb ischemia; and ischemic brain injury 

&#8226; 

2 U.S. and 12 outside the U.S. patent applications are pending. 

Market Opportunity and Competition for CLI 

In Japan there are roughly 44,000 patients with CLI, of whom roughly 21,000 are not candidates for revascularization, making them the addressable population for CLBS12. The addressable population is roughly 100,000 in the EU and 20,000 in the U.S. 

&#160; 

The field of cardiovascular cell therapy development is competitive. There are a number of companies that are developing stem cell-based therapies for cardiovascular diseases, including, but not limited to, Celyad, Capricor, Inc., Mesoblast Limited, Athersys, Inc., Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. and Vericel Corporation. These companies are utilizing a number of different therapeutic approaches in their development efforts. There are both autologous and allogeneic based competitive therapies that derive cells principally from four sources: fat, peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow. CLBS12 is an autologous therapy that derives its cells from peripheral blood via apheresis. Pluristem Therapeutics Inc. and Stempeutics Research Pvt. Ltd. are examples of two companies also seeking to launch or evaluating the potential to launch clinical trials in Japan for allogeneic cell therapy product candidates for CLI. 

Immune Modulation (T Regulatory Cell Technology) 

&#160; Our Treg technology platform is potential applicable to multiple autoimmune and allergic diseases beyond our current target indication of TID. Asthma, another condition caused by an imbalance in the immune system, occurs when excessive inflammation is triggered in the lungs resulting in constriction of the airways and difficulty breathing. The causes of asthma are complex, though it is known that over-activity of T-helper type 2 ("Th2") cells is a common feature. Th2 cells secrete the inflammatory signals that lead to the symptoms of asthma. Existing evidence indicates that Treg cells may regulate Th2 activity and therefore may have a beneficial effect on severe asthma. Certain evidence also suggests that a failure of Tregs may be important in the development systemic lupus erythematosis ("SLE") and that Treg therapy may therefore be helpful in treatment of SLE. Additionally, Tregs have been evaluated in early phase human clinical trials and have indicated clinical benefit, for graft-versus-host disease ("GVHD"). Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, multiple sclerosis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic 

obstructive pulmonary disease and inflammatory bowel disease are also other indications in which we believe Tregs may have a meaningful therapeutic effect.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

&#160; 

The health care industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in the U.S. and abroad. Various governmental regulatory authorities, as well as private accreditation organizations, oversee and monitor the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the development, manufacture and delivery of health care products and services. The following is a general description of certain current laws and regulations that are relevant to our business. 

HCT/P Regulations 

Manufacturing facilities that produce cellular therapies are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. In particular, FDA regulations set forth requirements pertaining to establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (&#8220;HCT/Ps&#8221;). Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1271 provides for a unified registration and listing system, donor-eligibility, current Good Tissue Practice ("cGTP"), and other requirements that are intended to prevent the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases by HCT/Ps. More specifically, key elements of Part 1271 include: 

&#8226; 

Registration and listing requirements for establishments that manufacture HCT/Ps; 

&#8226; 

Requirements for determining donor eligibility, including donor screening and testing; 

&#8226; 

cGTP requirements, which include requirements pertaining to the manufacturer's quality program, personnel, procedures, manufacturing facilities, environmental controls, equipment, supplies and reagents, recovery, processing and process controls, labeling, storage, record-keeping, tracking, complaint files, receipt, pre-distribution shipment, distribution, and donor eligibility determinations, donor screening, and donor testing; 

&#8226; 

Adverse reaction reporting; 

&#8226; 

Labeling of HCT/Ps; and 

&#8226; 

FDA inspection, retention, recall, destruction, and cessation of manufacturing operations. 

PCT currently collects, processes, stores and manufactures HCT/Ps, including the manufacture of cellular therapy products. NeoStem Family Storage also collects, processes, and stores HCT/Ps. Therefore, both PCT and NeoStem Family Storage must comply with cGTP and with the current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") requirements that apply to biological products. Cell and tissue based products may also be subject to the same approval standards, including demonstration of safety and efficacy, as other biologic and drug products if they meet certain criteria such as if the cells or tissues are more than minimally manipulated or if they are intended for a non-homologous use. Management believes that requirements pertaining to premarket approval do not currently apply to PCT or NeoStem Family Storage because those entities are not currently investigating, marketing or selling cellular therapy products. If either PCT or NeoStem Family Storage changes its business operations in the future, the FDA requirements that apply to PCT or NeoStem Family Storage may also change. 

State Regulation of Cell Therapy 

Certain state and local governments regulate cell-processing facilities by requiring them to obtain other specific licenses. As required under applicable state law, PCT's New Jersey and California facilities are licensed, respectively, as a blood bank in New Jersey and as a biologics manufacturing facility in California. PCT also maintains licenses with respect to states that require licensure of out-of-state facilities that process cell, tissue and/or blood samples of residents of such states (e.g., New York and Maryland). PCT has the relevant state licenses needed for processing and is AABB (American Association of Blood Banks) accredited for this purpose. Management believes that it is in material compliance with currently applicable federal, state, and local laboratory licensure requirements and intends to continue to comply with new licensing requirements that may become applicable in the future. 

Certain states may also have enacted laws and regulations, or may be considering laws and regulations, regarding the use and marketing of stem cells or cell therapy products, such as those derived from human embryos. While these laws and regulations should not directly affect PCT's business, they could affect the business of some of PCT's clients and therefore the amount of business PCT receives from these clients. 

Federal Regulation of Clinical Laboratories 

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (&#8220;CLIA&#8221;) extends federal oversight to clinical laboratories that examine or conduct testing on materials derived from the human body for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease or for the assessment of the health of human beings. CLIA requirements apply to those laboratories that handle biological matter. CLIA requires that these laboratories be certified by the government, satisfy governmental quality 

and personnel standards, undergo proficiency testing, be subject to biennial inspections and remit fees. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA include suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate necessary to conduct business, fines, or criminal penalties. Additionally, CLIA certification may sometimes be needed when an entity, such as PCT or NeoStem Family Storage, desires to obtain accreditation, certification, or license from non-government entities for cord blood collection, storage and processing. PCT has obtained CLIA certification for its facilities in New Jersey. We have been advised that, currently, CLIA certification is not required for our PCT facilities in California. However, to the extent that any of the activities of PCT or NeoStem Family Storage (for example, with regard to processing or testing blood and blood products) require CLIA certification, PCT intends to obtain and maintain such certification and/or licensure. 

Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 

The Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 established a national donor bank of cord blood and created a national network for matching cord blood to patients. The National Marrow Donor Program ("NMDP") carries out this legislation, which entails acting as the nation's Cord Blood Coordinating Center and actively recruiting parents for cord blood donations. The NMDP also administers the National Cord Blood Inventory ("NCBI"), which has a goal of collecting 150,000 cord blood units that could be used to treat patients all over the United States. Importantly, the legislation also authorized federal funding to support the legislation's goals for collecting cord blood units. 

Pharmaceutical and Biologic Products 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising and promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of biological products such as CLBS10, CLBS20 and CLBS03D. The process of obtaining required regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and money, and there is no guarantee that we will successfully complete the steps needed to obtain regulatory approval of CLBS10, CLBS20, CLBS03D or any future product candidates. In addition, these regulations may change and our product candidates may be subject to new legislation or regulations. 

In the United States, pharmaceutical and biologic products, including cellular therapies, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FD&#38;C Act&#8221;) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act ("PHS Act"). However, because most biological products also meet the definition of &#8220;drugs&#8221; under the FD&#38;C Act, they are also subject to regulation under FD&#38;C Act provisions. The PHS Act requires the submission of a biologics license application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;), rather than a New Drug Application ("NDA"), for market authorization. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. 

&#32; Failure to comply with applicable United States requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution. 

Pharmaceutical and biologic product development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of a notice of claimed investigational exemption or an investigational new drug application (&#8220;IND&#8221;), which must become effective before clinical testing can commence and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical or nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 

Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to initiate a clinical trial if FDA raises concerns or questions about the design of the clinical trial or the preclinical or manufacturing information supporting it, including concerns that human 

research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in compliance with federal regulations; good clinical practice, or GCP, as set forth in FDA guidance, which is meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 

The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements, or may impose other conditions. 

Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Under certain circumstances, a fourth phase may be required. 

&#8226; 

Phase 1 : Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the product candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients, such as cancer patients when the drug or biologic is too toxic to be ethically given to healthy individuals. 

&#8226; 

Phase 2 : Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 

&#8226; 

Phase 3 : These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 

&#8226; 

Phase 4 : In some cases, FDA may condition approval of an NDA or BLA for a product candidate on the sponsor's agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA or BLA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily carry out additional trials post approval to gain more information about the drug or biologic. Such post approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies. 

After completion of the required clinical testing, a NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs or BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,335,000, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $110,000 per product and $569,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. 

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for standard review drug or biologic products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed in six to eight months. FDA can extend these reviews by three months. Priority review can be applied to drugs or biologics that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide 

a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. 

&#160; 

&#32;The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biologic products, or drug or biologic products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. 

Before approving a NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP - a quality system regulating manufacturing - is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective in the indication studied. 

After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 

Additional Controls 

The PHS Act also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the U.S. and between states. 

Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) Standards 

The FD&#38;C Act and FDA regulations govern the quality control, manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures of products regulated as a drug or biological product, including cellular therapies comprised of HCT/Ps. These laws and regulations include requirements for cGMP. These requirements are designed to ensure that a facility's processes - and products resulting from those processes - meet defined safety requirements. The cGMP requirements are federal regulations that govern the manufacture, processing, packaging and holding of drug and cell therapy products. 

The objective of compliance with cGMP standards is to protect the public health and safety by ensuring that products (i) have the identity, strength, quality and purity that they purport or are represented to possess; (ii) meet their specifications; and (iii) are free of objectionable microorganisms and contamination. 

A central focus of the cGMP requirements is to design and build quality into the manufacturing processes and the facilities in which products are produced and to ensure the consistency, product integrity, and reproducibility of results and product characteristics. This is done by implementing quality systems and processes including specifications and documentation. 

In addition, drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can result in regulatory inspections and associated observations, warning letters, other requirements of remedial action, and, in the case of failures that are more serious, suspension of manufacturing operations, seizure, injunctions, product recalls, fines, and other penalties. We believe that our facilities are in material compliance with applicable existing FDA requirements. 

Additionally, FDA, other regulatory agencies, or the U.S. Congress may be considering, and may enact laws or regulations regarding the use and marketing of stem cells, cell therapy products, or products derived from human cells or tissue. These laws and regulations can affect us directly or the business of some of PCT's clients and therefore the amount of business PCT receives from these clients. 

Pediatric Information 

&#160; 

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act ("PREA") NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers or deferrals for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 

The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act ("BPCA") provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity-patent or non-patent-for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA&#8217;s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers. Under the BPCA, BLA-holders may obtain a six-month extension of non-patent market exclusivity for a biologic if certain conditions are met. 

Orphan Drugs 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition - generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee.
