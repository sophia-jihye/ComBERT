 Item 1. Business. 

Overview 

We are a biopharmaceutical company developing targeted, receptor-specific peptide therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with significant unmet medical need and commercial potential. Our programs are based on molecules that modulate the activity of the melanocortin and natriuretic peptide receptor systems. Our primary product in clinical development is bremelanotide for the treatment of premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD, which is a type of female sexual dysfunction, or FSD, defined as low desire with associated distress. In addition, we have drug candidates or development programs for obesity, erectile dysfunction, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, inflammatory diseases and dermatologic diseases. 

The following drug development programs are actively under development: 

&#9679; 

Bremelanotide, an as needed subcutaneous injectable peptide melanocortin receptor agonist, for treatment of HSDD in premenopausal women. Bremelanotide, which is a melanocortin agonist, is a synthetic peptide analog of the naturally occurring hormone alpha-MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone). The novel mechanism of action involves activating endogenous melanocortin hormone pathways involved in sexual response. Bremelanotide has completed the efficacy portion of patient studies in the primary Phase 3 clinical studies; 

&#9679; 

Melanocortin receptor-4, or MC4r, compounds for treatment of obesity and diabetes. Results of our studies involving MC4r peptides suggest that certain of these peptides may have significant commercial potential for treatment of conditions responsive to MC4r activation, including FSD, HSDD, erectile dysfunction or ED, obesity and diabetes; 

&#9679; 

PL-3994, a natriuretic peptide receptor-A, or NPR-A, agonist, for treatment of cardiovascular and pulmonary indications. PL-3994 is our lead natriuretic peptide receptor product candidate, and is a synthetic mimetic of the neuropeptide hormone atrial natriuretic peptide, or ANP. PL-3994 is in development for treatment of heart failure, acute exacerbations of asthma and refractory hypertension; and 

&#9679; 

Melanocortin receptor-1, or MC1r, agonist peptides for treatment of inflammatory and dermatologic disease indications. Our MC1r peptide drug candidates are highly specific, with substantially greater binding and efficacy at MC1r than at other melanocortin receptors. We have selected one of our MC1r peptide drug candidates, designated PL-8177, as a clinical trial candidate. 

The following chart illustrates the status of our drug development programs.

Our Melanocortin Receptor-Specific Programs 

The melanocortin system is involved in a large and diverse number of physiologic functions. Therapeutic agents modulating this system may have the potential to treat a variety of conditions and diseases, including sexual dysfunction, obesity and related disorders, pigmentation disorders and inflammation-related diseases. 

Bremelanotide for HSDD. We are developing subcutaneously administered bremelanotide for the treatment of HSDD in premenopausal women. HSDD is characterized by a decrease in sexual desire with significant personal distress or interpersonal difficulty as a result of the lack of desire. Bremelanotide is a melanocortin agonist with a mechanism of action involving activation of endogenous neuronal pathways regulating sexual arousal and desire responses. 

We initiated patient screening in our Phase 3 clinical study program of bremelanotide for the treatment of HSDD in premenopausal women, called the RECONNECT STUDY, in the fourth quarter of calendar 2014, completed patient enrollment in the fourth quarter of calendar 2015, and completed the last patient visits in the double blind, or efficacy, portion of the studies in the third quarter of calendar 2016. Topline results are projected early fourth quarter of calendar 2016. The open-label safety extension portion of the RECONNECT STUDY is continuing. We cannot assure you that the Phase 3 efficacy data will support approval of bremelanotide for HSDD or that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, will approve a new drug application, or NDA, for bremelanotide. 

Phase 3 Clinical Program. Prior to initiating our Phase 3 RECONNECT STUDY &#160; clinical program, we reached preliminary agreement with the FDA on key aspects of the bremelanotide efficacy Phase 3 pivotal registration studies, including HSDD patient population, primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, general study design, dose selection and safety monitoring. In addition, the FDA agreed that the Phase 2 data adequately characterized blood pressure and heart rate signals of bremelanotide. The FDA also agreed that the intranasal Definitive QTc study (an electrocardiographic evaluation), the carcinogenicity studies and the reproductive toxicity studies we conducted were acceptable for NDA submission. 

The RECONNECT STUDY is being conducted in premenopausal women diagnosed with HSDD, either with or without arousal difficulties. HSDD is the single largest specific diagnosis in FSD. We enrolled a combined total of approximately 1,250 randomized subjects in the two pivotal efficacy studies, which are double blind placebo-controlled, randomized parallel group studies. Each study had two arms, one a 1.75 mg bremelanotide dose and one a placebo. The double blind or efficacy portion of each study consisted of a 24-week treatment evaluation period, with primary and key secondary endpoints of satisfying sexual events, or SSEs, the Female Sexual Function Index, or FSFI, desire subdomain (a 28 day recall), and question 13 of the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Desire/Arousal/Orgasm, or FSDS-DAO, questionnaire. 

The last patient visits for efficacy portion of the RECONNECT STUDY were completed in the third quarter of calendar 2016. Patients in the efficacy portion of the RECONNECT STUDY had the option, after completion of the randomized portion of the study, to continue in an open-label safety extension study, in which all patients receive the 1.75 mg bremelanotide dose. The open-label safety extension study has enrolled approximately 680 patients. The open-label safety extension study will continue through the third quarter of calendar 2017, and the purpose of the extension study is to gather additional data on the safety of long-term and repeated use of bremelanotide. 

The analysis of Phase 3 efficacy data is anticipated to be completed in the fourth quarter of calendar 2016. Assuming we believe that the Phase 3 data will support approval of bremelanotide for HSDD by FDA, we will conduct drug interaction and other ancillary studies, and certain chemistry, manufacturing and controls activities, required for FDA approval in the fourth quarter of calendar 2016 and first half of calendar 2017. We anticipate submitting an NDA to FDA for approval of bremelanotide for HSDD in mid-calendar 2017. We cannot assure you that the Phase 3 data will support approval of bremelanotide for HSDD or that the FDA will approve an NDA for bremelanotide. 

In the RECONNECT STUDY patients self-administer bremelanotide with a single-use autoinjector pen. The bremelanotide single-use autoinjector pen, intended to be the commercial drug product, does not have a visible needle, is stored at room temperature and is easy to use. Women administer bremelanotide by pressing the autoinjector pen collar against either their thigh or abdomen, and the autoinjector pen automatically introduces the needle, administers the dose of bremelanotide under the skin and audibly signals when the drug has been delivered and the needle is retracted. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Phase 2B Clinical Study Results. The bremelanotide RECONNECT STUDY was predicated on the results of a Phase 2B clinical study of bremelanotide. The Phase 2B clinical study was a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group, dose-finding trial testing three dose levels, 0.75 mg, 1.25 mg and 1.75 mg, of subcutaneously administered bremelanotide against placebo in premenopausal women diagnosed with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female sexual arousal disorder or both. The 1.75 mg dose demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant results for all predefined endpoints and was well-tolerated. Full data on the Phase 2B clinical study was presented at the March 2013 annual meeting of the International Society for the Study of Women&#8217;s Sexual Health, and was published in Women&#8217;s Health , 12:3425-337 (2016). 

The Phase 2B clinical study enrolled 395 premenopausal women across 66 sites within the United States and Canada, with patients randomized to one of three bremelanotide treatment arms and a placebo arm for 16 weeks of treatment. The objective of the Phase 2B study was to measure safety and efficacy in premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female sexual arousal disorder or both of bremelanotide compared to placebo. In the Phase 2B study, subcutaneous doses of bremelanotide and placebo were self-administered by the patient prior to a sexual encounter. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to end of study in the number of SSEs, with pre-specified analysis of pooled 1.25 and 1.75 mg doses compared to placebo. 

In the Phase 2B clinical study, the primary endpoint data analysis of 327 premenopausal women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female sexual arousal disorder or both showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful increases in the number of SSEs, and statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in secondary endpoint measures of overall sexual functioning and distress related to sexual dysfunction, for women taking bremelanotide compared to placebo. Satisfying sexual events were measured with an event log and overall sexual functioning and distress related to sexual dysfunction were measured using validated patient reported outcome measurement tools. Bremelanotide showed a statistically significant increase from baseline in the number of SSEs compared against placebo at both the 1.75 mg dose and pooled results of the 1.75 and 1.25 mg doses. The mean increase in SSEs at 1.75 mg dose levels was 0.8 SSEs per month, from 1.8 to 2.6, with a p value of 0.021 against placebo. For the pooled doses, the mean increase in SSEs was 0.7 SSEs per month, from 1.6 to 2.4 (a 50% increase), with a p value of 0.018 against placebo. By contrast, with placebo, the mean change from baseline was from 1.7 to 1.9 (a 12% increase) in SSEs. The 0.75 mg dose demonstrated a response that was not significant different from placebo. 

The mean change from baseline in a validated measurement tool of overall sexual functioning, the FSFI total score, was 4.4 at the 1.75 mg dose level, compared to 1.88 for placebo, with a p value of 0.0021 against placebo. For the pooled doses, the FSFI total score mean change from baseline was 3.55, compared to 1.88 for placebo, with a p value of 0.0017 against placebo. The FSFI is a 19-item questionnaire measuring improvement in arousal, desire and overall sexual function. 

The mean change from baseline in a validated measurement tool of distress related to sexual dysfunction, the FSDS-DAO total score, was -13.1 at the 1.75 mg dose level, compared to -6.8 for placebo, with a p value of 0.0005 against placebo. For the pooled doses, the FSDS-DAO total score mean change from baseline was -11.1, compared to -6.8 for placebo, with a p value of 0.036 against placebo. The FSDS-DAO is a 15-item questionnaire that measures personal distress associated with HSDD. 

A significantly higher percentage of women receiving the 1.75 mg bremelanotide dose &#8211; 55% &#8211; achieved a clinically meaningful change from baseline of at least one satisfying sexual event, compared to 37% of women receiving placebo. In addition, compared against placebo a significantly higher percentage of women also achieved a clinically meaningful improvement in sexual function, as measured by the FSFI (53% vs. 29%), and a clinically meaningful decrease in distress associated with sexual dysfunction as measured by the FSDS-DAO (69% vs. 45%). 

Using a validated self-assessment questionnaire of treatment benefit, 79.5% of blinded patients receiving the 1.75 mg dose of bremelanotide reported they benefited from taking the drug, compared to 48.4% of blinded patients receiving placebo. 

Bremelanotide was well-tolerated during the Phase 2B clinical study. The most common types of treatment-emergent adverse events reported more frequently in the bremelanotide arms were facial flushing, nausea, emesis and headache, which were mainly mild-to-moderate in severity. Adverse events that most commonly led to discontinuation were nausea and emesis, with less than 3% discontinuation due to an adverse event. Twenty-six patients, evenly distributed among placebo and active arms of the Phase 2B clinical study, met the predefined blood pressure withdrawal criteria. Drug treated patients had approximately a 2 mm Hg change in blood pressure, predominately during the first four hours following dosing. No serious adverse events were attributable to bremelanotide during the trial. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Medical Need &#8212; HSDD. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder, either with or without arousal difficulties, is the largest single category of FSD. Female sexual dysfunction is a multifactorial condition that has anatomical, physiological, medical, psychological and social components, and is defined as persistent or recurring problems during one or more of the stages of sexual response with associated distress. HSDD has a significant impact on a patient&#8217;s self-image, relationships and general well-being. The 2006 PRESIDE (Prevalence of Female Sexual Problems Associated with Distress and Determinants of Treatment Seeking) study, a cross-sectional, population-based survey of 31,581 female adult respondents in the United States published in 2008 in the journal Obstetrics &#38; Gynecology , found that approximately 22% of women reported a sexual problem and 11% were women with HSDD. Based on the number of premenopausal women in the United States according to the U.S. Census, the presenting market size of premenopausal women with primary HSDD is at least 5.1 million women. 

Subcutaneous Bremelanotide. Bremelanotide, which is believed to act through activation of melanocortin receptors in the central nervous system, is a first-in-class pharmaceutical agent in development as a treatment of HSDD. Bremelanotide is intended for as needed use and is self-administered by the patient thirty minutes to one hour prior to anticipated sexual activity. We selected a simple and patient-friendly single-use autoinjector pen used in the RECONNECT STUDY and intended for commercialization of the bremelanotide drug product. 

Partnering. In August 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Gedeon Richter to co-develop and commercialize bremelanotide for FSD in the European Union, other European countries and additional selected countries. We received &#8364;7.5 million ($9.8 million) in total upfront payments from Gedeon Richter, and a milestone payment of &#8364;2.5 million ($3.1 million) upon the initiation of our Phase 3 clinical trial program in the United States. On September 16, 2015, we entered into a termination agreement pursuant to which we and Gedeon Richter agreed to mutually and amicably terminate the license agreement. In connection with this termination, all rights and licenses to co-develop and commercialize bremelanotide for FSD indications held by Gedeon Richter terminated and reverted back to us. Neither we nor Gedeon Richter have any future material obligations under the license agreement. 

We have worldwide rights for bremelanotide for FSD, HSDD and all other indications. We are in active discussions with potential partners for U.S. marketing and commercialization rights for bremelanotide for HSDD. We may not be able to enter into suitable agreements with potential partners on acceptable terms, if at all. 

Prior Clinical Trials. We have completed several Phase 1 clinical studies in which various safety parameters, including blood pressure effects of subcutaneously administered bremelanotide, were studied. Based in part on these studies, our Phase 2B clinical trial assessed the magnitude and duration of blood pressure effect, and determined that subcutaneous administration of selected doses of bremelanotide for treatment of HSDD in premenopausal women provides acceptable control of blood pressure effects. We have also completed clinical studies involving an alternative route of administration. Bremelanotide has been administered in 34 clinical studies involving about 3,000 subjects, including studies of premenopausal and postmenopausal women with HSDD and other forms of FSD and men with ED. 

MC1r Peptide Agonists. We have conducted preclinical animal studies with MC1r peptide drug candidates for inflammatory disease and autoimmune indications. The MC1r is upregulated in a number of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, nephritis, which is inflammation of the kidneys, and rheumatoid arthritis, and ocular indications such as uveitis and dry eye. We believe that MC1r peptides have broad anti-inflammatory effects and appear to utilize mechanisms engaged by the endogenous melanocortin system in regulation of the immune system and resolution of pro-inflammatory responses. MC1r peptides also have potential application in a number of dermatologic indications, including vitiligo and erythropoietic protoporphyria. 

Our MC1r peptide drug candidates are highly specific, with substantially greater binding and efficacy at MC1r than at other melanocortin receptors. In vitro safety studies have shown that our MC1r peptide drug candidates have no activity in a wide range of various receptors, ion channels and kinases. We have selected one of our MC1r peptide drug candidates, designated PL-8177, as a clinical trial candidate. 

Animal studies that we have conducted with our MC1r peptide drug candidates have shown positive results in experimental models of inflammatory bowel disease, uveitis and nephritis. We are continuing to conduct studies on a number of different indications. We have completed preclinical toxicology testing on PL-8177 and chemistry, controls and manufacturing activities to support Phase 1 studies, and anticipate filing an IND application on PL-8177. 

Next Generation MC4r Peptide and Small Molecule Agonists. We have developed a series of highly selective MC4r peptides and are developing orally active small molecules. In developing these compounds, we examined effectiveness in animal models of sexual response, obesity and related metabolic signals, and also determined cardiovascular effects, primarily looking at changes in blood pressure. Results of these studies suggest that certain of these compounds may have significant commercial potential for treatment of conditions responsive to MC4r activation, including HSDD, FSD, ED, obesity and diabetes. We are engaged in preclinical activities with these compounds, and are evaluating potential pharmaceutical applications. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We have selected an internal lead compound for obesity, designated PL-8905, which has over 100-fold functional selectivity for MC4r over MC1r with minimal effect on blood pressure and limited central nervous system penetration. PL-8905 exhibits significant chemical and metabolic stability. 

Obesity. Obesity is a multifactorial condition with numerous biochemical components relating to satiety (feeling full), energy utilization and homeostasis. A number of different metabolic and hormonal pathways are being evaluated by companies around the world in efforts to develop better treatments for obesity. Scientific research has established that melanocortin receptors have a role in eating behavior and energy homeostasis, and that melanocortin receptor agonists can decrease food intake and induce weight loss. With a previous partner, we completed clinical proof-of-concept studies for the MC4r mechanism in obesity, which met the primary objectives of significant decrease in food intake and weight loss. 

Other Melanocortin Receptor-Specific Programs. We are continuing drug discovery efforts in the melanocortin receptor field, primarily developing peptide compounds, including highly selective MC1r agonists and peptides specific for MC4r, including both agonists and antagonists. 

Our Natriuretic Peptide Receptor-Specific Programs 

The natriuretic peptide receptor system has numerous cardiovascular functions, and therapeutic agents modulating this system may be useful in treatment of heart failure, acute asthma, other pulmonary diseases and hypertension. While the therapeutic potential of modulating this system is well appreciated, development of therapeutic agents has been difficult due, in part, to the short biological half-life of native peptide agonists. 

We have designed and are developing candidate drugs that are selective for different natriuretic peptide receptors, including NPR-A, natriuretic peptide receptor B, or NPR-B, natriuretic peptide receptor C, or NPRC, and both NPR-A and NPR-B. 

We are in active discussions with potential partners for marketing and commercialization rights in the United States and the rest of the world for PL-3994 and our related candidate drugs. We may not be able to enter into suitable agreements on acceptable terms with potential partners, if at all. 

PL-3994. PL-3994 is our lead natriuretic peptide receptor product candidate, and is a synthetic mimetic of the neuropeptide hormone ANP and an NPR-A agonist. PL-3994 is in development for treatment of heart failure, acute exacerbations of asthma and refractory hypertension. PL-3994 activates NPR-A, a receptor known to play a role in cardiovascular homeostasis. Consistent with being an NPR-A agonist, PL-3994 increases plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate, or cGMP, levels, a pharmacological response consistent with the effects of endogenous (naturally produced) natriuretic peptides on cardiovascular function and smooth muscle relaxation. PL-3994 also decreases activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or RAAS, a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance. The RAAS system is frequently over-activated in heart failure patients, leading to worsening of cardiovascular function. 

PL-3994, our lead product development candidate which is ready for Phase 2 safety and efficacy studies, is one of a number of natriuretic peptide receptor agonist compounds we have developed. PL-3994 is a synthetic molecule incorporating a novel and proprietary amino acid mimetic structure, and has an extended circulation half-life and metabolic stability compared to endogenous ANP. Based on the half-life and pharmacokinetics, we believe that PL-3994 is amenable to once daily chronic use subcutaneous administration. 

PL-3994 for Heart Failure. Heart failure is an illness in which the heart is unable to pump blood efficiently, and includes acutely decompensated heart failure with dyspnea (shortness of breath) at rest or with minimal activity. Endogenous natriuretic peptides have a number of beneficial effects, including vasodilation (relaxation of blood vessels), natriuresis (excretion of sodium) and diuresis (excretion of fluids). 

Patients who have been admitted to the hospital with an episode of worsening heart failure have an increased risk of either death or hospital readmission in the three months following discharge. Up to 15% of patients die in this period and as many as 30% need to be readmitted to the hospital. We believe that decreasing mortality and hospital readmission in patients discharged following hospitalization for worsening heart failure is a large unmet medical need for which PL-3994 may be effective. PL-3994 could potentially be utilized as an adjunct to existing heart failure medications, and may, if successfully developed, be self-administered by patients as a subcutaneous injection following hospital discharge. We believe that PL-3994, through activation of NPR-A, may, if successful, reduce cardiac hypertrophy (increase in heart size due to disease), which is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

According to a report from the American Heart Association published in 2014 in the journal Circulation , an estimated 5.7 million Americans suffer from heart failure, with 870,000 new cases of heart failure diagnosed each year, with disease incidence expected to increase with the aging of the American population. Heart failure has tremendous human and financial costs. The same report estimated that the 2012 total costs in the United States for heart failure were $30.7 billion, with heart failure constituting the leading cause of hospitalization in people over 65 years of age and with over 1 million hospital discharges for heart failure in 2010. Heart failure is a high mortality disease, with approximately one-half of heart failure patients dying within five years of initial diagnosis. 

Patient populations have been identified which have reduced levels of endogenous active natriuretic peptides, including endogenous active ANP. The reduced levels have a variety of causes, including mutations in endogenous natriuretic peptides and in enzymes necessary to convert natriuretic peptide sequences to their active form. Patients with reduced levels of endogenous active natriuretic peptides are reported to have a poor response to current drug therapies and to have increased rates of cardiac remodeling and cardiac events. 

We believe that PL-3994 has the potential to treat heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, which is a high unmet medical need with no approved treatment options, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF, and patients with reduced levels of endogenous active natriuretic peptides, such as corin deficiencies, which is a high unmet medical need in patients with a poor response to current therapies, with the objective to restore normal natriuretic peptide function. 

We have planned a repeat dose Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with HFpEF, HFrEF and corin deficiency to evaluate safety profiles and symptom relief as well as pharmacokinetic (period to metabolize or excrete the drug) and pharmacodynamic (period of action or effect of the drug) endpoints. Analysis will include cardiac imaging and measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction. Contingent on adequate available funds, we intend to initiate this trial in the first half of calendar 2017. Assuming favorable results from this trial, we have planned a repeat dose Phase 2 proof-of-principle clinical trial in patients with heart failure, which would involve treatment for a three- to six-month period, and would evaluate safety, cardiac function, effects on remodeling, symptom improvement and hospitalization admission rates. Contingent on adequate available funds, the proof-of-principle Phase 2 trial will be initiated following completion of the first repeat dose Phase 2 clinical trial. 

PL-3994 for Acute Exacerbations of Asthma. Research over the past two decades has demonstrated potent bronchodilator effects with both systemic and inhalation administration of natriuretic peptides. NPR-A agonism is known to relax smooth muscles in airways and works through a pathway independent of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor. Preclinical testing demonstrated potent airway smooth muscle relaxation in guinea pig and human tissues using PL-3994, and animal studies in sensitized guinea pigs have demonstrated a bronchodilator effect with PL-3994 using both subcutaneous and inhalation administration. 

Acute exacerbations of asthma, also called acute severe asthma, is an ongoing, unremitting asthma episode in which asthma symptoms do not adequately respond to initial bronchodilator therapy. Inhaled beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, such as albuterol, inhaled anticholinergic drugs, such as ipratropium, and systemic corticosteroids are primary treatments for episodes of acute exacerbations of asthma. Some patients with acute exacerbations of asthma become unresponsive to beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, significantly limiting treatment options and increasing risk. Patients who do not respond to initial therapy are at risk of severe complications. We intend to initially target PL-3994 as a treatment for those at-risk unresponsive patients. 

According to a 2014 report from the National Center for Environmental Health, Asthma Prevalence in the United States, in 2010 there were 1.8 million emergency room visits and 439,000 hospitalizations attributed to asthma. Approximately 25.7 million Americans have asthma. 

Endogenous natriuretic peptides have a very short half-life, due primarily to degradation by neutral endopeptidase and clearance through the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor. PL-3994 is resistant to neutral endopeptidase and clears from the body much more slowly than endogenous natriuretic peptides. PL-3994 has a blood-plasma half-life of at least three hours in humans when administered by subcutaneous injection, with biological effects seen for over eight hours post-administration. 

Clinical Studies with PL-3994. Human clinical studies of PL-3994 commenced with a Phase 1 trial, which concluded in 2008. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 26 healthy volunteers who received either PL-3994 or a placebo subcutaneously. The evaluations included safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and several pharmacodynamic endpoints, including levels of cGMP. Dosing concluded with the successful achievement of the primary endpoint of the study, a pre-specified reduction in systemic blood pressure. No volunteer experienced a serious or severe adverse event. Elevations in plasma cGMP levels, increased diuresis and increased natriuresis were all observed for several hours after single subcutaneous doses. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Later in 2008, we conducted a Phase 2A trial in volunteers with controlled hypertension who were receiving one or more conventional antihypertensive medications. In this trial, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study in 21 volunteers, the objective was to demonstrate that PL-3994 can be given safely to patients taking antihypertensive medications commonly used in heart failure and hypertension patients. Dosing concluded with the successful achievement of the primary endpoint of the study, a pre-specified reduction in systemic blood pressure. No volunteer experienced a serious or severe adverse event. Elevations in plasma cGMP levels were observed for several hours after single subcutaneous doses. Based on the studies to date, PL-3994 is ready for Phase 2 safety and efficacy studies. 

Administration of PL-3994. For heart failure and refractory hypertension indications we believe that subcutaneous administration of PL-3994 may be preferable. PL-3994 is well absorbed through the subcutaneous route of administration. In human studies, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic half-lives were on the order of hours, significantly longer than the comparable half-lives of endogenous natriuretic peptides. We believe that subcutaneous PL-3994, if successful, will be appropriate for self-administration by patients, similar to insulin and other self-administered drugs. For asthma indications we believe that inhalation administration of PL-3994 may be preferable to subcutaneous or other systemic administration. 

Technologies We Use 

We used a rational drug design approach to discover and develop proprietary peptide, peptide mimetic and small molecule agonist compounds, focusing on melanocortin and natriuretic peptide receptor systems. Computer-aided drug design models of receptors are optimized based on experimental results obtained with peptides and small molecules that we develop. With our approach, we believe we are developing an advanced understanding of the factors which drive agonism. 

We have developed a series of proprietary technologies used in our drug development programs. One technology employs novel amino acid mimetics in place of selected amino acids. These mimetics provide the receptor-binding functions of conventional amino acids while providing structural, functional and physiochemical advantages. The amino acid mimetic technology is employed in PL-3994, our compound in development for treatment of heart failure, acute exacerbations of asthma and refractory hypertension. 

Some compound series have been derived using our proprietary and patented platform technology, called MIDAS&#8482;, or M etal I on-induced D istinctive A rray of S tructures. This technology employs metal ions to fix the three-dimensional configuration of peptides, forming conformationally rigid molecules that remain folded specifically in their active state. These MIDAS molecules are generally simple to synthesize, are chemically and proteolytically stable, and have the potential to be orally bioavailable. In addition, MIDAS molecules are information-rich and provide data on structure-activity relationships that may be used to design small molecule, non-peptide drugs. 

Amount Spent on Research and Development Activities 

Research and development expenses were approximately $43.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, or fiscal 2016, $24.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, or fiscal 2015, and $10.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, or fiscal 2014. 

Competition 

General. Our products under development will compete on the basis of quality, performance, cost effectiveness and application suitability with numerous established products and technologies. We have many competitors, including pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Furthermore, there are several well-established products in our target markets that we will have to compete against. Products using new technologies which may be competitive with our proposed products may also be introduced by others. Most of the companies selling or developing competitive products have financial, technological, manufacturing and distribution resources significantly greater than ours and may represent significant competition for us. In addition, if any of our product candidates are approved by FDA, they will eventually face competition from generic versions that will sell at significantly reduced prices, be preferred by managed care and health insurance payers, and be eligible for automatic pharmacy substitution even when a prescriber writes a prescription for our product. The timing and extent of future generic competition is dependent upon both our intellectual property rights and the FDA regulatory process, but cannot be accurately predicted. 

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological change. Many biopharmaceutical companies have developed or are working to develop products similar to ours or that address the same markets. Such companies may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective or less costly than any of those that we may develop. Such companies may be more successful than us in developing, manufacturing and marketing products. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete successfully in the future or that developments by others will not render our proposed products under development or any future product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive or that our collaborators or customers will not choose to use competing technologies or products. 

Bremelanotide for Treatment of HSDD. There is competition and financial incentive to develop, market and sell drugs for the treatment of HSDD and other forms of FSD. Flibanserin, sold under the trade name Addyi&#174;, is the only drug currently approved in the United States for treatment of HSDD. Flibanserin, a non-hormonal oral serotonin 5-HT1A agonist, 5-HT2A antagonist, which requires chronic dosing, was approved by the FDA on August 18, 2015 for treatment of premenopausal women with HSDD. The FDA approval included a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, because of the increased risk of severe hypotension and syncope due to the interaction between flibanserin and alcohol, and a Boxed Warning to highlight the risks of severe hypotension and syncope in patients who drink alcohol during treatment with flibanserin, in those who also use moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, and in those who have liver impairment. Approval by the FDA followed a positive FDA advisory committee recommendation in June 2015. We are aware of several other drugs at various stages of development, most of which are taken on a chronic, typically once-daily, basis. An oral fixed-dose combination of two antidepressants, bupropion and trazodone, is reported to be entering Phase 2 studies in premenopausal women with HSDD. Another company is developing two different oral fixed-dose combination drugs, one a combination of sildenafil and testosterone and the other a combination of testosterone and buspirone hydrochloride, and has conducted Phase 2 studies. Libigel&#174;, a testosterone gel, completed two Phase 3 efficacy trials for treatment of FSD in surgically post-menopausal women, but did not show statistical separation from placebo in those trials. Intrinsa, a transdermal testosterone patch, successfully completed a Phase 3 clinical program, but was not approved in the United States based on potential long-term use safety risks of cancer and cardiovascular adverse events. There are other companies reported to be developing new drugs for FSD indications, some of which may be in clinical trials in the United States or elsewhere. We are not aware of any company actively developing a melanocortin receptor agonist drug for HSDD. 

PL-3994 for Heart Failure Indications. Nesiritide (sold under the trade name Natrecor&#174;), a recombinant human B-type natriuretic peptide drug, is marketed in the United States by Scios Inc., a Johnson &#38; Johnson company. Nesiritide is approved for treatment of acutely decompensated congestive heart failure patients who have dyspnea at rest or with minimal activity. Other peptide drugs, including carperitide, a recombinant human atrial natriuretic peptide drug, and ularitide, a synthetic form of urodilatin, a naturally occurring human natriuretic peptide related to atrial natriuretic peptide, have been investigated for treatment of congestive heart failure, but we are not aware of any active development in the United States. We are aware of other companies developing intravenously administered natriuretic peptide drugs, with at least one reported to have completed Phase 2 clinical trials for acute heart failure. A combination drug comprised of sacubitril and valsartan developed by Novartis AG, sold under the trade name Entresto&#174;, inhibits both the angiotensin II receptor and neprilysin (an enzyme which inactivates endogenous active natriuretic peptides). This combination drug, which was approved by the FDA in July 2015, results in increases of endogenous active ANP levels, and thus has a mechanism of action with similarities to PL-3994. In a Phase 3 trial, the combination drug was compared to an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction. It significantly improved the rate of death from cardiovascular causes, significantly reduced hospitalization for heart failure and significantly improved heart failure symptoms. This combination drug demonstrated that upregulation of the natriuretic peptide system in combination with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition is superior to angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibition alone, and thus provides validation of the natriuretic peptide system as a target for improving outcomes in treating heart failure patients. In addition, there are a number of approved drugs and drugs in development for treatment of heart failure through mechanisms or pathways other than agonism of NPR-A. 

PL-3994 for Acute Exacerbations of Asthma Indications. The asthma market is intensively competitive, with substantial competition and financial incentive to develop, market and sell drugs for treatment of asthma, with projected costs of prescription drugs of $5.9 billion in the United States in 2010. We are aware of companies developing drugs for the specific indications of either acute exacerbations of asthma or acute severe asthma, including at least one company with a drug reported to be currently in clinical trials. Certain of these drugs under development work by mechanisms of action different from the mechanisms of action of currently approved products. In addition, a number of clinical trials are conducted by hospitals, research institutes and others exploring various methods and combinations of drugs to treat acute exacerbations of asthma. There are a number of drugs and therapies currently used to treat acute exacerbations of asthma, including administration of oral or intravenous systemic steroids, use of oxygen or heliox, a mixture of helium and oxygen, nebulized short-acting beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, intravenous or nebulized anticholinergic agents and, for patients in or approaching respiratory arrest, intubation and mechanical ventilation. However, each of these drugs or therapies has recognized limitations or liabilities, and we believe that there remains an unmet medical need for a safe and effective treatment for acute exacerbations of asthma. We are not aware of any other company actively developing a drug to treat asthma using a natriuretic peptide receptor pathway. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

MC4r Peptides for Erectile Dysfunction. Leading drugs approved for erectile dysfunction, or ED, indications are PDE-5 inhibitors which target the vascular system, such as sildenafil (sold under the trade name Viagra&#174;), vardenafil (sold under the trade name Levitra&#174;) and tadalafil (sold under the trade name Cialis&#174;). Other drugs approved for ED indications include alprostadil for injection (sold under the trade name Caverject Impulse&#174; among others), which is injected directly into the penis, and alprostadil in urethral suppository format (sold under the trade name MUSE&#174;). In addition, a variety of devices, including vacuum devices and surgical penile implants, have been approved for ED indications. We are aware of a number of companies developing new drugs for ED indications, some of which are in clinical trials in the United States and elsewhere. We are not aware of any company actively developing a melanocortin receptor agonist drug for ED. 

Obesity. There are a number of FDA-approved drugs and medical devices for the treatment of obesity, and a large number of products in clinical development by other companies, including products which target melanocortin receptors. At least one Phase 2 study has been reported on use of an MC4r agonist for obesity indications. 

MC1r Peptides for Dermatologic and Inflammatory Disease-Related Indications. Many dermatologic and inflammatory disease-related indications are treated using systemic steroids or immunosuppressant drugs, both of which have side effects which can be dose limiting. There are a large number of approved biological drugs and biological drugs under development for treatment of dermatologic and inflammatory disease-related indications. 

Patents and Proprietary Information 

Patent Protection. Our success will depend in substantial part on our ability to obtain, defend and enforce patents, maintain trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and abroad. We own a number of issued United States patents and have pending United States patent applications, many with issued or pending counterpart patents in selected foreign countries. We seek patent protection for our technologies and products in the United States and those foreign countries where we believe patent protection is commercially important. 

We own two issued United States patents claiming the bremelanotide substance and an issued patent claiming the bremelanotide substance in each of Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The issued United States patents have a term until 2020, which term may be subject to extension for a maximum period of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during drug development and the FDA regulatory review process, pursuant to the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Whether we will be able to obtain patent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and the length of any such extension cannot be determined until the FDA approves for marketing, if ever, a product in which bremelanotide is the active ingredient. In addition, the claims of issued patents covering bremelanotide may not provide meaningful protection. Further, third parties may challenge the validity or scope of any issued patent, and under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, potentially receive approval of a competing generic version of our product or products even before a court rules on the validity or infringement of our patents. 

We own an issued United States patent and pending patent applications in the United States for methods of treating FSD with bremelanotide, and related patent applications are pending in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Georgia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Ukraine, Vietnam and before the European and Eurasian patent offices. The issued United States patent has a term until 2033. Whether we will be able to obtain a patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, assuming that a relevant patent issues in the United States, and the length of any such extension, cannot be determined until the FDA approves for marketing, if ever, a product utilizing bremelanotide by methods claimed in the patent. Pending applications in the United States and elsewhere in the world have a presumptive term, if a patent is issued, until 2033. 

We have patents and patent applications on an alternative class of melanocortin receptor-specific peptides for treatment of sexual dysfunction and other indications, including obesity, consisting of two issued patents in the United States, an issued patent in each of Australia, Canada, China, Israel, Mexico, New Zealand, Japan and Russia, and pending patent applications on the same class in Brazil, India, Korea, and South Africa and before the European patent office. The presumptive term of the issued patents and pending patent applications is until 2029. We also have patents and pending patent applications for a second class of alternative melanocortin receptor-specific peptides for treatment of sexual dysfunction and other indications, including obesity, consisting of issued patents in the United States, Australia, China, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and South Africa and pending patent applications on the same class in Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel, Korea, and before the European patent office. The presumptive term of the issued patents and pending patent applications is until 2030. Until one or more product candidates covered by a claim of one of these patents and patent applications are developed for commercialization, which may never occur, we cannot evaluate the duration of any potential patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We own issued patents in the United States, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Russia claiming highly selective MC1r agonist peptides for treatment of inflammation-related diseases and disorders and related indications, and pending patent applications on two broad classes of highly selective MC1r agonist peptides in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, and Mexico and before the European patent office. The presumptive term of the issued patents and pending patent applications is until 2030. Until one or more product candidates covered by a claim of one of these patent applications are developed for commercialization, which may never occur, we cannot evaluate the duration of any potential patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. 

We own two issued United States patents claiming the PL-3994 substance and other natriuretic peptide receptor agonist compounds that we have developed and an issued United States patent claiming a precursor molecule to the PL-3994 substance, both of which expire in 2027. Corresponding patents on the PL-3994 substance and other natriuretic peptide receptor agonist compounds were issued in Australia, Austria, Belgium, China, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, with terms until 2027. Patent applications on the PL-3994 substance and other natriuretic peptide receptor agonist compounds are pending in Brazil and Canada, with presumptive terms until 2027. Applications claiming precursor molecules for the PL-3994 substance and other compounds have issued in the United States, Australia, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Philippines, Korea, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and expire in 2027. Patent applications on the precursor molecules are pending in Brazil, Canada, and before the Eurasian Patent Office, with presumptive terms until 2027. We also own an issued United States patent claiming use of the PL-3994 substance for treatment of acute asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which expires in 2031. We do not know the full scope of patent coverage we will obtain, or whether any patents will issue other than the patents already issued. Until one or more product candidates covered by a claim of the issued patents or one of these patent applications are developed for commercialization, which may never occur, we cannot evaluate the duration of any potential patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. 

We additionally have 31 issued United States patents on melanocortin receptor specific peptides and small molecules, and three issued United States patents on natriuretic peptide receptor agonist compounds, but we are not actively developing any product candidate covered by a claim of any of these patents. 

In the event that a third party has also filed a patent application relating to an invention we claimed in a patent application, we may be required to participate in an interference proceeding adjudicated by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention. The possibility of an interference proceeding could result in substantial uncertainties and cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. An adverse outcome could result in the loss of patent protection for the subject of the interference, subjecting us to significant liabilities to third parties, the need to obtain licenses from third parties at undetermined cost, or requiring us to cease using the technology. 

Future Patent Infringement. We do not know for certain that our commercial activities will not infringe upon patents or patent applications of third parties, some of which may not even have been issued. Although we are not aware of any valid United States patents which are infringed by bremelanotide or PL-3994, we cannot exclude the possibility that such patents might exist or arise in the future. We may be unable to avoid infringement of any such patents and may have to seek a license, defend an infringement action, or challenge the validity of such patents in court. Patent litigation is costly and time consuming. If such patents are valid and we do not obtain a license under any such patents, or we are found liable for infringement, we may be liable for significant monetary damages, may encounter significant delays in bringing products to market, or may be precluded from participating in the manufacture, use or sale of products or methods of treatment covered by such patents. 

Proprietary Information. We rely on proprietary information, such as trade secrets and know-how, which is not patented. We have taken steps to protect our unpatented trade secrets and know-how, in part through the use of confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees, consultants and certain contractors. If our employees, scientific consultants, collaborators or licensees develop inventions or processes independently that may be applicable to our product candidates, disputes may arise about the ownership of proprietary rights to those inventions and processes. Such inventions and processes will not necessarily become our property, but may remain the property of those persons or their employers. Protracted and costly litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

If trade secrets are breached, our recourse will be solely against the person who caused the secrecy breach. This might not be an adequate remedy to us because third parties other than the person who causes the breach will be free to use the information without accountability to us. This is an inherent limitation of the law of trade secret protection. 

U.S. Governmental Regulation of Pharmaceutical Products 

General 

Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries will continue to significantly impact our research, product development, manufacturing and marketing of any pharmaceutical products. The nature and the extent to which regulations apply to us will vary depending on the nature of any such products. Our potential pharmaceutical products will require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. The products we are developing are subject to federal regulation in the United States, principally by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and by state and local governments, as well as regulatory and other authorities in foreign governments that include rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other approval procedures. Such regulations govern or influence, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety and efficacy requirements, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, licensing, advertising, promotion, distribution and export of products, manufacturing and the manufacturing process. In many foreign countries, such regulations also govern the prices charged for products under their respective national social security systems and availability to consumers. 

All drugs intended for human use are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA in the United States and similar regulatory bodies in other countries. The steps ordinarily required by the FDA before an innovative new drug product may be marketed in the United States are similar to steps required in most other countries and include, but are not limited to: 

&#9679; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal testing and formulation studies; 

&#9679; 

submission to the FDA of an IND, which must be in effect before clinical trials may commence; 

&#9679; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA that includes preclinical data, clinical trial data and manufacturing information; 

&#9679; 

payment of substantial user fees for filing the NDA and other recurring user fees; 

&#9679; 

FDA review of the NDA; 

&#9679; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities; and 

&#9679; 

FDA approval of the NDA, including approval of all product labeling. 

For combination products deemed to have a &#8216;&#8216;drug&#8217;&#8217; primary mode of action, primary review of the product will be conducted by the appropriate division within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, but CDER will consult with the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH, to ensure that the device components of the product meet all applicable device requirements. 

The research, development and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and approvals may not be granted on a timely or commercially viable basis, if at all. 

Preclinical testing includes laboratory evaluations to characterize the product&#8217;s composition, impurities, stability, and mechanism of its pharmacologic effect, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of each product. Preclinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Animal Welfare Act. Violations of these laws and regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the tests, requiring such tests to be repeated and delaying approval of the NDA. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of human clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to an IND by placing the study on clinical hold, the IND will go into effect 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. The FDA may authorize trials only on specified terms and may suspend ongoing clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. If the FDA places a study on clinical hold, the sponsor must resolve all of the FDA&#8217;s concerns before the study may begin or continue. The IND application process may become extremely costly and substantially delay development of products. Similar restrictive requirements also apply in other countries. Additionally, positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to humans under the supervision of qualified principal investigators. Our clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations under protocols submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. In addition, each clinical trial is approved and conducted under the auspices of an institutional review board, or IRB, and requires the patients&#8217; informed consent. An IRB considers, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possibility of liability of the institutions conducting the trial. The IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a belief that the test subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. As the sponsor, we can also suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, Phases 1, 2, and 3, involving an increasing number of human subjects. These phases may sometimes overlap or be combined. Phase 1 trials are performed in a small number of healthy human subjects or subjects with the targeted condition, and involve testing for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Phase 2 studies, which may involve up to hundreds of subjects, seek to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, preliminary information related to the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, dosage tolerance, and optimal dosage. Finally, Phase 3 trials may involve up to thousands of individuals often at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, and are intended to provide the documentation of effectiveness and important additional safety data required for approval. Prior to commencing Phase 3 clinical trials many sponsors elect to meet with FDA officials to discuss the conduct and design of the proposed trial or trials. 

In addition, federal law requires the listing, on a publicly-available website, of detailed information on clinical trials for investigational drugs. Some states have similar or supplemental clinical trial reporting laws. 

Success in early-stage animal studies and clinical trials does not necessarily assure success in later-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from animal studies and clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to alternative interpretations that could delay, limit or even prevent regulatory approval. 

All data obtained from the preclinical studies and clinical trials, in addition to detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, would be submitted in an NDA to the FDA for review and approval for the manufacture, marketing and commercial shipments of any of our products. FDA approval of the NDA is required before commercial marketing or non-investigational interstate shipment may begin in the United States. The FDA may also conduct an audit of the clinical trial data used to support the NDA. 

The FDA may deny or delay approval of an NDA that does not meet applicable regulatory criteria. For example the FDA may determine that the preclinical or clinical data or the manufacturing information does not adequately establish the safety and efficacy of the drug. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may disagree with an applicant&#8217;s interpretation of the data submitted in its NDA. The FDA can request additional information, seek clarification regarding information already provided in the submission or ask that new additional clinical trials be conducted, all of which can delay approval. Similar types of regulatory processes will be encountered as efforts are made to market any drug internationally. We will be required to assure product performance and manufacturing processes from one country to another. 

Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved uses for the product as described in the product labeling, require that contraindications, warning statements or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that additional studies be conducted following approval as a condition of the approval, impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval or limit labeling. Once it approves an NDA, the FDA may revoke or suspend the product approval if compliance with post-market regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-market studies. The FDA and other government agencies have broad post-market regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy civil and criminal penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and revoke approvals. 

Pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors and their subcontractors are required to register their facilities with the FDA and state agencies. Manufacturers are required to list their marketed drugs with the FDA, are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other authorities, where applicable, and must comply with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, regulations, and the product specifications set forth in the approved NDA. The GMP requirements for pharmaceutical products are extensive and compliance with them requires considerable time, resources and ongoing investment. The regulations require manufacturers and suppliers of raw materials and components to establish validated systems and to employ and train qualified employees to ensure that products meet high standards of safety, efficacy, stability, sterility (where applicable), purity, and potency. The requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the synthesis, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug product. For all drug products, the regulations require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP requirements and impose documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Manufacturing establishments are subject to mandatory user fees, and to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with all GMP requirements. The FDA is authorized to inspect manufacturing facilities without a warrant at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We or our present or future suppliers may not be able to comply with GMP and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer and/or the NDA sponsor or distributor to possible legal or regulatory action, such as a delay or refusal to approve an NDA, suspension of manufacturing, seizure or recall of a product, or civil or criminal prosecution of the company or individual officers or employees. 

Post-Marketing Regulation 

Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals, as well as the materials and components used in our products, are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including: 

&#9679; 

recordkeeping requirements; 

&#9679; 

periodic reporting requirements; 

&#9679; 

GMP requirements related to all stages of manufacturing, testing, storage, packaging, labeling and distribution of finished dosage forms of the product; 

&#9679; 

monitoring and reporting of adverse experiences with the product; and 

&#9679; 

advertising and promotional reporting requirements and restrictions. 

Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or product removal. Product approvals may be revoked if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or effectiveness of the product occur following approval. The FDA is developing a national electronic drug safety tracking system known as SENTINEL that may impose additional safety monitoring burdens, and enhanced FDA enforcement authority, beyond the extensive requirements already in effect. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor a product&#8217;s safety or efficacy. The FDA also may impose other conditions, including labeling restrictions which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of a product. 

With respect to post-market product advertising and promotion, the FDA and other government agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice, and individual States, impose a number of complex regulations on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, including, among others, standards and restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FFDCA, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in administrative and judicial enforcement actions, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing correction of deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, False Claims Act prosecution based on alleged off-label marketing seeking monetary and other penalties, including potential exclusion of the drug and/or the company from participation in government health care programs, and state and federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions. Foreign regulatory bodies also strictly enforce these and other regulatory requirements and drug marketing may be prohibited in whole or in part in other countries. 

We, our collaborators or our third-party contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with the applicable regulations. After regulatory approvals are obtained, the subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems, or the failure to maintain compliance with existing or new regulatory requirements, may result in: 

&#9679; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product; 

&#9679; 

Warning Letters or Untitled Letters from the FDA asking us, our collaborators or third-party contractors to take or refrain from taking certain actions; 

&#9679; 

withdrawal of the product from the market; 

&#9679; 

the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications; 

&#9679; 

voluntary or mandatory product recall; 

&#9679; 

fines or disgorgement of profits or revenue; 

&#9679; 

suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals; 

&#9679; 

refusals to permit the import or export of products; 

&#9679; 

product seizure; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

We may also be subject to healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement and our failure to comply with any such laws, regulations or enforcement could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. Certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients&#8217; rights are and will be applicable to our business. We are subject to regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we or our partners conduct our business. The laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include: 

&#9679; 

the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual or in return for the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 

&#9679; 

federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including, for example, the federal civil False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 

&#9679; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payer (e.g., public or private), knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; 

&#9679; 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations, which impose obligations on covered entities, including healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their respective business associates that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 

&#9679; 

the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Affordable Care Act, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and 

&#9679; 

state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be provided to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent health care reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management&#8217;s attention from the operation of our business. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws or regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 

Generic Competition 

Orange Book Listing. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product. Upon approval of a drug, the applicant identifies all patents that claim the approved product&#8217;s active ingredient(s), the drug product&#8217;s approved formulation, or an approved method of use of the drug. Each of the identified patents are then published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing, unless such testing is waived by the FDA, as is the case with some injectable drug products, to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8216;&#8216;generic equivalents&#8217;&#8217; to the listed drug, and can usually be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 

The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify either that: (1) the required patent information has not been filed (a Paragraph I Certification); (2) the listed patent has expired (a Paragraph II Certification); (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and the generic approval is being sought only after patent expiration (a Paragraph III Certification); or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the proposed generic product (a Paragraph IV Certification). In certain circumstances, the ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a &#8216;&#8216;section (viii)&#8217;&#8217; statement instead of a Paragraph IV Certification, certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the application contains only Paragraph I or Paragraph II Certifications, the ANDA may be approved as soon as FDA completes its review and concludes that all approval requirements have been met. If the ANDA contains one or more Paragraph III Certifications, the ANDA cannot not be approved until each listed patent for which a Paragraph III Certification was filed have expired. 

If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA holder and patent owner once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The patent owner or NDA holder may then commence a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months (the &#8216;&#8216;30-month stay&#8217;&#8217;), expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit in which the patent owner admits that the patent is invalid or not infringed by the ANDA product, or a decision in the infringement case that holds the patent to be invalid or not infringed, or an order by the court shortening the 30-month stay due to actions by the patent holder to delay the litigation. In most circumstances, NDA holder is only eligible for one 30-month stay against an ANDA. 

If a patent infringement action is filed against an ANDA applicant, any settlement of the litigation must be submitted to the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC. If the FTC believes the terms or effects of the settlement are anticompetitive, FTC may bring an antitrust enforcement action against the parties. Private parties may also bring antitrust lawsuits against drug companies based on such patent litigation settlements. 

The ANDA also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent regulatory exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 

Regulatory Exclusivity. Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot receive for review any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. An ANDA containing a Paragraph IV Certification may be received by FDA 4 years after the NCE drug&#8217;s approval, but any 30-month stay that ensues would be extended so that it expires seven and one half years after the NCE approval date, subject to early termination by reason of a court decision or settlement as described above. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Certain changes to an NDA drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, for which new clinical trials, conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by FDA to be essential to the approval of the change, can be eligible for a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. An ANDA that contains a section (viii) statement to a method of use patent may be approved with labeling that omits the patented use before the use patent expires. Generic drugs approved with such a labeling carve out may be substituted by pharmacists for the original branded drug before the method of use patent expires. 

Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications. Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA or an ANDA. A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA&#8217;s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. 

505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. A 505(b)(2) NDA may be used where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by, or for, the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA&#8217;s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all, or some, of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication or conditions of use sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the expiration of any 30-month stay, subject to early termination of the stay as described above. 

Changing Legal and Regulatory Landscape 

Periodically, legislation is introduced in the U.S. Congress that could change the statutory and regulatory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of our drugs. In addition, the FDCA, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA or the courts in ways that may significantly affect our business and products. We cannot predict whether or when legislation or court decisions impacting our business will be enacted or issued, what FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations may change, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be in the future. 

Third-Party Reimbursements 

Successful sales of our proposed products in the United States and other countries depend, in large part, on the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payers such as governmental entities, managed care organizations, health maintenance organizations, or HMOs, and private insurance plans. Reimbursement by a third-party payer depends on a number of factors, including the payer&#8217;s determination that the product has been approved by the FDA for the indication for which the claim is being made, that it is neither experimental nor investigational, and that the use of the product is safe and efficacious, medically necessary, appropriate for the specific patient and cost effective. 

Since reimbursement by one payer does not guarantee reimbursement by another, we or our licensees may be required to seek approval from each payer individually. Seeking such approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. Third-party payers routinely limit the products that they will cover and the amount of money that they will pay and, in many instances, are exerting significant pressure on medical suppliers to lower their prices. 

Payers frequently employ a tiered system in reimbursing end users for pharmaceutical products, with tier designation affecting copay or deductible amounts. The only approved product for treating HSDD is flibanserin, sold under the trade name Addyi&#174;. There is significant uncertainty concerning the extent and scope of third-party reimbursement for products treating HSDD. Based on third-party reimbursement for approved products treating ED, we believe bremelanotide will be classified as a Tier 3 drug, so that reimbursement will be limited for bremelanotide for treatment of premenopausal women with HSDD, assuming the product is approved by the FDA. Less than full reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payers may adversely affect the market acceptance of bremelanotide. Further, healthcare reimbursement systems vary from country to country, and third-party reimbursement might not be made available for bremelanotide for HSDD under any other reimbursement system.

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Marketing 

To be successful, our proposed products will need to be manufactured in commercial quantities under GMP prescribed by the FDA and at acceptable costs. We do not have the facilities to manufacture any of our proposed products under GMP. We intend to rely on collaborators, licensees or contract manufacturers for the commercial manufacture of our proposed products. 

Our bremelanotide product candidate is a synthetic peptide. While the production process involves well-established technology, there are few manufacturers capable of scaling up to commercial quantities under GMP at acceptable costs. We have identified one third-party manufacturer for the production of bremelanotide, Lonza Ltd., and have validated manufacturing of the bremelanotide drug substance under GMP with that manufacturer. We are in the process of negotiating a long-term supply agreement with Lonza, and may not be able to enter into a supply agreement on acceptable terms, if at all. 

Our bremelanotide product candidate will be a combination product, incorporating both the bremelanotide drug substance and a delivery device. We will rely on a third-party manufacturer, Ypsomed AG, to make the delivery device and to ensure its and the device&#8217;s continued compliance with all FDA medical device regulations. We have selected an autoinjector pen delivery device, and are negotiating a long-term supply and manufacturing agreement, but may not be able to enter into such an agreement on acceptable terms, if at all. A third-party contract manufacturer, Catalent Belgium S.A., performs fill, finish and packaging of our bremelanotide product candidate. We have negotiated a long-term commercial supply agreement with Catalent Belgium S.A. 

Our PL-3994 product candidate is a peptide mimetic molecule, incorporating a proprietary amino acid mimetic structure and amino acids. We identified a manufacturer that made the product in quantities sufficient for Phase 1, and are evaluating commercial-scale manufacturers. Scaling up to commercial quantities may involve production, purification, formulation and other problems not present in the scale of manufacturing done to date. 

Our MC1r and MC4r agonist product candidates are synthetic peptides, which we have manufactured only at laboratory scale. We have not contracted with a third-party manufacturer to produce these synthetic peptides for either clinical trials or commercial purposes. While the production process involves well-established technology, there are few manufacturers capable of scaling up to commercial quantities under GMP at acceptable costs. Additionally, scaling up to commercial quantities may involve production, purification, formulation and other problems not present in the scale of manufacturing done to date. 

The failure of any manufacturer or supplier to comply with FDA regulations, including GMP or medical device quality systems regulations, or QSR, or to supply the device component or drug substance and services as agreed, would force us to seek alternative sources of supply and could interfere with our ability to deliver product on a timely and cost effective basis or at all. Establishing relationships with new manufacturers or suppliers, any of whom must be FDA-approved, is a time-consuming and costly process. 

Product Liability and Insurance 

Our business may be affected by potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and use of our proposed products. We have liability insurance providing $10 million coverage in the aggregate as to certain clinical trial risks. 

Employees 

As of September 16, 2016, we employed 22 people full time, of whom 16 are engaged in research and development activities and 6 are engaged in administration and management, and had no part-time employees. While we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel, competition for personnel in our industry is intense. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. All of our employees have executed confidentiality and intellectual property agreements. We consider relations with our employees to be good. 

We rely on contractors and scientific consultants to work on specific research and development programs. We also rely on independent organizations, advisors and consultants to provide services, including aspects of manufacturing, testing, preclinical evaluation, clinical management, regulatory strategy and market research. Our independent advisors, contractors and consultants sign agreements that provide for confidentiality of our proprietary information and that we have the rights to any intellectual property developed while working for us.
