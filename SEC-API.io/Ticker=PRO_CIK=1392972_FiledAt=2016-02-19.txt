Our industry 

Data-driven decision making is an important driver of business performance. Intense global competition, market volatility and rising costs put pressure on companies to simultaneously drive top-line and bottom-line results. In response to these pressures, we believe companies are increasingly focused on software solutions that leverage prescriptive analytics to accelerate the process of converting prospects to customers using data science-based decision-making technology. We also believe that market forces, including increasingly complex business models, uncertain demand for products and services, volatile costs, and exponentially increasing enterprise and market data, will accelerate the demand for software solutions that align critical sales, pricing and revenue management processes to help increase visibility, business agility and customer engagement. We believe the market for solutions that address the needs for companies to improve top and bottom-line financial results simultaneously is a large and growing opportunity that spans most major industries. 

Our solutions 

PROS revenue and profit realization solutions offer what we believe is a holistic approach to improving revenue and 

profit performance. Our selling and pricing solutions leverage prescriptive analytics designed to accelerate the process of converting prospects to customers, using data science-based decision-making technology. Our solutions are designed to enable companies to move pricing and revenue management strategies to leveraging scaled data-driven pricing strategies that are formulated to help increase profit margins by driving profit expansion and protecting against profit erosion. These data-driven insights help identify which customers and prospects of a company are most likely to buy, and what offers and price points are most likely to result in a closed deal. These insights leverage data science based on a company's historic customer transactions, market and other data to uncover customer buying patterns and preferences. T his data science embedded in our solutions provides our customers with predictive and prescriptive guidance on key business decisions that drive growth and profitability, including product mix optimization, price forecasting, price optimization, product configuration recommendations, cross-sell and upsell recommendations, attrition detection, and willingness-to-pay. Our solutions also help to increase visibility, business agility and customer engagement by aligning critical sales, pricing and revenue management processes. As a result, our solutions make it easier for companies to configure the correct product(s), set the right price and get a quote into the hands of a customer faster. 

Historically, we primarily offered perpetual license solutions to our customers. For perpetual licenses, our customers received the perpetual right to use our software. Our license agreements provide customers with the right to use licensed solutions within a specific license scope, including but not limited to revenue, geography, users, and business unit. The vast majority of our software license customers also purchased software maintenance and support, generally for an initial period of two years, then annual renewals thereafter. Software maintenance and support include unspecified software updates and enhancements on a when and if available basis, maintenance releases, and patches released during the term of the support period. 

We also historically offered some of our solutions as Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS"). However, in mid-2015, we shifted our business to offer our solutions primarily via a SaaS delivery model. Our SaaS and cloud-based solutions enable our customers to implement, access and use our software on the PROS cloud via an internet connection. We believe our cloud solutions allow our customers to reduce their initial investment in third-party software, hardware, and administration requirements over traditional enterprise software, and also allow smaller customers to cost-effectively leverage our enterprise class infrastructure, infrastructure management, security and other best practices. In addition, as we manage all product updates and upgrades of software deployed on the PROS cloud on behalf of our customers, we are able to provide our customers with our latest product innovations in a more uniform way. Over time, we expect that this model will require us to support fewer old versions of our software solutions, which would allow our product development team to focus more effort on creating innovative enhancements to our existing products and developing new products. We offer both single-tenant and multi-tenant solutions under our SaaS model generally via three year subscriptions with pricing generally based on the number of users, data volume and revenue managed by our software. 

Our high-performance software architecture supports real-time, high-volume transaction processing and enables us to handle the processing and database requirements of sophisticated customers, including those who need to respond to their customers with sub-second electronic response requirements. We provide standardized configurations of our software based on the industries we serve and offer professional services to configure these solutions to meet the specific needs of each customer. Our software solutions &#32;currently operate in large, complex and demanding information technology environments. 

PROS revenue and profit realization software solutions enable companies across many industries that we service to improve top-line and bottom-line financial results simultaneously by aligning sales, pricing, product, demand and availability. Our cloud solutions for revenue and profit realization include SellingPRO, PricingPRO, and RevenuePRO.

Technology 

Software Architecture. &#32; Our software architecture is based on open standards such as Java, HTML5, JavaScript, Flex, XML, and HTTP. We have created a component-based design in a service-oriented architecture to develop a flexible, layered framework. This framework supports parallel and independent evolution and innovation in technologies and product features. 

Service-Oriented Architecture. &#32; A comprehensive web services interface is at the heart of our architecture. This interface enables extension onto other platforms and the creation of rich integrated solutions. It is also the foundation of our initiative to bring our solutions to the software (Microsoft Excel&#174; and Microsoft SharePoint&#174;) and hardware (Apple Inc.'s iPhone&#174; and iPad&#174;, Windows Phone&#174;, BlackBerry&#174;, and Android&#8482; phones) tools that many businesses are already using. 

Embedded Science. &#32; Our robust science-based capabilities such as forecasting, optimization, segmentation, and price guidance allow us to leverage the deep expertise and research of our science and research group in our solutions. These capabilities are industry-independent and are validated using our proprietary verification and testing processes. 

Configuration vs. Custom Coding. &#32;Our solutions can be configured to meet each customer's business needs through configuration rather than custom code. The configuration capabilities define both a business layer (including definition of user workflows, executive dashboards, analytics views, calculations, approval processes and alerts), as well as a data layer that permits configuration of data structures, including hierarchical dimensions, pricing levels and measures. Much of the configuration can be performed by a business user without information technology personnel involvement. We preserve the configurations as part of an upgrade, allowing our customers to more easily upgrade to new versions of our solutions, when available. 

Scalability. &#160; We leverage modern big data technologies such as MapReduce and Hadoop&#174;, NoSQL databases such as Cassandra and MongoDB&#174;, and in-memory and column-oriented data stores to scale to large data volumes and high user request rates. The scalability of our software solutions has been tested and validated by third-party vendor benchmark performance centers. 

Data Integration. &#32; The data needed to execute and optimize sales, quoting, pricing, rebate and revenue management functionality typically resides in multiple sources, such as a company's enterprise resource planning ("ERP"), supply chain management ("SCM"), customer relationship management ("CRM"), reservations and inventory systems, and/or industry-specific transaction systems. In addition, productivity tools such as spreadsheets and external market data sources are common. Our data integration capabilities utilize web services and file-based data interfacing to bring data from disparate sources together into a single cohesive database, both in real time and through scheduled batch tasks. We also provide certified content for integration with SAP&#174; and Oracle&#174; as well as integration development services using industry standard tools. 

User Interface. &#32; Our technology provides a rich, browser-based interface that supports both local and remote users. This interface supports a wide variety of interactive charts and other data views, and provides a comprehensive data security model based on user role and scope of responsibility. We also offer natively-developed capabilities for multiple mobile devices, tablet, CRM systems, and client applications. 

Platform Support. &#32; Our software solutions run on most standard information technology platforms including Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle databases, 64-bit processors from Intel, AMD, IBM and Oracle, server hardware from HP, Dell, IBM and Oracle, Microsoft Windows, and Linux operating systems, and virtualization technologies such as VMware. Our solutions can be deployed natively in the Salesforce.com CRM environment and on PROS cloud. 

Cloud Infrastructure . PROS SaaS solutions are fully architected, scaled and managed by PROS to meet enterprise-class data demands. We currently deliver our solutions from secure co-location datacenters operated by third parties as well as from enterprise cloud computing platform providers. Our infrastructure is designed to achieve high levels of security, scalability, performance and availability. We use commercially available hardware in our data centers. We provide a highly secure computing environment as well as high application availability. 

Services 

We also provide software-related professional services, including implementation and configuration services, consulting and training. 

Implementation and configuration 

Our software solution implementations have a standardized and tested implementation process developed through years of experience implementing our software solutions in global enterprises across multiple industries. 

Our professional services team works closely with our customers to develop an integrated project plan to help them accelerate time to value. Pursuant to these plans, we provide technical deployment, cloud support, and configuration services related to our solutions. We also assist customers in loading and validating data and supporting organizational activities to assist our customers&#8217; transition from awareness of their pricing challenges to adoption of pricing excellence best practices. In addition to our own internal professional services team, we also work with a team of globally diverse partners who have been certified to implement our software. 

Consulting 

Our consulting services include discovery and insight consulting to analyze a customer&#8217;s current pricing processes and data, identifying and prioritizing specific high-value pricing opportunities, and recommending pricing best practices and strategic pricing services. We also offer change management, pricing process redesign, pricing organizational design, opportunity assessment and performance management consulting. These consulting services enhance our partnerships with our customers and help them achieve their specific pricing goals. 

Training 

&#160; 

We offer training to both our customers and partners to increase the knowledge and skills to deploy and use the full functionality of our software solutions. We offer an array of live and virtual classroom training, as well as tailored, private on-site classroom training. Our courses include training on all aspects of our software solutions, from introductory on-demand mini-courses to multi-day hands-on deep technical classroom sessions. 

Maintenance and support 

We offer ongoing maintenance and support services for our software solutions using a global model to support our customers across major geographies. Maintenance enrollment entitles a customer to solicit support through a web-based interface which allows the customer to submit and track issues, access our online knowledge base and receive unspecified upgrades, maintenance releases and bug fixes during the term of the support period on a when-and-if-available basis. In addition, our customer support personnel responds to customer issues using an escalation process that prioritizes reported issues based on a defined set of severity levels, as well as assists customers in deploying our standard releases for each software solution by providing release web seminars and documentation. Maintenance fees are an important source of recurring revenue, and we invest significant resources in providing these services. Revenue from maintenance and support services comprised 38% , 29% , and 32% &#32;of our total revenue in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. We expect our maintenance revenue growth will decrease as a result of customers licensing less of our software as we shift to a cloud-first strategy. 

SaaS and Cloud-based services 

Our SaaS solutions generally provide customers access to our software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage and offer to customers on a subscription basis and allow our customers to reduce infrastructure, installation, and ongoing administration requirements. We also offer cloud-based services to allow existing customers who previously purchased licenses to our software to have access to that software within a cloud-based IT environment that we manage to allow those customers to reduce infrastructure and ongoing administration requirements as an alternative to their on-premise deployment of our software. We generally offer these services via three year contracts with pricing based on the data volumes and service levels requested. 

Customers 

We sell our software solutions to customers across many industries, including automotive and industrial, B2B services, cargo, chemicals and energy, consumer goods, finance and insurance, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech, travel and hospitality. Our customers are generally large global enterprises, although we also have customers that are much smaller in scope of operations. In each of 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we had no single customer that accounted for 10% or more of revenue. 

Sales and marketing &#160; 

We sell and market our software solutions primarily through our direct global sales force and indirectly through resellers and systems integrators. Our sales force is organized by our target markets of manufacturing, distribution, services and travel, and is responsible for the worldwide sale of our solutions to new and existing customers. Our sales force works in concert with our solutions personnel for selling and providing solution demonstrations to new customers. 

Our marketing activities consist of a variety of programs designed to generate sales leads and build awareness of our revenue and profit realization cloud solutions. We host conferences for sales, pricing, and revenue management professionals, host informational web seminars and participate in and sponsor other industry and trade conferences and organizations. 

International operations 

We are a global company that conducts sales, sales support, professional services, product development and support, and marketing around the world. Our headquarters are located in Houston, Texas, and, as of December 31, 2015, we also have offices in London, England; Paris, France; Toulouse, France; Munich, Germany; San Francisco, California; Skokie, Illinois; and Austin, Texas. We also conduct development activities predominantly in France and the United States, and utilize third-party contractors in Bolivia, China, Colombia and India. We plan to continue to expand our operations in international locations to meet the strategic objectives of our business. 

Approximately 62% , 56% , and 55% &#32;of our total revenue came from customers outside the United States for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by factors, including currency fluctuations or regulatory, political, social and economic developments or instability in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. For additional financial information about geographic areas, see Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Seasonality 

Historically, we have experienced a higher volume of transactions in the quarter ended December 31, which is our fourth fiscal quarter, and to a lesser extent, during other fiscal quarters. However, our transition to cloud-first strategy may change the historical seasonality trends. 

Competition 

The market for solutions that provide automation, analytics and intelligence to drive sales and profitability is competitive, fragmented and rapidly evolving. For example, we have seen consolidation in the quoting software market with large CRM vendors acquiring smaller quoting companies as they attempt to provide end-to-end solutions to drive sales and profit. Today, we are increasingly competing in sales ecosystem with competitors that all aim to drive effectiveness and efficiency in selling. Our competition has increased in recent years as we expanded into adjacent technologies. 

We believe our customers include the following factors when evaluating us against our competition: 

&#8226; 

Large and referenceable global customer base; 

&#8226; 

Industry domain expertise; 

&#8226; 

Domain management best practices expertise and delivery; 

&#8226; 

Ability for users to configure the solution to their needs; 

&#8226; 

Depth of expertise in data and pricing science; 

&#8226; 

Real-time solutions; 

&#8226; 

Proven benefits of return on investment, total cost of ownership, and time-to-value; 

&#8226; 

Organizational change management expertise; 

&#8226; 

Product architecture, functionality, performance, reliability and scalability; 

&#8226; 

Ability to offer integrated high-value solutions; 

&#8226; 

Breadth and depth of product and service offerings; 

&#8226; 

Services and customer support quality; 

&#8226; 

Size and quality of partner ecosystem; 

&#8226; 

Existing customer relationships; and 

&#8226; 

Vendor viability. 

We compete with a number of larger and smaller companies, which we estimate to be approximately 10 competitors. Most of our competitors compete against individual products of ours, rather than at a strategic level across multiple products. For example, Vendavo and Zilliant, compete against the pricing portion of our revenue and profit realization solutions. Others, such as Apptus, Oracle (through its acquisition of Big Machines), and Salesforce.com (through its acquisition of SteelBrick) compete against the quoting portion of our revenue and profit realization solutions. Yet others, such as Sabre Airline Solutions and Amadeus compete against a portion of our revenue management solutions in the airline industry. Several large enterprise application providers, such as JDA Software, Oracle and SAP, have developed offerings that include limited pricing and revenue management functionality. Our solutions also compete with solutions developed internally by businesses. These businesses generally rely on a combination of manual processes, external consultants, spreadsheets and internally-developed software tools. 

We believe these competitors do not provide all of the functionality needed to support an organization interested in optimizing sales growth through data-science driven pricing, quoting and revenue management. In the past, some of these vendors have competed on price and by bundling their pricing and revenue management applications with other enterprise applications, and this may continue into the future. We believe that we distinguish ourselves from these vendors through the breadth and depth of the functionality we offer, the robust integration and configuration capabilities of our solutions, and our proven ability to provide high-value science-based optimization software to our global customer base across multiple industries. In the future, we believe our competition will increase as more companies move into our market segment and as we expand into adjacent market segments. 

Intellectual property and other proprietary rights 

Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. Due to the rapidly changing nature of applicable technologies and recent changes in U.S. patent law, we believe that for the improvement of existing solutions and development of new solutions, reliance upon trade secrets and unpatented proprietary know-how are generally more advantageous than patent and trademark protection. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, patents, trademarks, copyrights and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information. 

Research and development 

We believe our innovation with respect to our software solutions is the foundation of our business and accordingly have made substantial investments in research and development for the enhancement of existing products and services and the development of new products and services. We also believe that our long-term investment in the scientific analysis of pricing and revenue management differentiates us from our competitors. We are committed to developing high-value, science-based sales, pricing, and revenue management software solutions as evidenced by our continued investment in research and development. In fiscal 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we incurred expenses of $46.8 million , $43.2 million &#32;and $32.5 million , respectively, in research and development to enhance our existing portfolio of solutions and to develop new solutions. Our research and development expenses include costs associated with our product management, product development and science and research groups. We conduct research and development activities predominantly in the United States and to a lesser extent in France. 

We employ scientists, most of whom are Ph.D.s, to advance sales, pricing, and revenue management technology and its implementation in our software solutions. These scientists have specialties including, but not limited to, operations research, management science, statistics, econometrics, and computational methods. Our scientists regularly interact with our customers, product development, sales, marketing, and professional services staff to help keep our science efforts relevant to real-world demands. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 1,033 full time personnel, which included 857 employees and 176 outsourced personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our employee relations to be good.
