 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Historical Development 

&#160; 

LZG International, Inc. was incorporated in the state of Florida on May 22, 2000, as LazyGrocer.Com, Inc. We intended to establish an online grocery solution, but we were unable to raise sufficient capital to continue operations and as a result limited our operations in November 2001. On August 28, 2009, the Company&#8217;s name was changed to LZG International, Inc. 

&#160; 

Emerging Growth Company 

&#160; 

We qualify as an emerging growth company as that term is used in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 

&#160; 

&#8226; A requirement to have only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; &#160; 

&#8226; Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of the emerging growth company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; &#160; 

&#8226; Reduced disclosure about the emerging growth company&#8217;s executive compensation arrangements; and &#160; 

&#8226; No non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. &#160; 

We have already taken advantage of these reduced reporting burdens in this annual report, which are also available to us as a smaller reporting company as defined under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). 

&#160; 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to use the extended transition period and therefore our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company accounting standard effective dates. 

&#160; 

3&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160; 

Our business purpose is to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business, rather than immediate, short-term earnings. Our search for a business opportunity will not be limited to any particular geographical area or industry, including both U.S. and international companies. Our management has unrestricted discretion in seeking and participating in a business opportunity, subject to the availability of such opportunities, economic conditions and other factors. Our management believes that companies who desire a public market to enhance liquidity for current stockholders or plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash will be potential merger or acquisition candidates. 

&#160; 

We are a &#34;blank check&#34; company based on our proposed business activities. The SEC defines those companies as &#34;any company that is issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act, and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.&#34; Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, we also qualify as a &#8220;shell company&#8221; because we have no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of &#34;blank check&#34; companies in their respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. We intend to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements. 

&#160; 

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management. As of the date of this filing, we have not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company. We have unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In our efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, we intend to consider the following factors: 

&#160; 

&#8226; Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; &#160; 

&#8226; Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; &#160; 

&#8226; Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; &#160; 

&#8226; Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; &#160; 

&#8226; The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; &#160; 

&#8226; The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; &#160; 

&#8226; The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items; and &#160; 

&#8226; Other relevant factors. &#160; 

4&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. In addition, we will be competing against other entities that possess greater financial, technical and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing business combinations. 

&#160; 

In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible; however, none of our management are professional business analysts. (See Item 10, below.) Our management has had limited experience with mergers and acquisitions of business opportunities and has not been involved with an initial public offering. Potential investors must recognize that due to our management&#8217;s inexperience we may not adequately evaluate a potential business opportunity. 

&#160; 

We are unable to predict when, and if, we may actually participate in any specific business endeavor. We anticipate that proposed business ventures will be made available to us through personal contacts of our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker dealers in securities, venture capital personnel, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder&#8217;s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who submit a potential business endeavor in which we eventually participate. Such persons may include our directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of our securities or their &#8220;affiliates.&#8221; In that event, such fees may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential venture and, accordingly, may present a conflict of interest for such individuals. Management does not presently intend to acquire or merge with any business enterprise in which any has a prior ownership interest. 

&#160; 

In addition, certain conflicts of interest exist or may develop between LZG International and our executive officers and directors. Our management has other business interests to which they currently devote attention, which include their primary employment and management of other shell reporting companies. (See Item 10, below.) They may be expected to continue to devote their attention to these other business interests although management time should be devoted to our business. Also, in the process of negotiations for an acquisition or merger, our management may consider their own personal pecuniary benefit or the interests of other shell companies they are affiliated with rather than the best interests of LZG International and our stockholders. 

&#160; 

We presently do not foresee entering into a merger or acquisition transaction with any business with which our officers or directors are currently affiliated. We may acquire or merge with companies of which our management&#8217;s affiliates or associates have a direct or indirect ownership interest. If we determine in the future that a transaction with an affiliate would be in our best interest, we are permitted by Florida law to enter into such a transaction if: 

&#160; 

&#8226; The material facts regarding the relationship or interest of the affiliate in the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors. The board authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative vote of a majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors constitute less than a quorum; however, a single director may not authorize the contract or transaction; or &#8226; The material facts regarding the relationship or interest of the affiliate in the contract transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote on the transaction, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved by vote of the stockholders; or &#8226; The contract or transaction is fair to the Company at the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the board of directors or the stockholders. &#160; 

5&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business&#8217;s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to the Company. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage. Our limited funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. We anticipate that we will rely upon funds provided by advances and/or loans from management and significant stockholders to conduct investigation and analysis of any potential target companies or businesses. We may also rely upon the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash payments for services or expenses related to any analysis. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or other persons associated with the target business seeking our participation. 

&#160; 

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to the Company. Also, substantial fees are often paid in connection with the completion of all types of acquisitions, reorganizations or mergers, ranging from a small amount to as much as $300,000 or more. These fees are usually divided among promoters or founders or finders, after deduction of legal, accounting and other related expenses, and it is not unusual for a portion of these fees to be paid to members of management or to principal stockholders as consideration for their agreement to retire a portion of the shares of common stock owned by them. Management may actively negotiate or otherwise consent to the purchase of all or any portion of their common stock as a condition to, or in connection with, a proposed reorganization, merger or acquisition. It is not anticipated that any such opportunity will be afforded to other stockholders or that such other stockholders will be afforded the opportunity to approve or consent to any particular stock buy-out transaction. In the event that any such fees are paid, they may become a factor in negotiations regarding any potential acquisition or merger by us, and accordingly, may also present a conflict of interest for such individuals. We have no present arrangements or understandings respecting any of these types of fees or opportunities and we have not adopted any procedures or policies for the review, approval or ratification of related party transactions. 

&#160; 

Our common stock is not publicly traded at this time and we cannot assure that a market will develop or that a stockholder ever will be able to liquidate his investments without considerable delay, if at all. If a market develops, our shares will likely be subject to the rules of the Penny Stock Suitability Reform Act of 1990. The liquidity of penny stock is affected by specific disclosure procedures required by this Act to be followed by all broker-dealers, including, but not limited to, determining the suitability of the stock for a particular customer, and obtaining a written agreement from the customer to purchase the stock. This rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may affect the ability of purchasers to sell our securities in any future market. 

&#160; 

Form of Acquisition 

&#160; 

The manner in which we participate in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters. 

&#160; 

It is likely that we will acquire our participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of our common stock or other securities. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called &#34;tax free&#34; reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#34;Code&#34;) depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other &#34;tax free&#34; provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those persons who were our stockholders prior to such reorganization. 

&#160; 

6&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our present stockholders will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of our directors may resign, and one or more new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders. 

&#160; 

In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management without any vote or approval by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval. 

&#160; 

It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred. 

&#160; 

In addition, SEC regulations regarding shell companies and transactions with shell companies requires the filing of a Form 8-K within four business days of the closing of any business combination and that report must include all information that would have been required to have been filed had any such company filed a Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC, along with required audited, interim and pro forma financial statements. These regulations may eliminate many of the perceived advantages of these types of transactions. These regulations also deny the use of Form S-8 for the registration of securities of a shell company, and limit the use of Form S-8 to a reorganized shell company until the expiration of 60 days from when any such entity is no longer considered to be a shell company. This prohibition could further restrict opportunities for us to acquire companies that may already have stock option plans in place that cover numerous employees. In such an instance, there may be no exemption from registration for the issuance of securities in any business combination to these employees, thereby necessitating the filing of a registration statement with the SEC to complete any such reorganization, and incurring the time and expenses that are normally avoided by reverse reorganizations. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Additionally, we are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are, and will continue to be, an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including other small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for the Company. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a business combination. 

&#160; 

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on Our Business Plan 

&#160; 

We are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This Act created an independent accounting oversight board to oversee the conduct of auditors, of public companies and to strengthen auditor independence. It also requires steps to enhance the direct responsibility of senior members of management for financial reporting and for the quality of financial disclosures made by public companies; establishes clear statutory rules to limit, and to expose to public view, possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; creates guidelines for audit committee members&#8217; appointment, and compensation and oversight of the work of public companies&#8217; auditors; prohibits certain insider trading during pension fund blackout periods; and establishes a federal crime of securities fraud, among other provisions. 

&#160; 

7&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act requires all companies with securities registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act to comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding proxy solicitations, as outlined in Regulation 14A. Matters submitted to our stockholders at a special or annual meeting thereof or pursuant to a written consent will require us to provide our stockholders with the information outlined in Schedules 14A or 14C of Regulation 14A; preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are forwarded to our stockholders. 

&#160; 

We are also required to file annual reports on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC on a regular basis, and to timely disclose certain material events (e.g., changes in corporate control; acquisitions or dispositions of a significant amount of assets other than in the ordinary course of business; and bankruptcy) in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We presently do not have employees. Our directors and officers are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they will devote very limited time to our business until a successful business opportunity has been identified. We do not expect significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination. 

&#160;
