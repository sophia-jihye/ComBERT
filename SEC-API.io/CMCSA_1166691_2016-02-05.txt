 Item 1: Business 

We are a global media and technology company with two primary businesses, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal. We were incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania in December 2001. Through our predecessors, we have developed, managed and operated cable systems since 1963. In 2011, we acquired control of the businesses of NBCUniversal from General Electric Company (the &#147;NBCUniversal transaction&#148;), and in 2013, we acquired the remaining 49% common equity interest in NBCUniversal Holdings that we did not already own. 

We present our operations for Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications, and our operations for NBCUniversal in four reportable business segments. The Cable Networks, Broadcast Television, Filmed Entertainment and Theme Parks segments comprise the NBCUniversal businesses (collectively, the &#147;NBCUniversal segments&#148;). 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Cable Communications: Consists of the operations of Comcast Cable, which is one of the nation&#146;s largest providers of video, high-speed Internet and voice services (&#147;cable services&#148;) to residential customers under the XFINITY brand; we also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Cable Networks: Consists primarily of our national cable networks, our regional sports and news networks, our international cable networks, and our cable television studio production operations.

&#160; &#160; 20.6 % &#160; &#160; 20.5 % &#160; &#160; 19.9 % Basis of Presentation: Customer metrics include our residential and business customers. Information related to cable system acquisitions is included from the date acquired. Information related to cable systems sold or exchanged is excluded for all periods presented. All percentages are calculated based on actual amounts. Minor differences may exist due to rounding. 

&#160;

(a) &#160; Homes and businesses are considered passed if we can connect them to our distribution system without further extending the transmission lines. Homes and businesses passed is an estimate based on the best available information. 

&#160;

(b) &#160; Customer relationships represent the number of residential and business customers that subscribe to at least one of our cable services. Single product, double product and triple product customers represent customers that subscribe to one, two or three of our cable services, respectively. 

&#160;

(c) &#160; Generally, a home or business receiving video programming from our distribution system counts as one video customer. For multiple dwelling units (&#147;MDUs&#148;) whose residents have the ability to receive additional cable services, such as additional programming choices or our high-definition video (&#147;HD&#148;) or digital video recorder (&#147;DVR&#148;) advanced services, we count and report customers based on the number of potential billable relationships within each MDU. For MDUs whose residents are not able to receive additional cable services, the MDU is counted as a single customer. 

&#160;

(d) &#160; Penetration is calculated by dividing the number of customers by the number of homes and businesses passed. 

&#160;

(e) &#160; Digital video customers include customers receiving digital signals through any means, including digital transport adapters and CableCARDs. Digital video penetration is calculated by dividing the number of digital video customers by total video customers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#160; 2 &#160; Cable Services 

We offer a variety of cable services over our cable distribution system to residential and business customers. Subscription rates and related charges vary according to the services and features customers receive and the type of equipment they use, and customers are typically billed in advance on a monthly basis. The majority of our residential cable services customers are not subject to minimum-term contracts for their services, while substantially all of our business customers are. Minimum-term contracts are typically 2 years in length for residential customers and typically range from 2 to 5 years for business services customers. Customers with minimum-term contracts may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts, which may include an early termination fee. 

The Areas We Serve 

The map below highlights our footprint as of December 31, 2015 and the designated market areas (&#147;DMAs&#148;) in which we offer cable services that have 125,000 or more video customers. The number of high-speed Internet customers in these DMAs is generally similar to the number of our video customers. The locations that are bolded represent the markets we operate in that were also included in the top 25 U.S. television markets as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160;

&#160;

Video Services 

We offer a broad variety of video services under the XFINITY brand, with access to hundreds of channels depending on the customer&#146;s level of service. Our levels of service typically range from a limited basic service with access to between 20 and 40 channels to a full digital service with access to more than 300 channels. Our video services generally include programming provided by national broadcast networks, local broadcast stations, and national and regional cable networks, as well as government and public access programming. Our digital video services generally include access to our On Demand service and an interactive, on-screen program guide. We also offer packages that include extensive amounts of foreign-language programming, and we offer other specialty tiers of programming with sports, family and international themes. We tailor our video services for a particular geographic area according to applicable local and federal regulatory requirements, programming preferences and demographics. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K Our video customers may also subscribe to premium networks. Premium networks include networks such as HBO, Showtime, Starz and Cinemax that generally provide, without commercial interruption, movies, original programming, live and taped sporting events and concerts, and other features. 

Our On Demand service provides digital video customers with approximately 75,000 programming choices over the course of a month, including 30,000 in high definition. A substantial portion of our On Demand content is available at no additional charge; other content, primarily movies and special-events programming, such as sporting events and concerts, can be rented or in some cases purchased to own digitally. We continue to increase the number of On Demand choices, including the number of movies and television shows that can be purchased. 

Our HD service provides customers with high-resolution picture quality, improved audio quality and a wide-screen format through an HD set-top box. Our HD service includes a broad selection of HD programming choices, including major broadcast networks, national cable networks, premium networks and regional sports networks. Our DVR service allows digital video customers to record and store programs on their set-top box and play them at whatever time is convenient. Our DVR service also provides the ability to pause and rewind live television. 

Our X1 service, which is a cloud-enabled video platform, provides customers with integrated search functionality, personalized recommendations and access to certain third-party Internet applications through television sets. We also offer our Cloud DVR technology in substantially all of our markets. Cloud DVR technology allows our video customers to record television shows and movies from their home using cloud-based servers and view those recordings on mobile devices via our mobile apps. 

Through our online portal, our video customers may view certain live programming and On Demand content, browse program listings, and schedule and manage DVR recordings. We also have streaming services that provide customers with access to certain programming via On Demand, online and through our mobile apps and, depending on the customer&#146;s level of service, may require an additional monthly fee. 

High-Speed Internet Services 

We offer a variety of high-speed Internet services with downstream speeds of up to 150 Mbps, as well as downstream speeds of up to 505 Mbps in limited markets. These services include our online portal and mobile apps, which provide access to email, contacts and calendars, and online security features. In addition, we are actively deploying wireless gateways, which combine a customer&#146;s wireless router, cable modem and voice adapter, to improve the performance of multiple Internet-enabled devices used at the same time within the home, provide faster Internet speeds and create an in-home Wi-Fi network. We are continuing to expand our network of residential, outdoor and business Wi-Fi hotspots to allow most of our high-speed Internet customers to access our high-speed Internet services inside and outside the home, and we provide access to approximately 13.3 million of these hotspots as of December 31, 2015. 

Voice Services 

We offer voice services using an interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (&#147;VoIP&#148;) technology. Our voice services provide either usage-based or unlimited local and domestic long-distance calling and include options for international calling plans, voicemail, voicemail transcriptions, text messaging, caller ID and call waiting. For customers with our high-speed Internet services, our voice services also include the ability to access and manage voicemail, text messaging and other account features through our online portal or our mobile apps. 

Business Services 

We offer our cable services to small and medium-sized businesses, and more recently, we have begun to offer services to large enterprises with multiple locations (&#147;business services&#148;). In addition to the features we 

&#160; 

&#160;

Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#160; 4 &#160; provide to our residential cable services customers, our services for business customers include an interactive tool that allows customers to share, coordinate and store documents online, hosted voice services that use cloud network servers, a business directory listing, and additional capacity for multiple phone lines. 

We also offer to medium-sized businesses and large enterprises Ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and provide higher downstream and upstream speed options, and we offer cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators to help those customers manage network bandwidth. 

The new enterprise service offering is designed to serve Fortune 1000 companies and other large nationwide enterprises with multiple locations both in and outside of our cable distribution footprint. We service these multiple locations through agreements we have with other cable companies and providers that allow us to use their networks to fill in the gaps in our coverage areas. 

Advertising 

As part of our distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time on cable networks that our Spotlight business sells to local, regional and national advertisers. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us. We also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising online and on our On Demand service. 

Other Revenue Sources 

We receive revenue related to cable franchise and other regulatory fees and from our home security and automation services. Cable franchise and other regulatory fees represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities that we pass through to our customers. Under the terms of our cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay to the cable franchising authority an amount based on our gross video revenue. Our home security and automation services provide our customers with home monitoring services and the ability to manage other functions within the home, such as lighting and room temperature, through our online portal or our mobile apps. 

Technology 

Our cable distribution system uses a hybrid fiber-optic and coaxial cable network that we believe is sufficiently flexible and scalable to support our future technology requirements. This network provides the two-way transmissions that are essential to providing interactive video services, such as On Demand, and high-speed Internet and voice services. We are also leveraging our network to develop and deliver innovative services to our customers efficiently and in an accelerated fashion. 

We continue to focus on technology initiatives, such as: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; deploying and launching next-generation media and content delivery platforms, such as our X1 platform and related Cloud DVR technology, that use IP technology and our own cloud network servers to deliver video and advanced search capabilities, including through a voice-activated remote control, and allow access to certain third-party Internet applications 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; deploying wireless gateways to improve the performance of multiple Internet-enabled devices used at the same time within the home, provide faster Internet speeds and create an in-home Wi-Fi network

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; developing and deploying various technology and software tools to improve the customer experience 

&#160; Sources of Supply 

To offer our video services, we license a substantial portion of our programming from cable networks and broadcast networks, as well as from local broadcast television stations. We attempt to secure long-term programming distribution agreements with these programming providers. We also license programming for our On Demand and streaming services. We seek to include in our distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming to our subscribers through multiple delivery platforms that may be used in a variety of locations, such as through On Demand, our online portal and our mobile apps. 

We purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of set-top boxes and certain other customer premise equipment, network equipment and services that we use to provide our cable services to our residential and business customers. 

For our high-speed Internet services, we license software products, such as email and security software, and content, such as news feeds for our online portal, from a variety of suppliers. Under our contracts with these suppliers, we generally pay on a fixed-fee basis, on a per subscriber basis in the case of software product licenses or on a video advertising revenue share basis in the case of content licenses. 

For our voice services, we license software products such as voicemail and text messaging from a variety of suppliers under multiyear contracts. The fees we pay are generally based on the consumption of the related services. 

We use two primary vendors to provide customer billing for our cable services to our residential and business customers. 

Customer and Technical Services 

Our customer service call centers provide 24/7 call-answering capability, telemarketing and other services. Our technical services group performs various tasks, including installations, plant maintenance and upgrades to our cable distribution system. 

Sales and Marketing 

We offer our services directly to residential and business customers through customer service call centers, customer service centers, door-to-door selling, telemarketing and retail outlets, as well as through advertising via direct mail, television and the Internet. We market our cable services both individually and as bundled services. 

NBCUniversal Segments 

&#160;

Cable Networks 

Our Cable Networks segment consists of a diversified portfolio of national cable networks that provide a variety of entertainment, news and information, and sports content, our regional sports and news networks, our international cable networks, and our cable television studio production operations. We also own various digital media properties, which primarily include brand-aligned websites.

&#160; 9 &#160; Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K Filmed Entertainment 

Our Filmed Entertainment segment primarily produces, acquires, markets and distributes both live-action and animated filmed entertainment worldwide, and it also develops, produces and licenses live stage plays. 

We produce films both on our own and jointly with other studios or production companies, as well as with other entities. Our films are produced primarily under the Universal Pictures, Illumination and Focus Features names. Our films are marketed and distributed worldwide primarily through our own marketing and distribution companies. We also acquire distribution rights to films produced by others, which may be limited to particular geographic regions, specific forms of media or certain periods of time. Our content consists of theatrical films, direct-to-video movies and our film library, which is comprised of more than 5,000 movies in a variety of genres. 

We have entered into, and may continue to enter into, film cofinancing arrangements with third parties, including both studio and nonstudio entities, to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. These arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor. Investors generally assume the full risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film. 

The majority of our produced and acquired films are initially distributed for exhibition in movie theaters. After their release in movie theaters, we sell and license our films through various methods. We distribute our films globally by selling them on DVD to retail stores, rental kiosks and subscription by mail services and by selling them through digital distribution services and the video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers, including our Cable Communications segment. We also license our films, including selections from our film library, to cable, broadcast and premium networks, to subscription video on demand services, and to video on demand and pay-per-view services. The number of films that we license through subscription video on demand services is increasing as consumers continue to seek additional ways to view our content. 

Theme Parks 

Our Theme Parks segment consists primarily of our Universal theme parks in Orlando, Florida and Hollywood, California. Universal Orlando includes two theme parks, Universal Studios Florida and Universal&#146;s Islands of Adventure, as well as CityWalk, a dining, retail and entertainment complex. Universal Orlando also features on-site themed hotels in which we own a noncontrolling interest. Our Universal theme park in Hollywood, California consists primarily of Universal Studios Hollywood. We also are expanding our theme park business internationally, such as through NBCUniversal&#146;s acquisition of a 51% interest in Universal Studios Japan in November 2015 and our plans to develop a Universal Studios theme park in Beijing, China along with a consortium of Chinese state owned companies. In addition, we license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property, and also provide other services, to third parties that own and operate the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore, as well as to the Universal Studios Japan theme park. We also own a water park, Wet &#145;n Wild, in Orlando, Florida. 

Our Theme Parks segment licenses the right to use a substantial amount of intellectual property from third parties for its themed elements in rides, attractions and merchandising. 

Competition 

&#160;

All of our businesses operate in intensely competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environments and compete with a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services, and entertainment, news and information products and services, to consumers. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape for all of our businesses by challenging existing business models and affecting consumer behavior. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#160; 10 &#160; Cable Communications 

Competition for our video services consists primarily of direct broadcast satellite (&#147;DBS&#148;) providers, which have a national footprint and compete in all of our service areas, and phone companies with fiber-based networks, which overlap more than 55% of our service areas and are continuing to expand the areas they serve. Our high-speed Internet services business primarily competes with phone companies with fiber-based networks that overlap more than 60% of our service areas. Many of these competitors offer features, pricing and packaging for these services, individually and in bundles, comparable to what we offer. 

There also continue to be new companies, some with significant financial resources, that offer services that potentially may compete on a larger scale with some or all of our cable services. In particular, Google, which has launched high-speed Internet and video services in a limited number of areas in which we operate, has announced plans to expand in more areas, including in some of our significant markets. As Google expands to more areas, we expect it to become a meaningful wireline competitor to our high-speed Internet and video services. Other companies continue to emerge that provide Internet streaming and downloading of video programming, some of which charge a nominal or no fee. Wireless Internet services, such as 3G and 4G wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks, may compete with our video and high-speed Internet services, and our voice services are facing increased competition as customers replace wireline phones with mobile phones and Internet-based phone services such as Skype. 

Video Services 

We compete with a number of different sources that provide news, sports, information and entertainment programming to consumers, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; DBS providers that transmit satellite signals containing video programming and other information to receiving dishes located on the customer&#146;s premises 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; phone companies that have built and continue to build fiber-based networks that provide cable services similar to ours, which now overlap a substantial portion of our service areas 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; other providers that build and operate wireline communications systems in the same communities that we serve, including those operating as franchised cable operators 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satellite master antenna television (&#147;SMATV&#148;) systems that generally serve MDUs, office complexes and residential developments 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; online video distributors that offer online services and devices that enable Internet video streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming 

&#160; Congress has enacted legislation and the FCC has adopted regulatory policies intended to provide a favorable operating environment for existing competitors and for potential new competitors to our cable services. The FCC adopted rules favoring new investment by certain phone companies in networks capable of distributing video programming and rules allocating and auctioning spectrum for new wireless services that may compete with our video services. The FCC also has launched a rulemaking to classify certain online video distributors as multichannel video providers under the FCC&#146;s rules and thereby provide them with certain regulatory benefits under the rules. See &#147;Legislation and Regulation&#148; below for additional information. 

Direct Broadcast Satellite Providers 

According to recent government and industry reports, conventional medium-power and high-power satellites provide video programming to 33.5 million subscribers in the United States. DBS providers with high-power satellites typically offer video services substantially similar to our video services. DIRECTV, which was 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 11 &#160; Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K acquired by AT&#38;T in 2015, and DISH Network offer video services to substantially all U.S. households. DBS providers also have marketing arrangements with certain phone companies in which the DBS provider&#146;s video services are sold together with the phone company&#146;s high-speed Internet and voice services. 

Phone Companies 

Certain phone companies, in particular AT&#38;T and Verizon, have built and are continuing to build wireline fiber-based networks that provide video, high-speed Internet and voice services, and in some cases have bundled with wireless phone services, in substantial portions of our service areas. These and other phone companies with fiber-based networks or digital subscriber line (&#147;DSL&#148;) technology, such as CenturyLink, also may market video services provided by DBS providers in certain areas where they provide only high-speed Internet and voice services. AT&#38;T&#146;s acquisition of DIRECTV in 2015 created an even larger competitor to our cable services, which enables them to enhance their bundled offerings. 

Other Wireline Providers 

Federal law prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises, and it permits franchising authorities to operate cable systems. In addition to phone companies, various other companies, including those that traditionally have not provided video services and have significant financial resources, have obtained cable franchises and provide competing cable services. These and other cable systems offer cable services in some areas where we hold franchises. We anticipate that facilities-based competitors may emerge in other franchise areas that we serve. 

Satellite Master Antenna Television Systems 

Our video services also compete for customers with SMATV systems. SMATV system operators typically are not subject to regulation in the same manner as local, franchised cable system operators. SMATV systems offer to their subscribers both improved reception of local broadcast television stations and much of the programming offered by our cable systems. Some SMATV system operators also offer bundled services to residential and business subscribers. 

Online Video Services 

Our video services also compete with the services of online video distributors that offer Internet video streaming and downloading of movies, television shows and other video programming. A number of companies also have launched online video services that include both linear and on-demand programming and generally involve the offering of smaller packages of programming networks directly to customers over the Internet at prices lower than our traditional video service package offerings, while some programming providers also offer programming directly to customers over the Internet. In most cases, these services charge no fee or a lower fee than our traditional video packages. Consumer electronic companies that sell Internet-connected TVs or gaming consoles that provide a user interface for searching television and other programming over the Internet and offer links to various third-party Internet applications may also compete with our video services. The success of these services could also adversely affect demand for other video services, such as our expanded digital video packages, premium networks, and our DVR and On Demand services. 

Other 

Our cable services also may compete for customers with other companies, such as local broadcast television stations that provide multiple channels of free over-the-air programming, as well as video rental services and home entertainment and gaming products. 

High-Speed Internet Services 

We compete with a number of companies offering Internet services, many of which have substantial resources, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; wireline phone companies 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; &#149; &#160; Internet service providers 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; wireless phone companies and other providers of wireless Internet service 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; satellite broadband providers 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; power companies 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; municipal broadband networks 

&#160; Some phone companies, such as AT&#38;T, CenturyLink, Frontier and Verizon, have built and are continuing to build fiber-based network infrastructure deeper in their networks, which allows them to provide data transmission speeds that exceed those that can be provided with traditional DSL technology, and are now offering these higher-speed services in many of our service areas. DSL technology allows Internet access to be provided to customers over phone lines at data transmission speeds substantially greater than those of dial-up modems, and certain companies that offer DSL service have increased data transmission speeds, lowered prices or created bundled services to compete with our high-speed Internet services. 

Google, which has launched a fiber-to-the-home network that provides high-speed Internet services in a limited number of areas in which we operate, has announced plans to expand in additional geographic areas, including in some of our significant markets. As Google expands to more areas, we expect it to become a meaningful wireline competitor to our high-speed Internet and video services. Certain municipalities in our service areas are also building fiber-based networks. 

Various wireless companies are offering Internet services using a variety of network types, including 3G and 4G wireless high-speed Internet networks and Wi-Fi networks. Some of these services are similar to ours. These networks work with devices such as smartphones, laptops, tablets and mobile wireless routers, as well as wireless data cards. A number of commercial venues, such as retail malls, restaurants and airports, also offer Wi-Fi service. Numerous local governments are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized Wi-Fi and other Internet access networks. The availability of these wireless offerings could negatively impact the demand for our high-speed Internet services. 

Voice Services 

Our voice services compete with wireline phone companies, including incumbent local exchange carriers (&#147;ILECs&#148;), competitive local exchange carriers (&#147;CLECs&#148;), wireless phone service providers and other Internet-based and VoIP service providers. Certain phone companies, such as the ILECs AT&#38;T and Verizon, have substantial capital and other resources, longstanding customer relationships, and extensive existing facilities and network rights-of-way. A few CLECs also have existing local networks and significant financial resources. In addition, we are increasingly competing with other phone service providers as customers replace wireline phones with mobile phones and Internet-based phone services. 

Business Services 

Our business services primarily compete with a variety of phone companies, including ILECs and CLECs. These companies either operate their own network infrastructure or rely on reselling all or part of another carrier&#146;s network. We also compete with satellite operators who offer video services to businesses. 

NBCUniversal Segments 

Cable Networks and Broadcast Television 

Our cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for viewers&#146; attention and audience share with all forms of programming provided to viewers, including cable, broadcast and premium networks, local broadcast television stations, home entertainment, pay-per-view and video on demand services, online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content, 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K video games, and other forms of entertainment, news and information. Our cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations may compete for viewers&#146; attention with subscription video on demand services, some of which have their own high-quality original content. 

Our cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the acquisition of programming and for on-air and creative talent with other cable and broadcast networks, local television stations and subscription video on demand services. The market for programming is very competitive, particularly for sports programming, where the cost for such programming is significant. 

Our cable networks compete with other cable networks and programming providers for carriage of their programming by multichannel video providers and subscription video on demand services. Our broadcast television networks compete with the other broadcast networks in markets across the United States to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of broadcast network programming to a nationwide audience. 

In addition, our cable networks and broadcast television studio production operations compete with other production companies and creators of content for the acquisition of story properties, for creative, performing and technical personnel, and for distribution of, and consumer interest in, their content. 

Filmed Entertainment 

Our filmed entertainment business competes for audiences for its films and other entertainment content with other major studios and, to a lesser extent, with independent film producers, as well as with alternative forms of entertainment. Our competitive position primarily depends on the number of films we produce, their distribution and marketing success and consumer response. Our filmed entertainment business also competes to obtain creative, performing and technical talent, including writers, actors, directors and producers, as well as scripts for films. Our filmed entertainment business also competes with the other major studios and other producers of entertainment content for the exhibition of its films in theaters and for premium network and digital distribution of its films. 

Theme Parks 

Our theme parks business competes with other multi-park entertainment companies. We also compete with other providers of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. In order to maintain the competitiveness of our theme parks, we have invested and continue to invest in existing and new theme park attractions and infrastructure. 

Advertising 

Our cable communications business, cable networks, broadcast television networks, and owned local broadcast television stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as digital, radio and print media. The willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings at our cable networks, broadcast television networks and owned local broadcast television stations. Declines in advertising revenue also can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of audiences and audience fragmentation and from the growing use of technologies such as DVRs and video on demand services, which give consumers greater flexibility to watch programming on a time-delayed or on-demand basis or to fast-forward or skip advertisements within programming, and from subscription video on demand services. 

Seasonality and Cyclicality 

&#160;

Each of our businesses is subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. See Item 7: Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and refer to the &#147;Seasonality and Cyclicality&#148; discussion within that section for additional information. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#160; 14 &#160; Legislation and Regulation 

The Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Communications Act&#148;), and FCC regulations and policies affect significant aspects of our businesses. Our businesses are also subject to other regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities and to agreements we enter into with local cable franchising authorities. In addition, we must comply with the terms, conditions and commitments of the FCC Order that approved the NBCUniversal transaction in 2011 (the &#147;NBCUniversal Order&#148;) and a consent decree entered into between us, the Department of Justice (&#147;DOJ&#148;) and five states (the &#147;NBCUniversal Consent Decree&#148;), which contain conditions and commitments of varying duration, ranging from three to seven years after September 2011. 

Legislators and regulators at all levels of government frequently consider changing, and sometimes do change, existing statutes, rules or regulations, or interpretations of existing statutes, rules or regulations, or prescribe new ones, any of which may significantly affect our businesses. In addition, the FCC and certain states are becoming more active in considering rulemakings and legislation, as well as in conducting inquiries and reviews, regarding our services. Any future legislative, judicial, regulatory or administrative actions may increase our costs or impose additional restrictions on our businesses, some of which may be significant. For example, in February 2015, the FCC adopted new &#147;open Internet&#148; regulations that reclassify broadband Internet access service as a &#147;telecommunications service&#148; and subject it to certain common carrier regulations under Title II of the Communications Act. In addition, in February 2015, the FCC preempted certain state laws that had restricted municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks. See &#147;Cable Communications Segment &#151; High Speed Internet Services&#148; below. Congress also is expected to consider proposals to address communications issues, including whether it should rewrite the entire Communications Act to account for changes in the communications marketplace, whether it should address the FCC&#146;s authority to implement or enforce open Internet regulations, and whether it should modify rules relating to cable distribution of local broadcast television stations. We are unable to predict the effects of any of these or any other further regulatory or legislative requirements on our businesses. 

The following paragraphs summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirements affecting our businesses, although reference should be made to the Communications Act, FCC regulations, the NBCUniversal Order, the NBCUniversal Consent Decree, and other legislation and regulations for further information. 

Cable Communications Segment 

&#160;

Video Services 

Program Carriage 

Cable operators and other multichannel video providers are prohibited from requiring a financial interest in, or exclusive distribution rights for, a video programming network as a condition of carriage. FCC regulations, as well as the NBCUniversal Order, also prohibit us from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating against the network on the basis of its non-affiliation in the selection, terms or conditions for its carriage. The FCC is considering proposals to further expand program carriage regulations that may be disadvantageous to us. We have been involved in program carriage disputes at the FCC in the past and may be subject to complaints in the future. 

Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent 

Cable operators are required to carry, without compensation, programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations. As an alternative to this &#147;must-carry&#148; requirement, local broadcast television stations may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for &#147;retransmission consent,&#148; under which the station gives up its must-carry rights and instead seeks to negotiate a carriage 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K agreement with the cable operator, which frequently will involve payments to the station. We currently pay certain local broadcast television stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the stations&#146; broadcast programming to our video services customers and expect to continue to be subject to demands for increased payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. The FCC has initiated a rulemaking to review aspects of these rules. For information on must-carry and retransmission consent issues relating to our broadcast television business, see &#147;NBCUniversal Segments &#151; Broadcast Television&#148; below and refer to the &#147;Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent&#148; discussion within that section. 

Pricing and Packaging 

In 2015, the FCC revised its rate regulations to create a presumption that all local communities are subject to effective competition and should no longer be subject to rate regulation that limits prices cable operators may charge for basic video service, equipment and installation. That decision has been appealed in federal court. The FCC accepted a certification from a Massachusetts franchising authority that demonstrated an absence of effective competition in a number of the communities we serve in Massachusetts and that will allow for continued rate regulation in those communities. All of the other areas we serve, except for a relatively small number where we have a petition for effective competition still pending at the FCC, are covered by the FCC&#146;s presumption and are unregulated. 

Cable Equipment 

The Communications Act includes provisions aimed at promoting the retail availability of set-top boxes and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video services. Prior to December 2015, multichannel video providers were prohibited from deploying set-top boxes that performed both channel navigation and security functions, so most of our set-top boxes relied on a separate security device known as a CableCARD. Congress repealed this prohibition, so we may now deploy set-top boxes with integrated security. Congress also directed the FCC to establish a working group to report on software-based security aimed at promoting the retail availability of video devices. In the wake of that report, which was issued in August 2015, some have proposed that the FCC replace the CableCARD requirements with new technology mandates on multichannel video providers to enable retail video devices to work on any multichannel video provider&#146;s system. The Chairman of the FCC proposed such a technology mandate in January 2016, and announced that the FCC plans to open a rulemaking to consider the proposal. If implemented, this proposal would impose substantial costs on us, impair our ability to innovate and have other significant adverse effects on our business. 

Pole Attachments 

The FCC regulates the rates, terms and conditions that most pole-owning utility companies charge cable operators and telecommunications carriers, including broadband Internet access service providers such as us, for allowing attachments to their poles. States are permitted to preempt FCC jurisdiction and regulate the rates, terms and conditions of attachments themselves, and many states in which we operate have done so. Most of these states have generally followed the FCC&#146;s pole attachment rate standards, which set rates for telecommunications service pole attachments to levels at or near the rates for cable service attachments. In November 2015, the FCC eliminated the ability of utility companies to justify higher rates for telecommunication service pole attachments. Cable operators had requested this FCC action because the FCC&#146;s new open Internet regulations, as described below, reclassified Internet access service as a telecommunications service, which could have allowed for higher rental rates to be applied to a majority of our pole attachments. The FCC&#146;s order ensuring that pole rates for telecommunications service attachments approximate the cable service pole rate is expected to be challenged in court by the utility companies. 

Franchising 

Cable operators generally operate their cable systems under nonexclusive franchises granted by local or state franchising authorities. While the terms and conditions of franchises vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, franchises typically last for a fixed term, obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fees and meet 

&#160; 

&#160;

Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#160; 16 &#160; service quality, customer service and other requirements, and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions. Franchising authorities also may establish reasonable requirements for public, educational and governmental access programming, and some of our franchises require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming. The Communications Act also contains provisions governing the franchising process, including renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal. We believe that our franchise renewal prospects are generally favorable, but cannot guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise. 

Approximately half of the states in which we operate provide for statewide franchising or have simplified local franchising requirements for new entrants. Some allow new entrants to operate on more favorable terms than our current operations, for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all parts of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portions it wishes to serve. Certain states allow incumbent cable operators such as us to opt in to the new state franchise immediately or later when a competing state franchise has been issued, although even in those states, incumbent cable operators may be required to retain certain franchise obligations that are more burdensome than the new entrant&#146;s state franchise. 

High-Speed Internet Services 

We provide high-speed Internet services to our customers. Many of these services are subject to a number of regulatory obligations described below, including open Internet regulations implemented by the FCC and certain common carrier regulations under Title II of the Communications Act. As an Internet service provider (&#147;ISP&#148;), we are also subject to a requirement to implement certain network capabilities to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of persons suspected of criminal activity. 

Open Internet Regulations 

In February 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet access service as a &#147;telecommunications service&#148; subject to new open Internet regulations and certain common carrier regulations under Title II of the Communications Act, including requirements that ISPs&#146; charges and practices for and in connection with broadband Internet access service be just, reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory. However, the FCC also refrained from implementing a number of utility-style regulations that might otherwise apply under Title II, such as rate regulation, tariffs and unbundling requirements. 

The new open Internet regulations bar ISPs from blocking access to lawful content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; prohibit ISPs from impairing or degrading lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or services, or impairing or degrading the use of non-harmful devices; prohibit ISPs from favoring lawful traffic from one provider of Internet content, applications or services (called an &#147;edge provider&#148;) over lawful traffic of another edge provider in exchange for consideration (i.e., no &#147;paid prioritization&#148;); establish a new &#147;general conduct standard&#148; that prohibits ISPs from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging the ability of consumers to select, access and use the lawful Internet content, applications, services or devices of their choosing or of edge providers to make lawful content, applications, services or devices available to consumers; and require ISPs to disclose information regarding network management, performance and commercial terms of the service. In addition, interconnection arrangements, which govern how Internet traffic is exchanged between high-speed Internet networks and provide direct, dedicated interconnection capacity to edge providers, will now be subject to FCC oversight under Title II of the Communications Act. All of these regulations are subject to FCC enforcement and could give rise to third-party claims for damages or equitable relief. These new requirements could adversely affect our business, although the extent to which they do so will depend upon the manner in which the FCC interprets and enforces them. The FCC&#146;s new open Internet regulations have been appealed in federal court. 

States also may attempt to use the FCC&#146;s open Internet decision to justify imposing new regulations or taxes and fees on ISPs that could adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 17 &#160; Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K Separate and apart from the FCC&#146;s new open Internet regulations, we committed to be bound by the FCC&#146;s original &#147;open Internet&#148; regulations adopted in 2010 as a condition of the NBCUniversal Order and the NBCUniversal Consent Decree until 2018, although we did not agree to be bound by any future open Internet regulations. As a result, among other things, we cannot block access to lawful Internet content, applications, services or non-harmful devices or unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful Internet network traffic, although we may engage in reasonable network management. 

Municipally Owned Broadband Networks 

A number of states have enacted laws that restrict or prohibit local municipalities from operating municipally owned broadband networks. A municipal broadband provider in Tennessee and a municipality in North Carolina requested that the FCC preempt state laws that restrict their ability to provide broadband Internet access service, and in February 2015, the FCC preempted the Tennessee and North Carolina laws in most respects and expressed a willingness to entertain similar preemption requests. The FCC&#146;s decision has been appealed in federal court. 

Definition of Advanced Telecommunications Capability 

In January 2015, the FCC redefined what connection speeds and other service characteristics constitute &#147;advanced telecommunications capability,&#148; increasing the downstream speed from 4 Mbps to 25 Mbps. The definition of &#147;advanced telecommunications capability&#148; has been used by the FCC in the past to determine whether broadband Internet access services are being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely manner, and if they are not being so deployed, the FCC may adopt new regulations that could conceivably accelerate deployment of such services. The FCC relied in part on this authority to adopt its new open Internet regulations. 

NBCUniversal Order/Consent Decree Conditions 

The NBCUniversal Order and NBCUniversal Consent Decree include various conditions and commitments requiring us to expand our broadband service areas, to continue to offer all of our broadband Internet access service speed tiers on a standalone basis at reasonable market-based prices, to maintain a broadband Internet access service of at least 12 Mbps downstream across most of our footprint, and to avoid discrimination in how we treat &#147;specialized services&#148; (defined as services we provide over the same last-mile facilities as our broadband Internet access service, but not including our broadband Internet access service, video services or voice services). 

Voice Services 

We provide voice services using interconnected VoIP technology. The FCC has adopted a number of regulations for providers of nontraditional voice services such as ours, including regulations relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information, local number portability duties and benefits, disability access, E911, law enforcement assistance, outage reporting, rural call completion reporting, Universal Service Fund contribution obligations, domestic discontinuance requirements and certain regulatory filing requirements. The FCC has not yet ruled on whether interconnected VoIP service should be classified as an &#147;information service&#148; or a &#147;telecommunications service&#148; under the Communications Act. The classification determination is important because telecommunications services are regulated more extensively than information services. Unless and until the FCC definitively classifies interconnected VoIP service, state regulatory commissions and legislatures will continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirements on our voice services, and the FCC&#146;s new open Internet regulations reclassifying Internet access as a telecommunications service may further encourage state-level regulatory actions. 

Voice Interconnection 

Because the FCC has not determined the appropriate classification of our voice services, providers of VoIP services typically either secure CLEC authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone 

&#160; 

&#160;

Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#160; 18 &#160; company networks by contracting with an existing CLEC, which has the right, as a telecommunications carrier, to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone companies. We have arranged for such interconnection rights through affiliated CLECs. If a regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our affiliated CLECs, our ability to provide voice services and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted. The FCC regulates the arrangements by which telecommunications carriers compensate one another for exchanged traffic, and has affirmed the right of CLECs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for VoIP providers. In 2012, the FCC sought comment on petitions that raise issues concerning the interconnection obligations for VoIP providers. Further, a Massachusetts state commission is reviewing whether IP interconnection agreements should be subject to regulation and other states could follow. 

Universal Service 

A federal program known as the Universal Service program generally requires telecommunications service providers to pay a fee based on revenue from their services into a fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunications services in high-cost areas and to low-income consumers and the provision of Internet and telecommunications services to schools, libraries and certain health care providers. Some states also have analogous programs that support service in high-cost areas or to low-income consumers. The FCC has long considered implementing changes to the Universal Service program, such as changing the fee calculation from a revenue-based formula to a per-user fee or per-connection fee, adopting a fee based on bandwidth, and expanding the services subject to the fee to include broadband Internet access services. In 2014, the FCC referred the question of how to reform Universal Service fees to a joint federal and state commission, which was expected to make a recommendation in 2015, but has not yet done so. 

The FCC recently has shifted its focus away from supporting traditional telephone service, and toward subsidizing broadband deployment. This shift could assist some of our competitors. For example, in 2014, the FCC substantially revised the program that provides Universal Service support for services to schools and libraries to shift support from voice services to broadband services and the deployment of Wi-Fi networks. 

NBCUniversal Segments 

&#160;

Cable Networks 

Program Access 

The Communications Act and FCC regulations (i.e., the &#147;program access rules&#148;) generally prevent cable networks affiliated with cable operators from favoring cable operators over competing multichannel video programming distributors (&#147;MVPDs&#148;). The FCC is considering whether certain online video distributors (&#147;OVDs&#148;) should be classified as MVPDs, which would give them the ability to bring complaints under the program access rules. 

The FCC and Congress also have considered proposals that would require companies that own multiple cable networks to make each of their networks available individually when negotiating distribution agreements with multichannel video providers and potentially with OVDs. We currently offer our cable networks both on a bundled basis and, when requested, individually. 

Under the terms of the NBCUniversal Order, MVPDs can invoke commercial arbitration for access in certain circumstances to our cable networks and broadcast television networks, including our regional sports networks. In addition, under the NBCUniversal Order and NBCUniversal Consent Decree, we are required to make certain of our cable network, broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming available to bona fide OVDs in certain circumstances. For further discussion of these conditions, see &#147;Broadcast Television&#148; below and refer to the &#147;Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent&#148; and &#147;Internet Distribution&#148; discussions within that section. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 19 &#160; Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K Children&#146;s Programming 

Under federal regulations, the amount of commercial content that may be shown on cable networks, broadcast networks and broadcast television stations during programming originally produced and broadcast primarily for an audience of children under 13 years of age is limited, and certain television station programming must serve the educational and informational needs of children under 17 years of age. In addition, the NBCUniversal Order includes certain commitments and conditions related to children&#146;s television and advertising directed at children. 

Broadcast Television 

Licensing 

Local broadcast television stations may be operated only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants broadcast television station licenses for specific periods of time, which may be renewed with or without conditions. Substantially all of our broadcast television station licenses have pending applications for renewal, although our stations&#146; authority to operate is automatically extended while a renewal application is under review. Several of these applications have been opposed by third parties, and other applications are pending. Although our licenses have been renewed in the past, there can be no assurance that we will always obtain them. 

Ownership Limits 

FCC regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have &#147;attributable interests&#148; above specific ownership levels in local television stations and place limitations on ownership of other specified mass media entities, such as limits on the cross-ownership of broadcast stations and newspapers in the same market. The FCC is reviewing the ownership regulations detailed below in 2016. 

Local Television Ownership 

Under FCC regulations, a licensee generally may own up to two broadcast television stations in the same DMA, as long as at least one of the stations is not among the top four-ranked stations in the market based on audience share and there are at least eight independently owned and operating full-power broadcast television stations in the market. Without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations, ownership of more than one television station within the same DMA is permitted so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap. 

National Television Ownership 

The Communications Act and FCC regulations limit the number of broadcast television stations one entity may own or control nationally. No entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television stations that reach, in the aggregate, more than 39% of all U.S. television households. Our owned television station reach does not exceed this limit. The FCC is considering eliminating a rule that currently affords UHF stations (channels 14 and above) a 50% discount in calculating the extent of an individual station owner&#146;s holdings under the national cap, which if adopted, would place us closer to the national cap and limit our flexibility to acquire stations in the future. 

Foreign Ownership 

The Communications Act generally limits foreign ownership in a broadcast station to 20% direct ownership and 25% indirect ownership, although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the FCC finds it to be in the public interest. For many decades the FCC declined to waive the 25% indirect limit in broadcast transactions, but since 2013, it has been willing to consider such waiver requests. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#160; 20 &#160; Dual Network Rule 

The four major broadcast television networks &#150; ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC &#150; are prohibited from being under common ownership or control with another of the four. 

Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent 

Every three years, each commercial television station must elect for each cable system in its DMA either must-carry or retransmission consent. A similar regulatory scheme applies to satellite providers. For the current period, which ends on December 31, 2017, all of our owned NBC broadcast television stations and our owned Telemundo broadcast television stations elected retransmission consent. 

In enacting the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014, Congress modified certain aspects of the compulsory copyright licenses under which satellite providers and cable operators retransmit broadcast stations. As directed by this legislation, the FCC is reviewing aspects of the requirement that commercial television stations and multichannel video providers negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith. Congress also is considering legislation that would eliminate or modify the must-carry and retransmission consent regime. Under conditions imposed in the NBCUniversal Order, multichannel video providers may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes regarding carriage of our owned local broadcast television stations. 

Internet Distribution 

The NBCUniversal Order and NBCUniversal Consent Decree establish certain obligations and restraints concerning distribution of our content online. We must make available certain of our cable network, broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming to bona fide online video distributors in certain circumstances, and they may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve disputes over access to such programming. We also must distribute programming via nbc.com that is generally equivalent to the programming that we distributed via nbc.com as of January 1, 2011, on generally equivalent price, terms and conditions, so long as at least one of the other major broadcast networks continues to distribute its programming in a similar fashion. We are one of three broadcast network owners of Hulu, but we have no voting rights or board representation. We have entered into renewal license agreements with Hulu on substantially the same terms as its other broadcast network owners. 

Online Video Distributors 

The FCC is considering classifying certain online video distributors that offer multiple linear video programming networks to customers with a broadband Internet connection as multichannel video providers under FCC rules to ensure that OVDs have program access rights to video programming from vertically integrated cable programmers and the right to force local television broadcast stations to negotiate to license their content. The FCC also has proposed potentially excusing these entities from all or some of the regulatory obligations applicable to current multichannel video providers. If adopted, these proposals would increase our program access obligations and raise complicated issues regarding the licensing of our broadcast programming. 

Indecency 

A federal statute and FCC regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material on television stations at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. From time to time, we have received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on our owned local broadcast television stations included indecent or profane material. 

Filmed Entertainment 

Our filmed entertainment business is subject to &#147;trade practice laws&#148; in effect in 25 states and Puerto Rico relating to theatrical distribution of motion pictures. In countries outside the United States, a variety of existing or contemplated laws and regulations may affect our ability to distribute and license motion picture and 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 21 &#160; Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K television products, as well as consumer merchandise products. The ability of countries to deny market access or refuse national treatment to products originating outside their territories is regulated under various international agreements. 

Theme Parks 

Our theme parks are subject to various regulations, including laws and regulations regarding environmental protection, privacy and data protection, consumer product safety and theme park operations, such as health, sanitation, safety and fire standards, as well as liquor licenses. 

Other Areas of Regulation 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

Copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other proprietary rights laws of the United States and other countries help protect our intellectual property rights. In particular, piracy of programming and films through unauthorized distribution of counterfeit DVDs, peer-to-peer file sharing and other platforms presents challenges for our cable networks, broadcast television and filmed entertainment businesses. The unauthorized reproduction, distribution or display of copyrighted material over the Internet or through other methods of distribution, such as through devices, software or websites that allow the reproduction, viewing, sharing and/or downloading of content by either ignoring or interfering with the content&#146;s security features and copyrighted status, interferes with the market for copyrighted works and disrupts our ability to exploit our content. The extent of copyright protection and the use of technological protections, such as encryption, are controversial. Modifications to existing laws that weaken these protections could have an adverse effect on our ability to license and sell our programming. 

While many legal protections exist to combat piracy, laws in the United States and internationally continue to evolve, as do technologies used to evade these laws. We have actively engaged in the enforcement of our intellectual property rights and likely will continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content. The repeal of laws intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property or weakening of such laws or enforcement in the United States or internationally, or a failure of existing laws to adapt to new technologies, could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could negatively impact their value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights. 

Copyright laws also require that we contribute a percentage of revenue to a federal copyright royalty pool in exchange for retransmitting copyrighted material in broadcast signals pursuant to a compulsory license and that we pay standard industry licensing fees for the public performance of music in the programs we distribute, such as local advertising and local origination programming on our cable systems, as well as in the content we create. The fees we pay to music performance rights organizations are typically renegotiated when we renew licenses with those organizations, while the royalties we contribute to the copyright royalty pool for broadcast signals can be challenged by copyright owners in annual audits, and we cannot predict what those fees will be in the future or if disputes will arise over them. 

There has been litigation related to a number of online entities that stream our broadcast television content online without the consent of, or compensation to, NBC or its affiliates. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that one such entity, Aereo, violated the broadcasters&#146; exclusive right to perform their copyrighted works publicly. Subsequently, Aereo sought to operate as a cable system under the Copyright Act. Although the U.S. Copyright Office rejected its application for a compulsory copyright license, other companies continue to seek legislation or court rulings to obtain a compulsory license to stream broadcast programming online. Along with other major broadcasters, we also have brought a suit against a multichannel video provider to challenge the commercial-skipping functionality in its DVR. In addition, the FCC is considering whether to classify certain OVDs as multichannel video providers, giving them the right to negotiate for 

&#160; 

&#160;

Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#160; 22 &#160; retransmission consent with local broadcast television stations, and subjecting such negotiations to the good-faith requirements under the FCC&#146;s rules. Any such reclassification could influence the U.S. Copyright Office to extend the compulsory license to OVDs. 

Privacy and Data Security Regulation 

The Communications Act generally restricts the nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers&#146; personally identifiable information by cable operators, except for rendering service, conducting legitimate business activities related to the service, and responding to legal requests. We are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information (&#147;CPNI&#148;) related to our voice services. The FCC expects broadband Internet access service providers such as us to take reasonable, good faith steps to comply with existing statutory requirements to protect broadband CPNI and plans to propose new privacy and data security rules for broadband ISPs in 2016. The FCC has recently imposed substantial civil penalties and remediation obligations on several companies for alleged privacy and data security violations. In 2015, Comcast entered into a settlement with a California regulatory commission regarding Comcast&#146;s inadvertent disclosure of customer telephone numbers for which customers had requested non-published or non-listed status. 

The FTC exercises authority over privacy protections generally, using its existing authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices to apply greater restrictions on the collection and use of personally identifiable and other information relating to consumers. It also has undertaken numerous enforcement actions against parties that do not provide sufficient security protections against the loss or unauthorized disclosure of this type of information. We also are subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements on website operators and online services that are directed to children under 13 years of age, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children under 13 years of age. Other privacy-oriented laws have been extended by courts to online video providers and are increasingly being used in privacy lawsuits, including class actions, against providers of video materials online. 

We are also subject to state and federal &#147;do not call&#148; laws regarding telemarketing and state and federal laws regarding unsolicited commercial emails, as well as FCC regulations relating to automated telemarketing calls, texts or SMS messages. The FTC and state attorneys general also have initiated efforts to increase and enforce transparency requirements about the collection and use of consumer information, even in an aggregated, non-customer-identifiable form, which may require ongoing review of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required. 

We are also subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding data security that primarily apply to sensitive personal information that could be used to commit identity theft. Most states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed due to a security breach, and the FCC has adopted security breach rules for voice services. Several states have also enacted general data security requirements to safeguard consumer information, including the proper disposal of consumer information. 

The National Institute of Standards and Technology, in cooperation with other federal agencies and owners and operators of U.S. critical infrastructure, including us, have developed a voluntary framework that provides a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based and cost-effective approach to cybersecurity risk. It is a compendium of existing cross-sector cyber-defense processes, practices and protocols that can help companies identify, assess and manage their cyber risks and vulnerabilities, and several government agencies have encouraged compliance with this framework. Additionally, in December 2015, Congress enacted the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, which is intended to encourage and facilitate the sharing of security threat and defensive measure information with government agencies and other companies, in order to strengthen the 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 23 &#160; Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K country&#146;s overall cybersecurity protections. Finally, there are pending legislative proposals that could impose new requirements on owners and operators of critical infrastructure, including us, and the FCC is considering expanding its cybersecurity guidelines or adopting new cybersecurity requirements. 

FCC Spectrum Auction 

Congress has authorized the FCC to conduct an auction to repurpose some broadcast spectrum to mobile broadband use. In this auction, licensees of full-power and Class A television stations have the opportunity to sell some or all of their spectrum rights in exchange for cash. TV stations that do not voluntarily sell their spectrum rights may be assigned new channels on which to operate, but the FCC must make &#147;all reasonable efforts&#148; to preserve those stations&#146; over-the-air coverage areas and populations served, and to reimburse them for reasonable relocation costs (subject to an aggregate limit of $1.75 billion). 

NBCUniversal has submitted applications with the FCC indicating its potential interest in selling broadcast spectrum rights. Potential bidders for the repurposed mobile broadband spectrum licenses must file their applications with the FCC by February 10, 2016. We expect to submit an application to be a potential buyer of those new licenses. Bidding in the auction is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2016. Filing an application in the auction does not create any obligation to sell, bid on, or buy spectrum. We cannot predict whether NBCUniversal will sell any of its broadcast spectrum rights, whether we will bid for or buy any of the new mobile broadband licenses, or what the size of any proceeds or costs may be (although any such amounts may be significant). 

State and Local Taxes 

Some states and localities have imposed or are considering imposing, through both legislative and administrative channels, new or additional taxes or fees on, or limiting or eliminating incentives or credits earned or monetized by, the businesses operated by the Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments, or imposing adverse methodologies by which taxes, fees, incentives or credits are earned or monetized. These include combined reporting or other changes to general business taxes, central assessments for property tax, and taxes and fees on the businesses operated or services provided by the Cable Communications and NBCUniversal segments. In some situations, DBS and other competitors that deliver their services over a high-speed Internet connection do not face similar state tax and fee burdens. Congress has also considered, and may consider again, proposals to bar or limit states from imposing taxes on these DBS providers or other competitors that are equivalent to the taxes or fees that we pay. Congress may not extend the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which prohibits most states and localities from imposing taxes on Internet access charges, but expires in October 2016. Additionally, the FCC&#146;s reclassification of broadband Internet access services as Title II telecommunications services may cause or allow, directly or indirectly, some states and localities to impose additional taxes and fees on our high-speed Internet business. 

Environmental Matters 

Certain of our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations since they involve air emissions, wastewater discharges and the use, disposal and cleanup of toxic and hazardous substances. Any failure to comply with environmental requirements could result in monetary fines, civil or criminal sanctions, third-party claims or other costs or liabilities. As disclosed in Item 3, &#147;Legal Proceedings,&#148; we recently settled a matter relating to certain of our waste disposal policies, procedures and practices in California. 

Environmental requirements have become more stringent over time, and pending or proposed new regulations could impact our operations or costs. For example, climate change regulation, such as proposed greenhouse gas emissions limits or cap and trade programs, could result in an increase in the cost of electricity, which is a significant component of our operational costs at some locations. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Comcast 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#160; 24 &#160; Other Regulations 

Federal regulators actively regulate other aspects of our businesses, including accessibility to our cable, broadcast and voice services for people with disabilities, customer service standards, inside wiring, leased access, loudness of commercial advertisements, advertising, Emergency Alert System, equal employment opportunity, lottery programming, recordkeeping and public file access requirements, regulatory fees and technical standards relating to the operation of cable systems and television stations. We are occasionally subject to enforcement actions at the FCC, which can result in us having to pay fines to the agency or being subject to other sanctions. We also are subject to various international regulations, including those with respect to television broadcasting, programming and advertising. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 153,000 full-time and part-time employees. Of these employees, approximately 88,000 and 53,000 were associated with our cable communications business and our NBCUniversal businesses, respectively. We also use freelance and temporary employees in the normal course of our business. 

Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 

The SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company&#146;s future prospects and make informed investment decisions. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called &#147;forward-looking statements&#148; by words such as &#147;may,&#148; &#147;will,&#148; &#147;should,&#148; &#147;expects,&#148; &#147;believes,&#148; &#147;estimates,&#148; &#147;potential,&#148; or &#147;continue,&#148; or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties listed in &#147;Risk Factors&#148; and in other reports we file with the SEC. 

Additionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and, particularly in view of new technologies, the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any of such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.
