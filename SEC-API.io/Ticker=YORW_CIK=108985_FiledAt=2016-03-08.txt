 Item 1.

Business.

The York Water Company (the "Company") is the oldest investor-owned water utility in the United States and is duly organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Company has operated continuously since 1816. The primary business of the Company is to impound, purify to meet or exceed safe drinking water standards and distribute water. The Company also owns and operates two wastewater collection and treatment systems. The Company operates within its franchised territory, which covers 39 municipalities within York County, Pennsylvania and nine municipalities within Adams County, Pennsylvania. The Company is regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, or PPUC, in the areas of billing, payment procedures, dispute processing, terminations, service territory, debt and equity financing and rate setting. The Company must obtain PPUC approval before changing any practices associated with the aforementioned areas.

Water service is supplied through the Company's own distribution system. The Company obtains the bulk of its water supply from both the South Branch and East Branch of the Codorus Creek, which together have an average daily flow of 73.0 million gallons. This combined watershed area is approximately 117 square miles. The Company has two reservoirs, Lake Williams and Lake Redman, which together hold up to approximately 2.2 billion gallons of water. The Company has a 15-mile pipeline from the Susquehanna River to Lake Redman which provides access to an additional supply of 12.0 million gallons of untreated water per day. The Company also owns seven wells which are capable of providing a safe yield of approximately 366,000 gallons per day to supply water to its customers in Carroll Valley Borough and Cumberland Township, Adams County. As of December 31, 2015, the Company's average daily availability was 35.4 million gallons, and average daily consumption was approximately 18.5 million gallons. The Company's service territory had an estimated population of 194,000 as of December 31, 2015. Industry within the Company's service territory is diversified, manufacturing such items as fixtures and furniture, electrical machinery, food products, paper, ordnance units, textile products, injectable drug delivery systems, air conditioning systems, laundry detergent, barbells and motorcycles.

The Company's water business is somewhat dependent on weather conditions, particularly the amount and timing of rainfall. Revenues are particularly vulnerable to weather conditions in the summer months. Prolonged periods of hot and dry weather generally cause increased water usage for watering lawns, washing cars, and keeping golf courses and sports fields irrigated. Conversely, prolonged periods of dry weather could lead to drought restrictions from governmental authorities. Despite the Company's adequate water supply, customers may be required to cut back water usage under such drought restrictions which would negatively impact revenues. The Company has addressed some of this vulnerability by instituting minimum customer charges which are intended to cover fixed costs of operations under all likely weather conditions.

The Company's business does not require large amounts of working capital and is not dependent on any single customer or a very few customers for a material portion of its business. Increases in revenues are generally dependent on the Company's ability to obtain rate increases from the PPUC in a timely manner and in adequate amounts and to increase volumes of water sold through increased consumption and increases in the number of customers served. The Company continuously looks for water and wastewater acquisition and expansion opportunities both within and outside its current service territory as well as additional opportunities to enter into bulk water contracts with municipalities and other entities to supply water.

The Company has agreements with several municipalities to provide sewer billing services. The Company also has a service line protection program on a targeted basis in order to further diversify its business. Under this optional program, customers pay a fixed monthly fee, and the Company will repair or replace damaged customer service lines, as needed, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. Opportunities to expand both initiatives are being pursued.

Competition

As a regulated utility, the Company operates within an exclusive franchised territory that is substantially free from direct competition with other public utilities, municipalities and other entities. Although the Company has been granted an exclusive franchise for each of its existing community water and wastewater systems, the ability of the Company to expand or acquire new service territories may be affected by currently unknown competitors obtaining franchises to surrounding systems by application or acquisition. These competitors may include other investor-owned utilities, nearby municipally-owned utilities and sometimes from strategic or financial purchasers seeking to enter or expand in the water and wastewater industry. The addition of new service territory and the acquisition of other utilities are generally subject to review and approval by the PPUC.

Water and Wastewater Quality and Environmental Regulations

Provisions of water and wastewater service are subject to regulation under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Clean Water Act and related state laws, and under federal and state regulations issued under these laws. In addition, the Company is subject to federal and state laws and other regulations relating to solid waste disposal, dam safety and other aspects of its operations.

The federal Safe Drinking Water Act establishes criteria and procedures for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to develop national quality standards. Regulations issued under the Act, and its amendments, set standards on the amount of certain contaminants allowable in drinking water. Current requirements are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's operations or financial condition as it already meets or exceeds standards. In the future, the Company may be required to change its method of treating drinking water, and may incur additional capital investments if new regulations become effective.

Under the requirements of the Pennsylvania Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, or DEP, monitors the quality of the finished water supplied to customers. The DEP requires the Company to submit weekly reports showing the results of daily bacteriological and other chemical and physical analyses. As part of this requirement, the Company conducts over 70,000 laboratory tests annually. Management believes that the Company complies with the standards established by the agency under the SDWA. The DEP assists the Company by regulating discharges into the Company's watershed area to prevent and eliminate pollution.

The federal Groundwater Rule became effective December 1, 2009 with implementation for community water supplies serving between 100 and 500 customers before April 1, 2012. This rule requires additional testing of water from well sources, and under certain circumstances requires demonstration and maintenance of effective disinfection. The Company holds public water supply permits issued by the DEP, which establishes the groundwater source operating conditions for its wells, including demonstrated 4-log treatment of viruses. All of the satellite systems operated by the Company are in compliance with the federal Groundwater Rule. The Company plans to make modifications at one of these systems to more reliably and consistently demonstrate 4-log treatment of viruses.

The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. The Company complies with this Act by obtaining and maintaining all required permits and approvals for discharges from its water and wastewater facilities and by satisfying all conditions and regulatory requirements associated with the permits.

The DEP monitors the quality of wastewater discharge effluent under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, or NPDES. The Company submits monthly reports to the DEP showing the results of its daily effluent monitoring and removal of sludge and biosolids. The Company is not aware of any significant environmental remediation costs necessary from the handling and disposal of waste material from its wastewater operations.

The DEP and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission, or SRBC, regulate the amount of water withdrawn from streams in the watershed to assure that sufficient quantities are available to meet the needs of the Company and other regulated users. Through its Division of Dam Safety, the DEP regulates the operation and maintenance of the Company's impounding dams. The Company routinely inspects its dams and prepares annual reports of their condition as required by DEP regulations. The DEP reviews these reports and inspects the Company's dams approximately every year. The DEP most recently inspected the Company's dams in April 2014 and noted no significant violations.

Since 1980, the DEP has required any new dam to have a spillway that is capable of passing the design flood without overtopping the dam. The design flood is either the Probable Maximum Flood, or PMF, or some fraction of it, depending on the size and location of the dam. PMF is very conservative and is calculated using the most severe combination of meteorological and hydrologic conditions reasonably possible in the watershed area of a dam.

The Company engaged a professional engineer to analyze the spillway capacities at the Lake Williams and Lake Redman dams and validate the DEP's recommended flood design for the dams. Management presented the results of the study to the DEP in December 2004, and DEP then requested that the Company submit a proposed schedule for the actions to address the spillway capacities. Thereafter, the Company retained an engineering firm to prepare preliminary designs for increasing the spillway capacities to pass the PMF through armoring the dams with roller compacted concrete. Management has met with the DEP on a regular basis to review the preliminary design and discuss scheduling, permitting, and construction requirements. The Company is currently completing preliminary work on the dams as well as the final design and the permitting process. The Company expects to begin armoring one of the dams between 2017 and 2019. The second dam is expected to be armored in a year or two following the first dam armoring. The cost to armor each dam is expected to be approximately $5 million.

Capital expenditures and operating costs required as a result of water quality standards and environmental requirements have been traditionally recognized by state public utility commissions as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. The capital expenditures currently required as a result of water quality standards and environmental requirements have been budgeted in the Company's capital program and represent less than 10% of its expected total capital expenditures over the next five years. The Company is currently in compliance with wastewater environmental standards and does not anticipate any major capital expenditures for its current wastewater business.
