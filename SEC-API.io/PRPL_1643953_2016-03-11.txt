 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

We are a blank check company incorporated in May 2015 as a Delaware corporation formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 

&#160; 

Objective and Business Opportunity 

&#160; 

We are focused on seeking and completing an initial business combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between $300 million and $1.5 billion, although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise value may be considered. While we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any business industry or sector, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our combined team to identify, acquire and operate a business following the initial business combination. We believe that the characteristics and capabilities of our combined team make us an attractive partner to potential target businesses, enhance our ability to complete a successful business combination and bring value to the business post-business combination. Not only does our combined team bring a combination of operating, investing, financial and transaction experience, but they have also worked together previously on multiple private equity investments, consulting assignments and boards of directors. 

&#160; 

Our management team is led by William Kerr, our Chairman, Paul Zepf, our Chief Executive Officer and a director, and Andrew Cook, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, our combined team includes our other directors (Pano Anthos, Gary DiCamillo and Jeffrey Weiss) and advisors (David Chamberlain, Neal Goldman and Michael Johnston). For a complete discussion of our combined teams&#8217; background and experience, please see &#8220;Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance&#8212;Directors and Executive Officers.&#8221; 

&#160; 

We believe the combined team possesses the core characteristics of an ideal team for a special purpose acquisition corporation. This combined team is a mix of what we view to be successful dealmakers or operators, with experience across multiple deal types, including complicated special situations and as senior operators across a variety of businesses and industries, having completed more than 125 transactions collectively. This combined team has built a meaningful proprietary deal sourcing network in a wide range of industries and business lines that should allow us to source deals that other investors could not. Through these endeavors, this combined team has what we believe is a long standing track record of value creation, both as investors and for investors, across the gamut of private equity or direct public and private company investing. Our network and current affiliations across the team allow us to lean heavily on an existing infrastructure of resources that assist in due diligence, underwriting and ultimately structuring an acquisition. We may also leverage our network of third party advisors as needed. 

&#160; 

With respect to the foregoing examples, past performance by our management team or sponsor team is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate or (ii) that we will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial business combination. Furthermore, in considering any past performance information contained herein, you should bear in mind that actual returns depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the value of the investments and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may differ from the assumptions on which the overall performance of any prior investments are based. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Business Strategy and Sourcing of Targets 

&#160; 

Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and, after our initial business combination, to build a company in an industry that complements the experience and expertise of our combined team. Our acquisition selection process leverages their deep, broad and trusted network of industry, private equity sponsor and lending community relationships as well as their relationships with public and private companies at a board and management level, investment bankers, consultants, attorneys and accountants. We believe this should provide us with a breadth of business combination opportunities as well as opportunities for improving the target&#8217;s business post-merger. Over the course of their careers, our combined team have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships, which we intend to use to source merger targets which will not be subject to highly competitive auctions. Their capabilities include both deep and diverse strengths, as set forth in the diagrams below: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

This network provides our management team with a robust and consistent flow of investment opportunities. Upon completion of our initial public offering, members of our combined team communicated with their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters for our search for a target company and a potential business combination and began the process of pursuing and reviewing promising leads. 

&#160; 

The experience and capabilities of our combined team should allow us to drive growth in shareholder value following the business combination. The prior experience of the members of our combined team includes working with companies and increasing value for all stakeholders at the senior management level, as consultants, as board members and as constructive minority stake shareholders. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Investment Focus 

&#160; 

We believe certain non-public companies and their shareholders can benefit from a transaction with us. Acquisition candidates are entities that may need stable, permanent equity financing, but may currently have limited access to the public markets. While targets may be either independent entities or divisions of larger organizations, we believe there is an opportunity for us to provide value. We expect to utilize a pro-active and disciplined approach to sourcing potential deals. 

&#160;

Utilizing our knowledge of the M&#38;A and capital markets as well as various industry sectors, we developed specific investment themes which we believe are actionable for us. The combination of the ability to go public through a merger with us, the capital that we bring to the transaction and the value-added capabilities of our management should be attractive to owners and managers of target companies. 

&#160;

Industry Sector Expertise &#160;

&#160;

We are focusing our search for business combination targets across a range of industry sectors, in which our combined team has deep knowledge and experience. We believe our investing/deal and senior management operating expertise across multiple industry verticals gives us a sizable addressable universe of potential targets to which we can credibly analyze and enhance value and will, as a result, maximize our chances of completing a business combination in a timely manner and having that entity perform well post-merger. 

&#160; 

Multiple members of our combined team have experience in each of the following industry sectors: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Technology &#8212;We believe that our combined team&#8217;s experience and expertise in the technology sector enables us to take advantage of emerging trends in technology, as it relates (a) to a potential business combination with a technology company, and (b) to bringing technological expertise to a potential business combination partner which is not a technology company, but is facing technologically driven change forces or is trying to take advantage of technology driven changes. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Media &#8212;Our combined team has investing experience and management expertise in various media businesses, including content-centric businesses and media businesses facing rapid technological changes. This experience positions us well to source, execute and add value to a media-related business combination. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Industrials &#8212;Our combined team has significant management experience in basic industrial sectors and in industrial service sectors. They have invested in and managed manufacturing businesses where significant operational improvements were needed. Our combined team also has succeeded in growing industrial and industrial services businesses. Additionally, based on decades of experience, they have a keen understanding of international competitive dynamics on industrial focused businesses. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Consumer/Retail &#8212;Our combined team has experience across a range of consumer and retail sectors. They have driven investment returns in the consumer and retail sectors through focusing on the power of brands, including creating new brands as well as repositioning older, more stable brands for profitable growth. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Financial Services &#8212;Our combined team has experience and expertise in diverse financial service sectors, including finance companies, insurance, banking and asset management. They have found target opportunities and successful investments in financial services sector often through contrarian investment themes. They have been able to build financial services companies through start-up, consolidation and &#8220;roll-ups&#8221;, and deep value asset &#8220;plays&#8221;. They believe the ongoing regulatory scrutiny of large, traditional financial service companies should result in opportunities for us. &#160; 

We believe the owners of businesses, including private equity firms and management teams, will view the combined expertise, diversity of backgrounds and collective track record of our combined team&#8217;s deal sourcing, execution and management capabilities as a positive attribute contributing to our ability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities and structure and complete a successful business combination. 

&#160; 

Acquisition Criteria 

&#160;

Consistent with this strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities. We may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. We seek to acquire companies exhibiting the characteristics below: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Value-Added Capital For Growth And/Or Consolidation Opportunities : Our combined team has significant and successful experience in investing in and working with companies that are achieving rapid and profitable growth through (a) organic growth initiatives; and/or (b) strategic consolidation opportunities. We are targeting companies whose owners may not have the requisite capital or experience to take advantage of compelling corporate development opportunities. Our combined team also has experience expanding company&#8217;s markets and operations outside of the United States, and we believe our cross-border capabilities could be attractive to many potential middle market business combination targets. 

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#9679; Operational improvements : Our combined team has significant and successful experience investing in and working with companies where there is an opportunity to effect meaningful operational improvements. Members of our management team and sponsor team have worked with such companies as investors, board members, consultants and &#8220;senior management&#8221;. We have tailored, and will continue to tailor, our approach to working with the target company&#8217;s management team and owners to fit the unique challenges and opportunities they face. Our combined team has the versatility and flexibility to allow us to provide strategic guidance as board members and consultants or members take on direct senior leadership roles to drive operational improvements at the target company 

&#160; &#160; &#9679; Deleveraging : Our combined team&#8217;s extensive relationships with lenders and private equity firms, as well as their prior experience in making deleveraging investments, should position us well to source and execute a recapitalizing acquisition. We believe that the record issuance of high yield debt and leveraged loans from 2011 through 2015 will lead to an increase in companies that will need to de-lever within the next two years. As opposed to many distressed debt funds/investors, we believe we would be a preferred refinancing/de-leveraging solution to owners and management teams of middle-market companies. Currently, average debt multiples of large corporate leveraged buyout (LBO) loans and middle-market loans during the 2011-2015 period have surpassed even those of the 2004 &#8211; 2007 period. &#160; &#160; &#9679; &#8220;Partnership&#8221; Sale : We may seek to acquire one or more companies with a current owner, private equity or otherwise, who would like to retain a meaningful stake in the company to preserve and enhance potential upside. As a provider of public equity capital, we are well positioned to provide liquidity and expect that potential merger targets and partners would view having our combined team as significant, supportive shareholders as a positive factor. We could be an attractive financial and operating partner for a private equity firm that sees compelling acquisition opportunities but may be already fully-invested. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, approximately 3,529 private equity portfolio companies have been held for more than 5 years, with the median holding period increasing from an average of 3.5 years in 2007 to 5.2 years. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Limited Liquidity Options :undefinedAt times the IPO market is uncertain or closed, so an acquisition by us could be a better means of going public for a target company. Further, a target company&#8217;s owners and/or management might not have experience going public or operating as a public company and could view our management team and sponsor experience as an important factor. Additionally, certain businesses may not be an ideal candidate for an M&#38;A auction process, so a negotiated acquisition by us could provide a better means of the target business&#8217; current owners achieving liquidity. 

&#160; 

We may or may not consummate our business combination with a company that exhibits all or any of the qualities above. In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us. 

&#160; 

We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with members of our management team or their affiliates. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our management team or their affiliates, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. 

&#160; 

Members of our management team, our directors and members of our sponsor may directly or indirectly own common stock and warrants following our initial public offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer or director is required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of such persons will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any officer or director unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. 

&#160; 

Our executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of, or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months after the closing of our initial public offering. None of our officers or directors has been involved with any blank check companies or special purpose acquisition corporations in the past. 

&#160; 

We may pay a member of our combined team (or an entity affiliated with a member of our combined team) a fee for financial advisory services rendered in connection with our identification, negotiation and consummation of our initial business combination. The fee will only be payable upon closing of our initial business combination, and may be paid out of the offering proceeds deposited in the trust account. The per-share amount distributed to any redeeming stockholders upon the completion of our initial business combination will not be reduced as a result of such fee. A majority of disinterested directors will determine the nature and amount of such fee, which will be based upon the prevailing market rate for similar services negotiated at arms&#8217; length for such transactions at such time, but will in no event exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate. Any such fee will also be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committee&#8217;s policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest. No such fee will be payable to our Chief Executive Officer.

Significant Activities Since Inception 

&#160; 

On August 4, 2015, we consummated our initial public offering of 15,525,000 units, including the full exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option of 2,025,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one-half of one share of common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per half share ($11.50 per full share). The units were sold in our initial public offering at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $155,250,000 (before underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses). Simultaneously with the consummation of our initial public offering, we completed the private placement of 12,815,000 warrants, issued to our sponsor, generating total proceeds of $6,407,500. 

&#160; 

A total of $155,250,000 of the net proceeds from our initial public offering (including the over-allotment) and the private placement with the sponsor were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of the Company&#8217;s public stockholders. 

&#160; 

Our units began trading on July 30, 2015 on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol GPACU. Commencing on August 13, 2015, the securities comprising the units began separate trading. The units, common stock, and warrants are trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbols &#8220;GPACU,&#8221; &#8220;GPAC&#8221; and &#8220;GPACW,&#8221; respectively. 

&#160; 

Initial Business Combination 

&#160; 

The NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in connection with our initial business combination. We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. 

&#160; 

Status as a Public Company 

&#160; 

We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with an initial business combination with us. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter&#8217;s ability to complete the public offering, as well as general market conditions, which could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with shareholders&#8217; interests. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&#8217;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 

&#160; 

Financial Position 

&#160; 

With funds available for a business combination in the amount of $150,592,500 assuming no redemptions and after payment of up to $4,657,500 of deferred underwriting fees, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Effecting our Initial Business Combination 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses. 

&#160; 

If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital. 

&#160; 

We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. 

&#160; 

In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise. 

&#160; 

Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination 

&#160; 

The NASDAQ rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in connection with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we are not permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations. 

&#160; 

In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. 

&#160; 

To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors. 

&#160; 

The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. 

&#160; 

We may pay a member of our combined team (or an entity affiliated with a member of our combined team) a fee for financial advisory services rendered in connection with our identification, negotiation and consummation of our initial business combination. The fee will only be payable upon closing of our initial business combination, and may be paid out of the offering proceeds deposited in the trust account. The per-share amount distributed to any redeeming stockholders upon the completion of our initial business combination will not be reduced as a result of such fee. A majority of disinterested directors will determine the nature and amount of such fee, which will be based upon the prevailing market rate for similar services negotiated at arms&#8217; length for such transactions at such time, but will in no event exceed $3,000,000 in the aggregate. Any such fee will also be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committee&#8217;s policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest. No such fee will be payable to our Chief Executive Officer. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Lack of business diversification 

&#160; 

For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services. &#160; 

Limited ability to evaluate the target&#8217;s management team 

&#160; 

Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business&#8217;s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 

&#160; 

We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

&#160; 

Stockholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination 

&#160; 

We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction. 

&#160; 

Type of Transaction &#160; Whether Stockholder Approval is Required Purchase of assets &#160; No Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company &#160; No Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company &#160; No Merger of the company with a target &#160; Yes &#160; 

Under NASDAQ&#8217;s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; we issue common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering); &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; any of our directors, officers or substantial stockholders (as defined by NASDAQ rules) has a 5% or greater interest (or such persons collectively have a 10% or greater interest), directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired or otherwise and the present or potential issuance of common stock could result in an increase in outstanding common shares or voting power of 5% or more; or &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.

&#160; 

Permitted purchases of our securities 

&#160; 

In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions. They will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. We have adopted an insider trading policy which requires insiders to refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material non-public information and to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary. 

&#160; 

In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. 

&#160; 

The purpose of such purchases would be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. This may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. 

&#160; 

In addition, if such purchases are made, the public &#8220;float&#8221; of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange. 

&#160; 

Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws. 

&#160; 

Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. 

&#160; 

Redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination 

&#160; 

We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholder, officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

Manner of Conducting Redemptions 

&#160; 

We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

If a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. &#160; 

Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act. 

&#160; 

In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to purchase will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor, which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination. 

&#160; 

If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; file proxy materials with the SEC. &#160; 

In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination. 

&#160; 

If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. In such case, our initial stockholder has agreed to vote its founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination, and our officers and directors have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholder, officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. 

&#160; 

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules). Redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Limitation on redemption upon completion of our initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval 

&#160; 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 10% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the &#8220;Excess Shares.&#8221; We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 10% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&#8217;s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders&#8217; ability to redeem no more than 10% of the shares sold in our initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders&#8217; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination. 

&#160; 

Tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights 

&#160; 

We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &#8220;street name,&#8221; to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company&#8217;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&#8217;s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares. 

&#160; 

There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $35.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. 

&#160; 

The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders&#8217; vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an &#8220;option window&#8221; after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company&#8217;s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become &#8220;option&#8221; rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder&#8217;s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved. 

&#160; 

Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholders meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination. 

&#160; 

If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares. 

&#160; 

If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until August 4, 2017. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination 

&#160; 

Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed that if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2017, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the 24-month time period. 

&#160; 

Our initial stockholder has entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which it has waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to its founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2017. However, if our initial stockholder (or any of our officers, directors or affiliates) acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 24-month time period. 

&#160; 

Our executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a letter agreement with us, a form of which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms part, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination by August 4, 2017, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;penny stock&#8221; rules). 

&#160; 

We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately $1,048,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2015), although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $50,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses. 

&#160; 

If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors&#8217; claims. 

&#160; 

Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party&#8217;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, Paul Zepf, our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, then Mr. Zepf will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that Mr. Zepf would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our other officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 

&#160; 

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and Mr. Zepf asserts that he is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against Mr. Zepf to enforce his indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Zepf to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be substantially less than $10.00 per share. 

&#160; 

We will seek to reduce the possibility that Mr. Zepf will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent auditors), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Mr. Zepf will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to up to approximately $1,048,000 of proceeds held outside the trust account (as of December 31, 2015) with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $50,000). 

&#160; 

Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by August 4, 2017 may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. Delaware law provides that if a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination by August 4, 2017, is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete our business combination by August 4, 2017, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes and less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 24 th month and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

&#160; 

Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers and auditors) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. 

&#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.00 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver, in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay taxes and less any per-share amounts distributed from our trust account to our public stockholders in the event we are unable to complete our business combination by August 4, 2017 and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, Mr. Zepf will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. 

&#160; 

If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a &#8220;preferential transfer&#8221; or a &#8220;fraudulent conveyance.&#8221; As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons. 

&#160; 

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination by August 4, 2017 or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder&#8217;s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder&#8217;s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. 

&#160; 

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-business combination activity, we will provide public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. Our initial stockholder, officers and directors have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) in each case subject to the limitations described herein; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; if our initial business combination is not consummated by August 4, 2017, then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from the trust account or (ii) vote on any initial business combination. &#160; 

These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of 65% of our common stock. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation povides that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a majority of the shares of common stock voted by our stockholders at a duly held stockholders meeting.

Competition 

&#160; 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we have encountered and may continue to encounter, intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently have two executive officers. While Mr. Zepf currently devotes the substantial majority of his time to our affairs, other members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that Mr. Zepf or any other members of our management devote in any time period varies based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process. 

&#160; 

Periodic Reporting and Financial Information 

&#160; 

Our units, common stock and warrants are registered under the Exchange Act and we have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors. 

&#160; 

We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with GAAP. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material. 

&#160; 

We will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. 

&#160; 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile. 

&#160; 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

&#160; 

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30 th , and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
