Business and Organization

&#160;

America&#8217;s Car-Mart, Inc., a Texas corporation initially formed in 1981 (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), is one of the largest publicly held automotive retailers in the United States focused exclusively on the &#8220;Integrated Auto Sales and Finance&#8221; segment of the used car market. References to the &#8220;Company&#8221; include the Company&#8217;s consolidated subsidiaries. The Company&#8217;s operations are principally conducted through its two operating subsidiaries, America&#8217;s Car Mart, Inc., an Arkansas corporation (&#8220;Car-Mart of Arkansas&#8221;), and Colonial Auto Finance, Inc., an Arkansas corporation (&#8220;Colonial&#8221;). Collectively, Car-Mart of Arkansas and Colonial are referred to herein as &#8220;Car-Mart.&#8221; The Company primarily sells older model used vehicles and provides financing for substantially all of its customers. Many of the Company&#8217;s customers have limited financial resources and would not qualify for conventional financing as a result of limited credit histories or past credit problems. As of April 30, 2016, the Company operated 143 dealerships located primarily in small cities throughout the South-Central United States.

&#160;

Business Strategy

&#160;

In general, it is the Company&#8217;s objective to continue to expand its business using the same business model that has been developed and used by Car-Mart for over 30 years. This business strategy focuses on:

&#160;

Collecting Customer Accounts. Collecting customer accounts is perhaps the single most important aspect of operating an Integrated Auto Sales and Finance used car business and is a focal point for dealership level and corporate office personnel on a daily basis. The Company measures and monitors the collection results of its dealerships using internally developed delinquency and account loss standards. Substantially all associate incentive compensation is tied directly or indirectly to collection results. Over the last five fiscal years, the Company&#8217;s annual credit losses as a percentage of sales have ranged from a low of 21.1% in fiscal 2012 to a high of 28.5% in fiscal 2016 (average of 25.1%). Fiscal 2015 credit losses as a percentage of sales were 25.5%. The fiscal 2016 annual credit losses as a percentage of sales were 27.6% excluding the effect of the increase in the allowance for credit losses made in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion.

&#160;

Maintaining a Decentralized Operation. The Company&#8217;s dealerships will continue to operate on a decentralized basis. Each dealership is ultimately responsible for buying (via an assigned corporate office purchasing agent) and selling its own vehicles, making credit decisions and collecting the contracts it originates in accordance with established policies and procedures. Most customers make their payments in person at one of the Company&#8217;s dealerships. This decentralized structure is complemented by the oversight and involvement of corporate office management and the maintenance of centralized financial controls, including monitoring proprietary credit scoring, establishing standards for down-payments and contract terms, and an internal compliance function.

&#160;

Expanding Through Controlled Organic Growth. The Company plans to continue to expand its operations by increasing revenues at existing dealerships and opening new dealerships. The Company will continue to view organic growth as its primary source for growth. The Company has made significant infrastructure investments during the last five years in order to improve performance of existing dealerships and to support growth of its dealership count. The Company ended fiscal 2016 with 143 locations, a net increase of two locations over the prior year-end, and intends to add new dealerships selectively in what it considers to be good, solid communities, subject to favorable operating performance. These plans, of course, are subject to change based on both internal and external factors.

&#160;

Selling Basic Transportation. The Company will continue to focus on selling basic and affordable transportation to its customers. The Company&#8217;s average retail sales price was $10,361 per unit in fiscal 2016. By selling vehicles at this price point, the Company is able to keep the terms of its installment sales contracts relatively short (overall portfolio weighted average of 31.6 months), while requiring relatively low payments.

&#160;

&#160;

Operating in Smaller Communities. The majority of the Company&#8217;s dealerships are located in cities and towns with a population of 50,000 or less. The Company believes that by operating in smaller communities it experiences better collection results. Further, the Company believes that operating costs, such as salaries, rent and advertising, are lower in smaller communities than in major metropolitan areas.

&#160;

Enhanced Management Talent and Experience. It has been the Company&#8217;s practice to try to hire honest and hardworking individuals to fill entry level positions, nurture and develop these associates, and attempt to fill the vast majority of its managerial positions from within the Company. By promoting from within, the Company believes it is able to train its associates in the Car-Mart way of doing business, maintain the Company&#8217;s unique culture and develop the loyalty of its associates by providing opportunity for advancement. The Company has recently focused, however, to a larger extent on looking outside of the Company for associates possessing requisite skills and who share the values and appreciate the unique culture the Company has developed over the years. The Company has been able to attract quality individuals via its Manager in Training Program as well as other key areas such as Human Resources, Purchasing, Collections, Information Technology, Legal, Compliance and Portfolio Analysis. Management has determined that it will be increasingly difficult to grow the Company without looking for outside talent. The Company&#8217;s operating success, as well as the challenging macro-economic environment, has positively affected recruitment of outside talent in recent years, and the Company currently expects this trend to continue.

&#160;

Cultivating Customer Relationships. The Company believes that developing and maintaining a relationship with its customers is critical to the success of the Company. A large percentage of sales at mature dealerships are made to repeat customers, and the Company estimates an additional 10% to 15% of sales result from customer referrals. By developing a personal relationship with its customers, the Company believes it is in a better position to assist a customer, and the customer is more likely to cooperate with the Company should the customer experience financial difficulty during the term of his or her installment contract. The Company is able to cultivate these relationships as the majority of its customers make their payments in person at one of the Company&#8217;s dealerships on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.

&#160;

Business Strengths

&#160;

The Company believes it possesses a number of strengths or advantages that distinguish it from most of its competitors. These business strengths include:

&#160;

Experienced and Motivated Management. The Company&#8217;s executive operating officers have significant experience in the industry and an average tenure of over 15 years. Several of Car-Mart&#8217;s dealership managers have been with the Company for more than 10 years. Each dealership manager is compensated, at least in part, based upon the net income of his or her dealership. A significant portion of the compensation of senior management is incentive based and tied to operating profits.

&#160;

Proven Business Practices. The Company&#8217;s operations are highly structured. While dealerships are operated on a decentralized basis, the Company has established policies, procedures and business practices for virtually every aspect of a dealership&#8217;s operations. Detailed online operating manuals are available to assist the dealership manager and office, sales and collections personnel in performing their daily tasks. As a result, each dealership is operated in a uniform manner. Further, corporate office personnel monitor the dealerships&#8217; operations through weekly visits and a number of daily, weekly and monthly communications and reports.

&#160;

Low Cost Operator. The Company has structured its dealership and corporate office operations to minimize operating costs. The number of associates employed at the dealership level is dictated by the number of active customer accounts each dealership services. Associate compensation is standardized for each dealership position. Other operating costs are closely monitored and scrutinized. Technology is utilized to maximize efficiency. The Company believes its operating costs as a percentage of revenues, and per unit sold, are among the lowest in the industry.

&#160;

&#160;

Well-Capitalized / Limited External Capital Required for Growth. As of April 30, 2016, the Company&#8217;s debt to equity ratio (Revolving credit facilities divided by Total equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet) was 0.47 to 1.0, which the Company believes is lower than many of its competitors. Further, the Company believes it can fund a significant amount of its planned growth from net income generated from operations. Of the external capital that will be needed to fund growth, the Company plans to draw on its existing credit facilities, or renewals or replacements of those facilities.

&#160;

Significant Expansion Opportunities. The Company generally targets smaller communities in which to locate its dealerships (i.e., populations from 20,000 to 50,000), but is also operating in larger cities such as Tulsa, Oklahoma; Lexington, Kentucky; Springfield, Missouri and Little Rock, Arkansas. The Company believes there are numerous suitable communities within the eleven states in which the Company currently operates and other contiguous states to satisfy anticipated dealership growth for the next several years. As previously discussed, the Company plans to continue to add new dealerships going forward depending upon operational success. Existing dealerships will continue to be analyzed to ensure that they are producing desired results and have potential to provide adequate returns on invested capital.

&#160;

Operations

&#160;

Operating Segment. Each dealership is an operating segment with its results regularly reviewed by the Company&#8217;s chief operating decision maker in an effort to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. Individual dealerships meet the aggregation criteria for reporting purposes under the current accounting guidance. The Company operates in the Integrated Auto Sales and Finance segment of the used car market. In this industry, the nature of the sale and the financing of the transaction, financing processes, the type of customer and the methods used to distribute the Company&#8217;s products and services, including the actual servicing of the contracts as well as the regulatory environment in which the Company operates, all have similar characteristics. Each of our individual dealerships is similar in nature and only engages in the selling and financing of used vehicles. All individual dealerships have similar operating characteristics. As such, individual dealerships have been aggregated into one reportable segment.

&#160; 

Dealership Organization. Dealerships are operated on a decentralized basis. Each dealership is responsible for buying (with the assistance of a corporate office buyer) and selling vehicles, making credit decisions, and servicing and collecting the installment contracts it originates. Dealerships also maintain their own records and make daily deposits. Dealership-level financial statements are prepared by the corporate office on a monthly basis. Depending on the number of active customer accounts, a dealership may have as few as three or as many as 28 full-time associates employed at that location. Associate positions at a large dealership may include a dealership manager, assistant dealership manager, manager trainee, office manager, assistant office manager, service manager, buyer, collections personnel, salesmen and dealership attendants. Dealerships are generally open Monday through Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The Company has both regular and satellite dealerships. Satellite dealerships are similar to regular dealerships, except that they tend to be smaller and sell fewer vehicles.

&#160;

Below is a summary of dealership locations by state as of April 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; As of April 30, Dealerships by State &#160; 2016 &#160; 2015 &#160; 2014 Arkansas &#160; &#160; 37 &#160; &#160; &#160; 38 &#160; &#160; &#160; 38 &#160; Oklahoma &#160; &#160; 25 &#160; &#160; &#160; 26 &#160; &#160; &#160; 24 &#160; Missouri &#160; &#160; 19 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; &#160; &#160; 18 &#160; Alabama &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; &#160; 15 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; Texas &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; &#160; &#160; 14 &#160; Kentucky &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; &#160; 12 &#160; &#160; &#160; 11 &#160; Georgia &#160; &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4 &#160; Tennessee &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 6 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; Mississippi &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; Indiana &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; Iowa &#160; &#160; 1 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; 0 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; &#160; 143 &#160; &#160; &#160; 141 &#160; &#160; &#160; 134 &#160; 

&#160;

Dealerships are typically located in smaller communities. As of April 30, 2016, approximately 75% of the Company&#8217;s dealerships were located in cities with populations of less than 50,000. Dealerships are located on leased or owned property between one and three acres in size. When opening a new dealership, the Company will typically use an existing structure on the property to conduct business, or purchase a modular facility while business at the new location develops. Dealership facilities typically range in size from 1,500 to 5,000 square feet.

&#160;

Purchasing. The Company purchases vehicles primarily from wholesalers, new car dealers, individuals and auctions. The majority of vehicle purchasing is performed by the Company&#8217;s buyers, although dealership managers are authorized to purchase vehicles as needed. A buyer will purchase vehicles for one to four dealerships depending on the size of the dealerships. Buyers report to the dealership manager, or managers, for whom they make purchases, and to a regional purchasing director. The regional purchasing directors report to the Director of Purchasing. The Company centrally monitors the quantity and quality of vehicles purchased and continuously compares the cost of vehicles purchased to outside valuation sources and holds responsible parties accountable for results.

&#160;

Generally, the Company&#8217;s buyers purchase vehicles between six and 12 years of age with 90,000 to 140,000 miles, and pay between $3,000 and $7,000 per vehicle. The Company focuses on providing basic transportation to its customers. The Company generally does not purchase sports cars or luxury cars. Some of the more popular vehicles the Company sells include the Chevrolet Impala, Chevrolet Malibu, Chrysler 300, Ford Taurus, Ford Fusion, Dodge Ram Pickup, Ford Explorer and the Ford F-150 Pickup. The Company sells a significant number of trucks and sport utility vehicles. The Company&#8217;s buyers inspect and test-drive almost every vehicle they purchase. Buyers attempt to purchase vehicles that require little or no repair as the Company has limited facilities to repair or recondition vehicles.

&#160;

Selling, Marketing and Advertising. Dealerships generally maintain an inventory of 25 to 75 vehicles depending on the maturity of the dealership and the time of the year. Inventory turns over approximately 9 to 10 times each year. Selling is done principally by the dealership manager, assistant manager, manager trainee or sales associate. Sales associates are paid a commission for sales that they make in addition to an hourly wage. Sales are made on an &#8220;as is&#8221; basis; however, customers are given an option to purchase a service contract which covers certain vehicle components and assemblies. For covered components and assemblies, the Company coordinates service with third party service centers with which the Company typically has previously negotiated labor rates and mark-up percentages on parts. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s customers elect to purchase a service contract when purchasing a vehicle. Additionally, the Company offers its customers to whom financing is extended a payment protection plan product. This product contractually obligates the Company to cancel the remaining amount owed on a contract where the vehicle has been totaled, as defined in the plan, or the vehicle has been stolen. This product is available in most of the states in which the Company operates and substantially all financed customers elect to purchase this product when purchasing a vehicle in those states.

&#160;

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s objective is to offer its customers basic transportation at a fair price and treat each customer in such a manner as to earn his or her repeat business. The Company attempts to build a positive reputation in each community where it operates and generate new business from such reputation as well as from customer referrals. The Company estimates that approximately 10% to 15% of the Company&#8217;s sales result from customer referrals. The Company recognizes repeat customers with silver, gold and platinum plaques representing the purchase of 5, 10 and 15 vehicles, respectively. These plaques are prominently displayed at the dealership where the vehicles were purchased. For mature dealerships, a large percentage of sales are to repeat customers.

&#160;

The Company primarily advertises in local newspapers, on the radio, on television and on the internet. In addition, the Company periodically conducts promotional sales campaigns in order to increase sales.

&#160;

Underwriting and Finance. The Company provides financing to substantially all of its customers who purchase a vehicle at one of its dealerships. The Company only provides financing to its customers for the purchase of its vehicles, and the Company does not provide any type of financing to non-customers. The Company&#8217;s installment sales contracts as of April 30, 2016 typically include down payments ranging from 0% to 17% (average of 7%), terms ranging from 18 months to 42 months (average of 31.6 months), and a fixed annual interest rate of 15% (weighted average of 14.9%). Subsequent to year-end, in May 2016 the Company increased its retail installment sales contract interest rate from 15.0% to 16.5% in response to continued high levels of credit losses.

&#160;

The Company requires that payments be made on a weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly basis, scheduled to coincide with the day the customer is paid by his or her employer. Upon the customer and the Company reaching a preliminary agreement as to financing terms, the Company obtains a credit application from the customer which includes information regarding employment, residence and credit history, personal references and a detailed budget itemizing the customer&#8217;s monthly income and expenses. Certain information is then verified by Company personnel. After the verification process, the dealership manager makes the decision to accept, reject or modify (perhaps obtain a greater down payment or suggest a lower priced vehicle) the proposed transaction. In general, the dealership manager attempts to assess the stability and character of the applicant. The dealership manager who makes the credit decision is ultimately responsible for collecting the contract, and his or her compensation is directly related to the collection results of his or her dealership. The Company provides centralized support to the dealership manager in the form of a proprietary credit scoring system used for monitoring and other supervisory assistance to assist with the credit decision. Credit quality is monitored centrally by corporate office personnel on a daily, weekly and monthly basis.

&#160;

Collections. All of the Company&#8217;s retail installment contracts are serviced by Company personnel at the dealership level. A majority of the Company&#8217;s customers make their payments in person at the dealership where they purchased their vehicle; however, in an effort to make paying convenient for its customers, the Company offers a variety of payment options. Customers can send their payments through the mail, set up ACH auto draft, make mobile and online payments, and make payments at certain money service centers. Each dealership closely monitors its customer accounts using the Company&#8217;s proprietary receivables and collections software that stratifies past due accounts by the number of days past due. The vice presidents of operations and the area operations managers routinely review and monitor the status of customer collections to ensure collection activities are conducted in compliance with applicable policies and procedures. In addition, the Support Operations Officer oversees the collections department and provides timely oversight and additional accountability on a consistent basis. The Company also has a Director of Collection Services who assists with managing the Company&#8217;s servicing and collections practices and provides additional monitoring and training. The Company believes that the timely response to past due accounts is critical to its collections success.

&#160;

&#160;

The Company has established standards with respect to the percentage of accounts one and two weeks past due, 15 or more days past due and 30 or more days past due (delinquency standards), and the percentage of accounts where the vehicle was repossessed or the account was charged off that month (account loss standard).

&#160;

The Company works very hard to keep its delinquency percentages low and not to repossess vehicles. Accounts two days late are sent a notice in the mail. Accounts three days late are contacted by telephone. Notes from each telephone contact are electronically maintained in the Company&#8217;s computer system. The Company attempts to resolve payment delinquencies amicably prior to repossessing a vehicle. If a customer becomes severely delinquent in his or her payments, and management determines that timely collection of future payments is not probable, the Company will take steps to repossess the vehicle. Periodically, the Company enters into contract modifications with its customers to extend or modify the payment terms. The Company only enters into a contract modification or extension if it believes such action will increase the amount of monies the Company will ultimately realize on the customer&#8217;s account and will increase the likelihood of the customer being able to pay off the vehicle contract. At the time of modification, the Company expects to collect amounts due including accrued interest at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay. Other than the extension of time, concessions are not granted to customers at the time of modification. Modifications are minor and are made for pay day changes, minor vehicle repairs and other reasons. For those vehicles that are repossessed, the majority are returned or surrendered by the customer on a voluntary basis. Other repossessions are performed by Company personnel or third party repossession agents. Depending on the condition of a repossessed vehicle, it is either resold on a retail basis through a Company dealership or sold for cash on a wholesale basis, primarily through physical or online auctions.

&#160; 

New Dealership Openings. Senior management, with the assistance of the corporate office staff, will make decisions with respect to the communities in which to locate a new dealership and the specific sites within those communities. New dealerships have historically been located in the general proximity of existing dealerships to facilitate the corporate office&#8217;s oversight of the Company&#8217;s dealerships. The Company currently intends to add new dealerships selectively in what it considers to be good, solid communities, subject to favorable operating performance.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s approach with respect to new dealership openings has been one of gradual development. The manager in charge of a new dealership is normally a recently promoted associate who was an assistant manager at a larger dealership and in most cases participated in the formal manager-in-training program. The corporate office provides significant resources and support with pre-opening and initial operations of new dealerships. The facility may be of a modular nature or an existing structure. Historically, new dealerships have operated with a low level of inventory and personnel. As a result of the modest staffing level, the new dealership manager performs a variety of duties (i.e., selling, collecting and administrative tasks) during the early stages of his or her dealership&#8217;s operations. As the dealership develops and the customer base grows, additional staff is hired.

&#160;

Monthly sales levels at new dealerships are typically substantially less than sales levels at mature dealerships. Over time, new dealerships gain recognition in their communities, and a combination of customer referrals and repeat business generally facilitates sales growth. Historically, sales growth at new dealerships could exceed 10% per year for a number of years, whereas mature dealerships typically experience annual sales growth but at a lower percentage than new dealerships. Due to continual operational initiatives, the Company is able to support higher sales levels, and recently the Company has raised its volume expectation level of new locations somewhat as infrastructure improvements related to new dealership openings have improved.

&#160;

New dealerships are generally provided with approximately $1.5 million to $2.5 million in capital from the corporate office during the first few years of operation. These funds are used principally to fund receivables growth. After this start-up period, new dealerships can typically begin generating positive cash flow, allowing for some continuing growth in receivables without additional capital from the corporate office. As these dealerships become cash flow positive, a decision is made by senior management to either increase the investment due to favorable return rates on the invested capital, or to deploy capital elsewhere. This limitation of capital to new, as well as existing, dealerships serves as an important operating discipline. Dealerships must be profitable in order to grow and typically new dealerships are profitable within the first year of opening.

&#160;

&#160;

Corporate Office Oversight and Management. The corporate office, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, consists of area operations managers, regional vice presidents, regional purchasing directors, a purchasing director, a sales director, a director of collection services, a support operations officer, a director of audit and compliance and compliance auditors, a director of human resources, associate and management development personnel, accounting and management information systems personnel, administrative personnel and senior management. The corporate office monitors and oversees dealership operations. The corporate office receives operating and financial information and reports on each dealership on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. This information includes cash receipts and disbursements, inventory and receivables levels and statistics, receivables agings and sales and account loss data. The corporate office uses this information to compile Company-wide reports, plan dealership visits and prepare monthly financial statements.

&#160;

Periodically, area operations managers, regional vice presidents, compliance auditors and senior management visit the Company&#8217;s dealerships to inspect, review and comment on operations. The corporate office assists in training new managers and other dealership level associates. Compliance auditors visit dealerships to ensure policies and procedures are being followed and that the Company&#8217;s assets are being safe-guarded. In addition to financial results, the corporate office uses delinquency and account loss standards and a point system to evaluate a dealership&#8217;s performance. Also, bankrupt and legal action accounts and other accounts that have been written off at dealerships are handled by the corporate office in an effort to allow dealership personnel time to focus on more current accounts.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s dealership managers meet monthly on an area, regional or Company-wide basis. At these meetings, corporate office personnel provide training and recognize achievements of dealership managers. Near the end of every fiscal year, the respective area operations manager, regional vice president and senior management conduct &#8220;projection&#8221; meetings with each dealership manager. At these meetings, the year&#8217;s results are reviewed and ranked relative to other dealerships, and both quantitative and qualitative goals are established for the upcoming year. The qualitative goals may focus on staff development, effective delegation, and leadership and organization skills. Quantitatively, the Company establishes unit sales goals and profit goals based on invested capital and, depending on the circumstances, may establish delinquency, account loss or expense goals.

&#160;

The corporate office is also responsible for establishing policy, maintaining the Company&#8217;s management information systems, conducting compliance audits, orchestrating new dealership openings and setting the strategic direction for the Company.

&#160;

Industry 

&#160;

Used Car Sales. The market for used car sales in the United States is significant. Used car retail sales typically occur through franchised new car dealerships that sell used cars or independent used car dealerships. The Company operates in the Integrated Auto Sales and Finance segment of the independent used car sales and finance market. Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers sell and finance used cars to individuals with limited credit histories or past credit problems. Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers typically offer their customers certain advantages over more traditional financing sources, such as less restrictive underwriting guidelines, flexible payment terms (including scheduling payments on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to coincide with a customer&#8217;s payday), and the ability to make payments in person, an important feature to individuals who may not have a checking account.

&#160;

&#160;

Used Car Financing. The used automobile financing industry is served by traditional lending sources such as banks, savings and loans, and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, as well as by independent finance companies and Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers. Many loans that flow through the more traditional sources have historically ended up packaged in the securitization markets. Despite significant opportunities, many of the traditional lending sources have not historically been consistent in providing financing to individuals with limited credit histories or past credit problems. Management believes traditional lenders have historically avoided this market because of its high credit risk and the associated collections efforts. Management believes that there was constriction in the financing sources that existed for the deep sub-prime automobile market after the financial crisis in 2008. Since the Company does not rely on securitizations as a financing source, it was largely unaffected by the credit constrictions during the crisis and was able to continue to grow its revenue level and receivable base. More recently, funding for the deep subprime automobile market has increased significantly. Management attributes the increase to the ultra-low interest rate environment combined with the historical credit performance of the used automobile financing market during and after the recession. Management expects the availability of consumer credit within the automotive industry to continue to be higher over the near and mid- term when compared to recent history . 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The used automotive retail industry is fragmented and highly competitive. The Company competes principally with other independent Integrated Auto Sales and Finance dealers, as well as with (i) the used vehicle retail operations of franchised automobile dealerships, (ii) independent used vehicle dealers, and (iii) individuals who sell used vehicles in private transactions. The Company competes for both the purchase and resale of used vehicles. The increased funding to the used automobile industry has led to increased competitive pressures which have been the primary contributors to the Company&#8217;s decision in recent periods to allow longer term lengths and slightly lower down payments in connection with our customer financing contracts, as well as to the higher charge-off levels experienced by the Company in recent periods.

&#160;

Management believes the principal competitive factors in the sale of its used vehicles include (i) the availability of financing to consumers with limited credit histories or past credit problems, (ii) the breadth and quality of vehicle selection, (iii) pricing, (iv) the convenience of a dealership&#8217;s location, (v) the option to purchase a service contract and a payment protection plan, and (vi) customer service. Management believes that its dealerships are not only competitive in each of these areas, but have some distinct advantages. The Company&#8217;s local face-to-face presence allows it to serve customers at a higher level by forming strong personal relationships.

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Historically, the Company&#8217;s third fiscal quarter (November through January) has been the slowest period for vehicle sales. Conversely, the Company&#8217;s first and fourth fiscal quarters (May through July and February through April) have historically been the busiest times for vehicle sales. Therefore, the Company generally realizes a higher proportion of its revenue and operating profit during the first and fourth fiscal quarters. Tax refund anticipation sales efforts during the Company&#8217;s third fiscal quarter have increased sales levels during the third fiscal quarter in some past years; however, due to the timing of actual tax refund dollars in the Company&#8217;s markets, these sales and collections have primarily occurred in the fourth quarter in each of the last four fiscal years. The Company expects this pattern to continue in future years.

&#160;

If conditions arise that impair vehicle sales during the first, third or fourth fiscal quarters, the adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s revenues and operating results for the year could be disproportionately large.

&#160;

Regulation and Licensing 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations pertaining to the sale and financing of vehicles. Under various state laws, the Company&#8217;s dealerships must obtain a license in order to operate or relocate. These laws also regulate advertising and sales practices. The Company&#8217;s financing activities are subject to federal laws such as truth-in-lending and equal credit opportunity laws and regulations as well as state and local motor vehicle finance laws, installment finance laws, usury laws and other installment sales laws. Among other things, these laws require that the Company limit or prescribe terms of the contracts it originates, require specified disclosures to customers, restrict collections practices, limit the Company&#8217;s right to repossess and sell collateral, and prohibit discrimination against customers on the basis of certain characteristics including age, race, gender and marital status.

&#160;

&#160;

The states in which the Company operates impose limits on interest rates the Company can charge on its installment contracts. These limits have generally been based on either (i) a specified margin above the federal primary credit rate, (ii) the age of the vehicle, or (iii) a fixed rate. Management believes the Company is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations; however, the adoption of additional laws, changes in the interpretation of existing laws, or the Company&#8217;s entrance into jurisdictions with more stringent regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s used vehicle sales and finance business.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of April 30, 2016, the Company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, employed approximately 1,420 full time associates. None of the Company's employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the Company believes that its relations with its employees are good.
