 Item 1. Business 

Business Description 

Och-Ziff is a leading global institutional alternative asset manager, with approximately $43.7 billion &#32;in assets under management as of February 1, 2016 . We provide asset management services through our funds, which pursue a broad range of global investment opportunities, and by developing new, carefully considered investment products. We also offer customized solutions within and across our product platforms to help our fund investors meet their investment objectives. Our funds invest across numerous asset classes and geographies, with a breadth we believe is offered by few alternative asset management firms. 

Our approach to asset management is based on the same fundamental elements that we have employed since Och-Ziff was founded in 1994. Our objectives are to create long-term value for our fund investors through a disciplined investment philosophy that focuses on delivering consistent, positive, risk-adjusted returns across market cycles. Our extensive experience, combined with the consistency of our approach to investing and managing risk, have been integral to the growth of our assets under management. We currently manage multi-strategy, dedicated credit and real estate funds and other alternative investment vehicles. 

Multi-Strategy - Our multi-strategy funds combine global investment strategies, including long/short equity special situations, structured credit, corporate credit, convertible and derivative arbitrage, merger arbitrage and private investments. Our focus is on investing in value opportunities based on detailed, research-based analysis and thorough due diligence. Our multi-strategy funds allocate capital across strategies and geographies opportunistically based on market conditions and opportunities, with no predetermined capital allocations by strategy or asset class. 

Credit &#32;- Our dedicated credit funds are comprised of opportunistic credit funds and our Institutional Credit Strategies products. Our opportunistic credit funds seek to generate risk-adjusted returns by capturing value in mispriced investments across disrupted, dislocated and distressed corporate, structured and private credit markets globally. Institutional Credit Strategies is our asset management platform that invests in performing credits via CLOs and other customized solutions for clients. 

Real Estate &#32;- Our real estate funds generally make investments in commercial and residential real estate, including real property, multi-property portfolios, real estate-related joint ventures, real estate operating companies and other real estate-related assets. These funds typically seek to preserve capital and mitigate risk by limiting competitive bidding. The real estate funds focus on proprietary sourcing, discretion in deal selection, thorough due diligence, intensive asset management, multiple defined exit strategies and structured downside protection to seek and manage investments. 

We have built an experienced investment management team with a well-established presence in the United States, Europe and Asia. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 659 &#32;employees worldwide, including 181 &#32;investment professionals, 22 &#32;active executive managing directors and 81 &#32;managing directors working from our offices in New York, London, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Beijing, Dubai, Shanghai and Houston. Our New York office was established in 1994 and has been operational for over 20 years. Our London office, established in 1998, houses our European investment team. Our Hong Kong office, established in 2001, houses the majority of our Asian investment team. See &#8220;&#8212;Employees&#8221; for additional information on our global headcount. 

We currently have two operating segments: the Och-Ziff Funds segment and our real estate business. The Och-Ziff Funds segment is currently our only reportable operating segment under GAAP and provides asset management services to our multi-strategy funds, dedicated credit funds and other alternative investment vehicles. Our real estate business, which provides asset management services to our real estate funds, is included within Other Operations, as it does not meet the threshold of a reportable operating segment under GAAP . See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for additional information regarding the Och-Ziff Funds segment. 

Our primary sources of revenues are management fees, which are based on the amount of our assets under management, and incentive income, which is based on the investment performance of our funds. Accordingly, for any given 

period, our revenues will be driven by the combination of assets under management and the investment performance of our funds. 

Our Assets Under Management 

Our assets under management are a function of the capital that is allocated to us by the investors in our funds and the investment performance of our funds. Over the last ten years, we have increased our total assets under management at a compound annual growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) of 11% &#32;to $45.5 billion &#32;as of December 31, 2015 . 

For additional information regarding assets under management, please see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Assets Under Management and Fund Performance Information.&#8221; 

Overview of Our Funds 

Multi-Strategy 

As of December 31, 2015 , we managed approximately $29.5 billion &#32;of assets under management in our multi-strategy funds, or 65% &#32;of our total assets under management. The portfolio composition of our multi-strategy funds is determined by evaluating what we believe are the best market opportunities for each fund, consistent with each fund&#8217;s goal of generating consistent, positive, risk-adjusted returns while protecting fund investor capital. The primary investment strategies we employ in our multi-strategy funds include the following: 

&#8226; 

Long/short equity special situations , &#32; which consists of fundamental long/short and event-driven investing. Fundamental long/short investing involves analyzing companies and assets to profit where we believe mispricing or undervaluation exists. Event-driven investing attempts to realize gain from corporate events such as spin-offs, recapitalizations and other corporate restructurings, whether company specific or due to industry or economic conditions. 

&#8226; 

Structured credit , which involves investments in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities. This strategy also includes investments in collateralized loan obligations and collateralized debt obligations. 

&#8226; 

Corporate credit , which includes a variety of credit-based strategies, such as high-yield debt investments in distressed businesses and investments in bank loans and senior secured debt. Corporate credit also includes providing mezzanine financing and structuring creative capital solutions. 

&#8226; 

Convertible and derivative arbitrage , &#32; which takes advantage of price discrepancies between convertible and derivative securities and the underlying equity or other security. These investments may be made at multiple levels of an entity&#8217;s capital structure to profit from valuation or other pricing discrepancies. This strategy also includes volatility trades in equities, interest rates, currencies and commodities. 

&#8226; 

Merger arbitrage , which is an event-driven strategy involving multiple investments in entities contemplating a merger or similar business combination. This strategy seeks to realize a profit from pricing discrepancies among the securities of the entities involved in the event. 

&#8226; 

Private investments , which encompasses investments in a variety of special situations that seek to realize value through strategic sales or initial public offerings. 

The OZ Master Fund, our global multi-strategy fund, opportunistically allocates capital between our investment strategies in North America, Europe and Asia based on market conditions and attractive investment opportunities. The OZ Master Fund generally employs every strategy and geography in which our funds invest and constituted approximately 53% &#32;of our assets under management as of December 31, 2015 . Our other funds implement geographical- or strategy-focused investment programs. The investment performance for our other funds may vary from those of the OZ Master Fund, and that variance may be material. 

The chart below presents the composition, by strategy (excluding residual assets attributable to redeeming investors), of the OZ Master Fund as of January 1, 2016 : 

The table below sets forth, as of December 31, 2015 , the net annualized return, volatility and Sharpe Ratio of the OZ Master Fund, the Och-Ziff Multi-Strategy Composite (as defined below), the S&#38;P 500 Index and the MSCI World Index. This table is provided for illustrative purposes only. The performance reflected in the table below is not necessarily indicative of the future results of the OZ Master Fund. There can be no assurance that any Och-Ziff fund will achieve comparable results. An investment in our Class A Shares is not an investment in any of our funds. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our 

Business&#8212;An investment in our Class A Shares is not an alternative to an investment in any of our funds, and the returns of our funds should not be considered as indicative of any returns expected on our Class A Shares, although poor investment performance of, or lack of capital flows into, the funds we manage could have a materially adverse impact on our revenues and, therefore, the returns on our Class A Shares.&#8221; 

Past performance is no indication or guarantee of future results.

_______________ 

(1) 

The returns shown represent the composite performance of all feeder funds that comprise the OZ Master Fund since the inception of the OZ Master Fund on January 1, 1998 (collectively, the &#8220;OZ Master Fund Composite&#8221;). The OZ Master Fund Composite is calculated using the total return of all feeder funds net of all fees and expenses, except incentive income on Special Investments that could reduce returns on these investments at the time of realization, and includes the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. Performance includes realized and unrealized gains and losses attributable to Special Investments and initial public offering investments that are not allocated to all investors in the feeder funds. Investors that were not allocated Special Investments and/or initial public offering investments may experience materially different returns. The OZ Master Fund Composite is not available for direct investment. 

(2) 

The Och-Ziff Multi-Strategy Composite is provided as supplemental information to the OZ Master Fund Composite. The Och-Ziff Multi-Strategy Composite represents the composite performance of all accounts that were managed in accordance with our broad multi-strategy mandate that were not subject to portfolio investment restrictions or other factors that limited our investment discretion since our inception on April 1, 1994. Performance is calculated using the total return of all such accounts net of all investment fees and expenses of such accounts, except incentive income on unrealized gains attributable to Special Investments that could reduce returns in these investments at the time of realization, and the returns include the reinvestment of all dividends and other income. For the period from April 1, 1994 through December 31, 1997, the returns are gross of certain overhead expenses that were reimbursed by the accounts. Such reimbursement arrangements were terminated at the inception of the OZ Master Fund on January 1, 1998. The size of the accounts comprising the composite during the time period shown vary materially. Such differences impacted our investment decisions and the diversity of the investment strategies we followed. Furthermore, the composition of the investment strategies we follow is subject to our discretion and has varied materially since inception and is expected to vary materially in the future. 

(3) 

These comparisons show the returns of the S&#38;P 500 Index (SPTR) and the MSCI World Index (GDDLWI) (collectively, the &#8220;Broader Market Indices&#8221;) against the OZ Master Fund Composite and the Och-Ziff Multi-Strategy Composite. These comparisons are intended solely for illustrative purposes to show a historical comparison of the OZ Master Fund Composite and the Och-Ziff Multi-Strategy Composite to the broader equity markets, as represented by the Broader Market Indices, and should not be considered as an indication of how the OZ Master Fund or the feeder funds will perform relative to the Broader Market Indices in the future. The Broader Market Indices are not performance benchmarks of the OZ Master Fund or the feeder funds. Neither the OZ Master Fund nor the feeder funds are managed to correlate in any way with the returns or composition of the Broader Market Indices, which are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest in an unmanaged index. You should not assume that there is any material overlap between the securities underlying the OZ Master Fund Composite or the Och-Ziff Multi-Strategy Composite and those that comprise the Broader Market Indices. The S&#38;P 500 Index is an equity index owned and maintained by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s, a division of McGraw-Hill, whose value is calculated as the free float-weighted average of the share prices of 500 large-capitalization corporations listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ. The MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index owned and maintained by MSCI Inc. that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. Returns of the Broader Market Indices have not been reduced by fees and expenses associated with investing in securities and include the reinvestment of dividends. 

(4) 

Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of volatility that measures the fluctuation of the monthly rates of return against the average return. 

(5) 

Sharpe Ratio represents a measure of the excess return of a portfolio over the risk-free rate. The Sharpe Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the composite returns, and dividing that amount by the standard deviation of the returns. The risk-free rate of return used in computing the Sharpe Ratio is the one-month U.S. dollar London Interbank Offered Rate compounded monthly throughout the periods presented. 

Credit 

As of December 31, 2015 , we managed approximately $12.6 billion &#32;of assets under management in our dedicated credit funds, or 28% &#32;of our total assets under management. Our dedicated credit funds are comprised of our opportunistic credit funds and our Institutional Credit Strategies products. 

Opportunistic Credit Funds 

As of December 31, 2015 , we managed approximately $5.4 billion &#32;of assets under management in our opportunistic credit funds. Our opportunistic credit funds seek to generate risk-adjusted returns by capturing value in mispriced investments across disrupted, dislocated and distressed corporate, structured and private credit markets globally. As of December 31, 2015 , assets under management in the OZ Credit Opportunities Master Fund, our global opportunistic credit fund, totaled $1.5 billion . The remainder of the assets under management in our opportunistic credit funds was comprised of various open-end and closed-end funds, as well as customized solutions structured to meet our fund investors&#8217; needs. 

Institutional Credit Strategies 

As of December 31, 2015 , we managed approximately $7.2 billion &#32;of assets under management in our Institutional Credit Strategies products. Institutional Credit Strategies is our asset management platform that invests in performing credits, including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, private credit/bespoke financing and investment grade credit via CLOs and other customized solutions for clients. 

Real Estate 

As of December 31, 2015 , we managed approximately $2.0 billion &#32;of assets under management in our real estate funds, or 5% &#32;of our total assets under management. Our real estate funds employ a situation-specific, opportunistic investment strategy, combined with a disciplined risk assessment process. These funds seek to diversify investments across geography, asset types and transaction structures to actively balance the portfolios within each of the funds. 

Other 

Our other assets under management are comprised of funds that are generally strategy-specific, including our equity funds and other dedicated strategy funds. Our equity funds&#8217; investment objective is to achieve consistent, absolute returns with low volatility primarily by seeking to exploit pricing inefficiencies in equity securities. Investment strategies include, but may not be limited to, merger arbitrage and long/short equity special situations. 

Diversification of Assets Under Management 

We continue to pursue a strategy of diversifying our assets under management primarily by expanding our fund offerings in dedicated credit, real estate and other strategy-specific funds (collectively, &#8220;Dedicated Strategy Funds&#8221;). As of December 31, 2015 , these assets under management totaled $16.0 billion , or 35% &#32;of our total assets under management, compared with $1.4 billion , or 5% , five years ago. We believe that we are well positioned to continue to increase the diversification of our asset base through the growth of these products. Diversifying the mix of our assets under management should also enable us, over time, to recognize a greater proportion of our incentive income throughout the year rather than earning substantially all of it in the fourth quarter. 

As we have continued to diversify the type of funds we offer, we have also increased the amount of our longer-term assets under management. Over the last five years, our longer-term assets under management, which are those subject to initial commitment periods of three years or longer, have increased from approximately 13% &#32;to 37% &#32;of our total assets under management as of December 31, 2015 . Our longer-term assets under management are comprised of a portion of the capital invested in the OZ Master Fund and certain other multi-strategy funds, as well as the majority of the capital in our Dedicated Strategy Funds. For additional information regarding longer-term assets under management, please see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Longer-Term Assets Under Management.&#8221; 

Investment and Risk Management Process 

Our extensive investment experience, combined with the consistency of our approach to investing and risk management, has been integral to extending our performance history. Risk management is central to the investment process in all of our funds and the operations of our business. Our investment and risk management processes benefit from our dedicated and experienced investment teams operating out of our offices worldwide. 

Our approach to investing and managing risk is defined by certain common elements: 

&#8226; 

Proactive risk management with a focus on risk-adjusted returns. &#32;&#32;Our risk management practices are at the core of our investment philosophy, playing a crucial role in the asset allocation within our funds and in the operation of our business. Quantitative and qualitative analyses are utilized at both the individual position and total portfolio levels, and they have been integrated into our daily investment process. Our portfolio managers adhere to a research-driven, bottom-up approach to identifying and managing investments, using strong in-house investment and risk control teams. We employ a disciplined process to evaluate the risk-adjusted return on capital from existing and new investments. 

&#8226; 

Preservation of capital. &#32;&#32;Preservation of capital is our top priority and critical to delivering attractive returns to fund investors. Our goal is to preserve capital during periods of market decline and generate competitive investment performance in rising markets. We use sophisticated risk analysis and active portfolio management to limit exposure to market and other risks across all strategies. We generally limit the use of leverage for most of our funds, and are disciplined and patient when entering new markets. 

&#8226; 

Dynamic capital allocation. &#32;&#32;We allocate capital dynamically across strategies and geographies, consistent with the investment objectives for each of our funds. Opportunities and market conditions determine portfolio composition rather than predetermined capital allocations by assets class or strategy, while at the same time we maintain an active focus on portfolio diversification and risk management. 

&#8226; 

Expertise across strategies and geographies. &#32;&#32;We leverage our capital allocation philosophy and investment expertise across capital structures, industries and geographies to anticipate, identify and capitalize on investment trends across multiple disciplines. We have fostered a culture that allows us to allocate capital and evaluate investment opportunities on a firm-wide basis, focusing on the best ideas and opportunities available. 

Our Fund Investors 

We focus on developing and maintaining long-term relationships with a global base of institutional investors, which includes many of the largest, most sophisticated investors in the world. We currently have over 1,400 &#32;investors in our funds, including pension funds, private banks, corporates and other institutions, fund-of-funds, foundations and endowments, and family offices and individuals. Our investors value our funds&#8217; consistent performance history, our global investing expertise, our diverse investment strategies and our ability to develop investment capabilities in areas where we see opportunities evolve. As a result, a number of our fund investors invest in more than one of our funds. 

Investments by our executive managing directors and employees collectively comprised approximately 7% &#32;of our total assets under management as of January 1, 2016 . The single largest unaffiliated investor in our funds accounted for approximately 8% &#32;of our total assets under management as of January 1, 2016 , and the top five unaffiliated fund investors accounted for approximately 23% . Approximately 26% &#32;of our investors were from outside North America as of January 1, 2016 . These percentages, as well as those presented in the chart below, exclude assets under management in our CLOs, which are held by various types of investors. 

The following chart presents the composition of our fund investors by type across our funds as of January 1, 2016 : 

Competitive Environment 

The asset management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect that it will remain so. We compete globally and regionally with other investment managers, including hedge funds, public and private investment firms, distressed debt funds, mezzanine funds and other CLO issuers, real estate development companies, business development companies, investment banks and other financial institutions worldwide. We compete for both investors in our funds and attractive investment opportunities 

based on a number of factors, including investment performance, brand recognition, business reputation, pricing, innovation, the quality of services we provide to the investors in our funds, the range of products we offer, and our ability to attract and retain qualified professionals in all aspects of our business while managing our operating costs. We face competitors that are larger than we are and have greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Certain of our competitors may continue to raise capital to pursue investment strategies that may be similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances or make different risk assessments than we do, or may have lower return thresholds, allowing them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish broader networks of business relationships. They may also be subject to different regulatory requirements, which may give them greater flexibility to pursue investment opportunities or attract new capital to their funds. For additional information regarding the competitive risks that we face, see &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Competitive pressures in the asset management business could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.&#8221; 

Competitive Strengths 

Our business was built on certain fundamental elements that we believe are differentiating competitive strengths. They continue to define Och-Ziff today. As such, we view these elements as important to our ability to retain and attract new assets under management and, over time, increase our market share of new capital flows to the alternative asset management industry. 

&#8226; 

Alignment of interests. We structure our business to align our executive managing directors&#8217; and employees&#8217; interests with those of the investors in our funds and our Class A Shareholders. Investments by our executive managing directors, employees and certain other related parties in our funds collectively comprised approximately $2.6 billion &#32;of our total assets under management as of January 1, 2016 . Additionally, our executive managing directors have a 62.2% &#32;direct equity ownership interest in the firm and receive distributions that are directly tied to the firm&#8217;s profitability. Our 81 &#32;managing directors have a compensation structure that includes receiving a portion of any bonus compensation in equity that vests over time. 

&#8226; 

One-firm philosophy. Our &#8220;one-firm&#8221; philosophy creates a collaborative environment that encourages internal cooperation and the sharing of information, industry expertise and transaction experience gained over our history spanning over 20 years. We are a global organization and have fostered a culture that allows us to allocate capital and evaluate investment opportunities on a firm-wide basis, focusing on the best ideas and opportunities available. This collaborative approach emphasizes the success of our firm as a whole. 

&#8226; 

Synergies among investment strategies. Our funds invest across a broad range of asset classes and geographies. Our investment professionals have extensive experience and many are specialized by strategy, industry sector or asset class. Our one-firm culture and collaborative approach encourage investment professionals to leverage the experience of our global investment teams across strategies and geographies. This creates synergies that add to our market insight, enhance our due diligence efforts, and improve our ability to identify attractive investment opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Global presence. Our ability to opportunistically invest worldwide is an important element of diversifying our portfolios and managing risk. Our investment professionals operate from our various offices globally and have a long history of investing on an international scale. 

&#8226; 

Experience. We have a history of hiring highly talented and experienced employees across all areas of our business, and developing them into senior roles as managing directors and executive managing directors. The depth and breadth of experience of our senior management team enables us to source, structure, execute and monitor a broad range of investments worldwide. 

&#8226; 

Focus on infrastructure. Since our firm&#8217;s inception, we have focused on building a robust infrastructure with an emphasis on strong financial, operational and compliance-related controls. As of December 31, 2015 , of the firm&#8217;s 103 &#32;active executive managing directors and managing directors, 34 &#32;are dedicated to our global infrastructure, reinforcing our commitment to this important part of our business. &#32; As a public company, we are required to identify and document key processes and controls, which are subject to independent review. Additionally, we have added a number of independent, third-party processes to our fund operations that provide independent information to our fund investors. 

&#8226; 

Transparency. We believe that our fund investors should be provided with qualitative and quantitative information about our investment process, operational procedures and portfolio exposures in order to understand and evaluate our investment performance. We provide our fund investors with comprehensive reporting about each portfolio on a regular basis, and our senior management team and portfolio managers regularly meet with them to address their questions.

Class B Shares have no economic rights and are not publicly traded, but rather entitle the holders of record to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders. The Class B Shares are held solely by our executive managing directors and provide them with a voting interest in Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC commensurate with their economic interest in our business in the form of Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units. Each executive managing director holding Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units holds an equal number of Class B Shares. Upon a grant of Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units to an executive managing director, an equal number of Class B Shares is also granted to such executive managing director. Upon the exchange by an executive managing director of an Och-Ziff Operating Group A Unit for a Class A Share as further discussed below, the corresponding Class B Share is canceled. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Class B Shares represent 62.2% &#32;of our total combined voting power. Our executive managing directors have granted an irrevocable proxy to vote all of their Class B Shares to the Class B Shareholder Committee, the sole member of which is currently Mr. Och, as it may determine in its sole discretion. This proxy will terminate upon the later of (i) Mr. Och&#8217;s withdrawal, death or disability, or (ii) such time as our executive managing directors hold less than 40% of our total combined voting power. As a result, Mr. Och is currently able to control all matters requiring the approval of our shareholders. 

Och-Ziff Operating Group Entities 

We conduct our business through the Och-Ziff Operating Group. Historically, we have used more than one Och-Ziff Operating Group entity to segregate our operations for business, financial, tax and other reasons. We may increase or decrease the number of our Och-Ziff Operating Group entities and intermediate holding companies based on our views as to the appropriate balance between administrative convenience and business, financial, tax and other considerations. 

The Och-Ziff Operating Group currently consists of OZ Management, OZ Advisors I and OZ Advisors II. All of our interests in OZ Management and OZ Advisors I are held through Och-Ziff Corp. All of our interests in OZ Advisors II are held through Och-Ziff Holding. Each intermediate holding company is the sole general partner of the applicable Och-Ziff Operating Group entity and, therefore, generally controls the business and affairs of such entity. All of the equity interests in the Och-Ziff Operating Group are represented by Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units and Och-Ziff Operating Group B Units. 

The Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units and Och-Ziff Operating Group B Units have no preference or priority over other securities of the Och-Ziff Operating Group (other than the Och-Ziff Operating Group D Units to the extent described below) and, upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, will be entitled to any assets remaining after payment of all debts and liabilities of the Och-Ziff Operating Group (together with the Och-Ziff Operating Group D Units to the extent described below). 

Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units. One Class A operating group unit in each of the Och-Ziff Operating Group entities collectively represents one &#8220;Och-Ziff Operating Group A Unit.&#8221; Our executive managing directors own 100% of the Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units, which as of December 31, 2015 , represent a 62.2% &#32;equity interest in the Och-Ziff Operating Group. Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units are exchangeable for our Class A Shares at the discretion of the Exchange Committee (which consists of the members of the Partner Management Committee), on a one-for-one basis, subject to minimum retained ownership and vesting requirements by our executive managing directors and certain exchange rate adjustments for splits, unit distributions and reclassifications. 

Och-Ziff Operating Group B Units. One Class B operating group unit in each of the Och-Ziff Operating Group entities collectively represents one &#8220;Och-Ziff Operating Group B Unit.&#8221; Each intermediate holding company holds a general partner interest and Och-Ziff Operating Group B Units in each Och-Ziff Operating Group entity that it controls. Our intermediate holding companies own 100% of the Och-Ziff Operating Group B Units, which, as of December 31, 2015 , represent a 37.8% &#32;equity interest in the Och-Ziff Operating Group. The Och-Ziff Operating Group B Units are economically identical to the Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units held by our executive managing directors and represent common equity interests in our business, but are not exchangeable for Class A Shares and are not subject to vesting, forfeiture or minimum retained ownership requirements. 

Och-Ziff Operating Group D Units. We issue Class D operating group units to new executive managing directors in connection with their admission to the Och-Ziff Operating Group. In addition, we issue Och-Ziff Operating Group D Units in connection with performance-related grants to executive managing directors, including grants to active executive managing directors participating in The Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC 2012 Partner Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the &#8220;PIP.&#8221; For additional information regarding the PIP, please see &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Understanding Our Results&#8212;Expenses&#8212;Compensation and Benefits.&#8221; 

One Class D operating group unit in each of the Och-Ziff Operating Group entities collectively represents one &#8220;Och-Ziff Operating Group D Unit.&#8221; The Och-Ziff Operating Group D Units are non-equity, limited partner profits interests that are only entitled to share in residual assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up to the extent that there has been a threshold amount of appreciation subsequent to issuance of the units. The Och-Ziff Operating Group D Units convert into Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units to the extent we determine that they have become economically equivalent to Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units. Allocations to these interests are recorded within compensation and benefits in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

The diagram below depicts our organizational structure as of December 31, 2015 (1) : 

_______________ 

(1) 

This diagram does not give effect to 11,253,301 &#32;Class A restricted share units, or &#8220;RSUs,&#8221; that were outstanding as of December 31, 2015 , and were granted to our executive managing directors, managing directors, other employees and the independent members of our Board of Directors. 

(2) 

Mr. Och and the other executive managing directors hold Och-Ziff Operating Group A Units representing 32.8% &#32;and 29.3% , respectively, of the equity in the Och-Ziff Operating Group, excluding the 7,173,992 &#32;Class A Shares collectively owned directly by Mr. Och and certain other executive managing directors. Our executive managing directors also hold Class C Non-Equity Interests and Och-Ziff Operating Group D Units as described below in notes (4) and (5). 

(3) 

Mr. Och holds Class B Shares representing 32.8% &#32;of the voting power of our Company and the other executive managing directors hold Class B Shares representing 29.3% &#32;of the voting power of our Company. Our executive managing directors have granted an irrevocable proxy to vote all of their Class B Shares to the Class B Shareholder Committee, the sole member of which is currently Mr. Och, as it may determine in its sole discretion. In addition, Mr. Och controls an additional 0.4% &#32;of our total combined voting power through his direct ownership of 1,957,071 &#32;Class A Shares. 

(4) 

Not presented in the diagram above are Class C Non-Equity Interests, which are non-equity interests in the Och-Ziff Operating Group entities. No holder of Class C Non-Equity Interests will have any right to receive distributions on such interests. Our executive managing directors hold all of the Class C Non-Equity Interests, which may be used for discretionary income allocations, including the cash element of any discretionary annual performance awards paid to our executive managing directors. References to bonuses throughout this annual report include any Class C Non-Equity Interests distributions. 

(5) 

Not presented in the diagram above are Och-Ziff Operating Group D Units, which represent an approximately 5.0% &#32;profits interest in the Och-Ziff Operating Group, and are not considered equity interests for GAAP purposes. Our executive managing directors hold all of the Och-Ziff Operating Group D Units. 

Beginning in 2016, we began to provide profit sharing interests (&#8220;PSIs&#8221;) to new executive managing directors upon their admission as partners to the Och-Ziff Operating Group entities. PSIs are non-equity, limited partner profits interests in the Och-Ziff Operating Group that participate in distributions of future profits of the Och-Ziff Operating Group on a pro rata basis with the Och-Ziff Operating Group A, B and D Units and may share in residual assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up to the extent that there has been a threshold amount of appreciation subsequent to issuance of the PSIs. Subject to the discretion of the Chairman of the Partner Management Committee (the &#8220;PMC Chairman&#8221;), distributions on the PSIs are generally expected to be made as follows: 50% in cash; 25% in the form of Och-Ziff Operating Group D Units; and 25% in deferred cash interests (&#8220;DCIs&#8221;). These DCIs reflect notional Och-Ziff fund investments made by the Company on behalf of an executive managing director that are subject to multi-year vesting and forfeiture conditions. Upon vesting, the Company pays the executive managing director in an amount equal to the notional investment represented by the DCIs, as adjusted for notional fund performance. PSIs are subject to forfeiture upon the departure of an executive managing director, and the number of PSIs held by an executive managing director can be increased or decreased each year at the PMC Chairman&#8217;s discretion. 

Our Fund Structures 

Our funds are typically organized using a &#8220;master-feeder&#8221; structure. This structure is commonly used in the hedge fund industry and calls for the establishment of one or more U.S. or non-U.S. &#8220;feeder&#8221; funds, which are managed by us but are separate legal entities and have different structures and operations designed for distinct groups of investors. Fund investors, including our executive managing directors, employees and other related parties, invest directly into our feeder funds. These feeder funds hold direct or indirect interests in a &#8220;master&#8221; fund that, together with its subsidiaries, is the primary investment vehicle for its feeder funds. 

We also organize certain funds (e.g., our real estate funds and certain opportunistic credit funds) without the use of a master-feeder structure. Finally, the CLOs we manage are collateralized financing vehicles that issue notes to investors and use those proceeds to acquire various types of credit-related investments that serve as collateral for the notes. Senior notes issued by these vehicles make periodic payments based on a stated interest rate, while the most subordinated notes have no stated interest rate but receive periodic payments from excess cash flows remaining after periodic payments have been made to the other notes and for fees and expenses due. 

All of our funds are managed by the Och-Ziff Operating Group. Any of our existing or future funds may invest using any alternative structure that is deemed useful or appropriate. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , our worldwide headcount was 659 &#32;(including 87 &#32;in the United Kingdom and 48 &#32;in Asia), with 181 &#32;investment professionals (including 44 &#32;in the United Kingdom and 20 &#32;in Asia). As of this date, we had 22 &#32;active executive managing directors and 81 &#32;managing directors. 

Regulatory Matters 

Our business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations and regulatory investigations, by governmental and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Since 1999, we have been registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, which we refer to as the &#8220;Advisers Act.&#8221; We are also a company subject to the registration and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act, and therefore subject to regulation and oversight by the SEC. As a company with a class of securities listed on the NYSE, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the NYSE. In addition, we are subject to regulation by the Department of Labor under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which we refer to as &#8220;ERISA.&#8221; As a registered commodity pool operator and a registered commodity trading advisor, we are subject to regulation and oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which we refer to as the &#8220;CFTC.&#8221; We are also subject to regulation and oversight by the National Futures Association in the U.S., as well as other regulatory bodies. 

Our European and Asian operations, and our investment activities around the globe, are subject to a variety of regulatory regimes that vary country by country, including the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong, the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Dubai Financial Services Authority. Currently, governmental authorities in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate have proposed additional disclosure requirements and regulation of hedge funds and other alternative asset managers. 

See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business&#8212;Extensive regulation of our business affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. Our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially affected by regulatory issues,&#8221; &#8220;&#8212;Increased regulatory focus in the United States could result in additional burdens on our business&#8221; and &#8220;&#8212;Recent regulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the United States could adversely affect our business.&#8221; 

Global Compliance Program 

We have implemented a global compliance program to address the legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our company-wide operations. We have structured our global compliance program to address the requirements of each of our regulators, as described above, as well as the requirements necessary to support our global securities, commodities and loan trading operations. 

Our compliance program includes comprehensive policies and supervisory procedures that have been designed and implemented to monitor compliance with these requirements. All employees attend mandatory annual compliance training to remain informed of our policies and procedures related to matters such as the handling of material non-public information, conflicts of interest and employee securities trading. Annual training specifically targeted at ensuring the understanding of and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the &#8220;FCPA&#8221;) and, as applicable, other foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations is mandatory for employees and executives responsible for structuring, supervising, ensuring compliance of and executing accounting functions for private deals, as well as for employees who interact with or provide reporting to investors. In addition to a robust internal compliance framework, we have strong relationships with a global network of local attorneys specializing in compliance matters to help us quickly identify regulatory changes and address compliance issues as they arise.
