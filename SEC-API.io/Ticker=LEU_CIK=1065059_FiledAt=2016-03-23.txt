 Item 1. &#32;&#32; Business 

Overview 

Centrus Energy Corp. (&#8220;Centrus&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a trusted supplier of low-enriched uranium (&#8220;LEU&#8221;) for commercial nuclear power plants. References to &#8220;Centrus&#8221;, the "Company", or &#8220;we&#8221; include Centrus Energy Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries as well as the predecessor to Centrus unless the context otherwise indicates. LEU is a critical component in the production of nuclear fuel for reactors that produce electricity and we supply LEU to both domestic and international utilities for use in a growing fleet of nuclear reactors worldwide. Centrus is a leader in the development of advanced uranium enrichment technology and is performing research and demonstration work to support U.S. energy and national security. 

As a long-term supplier of LEU to our customers, our goal is to provide value through the reliability and diversity of our supply sources. We provide LEU from multiple sources including our inventory and long-term supply contracts and spot purchases. We ceased enrichment at our production facility in 2013 and repackaged and transferred our existing inventory to off-site licensed locations under agreements with the operators of those facilities. 

Our long-term objective is to resume commercial enrichment production. We anticipate having a contract with the operator of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (&#8220;ORNL&#8221;) funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (&#8220;DOE&#8221;) to conduct research, development and demonstration of advanced centrifuge technology for the U.S. government. We believe that this technology will play a critical role in meeting our national and energy security needs and achieving our nation&#8217;s non-proliferation objectives. &#32; 

Evolution of Our Business 

In 2014, USEC Inc. filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and on September 30, 2014, the Company emerged from that bankruptcy as Centrus Energy Corp. In 2015, a new management team was assembled to reposition the Company for long-term success with a focus on strategic positioning, expanding sales and business development. 

Today, Centrus is a very different company than USEC was three years ago: 

&#8226; 

Shift in strategic priorities: Due to oversupply in the enrichment market, Centrus does not plan for near term deployment of a commercial scale uranium enrichment facility. However, Centrus is continuing to advance its centrifuge technology, preserving its operating license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (&#8220;NRC&#8221;) and plans to deploy a commercial scale enrichment facility over the long term as market conditions recover. We are pursuing strategic relationships that would capitalize on Centrus' unique assets, including our NRC license, our operational expertise, and our significant technical capabilities. 

&#8226; 

Better positioned in the market: Without the large capital and overhead costs of a production facility, Centrus is positioned to obtain supply at a low price from a market that continues to be oversupplied, which will provide an advantage in pursuing sales opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Technology leader: Centrus expects to retain its core expertise and world leading technical, engineering and manufacturing capabilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee through our anticipated contract with the operator of ORNL. 

&#8226; 

Revised supply agreement: In late 2015, the new management team successfully completed a renegotiation of the company&#8217;s supply contract with Russia; better matching the agreement to market opportunities and extending the agreement to at least 2026. 

&#8226; 

Diversified supply base: Centrus' new leadership team is focused on expanding and diversifying our supply base to provide additional value to our customers. Over the course of 2015, Centrus entered into new agreements with primary producers of uranium enrichment expanding both our sources of supply and increasing the number of possible delivery locations for enriched uranium. In addition, Centrus acquired additional enrichment supply from the excess inventories of utility operators of nuclear power plants and from other secondary sources of enrichment supply. 

&#8226; 

Solidifying our position for the long term: Centrus has long-term sales and supply contracts in place that extend well into the next decade, which will provide an extended stream of revenue for many years. This will give the Company flexibility to continue growing as the global enrichment market recovers. In the meantime, we continue to book new sales and take advantage of present market conditions to obtain new low cost supply. 

We believe that Centrus&#8217; position as a leading provider of enriched uranium and our long-standing global relationships will enable an increase in future market share for the Company. We are well-positioned to capitalize on our heritage, industry-wide relationships, and diversity of supply to provide reliable and competitive enrichment sourcing. Centrus continues to be valued by our customers as a source of diversity, stability, and competition in the enrichment market. Moreover, our smaller size and lower fixed costs can be advantageous in the current excess capacity market. 

&#160;

Uranium and Enrichment 

Uranium is a naturally occurring element and is mined from deposits located in Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia and several other countries. According to the World Nuclear Association, there are adequate measured resources of uranium to fuel nuclear power at current usage rates for about 90 years. In its natural state, uranium is principally comprised of two isotopes: uranium-235 (&#8220;U 235 &#8221;) and uranium-238 (&#8220;U 238 &#8221;). The concentration of U 235 &#32;in natural uranium is only 0.711% by weight. Most commercial nuclear power reactors require LEU fuel with a U 235 &#32;concentration greater than natural uranium and up to 5% by weight. Uranium enrichment is the process by which the concentration of U 235 &#32;is increased to that level. 

LEU consists of two components: separative work units (&#8220;SWU&#8221;) and uranium. SWU is a standard unit of measurement that represents the effort required to transform a given amount of natural uranium into two components: enriched uranium having a higher percentage of U 235 &#32;and depleted uranium having a lower percentage of U 235 . The SWU contained in LEU is calculated using an industry standard formula based on the physics of enrichment. The amount of enrichment deemed to be contained in LEU under this formula is commonly referred to as its SWU component and the quantity of natural uranium used in the production of LEU under this formula is referred to as its uranium or &#8220;feed&#8221; component. 

&#160; 

Historically, we produced or acquired LEU from two principal sources. We produced LEU at the Paducah gaseous diffusion plant ("Paducah GDP") in Paducah, Kentucky that we leased from DOE, and acquired LEU under a contract with Russia under the 20-year Megatons to Megawatts program. Under the Megatons to Megawatts program, we purchased the SWU component of LEU derived from dismantled nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union for use as fuel in commercial nuclear power plants. We ceased enrichment at the Paducah GDP at the end of May 2013 and repackaged and transferred our existing inventory to off-site licensed locations under agreements with the operators of those facilities. 

While in some cases customers purchase both the SWU and uranium components of LEU from us, utility customers typically provide uranium to us as part of their enrichment contracts, and in exchange we deliver LEU to these customers and charge for the SWU component. As of December 31, 2015, we held uranium at licensed locations to which title was held by customers and suppliers with a value of $0.4 billion based on published price indicators. Title to uranium provided by customers generally remains with the customer until delivery of LEU, at which time title to LEU is transferred to the customer and we take title to the uranium. 

The following outlines the steps for converting natural uranium into LEU fuel, commonly known as the nuclear fuel cycle: 

Mining and Milling. &#32;Natural, or unenriched, uranium is removed from the earth in the form of ore and then crushed and concentrated. 

Conversion. &#32;Uranium concentrates (&#8220;U 3 O 8 &#8221;) are combined with fluorine gas to produce uranium hexafluoride (&#8220;UF 6 &#8221;), a solid at room temperature and a gas when heated. UF 6 &#32;is shipped to an enrichment plant. 

Enrichment. &#32;UF 6 &#32;is enriched in a process that increases the concentration of the U 235 &#32;isotope in the UF 6 &#32;from its natural state of 0.711% up to 5%, which is usable as a fuel for light water commercial nuclear power reactors. 

Fuel Fabrication. &#32;LEU is then converted to uranium oxide and formed into small ceramic pellets by fabricators. The pellets are loaded into metal tubes that form fuel assemblies, which are shipped to nuclear power plants. 

Nuclear Power Plant. The fuel assemblies are loaded into nuclear reactors to create energy from a controlled chain reaction. Nuclear power plants generate approximately 19% of U.S. electricity and 11% of the world&#8217;s electricity. 

Used Fuel Storage. After the nuclear fuel has been in a reactor for several years, its efficiency is reduced and the assembly is removed from the reactor&#8217;s core. The used fuel is warm and radioactive and is kept in a deep pool of water for several years. Many utilities have elected to then move the used fuel into steel or concrete and steel casks for interim storage. 

Products and Services 

Low-Enriched Uranium 

Revenue from our LEU segment is derived primarily from: 

&#8226; 

sales of the SWU component of LEU, 

&#8226; 

sales of both the SWU and uranium components of LEU, and 

&#8226; 

sales of natural uranium. 

Revenue for our LEU segment accounted for approximately 85% of our total revenue in 2015. The majority of our customers are domestic and international utilities that operate nuclear power plants, with international sales constituting 41% of revenue from our LEU segment in 2015. Our agreements with electric utilities are primarily long-term, fixed-commitment contracts under which our customers are obligated to purchase a specified quantity of the SWU component of LEU (or the SWU and uranium components of LEU) from us. Our agreements for natural uranium sales are generally shorter-term, fixed-commitment contracts. 

Contract Services 

As described below under Advanced Technology, Manufacturing, and Engineering Capability, &#32;we performed American Centrifuge research and technology activities as a contractor with UT-Battelle, LLC (&#8220;UT-Battelle&#8221;), the management and operating contractor of ORNL for DOE. Revenue and cost of sales for work that we perform as a contractor to UT-Battelle are reported in the contract services segment. The contract services segment also includes limited services provided by Centrus to DOE and its contractors in Piketon, Ohio and previously at the Paducah GDP.

SWU and Uranium Sales Order Book 

The SWU component of LEU is typically bought and sold under long-term contracts with deliveries over several years. Our order book of sales under contract (&#8220;order book&#8221;, or referred to in previous SEC filings as &#8220;backlog&#8221;) extends for more than a decade. Over the course of 2015, we made significant deliveries while also adding new long-term sales. As of December 31, 2015, our order book was $2.3 billion compared to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2014. We anticipate SWU and uranium revenue from the sales currently under contract in our order book in a range of $250 million to $275 million during 2016. 

&#160; 

Most of our contracts provide for fixed purchases of SWU during a given year. Our estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of future SWU and uranium sales is partially based on customers&#8217; estimates of the timing and size of their fuel requirements and other assumptions that are subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, the customer may be able to increase or decrease the quantity delivered within an agreed range. Our order book estimate is also based on our estimates of selling prices, which are subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, prices may be adjusted based on escalation using a general inflation index, published SWU price indicators prevailing at the time of delivery, and other factors, all of which are variable. We use external composite forecasts of future market prices and inflation rates in our pricing estimates. 

&#160; 

Our order book is subject to various risks. Certain contracts included in the order book have sales prices that are significantly above current market prices. Customers may seek to limit their obligations under these existing contracts or may elect to discontinue contracts that have termination rights. Some long-term contracts in our order book were established with milestones related to the deployment of the American Centrifuge Plant (&#8220;ACP&#8221;) in Piketon, Ohio, that permit termination with respect to portions of the contract under limited circumstances that vary across the contracts. Some of these customers have indicated they expect to exercise their contract termination rights. While we have waived, eliminated or renegotiated those termination rights where possible, we estimate that approximately $0.8 billion (35%) of our order book remains at various levels of risk due to milestones related to ACP deployment. 

We are also working with customers to modify contracts that have delivery, scheduling, origin or other terms that may require modifications to address our anticipated supply sources. However, we have no assurance that our customers will agree to revise existing contracts or will not seek to exercise contract termination rights or require concessions, which could adversely affect the value of our order book and our prospects. 

Russian Supply Agreement 

From 1993 to 2013, in addition to marketing the output of the gaseous diffusion plants we previously operated under lease from the government, we sold enriched uranium fuel derived from former Soviet nuclear warheads under the highly successful Megatons to Megawatts program. The program eliminated enough weapons grade material for 20,000 warheads, and provided the fuel for roughly 10% of America&#8217;s electricity over its 20-year term. 

We now purchase SWU contained in LEU from Russia supplied to us under a 2011 agreement (the &#8220;Russian Supply Agreement&#8221;) with the Russian government entity Joint Stock Company &#8220;TENEX&#8221; (&#8220;TENEX&#8221;). Unlike the Megatons to Megawatts program, in which we acted as the U.S. government&#8217;s executive agent, the LEU supplied under the Russian Supply Agreement is a commercial arrangement sourced from Russian enrichment production. 

In December 2015, we successfully negotiated an amendment to the Russian Supply Agreement to better align our purchase obligations in light of market conditions generally, our sales order book, and restrictions on the import of Russian LEU. The amendment, which is subject to approval of the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation (&#8220;Rosatom&#8221;), extends the Russian Supply Agreement beyond 2022 and gives us the right to reschedule quantities of SWU into the period 2023-2026, in return for the purchase of additional SWU in those years. 

Under the terms of the amended Russian Supply Agreement, we will have the option to reschedule to 2023-2026 up to approximately 7.7 million SWU of the approximately 16.6 million SWU remaining to be purchased, subject to an increase in our purchase obligation as compensation for our deferring the purchase to those years and a change in the terms for ordering enriched uranium included in the amendment. These compensatory SWU, which could increase our purchase obligation after 2022 to approximately 10 million SWU, will be calculated on a yearly basis beginning at the end of 2022. We will take these SWU in 2023-2026, but will have the right to move purchases in excess of 2.25 million SWU per year to the first year after 2026 in which such excess can be purchased without exceeding the 2.25 million SWU limit. The amendment also provides that the Company must pay for all SWU in its minimum purchase obligation each year, even if we fail to submit orders for such SWU. We would then have the right to take the unordered SWU in the following year. The recent modification did not change the pricing terms for 

SWU under the Russian Supply Agreement, which are based on a mix of market-related price points and other factors. 

&#160; 

Under the Russian Supply Agreement, we purchase the SWU component of the LEU and deliver natural uranium to TENEX for the LEU&#8217;s uranium component. The LEU is subject to quotas and other restrictions applicable to commercial Russian LEU that did not apply to LEU supplied to us under the Megatons to Megawatts program. These quotas and restrictions could adversely affect our ability to sell the commercial Russian SWU that we purchase under the Russian Supply Agreement. These quotas limit the amount of Russian LEU that can be imported into the United States for U.S. consumption. The total quota currently available to TENEX is equal to approximately 20% of the U.S. demand, or about 3 million SWU per year, from 2014 through 2020, with additional quantities of Russian LEU to be imported for use in the initial fueling of new U.S. reactors exempt from the quotas. At this time there are no quotas applicable after 2020. The quotas are subject to adjustment by the U.S. Department of Commerce (&#8220;DOC&#8221;) in 2016 and 2019. The Russian Supply Agreement only gives us the right to use a portion of this quota, which is less than the amount of Russian LEU that we need to order to meet our SWU purchase obligations to TENEX. We can ask TENEX for additional quota, which they can allocate to us at their discretion. We expect most of the Russian LEU that we order during the term of the Russian Supply Agreement will need to be delivered to customers who will use it in foreign reactors. 

&#160; 

The Russian LEU that we deliver to foreign customers can be delivered either at fabrication facilities in the United States or in foreign countries. There is a separate quota that applies to deliveries of Russian LEU to foreign customers at U.S. fabrication facilities that requires that the LEU be processed and re-exported within a certain period of time. At our request, the DOC approved our proposal that Japanese customers with existing contracts with our subsidiary be allowed to physically store Russian LEU in the United States pending the restart of nuclear reactors in Japan. Under this approval, Japanese customers who wish to store Russian LEU in the United States pending restart of their reactors can do so under conditions intended to protect the U.S. market while the material is in storage. This material would not have to be re-exported until it is withdrawn from storage. 

The amount of SWU we must purchase from TENEX under the Russian Supply Agreement in some years exceeds our current sales order book and therefore we will need to make new sales to place all the Russian LEU we must order to meet our SWU purchase obligations to TENEX. In addition, due to quotas and other limitations, not all of our delivery obligations under our existing contracts can be met with Russian LEU. We intend to procure LEU from other sources in order to supply the customers who cannot be supplied effectively with Russian LEU or from our existing inventory. 

Advanced Technology, Manufacturing, and Engineering Capability 

The Company has a long record as a global leader in advanced technology, manufacturing and engineering. Our manufacturing, engineering, testing and demonstration facilities in Tennessee and Ohio and our highly-trained workforce are deeply engaged in advancing the next generation of uranium enrichment technology. We are exploring a number of options for returning to domestic production, including deployment of our American Centrifuge, Centrus&#8217; advanced uranium enrichment gas centrifuge technology. 

In October 2015, DOE issued a report to Congress finding that the U.S. must restore its domestic uranium enrichment capability in the future. After evaluating a range of possible technologies, DOE found that the American Centrifuge is the &#8220;most technically advanced and lowest risk option&#8221; for restoring U.S. uranium enrichment capability to meet long-term national security requirements. The report identified existing sources of enriched uranium fuel that may be available, subject to varying levels of risk, to meet U.S. national security needs through 2041. 

From 2012-2013, the U.S. government and Centrus jointly funded the construction of a demonstration cascade of the American Centrifuge technology in Piketon, Ohio. The demonstration cascade completed its mission after nearly two years of continuous operations, delivering valuable operational data to inform future deployment efforts. In September 2015, DOE announced the conclusion of the federally funded demonstration effort. Effective October 1, 2015, funding for the demonstration cascade was discontinued and the program was consolidated at our engineering and testing facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. We anticipate that DOE, through UT-Battelle, will extend our development work in Oak Ridge with a contract through September 30, 2016. 

The Company continued funding cascade operations in Piketon from its own funds while it explored potential alternative use of the facility. Subsequently, on February 19, 2016, we announced our decision to commence with the decontamination and decommissioning (&#8220;D&#38;D&#8221;) of the Piketon demonstration cascade, and to reduce staffing levels. We will preserve a core staff, expertise, and facilities at Piketon to enable the facility to be used to support the Company&#8217;s other business development initiatives as needed. 

We intend to resume commercial production when market conditions warrant. Today, the economics for commercial deployment of new enrichment capacity are severely challenged by the current supply/demand imbalance in the market for LEU and related downward pressure on market prices for SWU, which are now at their lowest levels in more than a decade. Market conditions are expected to improve in the long term. 

We currently intend to continue to maintain our NRC license to construct and operate a commercial enrichment facility in Piketon. The 30-year license expires in 2037 and includes authorization to enrich uranium to a U 235 &#32;assay of up to 10%. The commercial license is based on a plant designed with an initial annual production capacity of 3.8 million SWU. 

We lease the Piketon facility from DOE. The process buildings encompass more than 14 acres under roof. The current lease term is through June 2019. We have the option to extend the lease term for additional five-year terms up to 2043 provided we certify that we meet certain conditions. Thereafter, we also have the right to extend the lease for up to an additional 20 years, through 2063, if we agree to demolish the existing buildings leased to us after the lease term expires and subject to certain other conditions. Rent is based on the cost of lease administration and regulatory oversight in Piketon and is approximately $1.5 million for 2016. We may terminate the lease upon three years&#8217; notice. DOE may terminate for default, including if DOE is able to exercise its remedies with respect to the ACP under our agreement dated June 17, 2002, as amended (the &#8220;2002 DOE-USEC Agreement&#8221;), or if there is an uncured production shortfall. The lease provides DOE with the right to terminate upon notice and applicable cure period in the event we fail to produce an average of 1 million SWU per year measured over a rolling two year performance period commencing with the two year period starting in April 2011. We are not currently producing at the 1 million SWU per year average. In the event DOE issues a notice under the lease, we would have 180 days to cure or to begin to cure if more than 180 days are reasonably required to cure. 

Competition and Foreign Trade 

We estimate that the enrichment industry market is currently about 50 million SWU per year. Our global market share is approximately 4 percent. Global LEU suppliers compete in the highly competitive industry primarily in terms of price and secondarily on reliability of supply and customer service. The three largest LEU suppliers comprise an estimated 90 percent of market share combined: 

&#8226; 

Rosatom, a Russian government entity, which sells LEU through its wholly owned subsidiary TENEX; 

&#8226; 

Urenco, a consortium of companies owned or controlled by the British and Dutch governments and by two German utilities; and 

&#8226; 

Areva, a company largely owned by the French government. 

Urenco reported installed capacity at its European and U.S. enrichment facilities of 19.1 million SWU per year at the end of 2015. Urenco has announced plans to continue a slow expansion at its Urenco USA facility with a target of adding an additional 1 million SWU by 2022. 

Areva&#8217;s gas centrifuge enrichment plant in France began commercial operations in 2011 and more than 96% of the plant&#8217;s nominal capacity of 7.5 million SWU was reported to be in service at the end of 2015. Areva has announced that it will reach its full capacity of 7.5 million SWU per year by the end of 2016. In October 2011, the NRC issued an operating license to Areva for the Eagle Rock plant near Idaho Falls, Idaho. Areva&#8217;s original plan called for initial production in 2014 but Areva has placed its plans for the Eagle Rock plant on hold. Furthermore, under a new strategic plan, Areva suspended planned capacity expansions for its domestic gas centrifuge plant beyond 7.5 million SWU. 

The production capacity for Rosatom/TENEX is estimated by the World Nuclear Association (&#8220;WNA&#8221;) to be approximately 27 million SWU per year. Imports of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation are subject to the restrictions described below under Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia. 

All of our current competitors are owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by foreign governments. These competitors may make business decisions in both domestic and international markets that are influenced by political or economic policy considerations rather than exclusively by commercial considerations. 

There are also producers of LEU in China, Japan and Brazil that primarily serve a portion of their respective domestic markets. China is emerging as a growing producer and has begun to supply limited quantities of LEU to foreign markets. China&#8217;s commercial SWU production capacity is estimated to be in the range of 4.5 to 4.8 million SWU per year at the end of 2015. Additional capacity is also under construction at the existing enrichment plants, which is expected to add an additional 3.0 million SWU per year by 2017, in order to meet Chinese internal SWU requirements. 

In addition, GE Hitachi Global Laser Enrichment (&#8220;GLE&#8221;) has an agreement with Silex Systems Limited, an Australian company, to license Silex&#8217;s laser enrichment technology. The NRC issued GLE a license in September 2012 for a proposed plant in Wilmington, North Carolina. More recently GLE has expressed an interest in deploying enrichment capacity at the site of the Paducah GDP. In recent quarters, sponsors of the GLE consortium have written off their investment in the project, and the GLE project staff has been significantly reduced. All GLE activities at the Oak Ridge, Tennessee facility have been shut down, but work continues at the Wilmington Test Loop facility. 

LEU may also be produced by down-blending government stockpiles of highly enriched uranium. Governments control the timing and availability of highly enriched uranium released for this purpose, and the release of this material to the market could impact market conditions. Given the current oversupplied nuclear fuel market, any additional LEU from down-blended highly enriched uranium released into the market would have a negative effect on prices for LEU. 

LEU that we supply to foreign customers is exported under the terms of international agreements governing nuclear cooperation between the United States and the country of destination or other entities, such as the European Union or the International Atomic Energy Agency. The LEU supplied to us under the Russian Supply Agreement is subject to the terms of cooperation agreements between the Russian Federation and the country of destination or other entities. 

Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia 

Imports into the United States of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation (including LEU imported under the Russian Supply Agreement but not the LEU imported through the end of 2013 under the Megatons to Megawatts program) are subject to quotas imposed under legislation enacted into law in September 2008 and under the 1992 Russian Suspension Agreement, as amended. The September 2008 legislation provides that it supersedes the Russian Suspension Agreement in cases where they conflict. 

The September 2008 legislation imposes annual quotas on imports of Russian LEU through 2020. From 2008 to 2011, the quotas only permitted a small amount of LEU to be imported. The quotas increased moderately in 2012 and 2013, and then from 2014-2020 are set at an amount equal to approximately 20% of projected annual U.S. consumption of LEU, based on a market report published in 2005 by the World Nuclear Association (the &#8220;2005 WNA Report&#8221;). These statutory import quotas are substantially similar to the export quotas established under the Russian Suspension Agreement discussed below, which also were based on the 2005 WNA Report. However, the legislation also includes the possibility of expanded quotas of up to an additional 5% of the domestic market annually beginning in 2014 if the Russian Federation continues to down-blend highly enriched uranium after the completion of the Megatons to Megawatts program. As with the Russian Suspension Agreement, the legislation also permits unlimited imports of Russian LEU for use in initial cores for any new U.S. nuclear reactor. 

As amended in February 2008, the Russian Suspension Agreement, which suspended an antidumping investigation on uranium imports from Russia, permits the Russian government to sell a stockpile of LEU containing approximately 400,000 SWU located in the United States, and establishes annual export quotas for the sale of Russian uranium products to U.S. utilities substantially similar to those in the September 2008 legislation. It also permits unlimited exports to the United States of Russian LEU for use in initial cores for any U.S. nuclear reactors entering service for the first time. In 2021, the suspended investigation (and the Russian Suspension Agreement) will be terminated and the export quotas will no longer apply. 

Both the Russian Suspension Agreement and the September 2008 legislation permit the Secretary of Commerce to increase the quotas for Russian LEU in situations where supply is insufficient to meet U.S. demand for LEU. In addition, under the terms of the February 2008 amendment and the September 2008 legislation, the DOC is scheduled to adjust the quotas to match projected reactor demand for years after the publication of the 2005 WNA Report. This adjustment could result in an increase or decrease of the quotas but is not expected to affect deliveries under contracts that were unconditionally approved by the DOC prior to the change. 

Limitations on Imports of LEU from France 

The DOC imposed an antidumping order on imports of French LEU in 2002. In December 2012, the DOC and the U.S. International Trade Commission (&#8220;ITC&#8221;) initiated separate reviews to determine if the antidumping order should remain in place. This was the second round of &#8220;sunset reviews&#8221; of the antidumping order. The first round of reviews in 2007 concluded that termination of the antidumping order would lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping of French LEU (a determination made by the DOC), and to the continuation or recurrence of material injury to the U.S. LEU industry (a determination made by the ITC), which resulted in the order being maintained. 

In April 2013, the DOC determined that revocation of the antidumping order would result in the resumption of dumping of French LEU and therefore the order should remain in place. In November 2013, the ITC commissioners, by a 3-1 vote, determined that revocation of the order would lead to continuation or recurrence of material injury to the domestic enrichment industry. Accordingly, the DOC&#8217;s order imposing duties on French LEU to offset dumping will remain in place through at least 2018. 

Environmental Matters 

The Company's prior enrichment operations generated hazardous, low-level radioactive and mixed wastes. The storage, treatment, and disposal of wastes are regulated by federal and state laws. Wastes from our prior operations at the Paducah GDP were shipped to off-site treatment and disposal facilities. As of December 31, 2015, Centrus has a recorded liability of $1.0 million for the processing of remaining quantities at these facilities. 

The Paducah GDP was operated by agencies of the U.S. government for approximately 40 years prior to the Company's privatization in 1998. As a result of such operation, there is contamination and other potential environmental liabilities associated with the plant. On October 21, 2014, all of the leased portions of the Paducah GDP were de-leased by the Company and returned to DOE. Pursuant to a June 2014 agreement with DOE, the lease terminated with respect to the Paducah GDP on August 1, 2015. The USEC Privatization Act and the lease for the plant provide that DOE remains responsible for the decontamination and decommissioning of the Paducah GDP site. 

The Company ceased uranium enrichment at the Portsmouth GDP in 2001. During subsequent years, the Company maintained the Portsmouth site and performed services under contract with DOE. On September 30, 2011, the Company completed the transition of Portsmouth site facilities to DOE. As part of the transition, at the Company&#8217;s request, the NRC terminated the Company&#8217;s certificate of compliance for the Portsmouth site. In connection with the return of facilities, DOE agreed to accept ownership of all nuclear material at the site, some of which required processing for waste disposal. The Company agreed to pay DOE its cost of disposing of such wastes. As of December 31, 2015, Centrus has a recorded liability of $0.7 million for the processing of remaining waste quantities. 

We continue to incur costs for compliance with environmental laws and regulations as a result of operations at the American Centrifuge project, including the handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous, low-level radioactive and mixed wastes generated. Unanticipated events or regulatory developments could cause the level of expenditures to maintain compliance to vary substantially from planned spending.

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, there are 76 employees represented by the United Steelworkers ("USW"), including 66 employees at the advanced technology facility in Piketon. A majority of eligible workers at the advanced technology facility voted in February 2013 to be represented by the USW and there is currently no collective bargaining agreement in place. We are engaged in bargaining with the USW on the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. There are also 10 employees (9 at Paducah and 1 at Piketon) who are not active at work, and therefore not included in the numbers above who are represented by the USW, and who are currently receiving disability payments. 

For details concerning ongoing workforce reductions in connection with the conclusion of the federally funded advanced technology demonstration effort in Piketon, Ohio, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .
