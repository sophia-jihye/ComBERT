Inputs and Suppliers 

Global Ceramic Segment 

The principal raw materials used in the production of ceramic tile are clay, talc, industrial minerals and glazes. The Company has long-term clay mining rights in the U.S. and Russia that satisfy a portion of its clay requirements for producing tile. The Company also purchases a number of different grades of clay for the manufacture of its tile. The Company has entered into long-term supply agreements for a portion of its talc requirements. Glazes are used on a significant percentage of manufactured tiles. Glazes consist of frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with frit being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures a significant amount of its frit requirements. The Company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of clay, talc and industrial minerals that are readily available from a number of independent sources. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the Company's requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available. 

Flooring NA Segment 

The principal raw materials used in the production of carpet and rugs are nylon, triexta, polyester, polypropylene, recycled post-consumer plastics, synthetic backing materials, latex and various dyes and chemicals, the majority of which are petroleum based. The Company uses wood chips, wood veneers, lumber, and resins in its production of laminate and hardwood products. In its vinyl flooring operations, the Company uses plasticizers and pvc resins. Major raw materials used in the Company&#8217;s manufacturing process are available from independent sources and the Company obtains most of its raw materials from major suppliers providing inputs to each major product category. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available. Although the market for raw materials is sensitive to temporary disruptions, the North American flooring industry has not experienced a significant shortage of raw materials in recent years. 

Flooring ROW Segment 

The principal raw materials used in the production of boards, laminate and hardwood flooring are wood, paper and resins. The wood suppliers provide a variety of wood species giving the Company a cost-effective and secure supply of raw material. In its vinyl flooring operations, the Company uses glass fiber, plasticizers and pvc resins. Major raw materials used in the Company&#8217;s manufacturing process are available from independent sources and the Company has long-standing relationships with a number of suppliers. 

Industry and Competition 

The Company is the largest flooring manufacturer in a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies from small privately held firms to large multinationals. In 2014 , the U.S. floor covering industry reported $21.8 billion in sales, up approximately 5.6% over 2013's sales of $20.7 billion. In 2014 , the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on sales, were carpet and rug (49%), hardwood (15%), resilient (includes vinyl and LVT) and rubber (14%), ceramic tile (12%), stone (6%) and laminate (5%). In 2014 , the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on square feet, were carpet and rug (56%), resilient (includes vinyl and LVT) and rubber (18%), ceramic tile (13%), hardwood (7%), laminate (5%) and stone (1%). Each of these categories is influenced by the residential construction, commercial construction, and residential remodeling markets. These markets are influenced by many factors including consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates, availability of credit, turnover in housing and the overall strength of the economy. 

The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service, style, quality, price, product innovation and technology. In each of the markets, price and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines. The Company&#8217;s investments in manufacturing equipment, computer systems and 

Index to Financial Statements 

distribution network, as well as the Company&#8217;s marketing strategy, contribute to its ability to compete on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than just price. 

Global Ceramic Segment 

Globally, the ceramic tile industry is significantly fragmented. Based on industry publications, the 2014 market sales globally for ceramic tile and stone surfaces was over $73 billion. The Company faces competition in the ceramic tile flooring market from a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers who all compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers. The Company believes it is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in the world. The Company also believes it is the largest manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in the U.S. 

Flooring NA Segment 

The North American carpet and rug industry is highly competitive. Based on industry publications, the top five North American carpet and rug manufacturers (including their foreign divisions) in 2014 &#32;had carpet and rug sales in excess of $7 billion of the over $10.7 billion market. The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of hardwood flooring in the U.S. The Company also believes it is the second largest producer of carpets and rugs (in terms of sales dollars) in the world based on its 2014 &#32;net sales. The sheet vinyl and LVT industry is also highly competitive, but according to industry publications grew 10.7% in 2014. Based on industry publications the top twenty manufacturers in North America had sheet vinyl and LVT sales of $1.7 billion of the over $2.6 billion market in 2014. 

Flooring ROW Segment 

The Company faces competition in the laminate and hardwood flooring business from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers. The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of laminate flooring in the world, with a focus on high-end products. In addition, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage in the laminate flooring market as a result of the Flooring ROW segment&#8217;s industry leading design, patented technologies and brand recognition, which allow the Company to distinguish its laminate and hardwood flooring products in the areas of finish, quality, installation and assembly. The Company faces competition in the resilient flooring channel from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers, but believes it has a competitive advantage in the sheet vinyl and vinyl tile (including LVT) market due to industry leading design, patented technologies, brand recognition, and vertical integration. 

Patents and Trademarks 

Intellectual property is important to the Company&#8217;s business and the Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect its interests. 

The Company uses several trademarks that it considers important in the marketing of its products, including American Olean, Bigelow, Daltile, Durkan, IVC, Karastan, Lees, Marazzi, Mohawk, Pergo, Quick-Step and Unilin. These trademarks represent innovations that highlight competitive advantages and provide differentiation from competing brands in the market. 

The Flooring ROW segment owns a number of patent families in Europe and the U.S. some of which the Company licenses to manufacturers throughout the world. The most important of these patent families is the UNICLIC family, which include the snap, pretension, clearance and the beveled edge patents. The UNICLIC family of patents will expire in 2017. The licensing earnings from patents included in the Flooring ROW segment's results were approximately &#8364;118 million in 2015, only a portion of which will be retained following the UNICLIC expiration. The Company continues to explore additional opportunities to generate revenue from its patent portfolio. The licensing revenue from patents generated in the Flooring ROW segment's operations is partially offset by various expenses such as amortization, developing new technologies, filing new patents, supporting existing patents, defending patent lawsuits, collection and auditing of receivables, bad debt and other administrative activities. 

Sales Terms and Major Customers 

The Company&#8217;s sales terms are substantially the same as those generally available throughout the industry. The Company generally permits its customers to return products purchased from it within specified time periods from the date of sale, if the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product. 

&#160; 

Index to Financial Statements 

During 2015 , no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total net sales and the top 10 customers accounted for less than 20% of the Company&#8217;s net sales. The Company believes the loss of one major customer would not have a material adverse effect on its business. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company employed approximately 34,100 persons consisting of approximately 20,400 in the United States, approximately 5,000 in Europe, approximately 3,900 in Mexico, approximately 3,500 in Russia, approximately 1,000 in Malaysia and approximately 300 in various other countries.
