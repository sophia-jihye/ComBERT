 Item 1. Business 

Overview

Mannatech is a global wellness solution provider, which was incorporated and began operations in November 1993. We develop and sell innovative, high quality, proprietary nutritional supplements, topical and skin care and anti-aging products, and weight-management products that target optimal health and wellness. We currently sell our products in three regions: (i) North America/South America (the United States, Canada, Colombia and Mexico); (ii) Europe/the Middle East/Africa (&#8220;EMEA&#8221;) (Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, the Republic of Ireland, Namibia, the Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom); and (iii) Asia/Pacific (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong). We conduct our business as a single operating segment and primarily sell our products and packs through a network of independent associates and members who occupy positions in our network. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 219,000 active independent associate and member positions held by individuals in our network associated with the purchase of our products and packs within the last 12 months.

We sell our products through network marketing, which we believe is the most cost-effective way to quickly and effectively introduce our products and communicate information about our business to the global marketplace. Network marketing minimizes upfront costs, as compared to conventional marketing methods, and allows us to be more responsive to the ever-changing overall market conditions, as well as continue to research and develop high quality products and focus on controlled successful international expansion. We believe the network marketing channel also allows us to effectively communicate the potential benefits and unique properties of our proprietary products to our consumers. In addition, network marketing provides our business-building independent associates with an avenue to supplement their income and develop financial freedom by building their own business centered on our business philosophies and unique products.

Our common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (&#8220;Nasdaq&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;MTEX&#8221;. Information for each of our two most recent fiscal years, with respect to our net sales, results of operations, and identifiable assets is set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report.

Business Segment, Products and Product Development

Business Segment. &#160; We conduct our business as a single operating segment &#8211; primarily through sales of nutritional supplements, skin care and anti-aging products, and weight management and fitness products through network marketing distribution channels in 25 countries. For more information with respect to the financial results and conditions of our business segment, including financial information about geographic areas, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Information .

Products. Scientists have discovered that a healthy body consists of many sophisticated components working in harmony to achieve optimal health and wellness and requires cellular communication to function at an optimal level. Scientists also discovered that there are more than 200 monosaccharides that form naturally. Specific monosaccharides are considered vital components for cellular communication in the human body. Furthermore, scientists discovered that these monosaccharides attach themselves to certain proteins, which then form a molecule called glycoprotein . Harper&#8217;s Biochemistry, a leading and nationally recognized biochemistry reference, has recognized that these molecules are found in human glycoproteins, and are believed to be essential in helping to promote and provide effective cell-to-cell communication in the human body.

&#160;

The history of our proprietary ingredients and products is as follows:

&#183; In 1994, we developed and began selling our first products containing Manapol &#174; powder, an ingredient formulated to support cell-to-cell communication. 

&#183; In 1996, we enhanced our products based on the study of glycoproteins and our scientists developed our own proprietary compound, Ambrotose &#174; complex, which we patented. Our Ambrotose &#174; complex is a blend of polysaccharides (composed of monosaccharides) that helps provide support for the immune system. 

&#183; In 2001, we broadened our proprietary ingredients by developing the Ambroglycin &#174; blend, a balanced food-mineral matrix which helps deliver nutrients to the body and which is used in our proprietary Catalyst &#8482; and Glycentials &#174; vitamin/mineral supplements. 

&#183; In 2004, we introduced our proprietary blend of antioxidant nutrients, MTech AO Blend &#174; ingredient, which is used in our proprietary antioxidant Ambrotose AO &#174; product. 

&#183; In 2006, we introduced a unique blend of plant-based minerals, natural vitamins, and standardized phytochemicals for use in our proprietary PhytoMatrix &#174; product. We also introduced a compound used in reformulated Advanced Ambrotose &#174; complex. This compound allows a more potent concentration of the full range of mannose-containing polysaccharides occurring naturally in aloe to be produced in a stable powdered form. 

&#183; In 2007, we introduced into the United States market our skin care and anti-aging line of products that supports skin&#8217;s natural texture, beauty, and elasticity. We also launched our PhytoMatrix &#174; caplets, Advanced Ambrotose &#174; capsules and Manna&#8226;Bears &#8482; supplement into international markets. 

&#183; In 2008, we introduced a proprietary proteolytic enzyme and phytosterol dietary supplement that supports the body&#8217;s natural recovery processes associated with physical activity in our BounceBack &#174; capsules. We also introduced a proprietary version of whey protein peptide technology that assists targeted fat loss when combined with exercise and a healthy diet in our OsoLean &#8482; powder. 

&#183; In 2009, we introduced our Omega-3, which features EPA/DHA essential acids, PhytoBurst &#8482; Nutritional Chews formulated with vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients from food-sourced ingredients, and GI-ProBalance &#8482; Slimstick, which is a synbiotic digestive product containing probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes. In addition, we improved our Ambrotose &#174; products to include beta-Carotene. 

&#183; In 2010, we launched our Mannatech LIFT &#8482; Skin Care System, which is paraben-free and formulated to give skin a more natural youthful appearance. 

&#183; In 2011, we introduced our reformulated version of our Omega-3 supplement, which now includes Vitamin D 3 and features EPA/DHA essential acids. We expanded several previously launched products from our domestic line to our international markets. 

&#183; In 2012, we launched our NutriVerus &#8482; powder, a single product that features all of our core scientific technologies at a very affordable price. This unique, ground-breaking product combines our core glyconutrient technologies with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and stabilized rice bran, all based on Real Food Technology solutions. 

&#183; In 2013, we launched &#362; th&#8482; skin cream, a breakthrough in anti-aging that incorporates Mannatech&#8217;s glyconutrient technology along with a microsphere delivery system that supports more thorough delivery of the active ingredients to all levels of the skin. 

&#183; In 2014, we launched GlycoBOOM&#8482; Advanced Immune Support Supplement, packed with nutrients that are designed to support the body&#8217;s natural defenses. 

&#183; In 2015, Mannatech introduced a new brain supplement, Cognitate&#8482;, featuring a proprietary blend of natural ingredients to aid memory, recall and cognition. 

Mannatech offers products based on Real Food Technology solutions, an approach that offers standardized amounts of nutrients sourced from real foods and plants. We focus on producing products that are from all-natural sources. There are three major categories of our products:

Health , &#160; which offers a variety of nutritional supplements that aid in optimizing overall health and wellness. This category includes a variety of daily nutritional supplements, health solutions for children, and additional nutrients designed to help keep specific body systems at optimal levels.

Product Development . Our product committee continues to focus on potential new products and compounds that help target or promote overall health and wellness. When considering new products and compounds, our product committee considers the following criteria:

&#183; marketability and proprietary nature of the product; 

&#183; demand for the product; 

&#183; competitors&#8217; products; 

&#183; regulatory considerations; 

&#183; availability of ingredients; and 

&#183; data supporting claims of efficacy and safety. 

&#160;

Table of Contents 

To maintain a flexible operating strategy and the ability to increase production capacity, we contract with third-parties to manufacture all of our products, which allows us to effectively respond to fluctuations in demand with minimal investment and helps control our operating costs. We believe our suppliers and manufacturers are capable of meeting our current and projected inventory requirements over the next several years. However, as a safety measure, we continue to identify and approve alternative suppliers and manufacturers to ensure that our global demands are met in a timely manner and to help minimize any risk of business interruption.

Industry Overview

Nutrition Industry 

We operate in the nutritional supplement industry and distribute and sell our products through our own global network marketing channel. The nutritional supplement industry is fast-paced, highly fragmented, and intensely competitive. It includes companies that manufacture and distribute products that are intended to enhance the body&#8217;s performance and well-being. Nutritional supplements include vitamins, minerals, dietary supplements, herbs, botanicals, and compounds derived therefrom. Prior to 1990, all dietary supplements in the United States were tightly regulated by the FDA and only included essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and proteins. In 1990, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act expanded the category to include &#8220;herbs or similar nutritional substances&#8221;, but the FDA maintained control over pre-market approval. However, in 1994, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (&#8220;DSHEA&#8221;) was passed in the United States, drastically changing the dietary supplement marketplace. The DSHEA was instrumental in expanding the category of dietary supplements to further include herbal and botanical supplements and ingredients such as ginseng, fish oils, enzymes, and various mixtures of these ingredients. Under DSHEA, vendors of dietary supplements are now able to educate consumers regarding the effects of certain component ingredients.

Nutritional supplements are available through mass-market retailers, drug stores, supermarkets, discount stores, health food stores, mail order companies, and direct sales organizations. Direct selling, of which network marketing is a significant segment, has grown significantly and has been enhanced in the past decade as a distribution channel due to advancements in technology and communications resulting in improved product distribution and faster dissemination of information.

Direct Selling/Network Marketing Channel 

Since the 1990s, the direct selling and network marketing sales channel has grown in popularity and general acceptance, including acceptance by prominent investors and capital investment groups who have invested in direct selling companies. This has provided direct selling companies with additional recognition and credibility in the growing global marketplace. In addition, many large corporations have diversified their marketing strategy by entering the direct selling arena. Several consumer-product companies have launched their own direct selling businesses with international operations often accounting for the majority of their revenues. Consumers and investors are beginning to realize that direct selling provides unique opportunities and a competitive advantage in today&#8217;s markets. Businesses are able to quickly communicate and develop strong relationships with their customers, bypass expensive ad campaigns, and introduce products and services that would otherwise be difficult to promote through traditional distribution channels such as retail stores. Direct selling is a channel of distribution with healthy cash flow, high return on invested capital, and long-term prospects for global expansion. According to the worldwide direct sales data published by the World Federation of Direct Selling Association, in 2014 approximately 99 million global direct sellers collectively generated annual retail sales of $182.8 billion.

Operating Strengths

1. High-Quality, Innovative, Proprietary Products . We base our product concept on the scientific belief that certain glyconutrients, also known as monosaccharides, are essential for maintaining a healthy immune system. We believe the addition of effective nutritional supplements to a well-balanced diet, coupled with an effective exercise program, will enhance and help maintain optimal health and wellness. We focus on producing products that are from all-natural sources with no synthetic or chemically derived additives. We formulate our products with predominately naturally-occurring, plant-derived, carbohydrate-based, safe ingredients that are designed to use nutrients working through normal physiology to help achieve and maintain optimal health and wellness, rather than developing common synthetic, carbohydrate-based products. 

We believe that our patented blends and formulas distinguish us as a leader in the global nutritional supplements industry. We also believe the use of unique compounds found in our products allows us to effectively differentiate and distinguish our products from those of our competitors.

&#160;

2. Research and Development Efforts . We are steadfast in our commitment to quality-driven research and development. We use systematic processes for the research and development of our unique proprietary product formulas, as well as the identification of quality suppliers and manufacturers. Our research and quality assurance programs are outlined on our corporate websites www.mannatechscience.org , www.mannatech.com , and www.allaboutmannatech.com . 

Mannatech&#8217;s team of experienced researchers and scientists continually reviews the latest published research data, attends scientific conferences, and draws upon its vast knowledge and expertise to develop new products and support existing ones. In addition, this team works in collaboration with other research firms, universities, institutes, and scientists. Our products have been the focus of numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies.

To support our research and development efforts, we have strategic alliances with our suppliers, consultants, and manufacturers that allow us to effectively identify and develop high-quality, innovative, proprietary products that increase our competitive advantage in the marketplace.

These efforts include developing and maintaining quality standards, supporting development efforts for new ingredients and compounds, and improving or enhancing existing products or ingredients. In addition, our research and development team identifies other quality-driven suppliers and manufacturers for both our global and regional needs.

Research and development costs &#8211; relating to new product development, enhancement of existing products, clinical studies and trials, FDA compliance studies, general supplies, internal salaries, third-party contractors, and consulting fees &#8211; were approximately $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.

3. Quality Assurance Program . Mannatech uses only qualified manufacturing contractors to produce, test, and package our finished products. These contractors must be compliant and current with required certifications and they must strictly adhere to our own quality standards for all markets. Certifications and guidelines that our contract manufacturers are required to carry and/or follow include: 

&#183; the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices for manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding of dietary supplements; 

&#183; the FDA&#8217;s Good Manufacturing Practices for human food; 

&#183; the requirements of the Natural Health Products Directorate of Canada; 

&#183; the Korean Food and Drug Administration; 

&#183; certification by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia, when necessary; 

&#183; the European Union&#8217;s Food Supplement Directive and Nutrition and Health Claims Regulations, as well as individual member state legislation; 

&#183; the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration; 

&#183; the Japan Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare; 

&#183; the Singapore Health Sciences Authority; 

&#183; the South African Department of Health and Medicines Control Council; and 

&#183; the Hong Kong Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and Department of Health Drug Office. 

We have an established quality assurance program designed to ensure our manufacturers&#8217; compliance with these certifications and guidelines, and to ensure that proper controls are maintained during the manufacturing, evaluation, packaging, storage, and distribution of our products. These controls include a comprehensive supplier audit and surveillance program, third-party certifications, and continuous product monitoring.

A team of professionals, many of whom have extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry, leads our in-house quality assurance program and continually monitors the quality of our products, including the production process. In addition, they work with suppliers and manufacturers to develop quality standards for raw material components and products, and perform tests and inspections to ensure that finished products are safe and of high quality prior to release.

&#160;

Table of Contents 

We require our dietary supplements to be packaged with seals to help minimize the risk of tampering. We also perform stability studies under both controlled ambient and accelerated temperature storage conditions to ensure label claims throughout the shelf life of our products.

To further ensure product quality, we seek qualified independent organizations to conduct further product testing. To date, numerous products have been tested, and:

&#183; ten products are certified according to the NSF/ANSI 173 Dietary Supplement Standard&#8212;the only American National Standard for dietary supplements. This certification ensures that this product contains only the ingredients indicated on the label and is free of impurities, and that Good Manufacturing Practices were used in the manufacturing facility; and 

&#183; twenty-six products have been tested and confirmed to be gluten-free by Covance Laboratories. 

4. Global Scientific Advisory Board . A charter for an advisory board has been established and will be filled by a combination of independent scientists and doctors from multiple disciplines, along with two members of Mannatech staff. Members of the Global Scientific Advisory Board (GSAB) will review each new and reformulated product to ensure ingredients and products are up to Mannatech&#8217;s high standards and are in line with the latest, viable research. GSAB may also make ingredient and product suggestions for new products. 

5. High-Caliber, Industry-Leading Independent Associates . &#160; Our global team of independent associates is comprised of dedicated, hard-working, high-caliber individuals, many of whom have been associated with the network marketing industry for decades and have been loyal to us since our beginning in 1993. To capitalize on their wealth of knowledge and experience, we sponsor a panel of independent associates, called the &#8220;North American Associate Advisory Council&#8221; (the &#8220;Advisory Council&#8221;), which helps identify and effectively relay the needs of our independent business-building associates to us. The members of the Advisory Council are elected by their peers and serve a three-year term. The Advisory Council meets periodically with our team of senior management to recommend changes, discuss issues, and provide new ideas or concepts, including a full spectrum of innovative ideas for additional quality-driven nutritional supplements aimed at maintaining optimal health and wellness. 

6. Support Philosophy for Our Independent Associates and Members . We are fully committed to providing the highest level of support services to our independent associates and members and believe that we meet expectations and build customer loyalty through the following: 

&#183; offering highly-personalized and responsive customer service; 

&#183; offering a satisfaction guarantee product return policy; 

&#183;

providing comprehensive corporate websites ( www.mannatech.com , www.allaboutmannatech.com , www.mannatechscience.org , www.library.mannatech.com , www.events.mannatech.com , www.mannafest.com and www.mannatechlive.com ), that provide instant access to Internet ordering, marketing, technical and educational information, and unique and innovative marketing tools;

&#183; maintaining an extensive web-based downline management system called Success Tracker &#8482; that provides access to web conferencing and downline organization reporting for our independent associates at minimal costs; 

&#183; offering, in the United States and Canada, an effective compilation of online marketing and training tools, including MannaSocial, and our Navig8 Global Business System; 

&#183; offering updated training/orientation and compliance programs for our independent associates; 

&#183; providing strategically based distribution fulfillment centers to ensure products are shipped on time and at minimal cost; and

7. Flexible Operating Strategy . &#160; We believe efficiency, focus, and flexibility are paramount to our operations. For more than a decade, we have contracted with third parties to supply and manufacture our proprietary raw materials and products, which we believe allows us to minimize capital expenditures, capitalize on such parties&#8217; expertise, and build additional resources for strategic alliances in the areas of distribution and logistics, product registration, and export requirements. By contracting with various suppliers and manufacturers and by outsourcing distribution for all of our operations, we believe we can quickly adapt operations to current demands in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner. We monitor the performance of our third party contractors to ensure they maintain a high quality of service. In addition, we identify alternative sources for our raw materials suppliers and finished goods manufacturers to help prevent any risk of interruption in production should any existing contractors become unable to perform satisfactorily. 

8. Experience and Depth of Our Management Team and Board of Directors . &#160; We believe that our team of executives has extensive experience in every aspect of business operations and is highly focused on our success. At December 31, 2015, our Board of Directors is composed of seven directors, including five independent directors. We believe our board members have a wealth of knowledge and experience in most aspects of our business operations and are especially well versed in network marketing, finance, nutritional products, regulatory matters, and corporate governance. Our entire management team is committed to delivering high-quality products and superior service. 

Business Strategy

Our long-term goal is to be one of the world&#8217;s leading network marketing companies founded on the best science-based proprietary products by incorporating a powerful global independent network distribution model into our social entrepreneur consumption program. To achieve our goal, we believe we must focus on the following business priorities: 

&#183; Strengthening our Financial Results and Adding Value to Our Shareholders and Independent Associates. We focus on improving financial results by striving to increase our revenues in both our domestic and foreign operations and to control our operating costs. 

&#183; Attracting New Independent Associates and Retaining Existing Independent Associates. &#160; We continually examine our global associate career and compensation plan and periodically offer incentives in order to attract, motivate, and retain independent associates. We believe our global associate career and compensation plan encourages greater associate retention, motivation, and productivity. 

&#183; Carefully Planning and Executing New Market Entries. &#160; In order to expand efficiently around the globe, we must continue to present maximum opportunity to our current independent associates as well as those who will join us in the future. 

&#183; Developing New Products and Enhancing Existing Products . &#160; We continue to focus on new areas for future product development. We continue our research efforts and strive to ensure that all of our products are made from high quality, effective ingredients that contain one or more of our proprietary compounds, which we believe supports our goal to be a cutting-edge industry leader. We expect that any future products we develop will further complement and enhance our existing products. 

Intellectual Property

Trademarks. &#160; We pursue registrations for various trademarks associated with our key products and branding initiatives. As of December 31, 2015, we had 29 registered trademarks in the United States and six trademark applications pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. As of December 31, 2015, we had 328 registered trademarks in 38 countries and 32 trademark applications pending in 14 foreign jurisdictions. Globally, the protection available in foreign jurisdictions may not be as extensive as the protection available to us in the United States. Where available, we rely on common law trademark rights to protect our unregistered trademarks, even though such rights do not provide us with the same level of protection as afforded by a United States federal trademark registration. Common law trademark rights are limited to the geographic area in which the trademark is actually used. A United States federal trademark registration enables us to stop infringing use of the trademark by a third party anywhere in the United States provided the unauthorized third party user does not have superior common law rights in the trademark within a specific geographical area of a particular state or region prior to the date our mark federally registers. In the United States (and in many foreign jurisdictions) a registered trademark is valid for ten years and may be renewed subject to the trademark owner demonstrating continued use of the mark in commerce.

&#160;

Table of Contents 

Patents. &#160; The Company applies for patent protection in various countries for the technology related to our product formulations. As of December 31, 2015, we had 54 patents for technology related to our Ambrotose &#174; formulation, five of which are in the United States and the remainder of which are in 34 foreign jurisdictions. Overall, as of December 31, 2015, 118 patents have been issued, granted and validated to Mannatech in major global markets for the technology relating to our Ambrotose &#174; , Ambrotose AO &#174; , GI-ProBalance&#8482;, PhytoMatrix &#174; , NutriVerus&#8482;, and PhytoBurst &#174; product formulations, as well as in the field of biomarker assays. Currently, we have 40 patent applications pending in various jurisdictions relating to the technology supporting the above listed products. Patent protection means that the patented invention cannot be commercially made, used, distributed or sold without the patent owner's consent. These patent rights are usually enforced in a court, which, in most jurisdictions, holds the authority to stop patent infringement. The protection is granted for a limited period, generally 20 years. In most jurisdictions, renewal annuities or maintenance fees must be paid regularly during the term of the patent to keep the patent in force.

Associate Distribution System

Overview . Our sales philosophy is to distribute our products through network marketing channels where consumers purchase products for personal consumption or resale. Members purchase our products for personal use at a discounted retail value, but do not participate in our global associate career and compensation plan. Independent associates purchase our products at a discounted wholesale value and are eligible to participate in our global associate career and compensation plan. All of our associates are independent contractors. We provide each new independent associate with our policies and procedures that require the independent associates to comply with regulatory guidelines and act in a consistent and professional manner.

Our revenues are heavily dependent upon the retention and productivity of independent associates who help us achieve long-term growth. We believe the introduction of new innovative incentives, such as travel incentives, will continue to motivate our independent associates and help expand our global purchasing base. We remain actively committed to expanding the number of our independent associates through recruitment, support, motivation, and incentives. We had approximately 219,000 active independent associate and member positions held by individuals purchasing our products or packs during the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, and we had approximately 230,000 active independent associate and member positions held by individuals purchasing our products or packs during the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. We have a loyalty program through which consumers earn loyalty points from qualified automatic orders, which can be applied to future purchases.

Independent Associate Development . Network marketing consists of enrolling individuals who build a network of independent associates, members, and retail customers who purchase products. We support our independent associates by providing an array of support services that can be tailored to meet individual needs, including:

&#183; offering educational meetings and corporate-sponsored events that emphasize business-building and compliance related information;

Our global associate career and compensation plan consists of ten independent associate achievement levels; from lowest to highest, these include regional, national, senior national, executive, senior executive, presidential, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. These achievement levels are determined by the growth and volume of the independent associates&#8217; direct and indirect commissionable net sales, as well as expanding their networks, which are all assigned a point volume. Promotional materials and training aids are not assigned a point volume. This point volume system, referred to as our global seamless downline structure, allows independent associates to build their network by expanding their existing downlines into all international markets. Our global associate career and compensation plan is intended to comply with all applicable governmental regulations that govern the various aspects of payments to independent associates in each country.

Based upon our knowledge of industry-related network marketing compensation plans, we believe our global associate career and compensation plan remains strong in the industry and is currently among the most financially rewarding plans offered. Together, our commissions and incentives range approximately from 39% to 43% of our consolidated net sales.

Our global associate career and compensation plan pays various types of commissions and incentives based upon a point system that calculates a percentage of the independent associate&#8217;s commissionable direct and indirect net product sales and the attainment of certain associate achievement levels. All payments to our independent associates are made after they have earned their commissions. We believe our global associate career and compensation plan fairly compensates our independent associates at every stage of building their business by quickly rewarding an independent associate for both the breadth and depth of their global seamless downline structure.

Our global associate career and compensation plan identifies and pays 18 types of commissions to our qualified independent associates, which are based on the following:

&#183; generating product sales from an independent associate&#8217;s global downline to earn certain achievement levels; 

&#183; enrolling new independent associates or members who place a product order; 

&#183; obtaining certain achievement levels and enrolling other independent associates who place qualifying orders; 

&#183; obtaining and developing certain achievement levels within their downline organizations to qualify for additional bonuses; and 

&#183; various other incentive programs. 

Management of Independent Associates . We actively monitor our independent associates&#8217; activities related to sales of our products and the promotion of certain business opportunities by requiring our independent associates to abide by our policies and procedures. However, we have limited control over the actions of our independent associates. To aid in our monitoring efforts, we provide each independent associate with a copy of our policies and procedures prior to or upon signing up as an independent associate. We also use various media formats to distribute changes to our mandatory policies and procedures, including our corporate website, conference calls, educational meetings, corporate events, seminars, and webcasts.

Our legal/compliance department, in cooperation with other departments and associates, periodically evaluates the conduct of our independent associates and the need for new or revised policies and procedures. Our monitoring efforts include reviewing associates&#8217; websites, promotional materials, and meetings. Our legal/compliance program assists in maintaining high ethical standards among our independent associates, which helps our independent associates in their sales efforts.

To help manage our associates, our legal/compliance department periodically monitors independent associates&#8217; websites for content. In addition, associates may use our anonymous compliance reporting system to report non-compliant websites to the compliance department, which then further investigates such websites. In an effort to decrease the number of independent websites owned by our independent associates and to preserve and protect our trademarks, we offer standardized personal web pages to our associates that help them with their sales efforts and provides consistent, standardized information, and education. We also offer our independent associates and members a free standardized website through our Navig8 Global Business System service.

Table of Contents 

Our legal/compliance program also provides our independent associates with a standardized and anonymous complaint process. When a complaint is filed against an independent associate, our legal/compliance department conducts a mandatory investigation of the allegations, if warranted. Depending on the nature of the violation, we may suspend or terminate the non-compliant associate&#8217;s agreement or we may impose various sanctions, including written warnings, probation, withholding commissions, and termination of associate status. We will terminate any associate&#8217;s agreement for making claims that our products can treat, cure, mitigate or prevent any disease, unless such claim is de minimus and isolated.

&#160;

Product Return Policy. We stand behind our packs and products and believe we offer a reasonable and industry-standard product return policy to all of our customers. We do not resell returned products. Refunds are not processed until proper approval is obtained. All refunds must be processed and returned in the same form of payment that was originally used in the sale. Each country in which we operate has specific product return guidelines. However, we allow our independent associates and members to exchange products as long as the products are unopened and in good condition. Our return policies for our retail customers and our independent associates and members are as follows:

&#183; Retail Customer Product Return Policy. This policy allows a retail customer to return any of our products to the original independent associate who sold the product and receive a full cash refund by the independent associate for the first 180 days following the product&#8217;s purchase, if located in the United States and Canada, and for the first 90 days following the product&#8217;s purchase in the remaining countries. The independent associate may then return or exchange the product based on the independent associate product return policy. 

&#183; Independent Associate and Member Product Return Policy. &#160; This policy allows the independent associate or member to return an order within one year of the purchase date upon terminating his/her account. If an independent associate or member returns a product unopened and in good condition, he/she may receive a full refund minus a 10% fee. We may also allow the independent associate or member to receive a full satisfaction guarantee refund if they have tried the product and are not satisfied for any reason, excluding promotional materials. This satisfaction guarantee refund applies in the United States and Canada, only for the first 180 days following the product&#8217;s purchase, and applies in the remaining countries for the first 90 days following the product&#8217;s purchase; however, any commissions earned by an independent associate will be deducted from the refund. If we discover abuse of the refund policy, we may terminate the independent associate&#8217;s or member&#8217;s account. 

Information Technology Systems

Our information technology and e-commerce systems include a transaction-processing database, financial systems, an associate management system, and comprehensive management tools that are designed to:

&#183; minimize the time required to process orders and distribute products; 

&#183; provide customized ordering information; 

&#183; quickly respond to information requests, including providing detailed and accurate information to independent associates about qualification and downline activity; 

&#183; provide detailed reports about paid commissions and incentives; 

&#183; support order processing and customer service departments; and 

&#183; help monitor, analyze, and report operating and financial results. 

To complement our transaction database, we developed a comprehensive management tool called Success Tracker &#8482; that is used both internally and by our independent associates to manage and optimize their business organizations. With this tool, independent associates have constant access to graphs, maps, alerts, and reports on the status of their individual organizations, which helps to optimize their earnings.

We also maintain a written service continuity disaster recovery plan, which was developed using the guidelines published by the National Institute of Standards of Technology to minimize the risk of loss due to any interruption in business. Our disaster recovery plan encompasses all critical aspects of our business and identifies contacts and resources. Additionally, we perform daily backup procedures and proactively monitor various software, hardware, and network infrastructure systems. We also perform routine maintenance procedures and periodically upgrade our software and hardware to help ensure that our systems work efficiently and effectively and to minimize the risk of business interruption. Although we maintain an extensive disaster recovery plan, a long-term failure or impairment of any of our information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to conduct day-to-day business. Please see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; If our information technology system fails, our operations could suffer.&#8221;

Government Regulations

Domestic Regulations . &#160; In the United States, governmental regulations, laws, administrative determinations, court decisions, and similar legal requirements at the federal, state, and local levels regulate companies such as ours and network marketing activities. Such regulations address, among other things:

&#160;

&#183; direct selling and network marketing systems; 

&#183; transfer pricing and similar regulations affecting the amount of foreign taxes and customs duties paid; 

&#183; taxation of independent associates and requirements to collect taxes and maintain appropriate records; 

&#183; how a company manufactures, packages, labels, distributes, imports, sells, and stores products; 

&#183; product ingredients; 

&#183; product claims; 

&#183; advertising; and 

&#183; the extent to which companies may be responsible for claims made by independent associates. 

The following governmental agencies regulate various aspects of our business and our products in the United States:

&#183; the Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;); 

&#183; the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;); 

&#183; the Consumer Product Safety Commission; 

&#183; the Department of Agriculture; 

&#183; the Environmental Protection Agency; 

&#183; the United States Postal Service; 

&#183; state attorney general offices; and 

&#183; various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. 

The FDA regulates the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, storage, labeling, promotion, distribution, and sale of foods, dietary supplements, over-the-counter drugs, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals. In January 2000, the FDA issued a final rule called &#8220;Statements Made for Dietary Supplements Concerning the Effect of the Product on the Structure or Function of the Body&#8221;. In the rule and its preamble, the FDA distinguished between permitted claims under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the &#8220;Act&#8221;) relating to the effect of dietary supplements on the structure or functions of the body, and impermissible direct or implied claims of the effect of dietary supplements on any disease. In June 2007, the FDA issued a rule, as authorized under the Act that defined current Good Manufacturing Practices in the manufacture and holding of dietary supplements. Effective January 1, 2006, legislation required specific disclosures in labeling where a food, including a dietary supplement, contains an ingredient derived from any of eight named allergens. Legislation passed at the end of 2006 now requires us to report to the FDA any reports of &#8220;serious adverse events&#8221; associated with the use of a dietary supplement or an over-the-counter drug that is not covered by new drug approval reporting. The FDA created the Office of Dietary Supplements (&#8220;ODSP&#8221;) on December 21, 2015. The creation of this new office elevates the FDA&#8217;s program from its previous status as a division under the Office of Nutrition and Dietary Supplements. ODSP will continue to monitor the safety of dietary supplements.

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, referred to as DSHEA, revised the provisions of the Act concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements and statutorily created a new class entitled &#8220;dietary supplements.&#8221; Dietary supplements include vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and other dietary substances used to supplement diets. A majority of our products are considered dietary supplements as outlined in the Act, which requires us to maintain evidence that a dietary supplement is reasonably safe. A manufacturer of dietary supplements may make statements concerning the effect of a supplement or a dietary ingredient on the structure or any function of the body, in accordance with the regulations described above. As a result, we make such statements with respect to our products. In some cases, such statements must be accompanied by a statutory statement that the claim has not been evaluated by the FDA and that the product is not intended to treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent any disease, and the FDA must be notified of such claim within 30 days of first use.

&#160;

Table of Contents 

The FDA oversees product safety, manufacturing, and product information, such as claims on a product&#8217;s label, package inserts, and accompanying literature. The FDA has promulgated regulations governing the labeling and marketing of dietary and nutritional supplement products. The regulations include:

&#183; the identification of dietary or nutritional supplements and their nutrition and ingredient labeling; 

&#183; requirements related to the wording used for claims about nutrients, health claims, and statements of nutritional support; 

&#183; labeling requirements for dietary or nutritional supplements for which &#8220;high potency,&#8221; &#8220;antioxidant,&#8221; and &#8220;trans-fatty acids&#8221; claims are made; 

&#183; notification procedures for statements on dietary and nutritional supplements; and 

&#183; pre-market notification procedures for new dietary ingredients in nutritional supplements. 

We develop and maintain product substantiation dossiers, which contain the scientific literature pertinent to each product and its ingredients. An independent scientist reviews these dossiers, which provide the scientific basis for product claims. We periodically update our substantiation program for evidence for each of our product claims and notify the FDA of certain types of performance claims made in connection with our products.

In certain markets, including the United States, specific claims made with respect to a product may change the regulatory status of a product. For example, a product sold as a dietary supplement but marketed as a treatment, prevention, or cure for a specific disease or condition would likely be considered by the FDA or other regulatory bodies as unapproved and thus an illegal drug. To maintain the product&#8217;s status as a dietary supplement, its labeling and marketing must comply with the provisions in DSHEA and the FDA&#8217;s extensive regulations. As a result, we have procedures in place to promote and assure compliance by our employees and independent associates related to the requirements of DSHEA, the Act, and various other regulations.

Dietary supplements are also subject to the Nutrition, Labeling and Education Act and various other acts that regulate health claims, ingredient labeling, and nutrient content claims that characterize the level of nutrients in a product. These acts prohibit the use of any specific health claim for dietary supplements unless the health claim is supported by significant scientific research and is pre-approved by the FDA.

The FTC and other regulators regulate marketing practices and advertising of a company and its products. In the past several years, regulators have instituted various enforcement actions against numerous dietary supplement companies for false and/or misleading marketing practices, as well as misleading advertising of products. These enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and significant monetary judgments against the companies and/or individuals involved. Regulators require a company to convey product claims clearly and accurately and further require marketers to maintain adequate substantiation for their claims. More specifically, the FTC requires such substantiation to be competent and reliable scientific evidence and requires a company to have a reasonable basis for the expressed and implied product claim before it disseminates an advertisement. A reasonable basis is determined based on the claims made, how the claims are presented in the context of the entire advertisement, and how the claims are qualified. The FTC&#8217;s standard for evaluating substantiation is designed to ensure that consumers are protected from false and/or misleading claims by requiring scientific substantiation of product claims at the time such claims are first made. The failure to have this substantiation violates the Federal Trade Commission Act.

Due to the diverse scope of regulations applicable to our products and the various regulators enforcing these requirements, determining how to conform to all requirements is often open to interpretation and debate. However, our policy is to fully cooperate with any regulatory agency in connection with any inquiries or other investigations. We can make no assurances that regulators will not question our actions in the future, even though we continue to make efforts to comply with all applicable regulations, inquiries, and investigations.

International Regulations . We are also subject to extensive regulations in each country in which we operate. Currently we sell our products in three regions: (i) North America/South America (the United States, Canada, Colombia and Mexico); (ii) EMEA (Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, the Republic of Ireland, Namibia, the Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom); and (iii) Asia/Pacific (Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong).

&#183; the Regulation of Act 1700 of 2013, Article 2.2.50 on December 27, 2013 governs the Activities of Network Marketing or Multilevel Marketing companies through monitoring compensation plans, contract conditions and enacting preventive suspension, in Colombia. 

&#160;

Regulations Regarding Network Marketing System and Our Products. Our network marketing system and our global associate career and compensation plan are also subject to a number of governmental regulations including various federal and state statutes administered by the FTC, various state authorities, and foreign government agencies. The legal requirements governing network marketing organizations are directed, in part, to ensure that product sales are ultimately made to consumers. In addition, earnings within a network marketing company must be based on the sale of products rather than compensation for (i) the recruitment of distributors or associates, (ii) investments in the organization, or (iii) other non-retail sales-related criteria. For instance, some countries limit the amount associates may earn from commissions on sales by other distributors or independent associates that are not directly sponsored by that distributor or independent associate. Prior to expanding our operations into any foreign jurisdiction, we must first obtain regulatory approval for our network marketing system in jurisdictions requiring such approval. To help ensure regulatory compliance, we rely on the advice of our outside legal counsel and regulatory consultants in each specific country.

As a network marketing company, we are also subject to regulatory oversight, including routine inquiries and enforcement actions, from various United States state attorneys general offices. Each state has specific acts referred to as Little FTC Acts. Each state act is similar to the federal laws. As a result, each state may perform its own inquiries about our organization and business practices, including allegations related to distributors or independent associates. To combat such industry-specific risk, we provide a copy of our published associate policies and procedures to each independent associate, publish these policies on our corporate website, and provide educational seminars and publications. In addition, we maintain a legal/compliance department to cooperate with all regulatory agencies and investigate allegations of improper conduct by our independent associates.

In Canada, our network marketing system is regulated by both national and provincial laws. Under Canada&#8217;s Federal Competition Act, we must make sure that any representations relating to compensation to our independent associates or made to prospective new independent associates constitute fair, reasonable, and timely disclosure and that such representations meet other legal requirements of the Federal Competition Act. All Canadian provinces and territories, other than Ontario, have legislation requiring that we register or become licensed as a direct seller within that province to maintain the standards of the direct selling industry and to protect consumers. Some other Canadian provinces require that both we and our independent associates be licensed as direct sellers.

In Colombia, our network marketing system is governed by the Regulation Act of 1700 of 2013 on Activities of Network Marketing or Multilevel Marketing. It specifies requirements for our compensation plan, contracts, corporate governance and penalties for violations. Data processing is regulated by Act No. 1581 of 2012 and Regulatory Decree No. 1377 of 2013 which protects personal data and requires that Mannatech to obtain authorization from the owner to collect personal data. The distribution of nutritional supplement products is governed by Invima, which is in charge of inspecting and monitoring the marketing and manufacturing of health products.

In Mexico, as in many other markets, there are no specific regulations directly related to the direct selling or network marketing industry. However, all product sales and business offerings must comply with the Consumer Protection Law, which is enforced by the Consumer Protection Agency. Food supplements and medicines are subject to the Health Law and various Official Mexican Standards, which are enforced by the Health Ministry and The Federal Commission for Protection Against Sanitary Risk. Mexican Customs Law and its regulations govern the general importation of our products into Mexico. We are subject to the Mexican Corporate Law, which is enforced by the Mexican courts and to the Federal Labor Law enforced by the Labor Courts. In Mexico, we are also subject to the Foreign Investment Law and its regulations administered by the Ministry of Economy. We are required to register before the Mexican System for Business Information at the appropriate Business Chamber under the Organizations Law.

In Australia, our network marketing system is subject to Australia&#8217;s federal and local regulations. Our global associate career and compensation plan is designed to comply with Australian law and the requirements of Australia&#8217;s Trade Practices Act.

These regulations enforce specific kinds of business or trade practices and regulate the general conduct of network marketing companies. The Commerce Commission also enforces the Consumer Guarantees Act, which establishes specific rights and remedies with respect to transactions involving the provisions of goods and services to consumers. Finally, the New Zealand Commerce Commission and the Ministry of Health both enforce the Door-to-Door Sales Act of 1967 and the NZ Medicines Act, which govern the conduct of our independent associates.

In Taiwan, our network marketing system, overall operations and trade practices are governed by the Fair Trade Law and the Consumer Protection Law. Such laws contain a wide range of provisions covering trade practices.

In Denmark, the notion of door-to-door selling is prohibited. As a result, under Danish law, the trader is not allowed to contact the consumer at his home, place of work, or other non-public place in order to conclude a contract on certain subjects. However, the prohibition has an exemption when the consumer asks the trader for a contact in writing or upon written prior consent. In addition, the Danish Marketing Practices Act, the Guidelines from the Danish Consumerombudsman and the rules contained in the Danish Consumer Contracts Act govern our network marketing system. There is no requirement for pre-approval of our products in Denmark; however, our products are subject to a yearly inspection carried out by the Food authorities. Further, all our activities are subject to Self Inspection, the results of which are also controlled once a year by the Food authorities. The rules for marketing and sale of dietary supplements are covered by the Danish Executive Order on Food Supplements, as well as by the Danish Act on Foodstuffs and various EU-regulations. Denmark also subjects the marketing of a company&#8217;s food supplements to a notification procedure (with a pre-market approval process for certain substances), before a product may be lawfully marketed in Denmark. Full product compliance with all Danish provisions is reviewed by the Food authorities once a year.

In Germany, there is no specific legal regulation covering network marketing company practices. However, under certain circumstances network marketing systems may have to follow the German Unfair Competition Act.

In addition, direct selling operations are governed by the Industrial Code, which requires direct sellers to hold itinerant trader&#8217;s cards. The German Regulation on food supplements and the German Law on food and feed govern vitamin and mineral substances and herbs and other substances, respectively.

In South Africa, the Consumer Affairs Act 1988, the Competition Act 1998, and the Advertising Standards Authority Code of Advertising Practice (a voluntary code enforced by the media) govern business practices. The products are classified as complementary medicines for which there are no specific regulations. The Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act 1972, and the Medicines and Related Substances Act 1965 currently apply.

In Austria, the Austrian Trade Law of 1994 (Novelle 2002) prohibits the offer of direct sale to an individual consumer of food supplement and cosmetic products. The provision, however, has generally not been enforced in recent years and sales made via the Internet or mail order or made to a non-consumer distributor do not fall under this prohibition. The Austrian Trade Law is predominantly administered through the National Ministry of Economy and Labor. Our business operations within Austria are conducted from beyond the borders of Austria, which is the common practice in our industry. Our distributors qualify as &#8220;traders&#8221; for purposes of Austrian state and municipal laws. Traders are regulated by the local chambers of commerce and must obtain licenses from the respective chambers of commerce. Regulation of food supplements and cosmetics is generally harmonized throughout the EU and must conform to EU standards. Austrian-specific food regulations include the Food Safety and Consumer Protection Law (2006), supporting ordinances to this law, the Food Supplement Law, and the Austrian Food Codex, which is primarily administered by the National Ministry of Health, Office for Health and Food Security, and the Local Health Authority.

In Sweden, various provisions of the Consumer Sales Act (1990), the Marketing Practices Act (2008), the Distance and Doorstep Sales Act (2005), the Product Liability Act (1992), the Product Safety Act (2004), and the Companies Act (2005) all serve to govern our multi-level marketing and business activities. The Food Act (2006) provides regulations and guidelines for the sale of food and food supplements. We are subject to the authority of the Swedish Consumer Office, the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the Swedish Tax Office, Swedish Customs, Medical Products Agency, and the National Food Administration. As in all EU countries various EU regulations and guidelines apply.

In the Netherlands, the Food and Consumer Product and the Unfair Trade Practices Act are the most relevant legislations relating to our business practices. The first is enforced by the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority and the latter is enforced by the Consumer Authority. Furthermore, various EU regulations apply as well as the Dutch Door to Door Selling Act, and all provisions of the Dutch Civil Code with particular emphasis to those regulations dealing with general terms and conditions, and those regarding misleading advertising.

Norway exercises a border control of products and their composition upon importation. Import products must be registered in an Import Reporting Registry, and the regulations are enforced by the customs authorities. Our products must be compliant with Norwegian regulations in order to be admitted for admission through customs into Norway. In Norway Door-to-Door Selling is allowed, provided the Guidelines from the Norwegian Consumer Agency are followed. Likewise, telephone-selling is allowed provided the agency&#8217;s guidelines are followed. Home-selling in Norway is also allowed. All of our sales in Norway are subject to a 14-day right to cancel by the consumers.

In the Czech Republic, there are no specific regulations or special legislation that limit the network marketing industry. Network marketing is considered to be a specific form of general sale and is generally subject to various provisions of the Business Code (Act. Nr. 513/1992 Coll.), Civil Code (Act. Nr. 40/1964 Coll.), Labor Code (Act. No. 262/2006 Coll.), Trade License Act (Act. Nr. 455/1991 Coll.), Consumer Protection Act (Act. Nr. 634/1992 Coll.) and related legislation. The status of independent contractor/sales distributor is primarily regulated by the Trade License Act (Act. Nr. 455/1991 Coll), which requires sales distributors to maintain a trade license. Additionally, the regulation of food supplements is harmonized throughout the EU and, therefore, the supplements must conform to the EU standards. Enforcement of Czech-specific regulations is undertaken by the Ministry of Health, National Institute of Public Health, State Institute of Drug Control and the Czech Agriculture and Food Inspection Authority.

In Estonia, there are no specific regulations governing the network marketing business, but the business is generally regulated under the Consumer Protection Act. Also, independent distributors are required to register as sole proprietors with the Tax and Customs Board before entry into associate agreements. Mannatech must also comply with various EU regulations. The Veterinary and Food Board also enforces local legislation including Estonia Food Act and Medicine Act.

In Finland, the Finnish Food Act, the Finnish Food Packaging and Consumer Protection Acts, Act on Unfair Business Practice Act, Decrees and other regulations, as well as applicable EU regulations, regulate Mannatech products, product information, and the way Mannatech promotes its products. Additionally, certain principals applicable to multi-level marketing under the Money Collection Act (255/2006) apply to Mannatech&#8217;s activities. Lastly, persons engaged in the manufacture, commission of manufacture or import of food supplements, must submit a written notification to the Finnish Food Safety Authority when marketing and selling in Finland. A notification is also required when the composition of preparation changes in terms of characteristics of substances or the preparation is withdrawn from the market.

In the Republic of Ireland, the primarily relevant legislation is the Consumer Protection Act of 2007, the Distance Selling Regulations Act of 2001, and the codes of practice of the Direct Selling Association of Ireland and the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland. There is no equivalent in Irish law to the UK Trading Schemes Regulations, but the Direct Selling Association of Ireland codes, while not as prescriptive, contain many similar requirements. Lastly, the regulation of food and food supplements are generally harmonized throughout the EU and must conform to EU standards.

In Hong Kong, our network marketing system, overall operations and trade practices are governed by a number of Ordinances including the Sale of Goods Ordinance, the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, the Pyramid Schemes Prohibition Ordinance and the Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance. Such Ordinances include a number of consumer protections (including data privacy) and regulate trading practices. Importation and registration of our products permitting their sale in Hong Kong are controlled by the Import and Export Ordinance and its subsidiary legislation, the Import and Export (Registration) Regulations.

In Spain, our network marketing system, overall operations, and trade practices are governed by the Retail Trade Act and the Spanish Consumers Act. Such laws contain a wide range of provisions covering trade practices, including multi-level marketing, pyramid sales, warranties and product liability. While regulation of food supplements and cosmetics is generally harmonized throughout the EU and must conform to EU standards, the Spanish Agency for Medicines and Health Products oversees cosmetics and the Spanish Agency for Consumer Affairs, Food Safety and Nutrition oversees food supplements.

Other Regulations . Our operations are also subject to a variety of other regulations, including:

&#183; social security taxes; 

&#183; value-added taxes; 

&#183; goods and services taxes; 

&#183; sales taxes; 

&#183; consumption taxes; 

&#183; income taxes; 

&#183; customs duties; 

&#183; employee/independent contractor regulations; 

&#183; employment, service pay, retirement pay, and profit sharing requirements; 

&#183; import/export regulations; 

&#183; federal securities laws; and 

&#183; antitrust laws. 

In many markets, we are limited by the types of rules we can impose on our independent associates, including rules in connection with cooling off periods and termination criteria. If we do not comply with these requirements, we may be required to pay social security, unemployment benefits, workers&#8217; compensation, or other tax or tax-type assessments on behalf of our independent associates and may incur severance obligations if we terminate one of our independent associates.

In some countries, including the United States, we are also governed by regulations concerning the activities of our independent associates. Regulators may find that we are ultimately responsible for the conduct of our independent associates and may request or require that we take additional steps to ensure that our independent associates comply with these regulations. The types of conduct governed by these types of regulations may include:

&#183; claims made about our products; 

&#183; promises or claims of income or other promises or claims by our independent associates; and 

&#183; sales of products in markets where the products have not been approved or licensed. 

In some markets, including the United States, improper product claims by independent associates could result in our products being overly scrutinized by regulatory authorities. This review could result in our products being re-classified as drugs or classified into another product category that requires stricter regulations or labeling changes.

We continuously research and monitor the laws governing the conduct of our independent associates, our operations, our global associate career and compensation plan, and our products and sales aids within each of the countries in which we sell our products. We provide education for our independent associates regarding acceptable business conduct in each market through our policies and procedures, seminars, and other training materials and programs. However, we cannot guarantee that our independent associates will always abide by our policies and procedures and/or act in a professional and consistent manner.

Competition

Other Nutritional Supplement Companies . &#160; The nutritional supplement industry is steadily gaining momentum and is intensely competitive. Our current direct competitors selling similar nutritional products include:

&#183; AdvoCare International 

&#183; GNC Holdings, Inc.; 

&#183; Herbalife Ltd.; 

&#183; Nature&#8217;s Sunshine Products, Inc.; 

&#183; NOW Foods; 

&#183; Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.; 

&#183; Reliv&#8217; International, Inc; 

&#183; Solgar Vitamin and Herb Company, Inc.; 

&#183; Swanson Health Products; 

&#183; Usana Health Sciences, Inc.; and 

&#183; Vitamin Shoppe Industries, Inc. 

Network Marketing . Nutritional supplements are offered for sale in a variety of ways. Network marketing has a limited number of individuals interested in participating in the industry, and we must compete for those types of individuals. We believe network marketing is the best sales approach to sell our products for the following reasons:

&#183; our products can be introduced into the global marketplace at a much lower up-front cost than through conventional methods; 

&#183; our key ingredients and differential components found in our proprietary products can be better explained through network marketing; 

&#183; the network marketing approach can quickly and easily adapt to changing market conditions; 

&#183; consumers appreciate the convenience of ordering from home, through a sales person, by telephone, or on the Internet; and 

&#183; network marketing enables independent associates to earn financial rewards. 

We compete with other direct selling and network marketing companies for new independent associates and for retention of continuing independent associates. Some of our competitors have longer operating histories, are better known, or have greater financial resources. These companies include:

&#183; Amway Corporation; 

&#183; Forever Living Products, Inc.; 

&#183; Herbalife International, Inc.; 

&#183; Mary Kay, Inc.; 

&#183; Nature&#8217;s Sunshine Products, Inc.; 

&#183; Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc.; 

&#183; Reliv&#8217; International, Inc.; 

Table of Contents 

&#183; Shaklee Worldwide; and 

&#183; Usana Health Sciences, Inc. 

&#160;

The availability of independent associates decreases when other network marketing companies successfully recruit and retain independent associates for their operations. We believe we can successfully compete for independent associates by emphasizing the following:

&#183; our unique patented, proprietary blend of high-quality products; 

&#183; our 22 year track record in the business of selling nutritional products; 

&#183; our model which does not require our independent associates to carry inventory or accounts receivable; 

&#183; our unique and financially rewarding global associate career and compensation plan; 

&#183; our innovative marketing and educational tools; and 

&#183; our easy and convenient delivery system.
