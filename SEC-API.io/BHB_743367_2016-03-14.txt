 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Organization 

Bar Harbor Bankshares (the &#147;Company&#148;) (&#147;BHB&#148;) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Maine on January 19, 1984. At December 31, 2015, the Company had total consolidated assets of $1.58 billion and total shareholders&#146; equity of $154.2 million.

The Company has one, wholly-owned first tier operating subsidiary, Bar Harbor Bank &#38; Trust (the &#147;Bank&#148;), a community bank, which offers a wide range of deposit, loan, and related banking products, as well as brokerage services provided through a third-party brokerage arrangement. In addition, the Company offers trust and investment management services through its second tier subsidiary, Bar Harbor Trust Services (&#147;Trust Services&#148;), a Maine chartered non-depository trust company. These products and services are offered to individuals, businesses, not-for-profit organizations and municipalities.

The Company is a bank holding company (&#147;BHC&#148;) registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#147;BHC Act&#148;), and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#147;FRB&#148;). The Company is also a Maine Financial Institution Holding Company for the purposes of the laws of the state of Maine, and as such is subject to the jurisdiction of the Superintendent (the &#147;Superintendent&#148;) of the Maine Bureau of Financial Institutions (&#147;BFI&#148;).

Bar Harbor Bank &#38; Trust 

The Bank, originally founded in 1887, is a Maine financial institution, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#147;FDIC&#148;) up to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Bank is subject to the supervision, regulation, and examination of the FDIC and the BFI. It is not a member of the Federal Reserve Bank.

The Bank has fifteen (15) branch offices located throughout downeast, midcoast and central Maine, including its principal office located at 82 Main Street, Bar Harbor. The Bank&#146;s branch offices are located in Hancock, Washington, Knox, Kennebec and Sagadahoc Counties, representing the Bank&#146;s principal market areas. The Hancock County offices, in addition to Bar Harbor, are located in Blue Hill, Deer Isle, Ellsworth, Northeast Harbor, Somesville, Southwest Harbor, and Winter Harbor. The Washington County offices are located in Milbridge, Machias, and Lubec. The Knox, Kennebec and Sagadahoc County offices are located in Rockland, Augusta, South China, and Topsham. The Bank delivers its operations and technology support services from its operations center located in Ellsworth, Maine.

The Bank is a retail bank serving individual and business customers, retail establishments and restaurants, seasonal lodging, biological research laboratories, and a large contingent of retirees. As a predominately coastal bank, it serves the tourism, hospitality, lobstering, fishing, boat building and marine services industries. It also serves Maine&#146;s wild blueberry industry through its Hancock and Washington County offices. The Bank operates in a competitive market that includes other community banks, savings institutions, credit unions, and branch offices of statewide and interstate bank holding companies located in the Bank&#146;s market area. 

The Bank has a broad deposit base and loss of any one depositor or closely aligned group of depositors would not have a material adverse effect on its business. Historically, the banking business in the Bank&#146;s market area has been seasonal, with lower deposits in the winter and spring, and higher deposits in the summer and autumn. These seasonal swings have been fairly predictable and have historically not had a materially adverse impact on the Bank or its liquidity position. Approximately 91.8% of the Bank&#146;s 

deposits are in interest bearing accounts. The Bank has paid, and anticipates that it will continue to pay, competitive interest rates on all of the deposit account products it offers and does not anticipate any material loss of these deposits.

The Bank emphasizes personal service to the community, with a concentration on retail banking. Customers are primarily individuals and small businesses to which the Bank offers a wide variety of products and services. 

Retail Products and Services: The Bank offers a variety of consumer financial products and services designed to satisfy the deposit and borrowing needs of its retail customers. The Bank&#146;s retail deposit products and services include checking accounts, interest bearing NOW accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, club accounts, short-term and long-term certificates of deposit, Health Savings Accounts, and Individual Retirement Accounts. Credit products and services include home mortgages, residential construction loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, credit cards, installment loans, and overdraft protection services. The Bank provides secured and unsecured installment loans for new or used automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles, mobile homes and other personal needs. The Bank also offers other customary products and services such as safe deposit box rentals, wire transfers, check collection services, foreign currency exchange, money orders, and U.S. Savings Bonds redemptions. 

The Bank staffs a call center, providing customers with telephone and e-mail responses to their questions and needs. The Bank also offers free banking-by-mail services.

Retail Brokerage Services: The Bank retains Infinex Investments, Inc., (&#147;Infinex&#148;) as a full service third-party broker-dealer, conducting business under the assumed business name &#147;Bar Harbor Financial Services.&#148; Bar Harbor Financial Services is a branch office of Infinex, an independent registered broker-dealer offering securities and insurance products that is not affiliated with the Company or its subsidiaries. These products are not deposits, are not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency, are not guaranteed by the Bank or any affiliate, and may be subject to investment risk, including possible loss of value.

Bar Harbor Financial Services principally serves the brokerage needs of individuals, from first-time purchasers, to sophisticated investors. It also offers a line of life insurance, annuity, and retirement products, as well as financial planning services. Infinex was formed by a group of member banks, and is one of the largest providers of third party investment and insurance services to banks and their customers in New England. Through Infinex, the Bank is able to take advantage of the expertise, capabilities, and experience of a well-established third-party broker-dealer in a cost effective manner.

Electronic Banking Services: The Bank continues to offer free Internet banking services, including consumer remote deposit capture, e-statements, free check images, and electronic bill payment, through its dedicated website at www.bhbt.com . Additionally, the Bank offers telephone banking, an interactive voice response system through which customers can check account balances and activity, as well as initiate money transfers between their accounts. Customers can also monitor their accounts with free mobile banking access via text messaging, browser or &#147;Apps&#148;, and they can receive alerts, view accounts, transfer funds and pay bills. The Bank also offers Popmoney&#174;, an innovative personal payment service that eliminates the need for checks and cash by allowing customers to send and receive money as easily as they send and receive e-mail and text messages.

Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) are located at each of the Bank&#146;s fifteen (15) branch locations. The Bank is also a member of Maine Cash Access, providing customers with surcharge-free access to over 225 ATMs throughout the state of Maine. Visa debit cards are also offered, providing customers with free access to their deposit account balances at point of sale locations throughout most of the world. 

Commercial Products and Services: The Bank serves the small business market throughout downeast, midcoast and central Maine. It offers business loans to individuals, partnerships, corporations, and other business entities for capital construction, real estate and equipment financing, working capital, real estate development, and a broad range of other business purposes. Business loans are provided primarily to organizations and sole proprietors in the tourism, hospitality, healthcare, blueberry, boatbuilding, biological research, and fishing industries, as well as to other small and mid-size businesses associated with coastal communities. 

The Bank offers a variety of commercial deposit accounts, most notably business checking and tiered money market accounts. These accounts are typically used as operating accounts or short-term savings vehicles. The Bank&#146;s cash management services provide business customers with short-term investment opportunities through a cash management sweep program, whereby excess operating funds over established thresholds are swept into overnight securities sold under agreements to repurchase. The Bank also offers Business On-Line Direct (&#147; BOLD&#148; ) an Internet banking service for businesses. This service allows business clients to view their account histories, print statements, view check images, order stop payments, transfer funds between accounts, and transmit Automated Clearing House (ACH) files. The Bank also offers remote deposit capture, enabling its business customers to deposit checks remotely. Other commercial banking services include merchant credit card processing provided through a third party vendor, night depository, and coin and currency handling.

Bar Harbor Trust Services 

Trust Services is a Maine chartered non-depository trust company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank. Trust Services provides a comprehensive array of trust and investment management services to individuals, businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and municipalities. 

Trust Services serves as trustee of both living trusts and trusts under wills, including revocable and irrevocable, charitable remainder and testamentary trusts, and in this capacity holds, accounts for and manages financial assets, real estate and special assets. Trust Services offers custody, estate settlement, and fiduciary tax services. 

The staff includes credentialed investment and trust professionals with extensive experience. At December 31, 2015, Trust Services served 713 client accounts, with assets under management and assets held in custody amounting to $377.5 million and $34.3 million, respectively.

Market Competition 

The Company competes principally in downeast, midcoast and central Maine, which can generally be characterized as rural areas. The Company considers its primary market areas to be Hancock, Knox, Washington, Kennebec and Sagadahoc counties, each in the state of Maine. According to the 2014 Census Bureau Report estimate, the population of these five counties was 54,696, 39,676, 31,808, 121,112 and 35,045, respectively, representing a combined population of approximately 282,337. The economies in these counties are based primarily on tourism, healthcare, fishing and lobstering, agriculture, state government, and small local businesses, but are also supported by a large contingent of retirees. Major competitors in these market areas include local independent banks, local branches of large regional bank affiliates, thrift institutions, savings and loan institutions, mortgage companies, and credit unions. Other competitors in the Company&#146;s primary market area include financing affiliates of consumer durable goods manufacturers, insurance companies, brokerage firms, investment advisors, and other non-bank financial service providers.

Like most financial institutions in the United States, the Company competes with an ever-increasing array of financial service providers. As the national economy moves further towards a concentration of service companies, competitive pressures will mount.

The Company has generally been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing quality customer service, making decisions at the local level, maintaining long-term customer relationships, building customer loyalty, and providing products and services designed to address the specific needs of customers; however, no assurance can be given that the Company will continue to be able to compete effectively with other financial institutions in the future.

No part of the Company&#146;s business is materially dependent upon one, or a few customers, or upon a particular industry segment, the loss of which would have a material adverse impact on the operations of the Company.

Management and Employees 

The Company has two principal executive officers: Curtis C. Simard, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Gerald Shencavitz, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. 

&#160;

For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the Bank employed 205 full-time equivalent employees, Trust Services employed 13 full-time equivalent employees, and the Company employed 3 full-time employees, representing a full-time equivalent complement of 221 employees of the Company. None of the employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements.

The Company&#146;s management believes employee relations to be good.

Supervision and Regulation 

General 

Banking is a complex, highly regulated industry. Consequently, the performance of the Company and the Bank can be affected not only by management decisions and general and local economic conditions, but also by the statutes enacted by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. These authorities include, but are not limited to, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#147;FDIC&#148;), the Maine Bureau of Financial Institutions (&#34;BFI&#34;), the Internal Revenue Service, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#147;CFPB&#148;) and state taxing authorities. The effect of these statutes, regulations and policies and any changes to any of them can be significant and cannot be predicted.

&#160;

The primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. In furtherance of these goals, the U.S. Congress and the State of Maine have created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies that oversee, and have enacted numerous laws that govern banks, bank holding companies and the banking industry. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to the Company and the Bank establishes a comprehensive framework for the entities&#146; respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the Bank&#146;s depositors and the public, rather than the stockholders and creditors. The following summarizes some of the materially relevant laws, rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies, including the Company and the Bank, but does not purport to be a complete summary of all applicable laws, rules and regulations governing banks and bank holding companies or the Company or the Bank. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the specific statutes, regulations and policies discussed. Any change in applicable laws, regulations or regulatory policies may have a material effect on our businesses, operations and prospects. We are unable to predict the nature or extent of the 

effects that economic controls or new federal or state legislation may have on our business and earnings in the future. 

Regulatory Agencies 

&#160;

Bar Harbor Bankshares is a legal entity separate and distinct from its first tier bank subsidiary, Bar Harbor Bank &#38; Trust and its second tier subsidiary, Bar Harbor Trust Services. As a bank holding company, the Company is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act (&#147;BHC&#148;) and is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (&#147;Exchange Act&#148;). The Company&#146;s common stock is listed on The NYSE MKT (&#147;NYSE&#148;) under the trading symbol &#147;BHB,&#148; and is subject to the rules of NYSE for listed companies. 

&#160;

As a Maine chartered financial institution, Bar Harbor Bank &#38; Trust (&#34;Bank&#34;) is subject to supervision, periodic examination, and regulation by the BFI and FDIC . The prior approval of the Bureau and the FDIC is required, among other things, for the Bank to establish or relocate an additional branch office, assume deposits, or engage in any merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of any bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve may directly examine the subsidiaries of the Company, including the Bank. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

&#160;

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), which implemented and continues to implement significant changes to the regulation of the financial services industry. 

The effects of the Dodd-Frank Act have been far-reaching, and many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to rulemaking by various regulatory agencies and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Company, its customers or the financial industry more generally. Provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the Company and the Bank could require the Company and the Bank to seek additional sources of capital in the future. 

&#160;

Bank Holding Company Regulations Applicable to the Company 

&#160;

The BHC Act and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage, and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations. 

&#160;

Permitted Activities : Generally, bank holding companies are prohibited under the BHC Act from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in any activity other than (i) banking or managing or controlling banks or (ii) an activity that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking. The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries or affiliates when the Federal Reserve Board believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any of its banking subsidiaries. 

&#160;

A bank holding company that qualifies and elects to become a financial holding company is permitted to engage in additional activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to financial activity. We currently have no plans to make a financial holding company election. 

Sound Banking Practices : Bank holding companies and their non-banking subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in activities that represent unsafe and unsound banking practices. For example, under certain circumstances the Federal Reserve Board&#146;s Regulation Y requires a holding company to give the Federal Reserve Board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities if the consideration to be paid, together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year, is equal to 10% or more of the company&#146;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may oppose the transaction if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate a regulation. As another example, a holding company is prohibited from impairing its subsidiary bank&#146;s soundness by causing the bank to make funds available to non-banking subsidiaries or their customers if the Federal Reserve believes it not prudent to do so. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to assess civil money penalties for knowing or reckless violations, if the activities leading to a violation caused a substantial loss to a depository institution. Potential penalties are as high as $1,000,000 for each day the activity continues. 

&#160;

Source of Strength : In accordance with Federal Reserve Board policy, the holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank. Under this policy, the holding company is expected to commit resources to support its bank subsidiary, including at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position to provide it. As discussed below, the holding company could be required to guarantee the capital plan of the Bank if it becomes undercapitalized for purposes of banking regulations. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. The BHC Act provides that, in the event of a bank holding company&#146;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 

&#160;

Regulatory agencies have promulgated regulations to increase the capital requirements for bank holding companies to a level that matches those of banking institutions. 

&#160;

Anti-tying Restrictions : Bank holding companies and affiliates are prohibited from tying the provision of services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by a holding company or its affiliates. 

Acquisitions : The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, the laws of the State of Maine applicable to financial institutions and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of banks and their holding companies. The BHC Act generally limits acquisitions by bank holding companies to banks and companies engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. The BHC Act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of any bank or other bank holding company, (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. 

&#160;

In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities generally consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the combined organization (including the capital position of the combined organization), the applicant&#146;s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act (see the section captioned &#147;Community Reinvestment Act&#148; included elsewhere in this item), fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. 

Dividends : Dividends from the Bank are the Company's principal source of cash revenues. Our earnings and activities are affected by legislation, by regulations and by local legislative and administrative bodies and decisions of courts in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These include limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the holding company and our ability to pay dividends to our 

stockholders. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#146;s expected future needs and financial condition. The policy provides that bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the bank holding company&#146;s ability to serve as a source of strength to its banking subsidiary. Consistent with such policy, a banking organization should have comprehensive policies on dividend payments that clearly articulate the organization&#146;s objectives and approaches for maintaining a strong capital position and achieving the objectives of the policy statement. 

The FDIC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. Maine law requires the approval of the Bureau for any dividend that would reduce a bank's capital below prescribed limits.

&#160; 

Annual Reporting; Examinations : The Company is required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve Board, and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require. The Federal Reserve Board may examine a bank holding company and any of its subsidiaries, and charge the company for the cost of such an examination. 

&#160;

Imposition of Liability for Undercapitalized Subsidiaries : The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#147;FDICIA&#148;) requires bank regulators to take &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; to resolve problems associated with insured depository institutions. In the event an institution becomes &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; it must submit a capital restoration plan. The capital restoration plan will not be accepted by the regulators unless each company &#147;having control of&#148; the undercapitalized institution &#147;guarantees&#148; the subsidiary&#146;s compliance with the capital restoration plan until it becomes &#147;adequately capitalized.&#148; For purposes of this statute, the holding company has control of the Bank. Under FDICIA, the aggregate liability of all companies controlling a particular institution is limited to the lesser of five percent of the depository institution&#146;s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount necessary to bring the institution into compliance with applicable capital standards. FDICIA grants greater powers to bank regulators in situations where an institution becomes &#147;significantly&#148; or &#147;critically&#148; 

undercapitalized or fails to submit a capital restoration plan. For example, a bank holding company controlling such an institution can be required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval of proposed distributions, &#160; or might be required to consent to a merger or to divest the troubled institution or other affiliates. 

&#160;

Transactions with Affiliates : &#160; The holding company and the Bank are considered &#147;affiliates&#148; of each other under the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between such affiliates are subject to certain restrictions, including compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and their implementing regulations. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B: (1) limit the extent to which a financial institution or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions (a) with an affiliate (as defined in such sections) to an amount equal to 10% of such institution&#146;s capital and surplus, and (b) with all affiliates, in the aggregate to an amount equal to 20% of such capital and surplus; and (2) require all transactions with an affiliate, whether or not covered transactions, to be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution or subsidiary, as the terms provided or that would be provided to a non-affiliate. The term &#147;covered transaction&#148; includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and other similar types of transactions. 

State Law Restrictions : As a Maine corporation, the holding company is subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable Maine corporate law. For example, state law restrictions in Maine include limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors, distributions and dividends to 

stockholders, transactions involving directors, officers or interested stockholders, maintenance of books, records, and minutes, and observance of certain corporate formalities. 

&#160;

Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action 

Bank holding companies and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. The Federal Reserve Board has risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations, which are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. 

Basel III Capital Rules Effective January 1, 2015 : The federal bank regulatory authorities&#146; risk-based capital guidelines were previously based upon the 1988 capital accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, or Basel I. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country&#146;s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply. In 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a new capital accord to replace Basel I, with an update in November 2005 (&#147;Basel II&#148;). Basel II provided two approaches for setting capital standards for credit risk -an internal ratings-based approach tailored to individual institutions&#146; circumstances (which for many asset classes is itself broken into a &#147;foundation&#148; approach and an &#147;advanced or A-IRB&#148; approach, the availability of which is subject to additional restrictions) and a standardized approach that based risk weightings on external credit assessments to a much greater extent than permitted in previous risk-based capital guidelines. Basel II also set capital requirements for operational risk and refined the existing capital requirements for market risk exposures. 

&#160;

In July 2007, the U.S. banking and thrift agencies reached an agreement on the implementation of the capital adequacy regulations and standards based on Basel II. In November 2007, the agencies approved final rules to implement the new risk-based capital requirements in the United States for large, internationally active banking organizations, or &#147;core banks&#148; - defined as those with consolidated total assets of $250 billion or more or consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion or more. The final rule was effective as of April 1, 2008. We are not a core bank and do not apply the Basel II approach to computing risk-weighted assets. 

&#160;

In response to the economic and financial industry crisis that began in 2008, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and their oversight body - the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) &#150; began in late 2009 to work on global initiatives to strengthen the financial regulatory system. In July 2010, the GHOS agreed on key design elements and in September 2010 agreed to transition and implementation measures. The product of this effort is known as Basel III, and is designed to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. In particular, Basel III strengthens existing capital requirements and introduces a global liquidity standard. In June 2012, the FRB, FDIC and the OCC jointly issued three notices of proposed rulemaking (&#147;NPRs&#148;) to, among other things implement the Basel III minimum capital requirements. On November 9, 2012, the FRB, FDIC, and the OCC indefinitely delayed the start date for the Basel III capital requirements and stated that they did not expect the final rules to implement the Basel III capital requirements to be in effect on January 1, 2013, the initial deadline. In July 2013, the FRB, the FDIC and OCC issued two final interim rules to implement the Basel III capital reforms and the rules began phasing-in in 2015, depending on the size of the financial institution. 

As of December 31, 2015, each of the Company&#146;s regulatory capital ratios at both the Company and the Bank exceeded the minimums prescribed under Basel III (including consideration of a fully phased in capital conservation buffer, as discussed below) by approximately 500 basis points or more. 

&#160;

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (&#147;FDIA&#148;), requires, among other things, that federal banking agencies take &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA sets forth the following five capital tiers: &#147;well capitalized,&#148; &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; &#147;undercapitalized,&#148; &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; and &#147;critically undercapitalized.&#148; A depository institution&#146;s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. The relevant capital measures are the total capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio, the leverage ratio and the new ratio requirement under Basel III, the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. 

&#160;

Under the regulations adopted by the federal regulatory authorities, a bank will be: (i) &#147;well capitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater (6.0% prior to January 1, 2015), and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater (4.0% prior to January 1, 2015), and a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and is not &#147;well capitalized&#148;; (iii) &#147;undercapitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0% (4.0% prior to January 1, 2015) or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%; (iv) &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of less than 3.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0% (3.0% prior to January 1, 2015) or a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%; and (v) &#147;critically undercapitalized&#148; if the institution&#146;s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2.0% of average quarterly tangible assets. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank&#146;s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank&#146;s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes. 

&#160;

The final rules also established a &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148; of 2.5% above new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and when fully effective in 2019, will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution is subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchase, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such activities. 

&#160;

The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan to the FDIC. The agencies may not accept such a plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution&#146;s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution&#146;s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5.0% of the depository institution&#146;s total assets at the time it 

became undercapitalized and (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is &#147;significantly undercapitalized.&#148; 

&#160;

&#147;Significantly undercapitalized&#148; depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become &#147;adequately capitalized,&#148; requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. &#147;Critically undercapitalized&#148; institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. 

&#160;

Both the Company and the Bank have always maintained the capital ratios and leverage ratio above the levels to be considered quantitatively well-capitalized. For information regarding the capital ratios and leverage ratio of the Company and the Bank as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, see the discussion under the section captioned &#147;Capital Resources&#148; included in Item 7, &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; and Note 14, in the &#147;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#148; included in Item 8, &#147;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#148;, elsewhere in this report.

&#160;

Significant Banking Regulations Applicable to the Bank 

Deposit Insurance : &#160; The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund, (&#147;DIF&#148;), of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank&#146;s capital level and supervisory rating. Risk Category I is the lowest risk category while Risk Category IV is the highest risk category. 

&#160;

In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act revised certain statues governing the FDIC&#146;s management of the DIF. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act (i) raised the minimum fund reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%, (ii) requires the fund reserve ratio to reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020, (iii) eliminated the requirement that the FDIC provides dividends from the DIF when the reserve ratio is between 1.35% and 1.5%, (iv) removed the 1.5% cap on the reserve ratio, (v) granted the FDIC the sole discretion in determining whether to suspend or limit the declaration or payment of dividends and (vi) changed the assessment base for banks from insured deposits to the average total assets of the bank minus the average tangible equity of the bank during the assessment period. In December 2010, the FDIC set the minimum reserve ratio at 2.00%. In addition, the FDIC adopted a new Restoration Plan, pursuant to which, among other things, the FDIC (a) eliminated the uniform 3 basis point increase in initial assessment rates that were scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2011, (b) pursued further rulemaking in 2011 regarding the method used to offset the effect on banks with less than $10 billion in assets of the requirement that the reserve ratio reach 1.35% and (c) at least semiannually, will update its projections for the DIF and increase or decrease assessment rates, if needed. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted final rules to implement the dividend provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, changed the assessment base and set new assessment rates. In addition, as part of its final rules, the FDIC made certain assessment rate adjustments by: (1) altering the unsecured debt adjustment by adding an adjustment for long-term debt issued by another insured depository institution and (2) eliminating the secured liability adjustment, and changing the brokered deposit adjustment to conform to the change in the assessment base. The new assessment rates became effective April 1, 2011. The new initial base assessment rates range from 5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I banks to 35 basis points for Risk Category IV banks. Risk Category II and III banks have an initial base assessment rate of 14 and 23 basis points, respectively. 

&#160;

The FDIC may further increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule in order to manage the DIF to prescribed statutory target levels. An increase in the risk category for the Bank or in the assessment rates could have an adverse effect on the Bank&#146;s and consequently the Company&#146;s earnings. The FDIC may 

terminate deposit insurance if it determines the institution involved has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or has violated applicable laws, regulations or orders. 

&#160;

In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (FICO), a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the DIF. The current annualized assessment rate is approximately six basis points and the rate is adjusted quarterly. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2019. 

&#160;

The enactment of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 then-temporarily raised the basic limit on federal deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor and in July of 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act made the increased coverage amount permanent. 

&#160;

The Volcker Rule : Through the Volker Rule, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investments companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The Company does not currently believe that the Volker Rule will have a material effect on the operations of the Company or the Bank, as we do not engage in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule. 

&#160;

Depositor Preference : The FDIA provides that, in the event of the &#147;liquidation or other resolution&#148; of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution. 

&#160;

Consumer Financial Protection : The Company is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act and these laws&#146; respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, prohibit unfair, deceptive and abusive practices, restrict the Bank's ability to raise interest rates and subject the Bank to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys&#146; fees. 

Further, the CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit &#147;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#148; acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer&#146;s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer&#146;s: (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer&#146;s interests. 

Brokered Deposit Restrictions : Well-capitalized institutions are not subject to limitations on brokered deposits, while an adequately capitalized institution is able to accept, renew or roll over brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC and subject to certain restrictions on the interest rate paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions are generally not permitted to accept, renew, or roll over brokered deposits. 

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act : &#160; The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#147;CRA&#148;), requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility. The applicable federal regulators regularly conduct CRA examinations to assess the performance of financial institutions and assign one of four ratings to the institution&#146;s records of meeting the credit needs of its community. During its last examination, a rating of &#147;satisfactory&#148; &#160; was received by the Bank. 

&#160;

Insider Credit Transactions : Banks are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to certain executive officers, directors, principal stockholders and any related interests of such persons. Extensions of credit to such persons must: (i) be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not covered by such restrictions and (ii) not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions. 

&#160;

FDICIA : Under FDICIA, each federal banking agency has prescribed, by regulation, non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority. These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution which fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. 

&#160;

Examinations : The Bank is examined from time-to-time by its primary federal banking regulator, the FDIC and the Maine Bureau of Financial Institutions (&#147;BFI&#148;).

Financial Privacy : &#160; In accordance with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (the &#147;GLB Act&#148;), federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors. 

Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and the USA Patriot Act : &#160; A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions over the last decade has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (&#147;USA Patriot Act&#148;), substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial 

jurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions such as the Bank. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identities of their customers. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, can have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation : &#160; The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#147;OFAC&#148; rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#147;OFAC&#148;). The OFAC-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#147;U.S. persons&#148; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. The Company is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

&#160;

Other Laws and Regulations : The Company is not only subject to federal laws applicable to it, it is also subject to the rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. 

Guidance on Sound Compensation Policies 

&#160;

In 2010, the federal bank regulators jointly issued final guidance on sound compensation policies (&#147;SICP&#148;) intended to ensure that the compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The SICP guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#146;s compensation arrangements should: (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#146;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#146;s board of directors. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organization&#146;s supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The SICP guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization&#146;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. 

In addition, in 2010 the FDIC announced that it would seek public comment on whether banks with compensation plans that encourage risky behavior should be charged higher deposit assessment rates than they would be charged were they not to encourage risky behavior. In February 2011, the federal financial regulators issued joint proposed regulations to implement the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that the federal financial regulators prohibit, at any financial institution with consolidated assets of at least $1 billion, incentive pay that they determine encourages inappropriate risk.

Changing Regulatory Structure and Future Legislation and Regulation 

&#160;

Congress may enact further legislation that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and the Maine legislature may enact further legislation affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by the State of Maine. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The Company cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulations, or the application thereof, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which the Company operates and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to the Company&#146;s business strategy, and limit the Company&#146;s ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries could have a material effect on its business. 

Monetary Policy and Economic Environment 

The earnings of the Company are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the FRB. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the FRB to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The FRB frequently used these instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the level of inflation, or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may have on the Company&#146;s business and earnings.
