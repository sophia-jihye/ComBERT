 ITEM 1. Business 

General 

We believe we are the world&#8217;s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners. We serve more than 1 million customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories, animal health clinics and physician practices, as well as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics. We believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 83 years of experience distributing health care products. 

We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ nearly 19,000 people (of which more than 8,500 are based outside the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 33 countries, including the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom. 

We offer a comprehensive selection of products and services and value-added solutions for operating efficient practices and delivering high quality care. We operate through a centralized and automated distribution network with a selection of more than 110,000 branded products and Henry Schein private brand products in stock, as well as more than 150,000 additional products available as special order items. We also offer our customers exclusive, innovative technology solutions, including practice management software and e-commerce solutions, as well as a broad range of financial services. 

We have established over four million square feet of space in 61 strategically located distribution centers around the world to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers&#8217; needs. Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment. 

We conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services. These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. 

The health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental, animal health and medical operating segments. This segment distributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins. Our global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions. Our global animal health group serves animal health practices and clinics. Our global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions. 

Our technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners. Our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental and medical practitioners and animal health clinics. Our value-added practice solutions include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, as well as continuing education services for practitioners. 

Industry 

The health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented and diverse. This industry, which encompasses the dental, animal health and medical markets, was estimated to produce revenues of approximately $45 billion in 2015 in the global markets. The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices. 

&#160; 

Due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment. The purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant. Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier. 

The health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage. In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians&#8217; offices. 

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities. This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base. 

In recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment. This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices. It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support. We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management. 

Competition 

The distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive. Many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers. In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products. Manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors. 

In North America, we compete with other distributors, as well as several manufacturers, of dental, animal health and medical products, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, customer service and value-added products and services. In the dental market, our primary competitors are the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply Company. In addition, we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national, regional and local level. In the animal health market, our primary competitors are the MWI Animal Health division of AmerisourceBergen and the Patterson Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc. Our primary competitors in the medical market are McKesson Corporation and Medline Industries, Inc., which are national distributors. We also compete against a number of regional and local animal health and medical distributors, as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to veterinarians and physicians. With regard to our dental practice management software, we compete against numerous companies, including Carestream Health, Inc. and the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc. In the animal health practice management market, our primary competitors are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and the Patterson Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc. The medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the NextGen division of Quality Systems, Inc., eClinicalWorks and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. 

We also face significant competition internationally, where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors, including the GACD Group, Pluradent AG &#38; Co., Lifco AB, Planmeca Oy, Billericay Dental Supply Co. Ltd., National Veterinary Services Limited (Patterson Veterinary division of Patterson Companies, Inc.), Centaur Services Limited (MWI Animal Health division of AmerisourceBergen) and Alcyon SA, as well as a large number of dental, animal health and medical product distributors and manufacturers in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Kingdom. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices. Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; Financial services . We offer our customers solutions in operating their practices more efficiently by providing access to a number of financial services and products (including non-recourse financing for equipment, technology and software products; non-recourse patient financing; collection services and credit card processing) at rates that we believe are generally lower than what our customers would be able to secure independently. We also provide consulting services, dental practice valuation and brokerage services. 

&#160;

Commitment to superior customer service . We maintain a strong commitment to providing superior customer service. We frequently monitor our customer service through customer surveys, focus groups and statistical reports. Our customer service policy primarily focuses on: 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Exceptional order fulfillment . We ship an average of approximately 165,000 cartons daily. Approximately 99% of items ordered are shipped without back ordering and are shipped on the same business day the order is received. 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; Streamlined ordering process . Customers may place orders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by mail, fax, telephone, e-mail, Internet and by using our computerized order entry systems. 

Integrated management information systems .

These systems allow us to manage our growth, deliver superior customer service, properly target customers, manage financial performance and monitor daily operational statistics. 

Cost-effective purchasing . We believe that cost-effective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing our position as a competitive-pricing provider of health care products. We continuously evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers&#8217; offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the lowest possible cost. In 2015, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 34% and 7%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases. 

Efficient distribution . We distribute our products from our strategically located distribution centers. We strive to maintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery and complete order fulfillment. These inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our management information systems. Once an order is entered, it is electronically transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customer&#8217;s location and a packing slip for the entire order is printed for order fulfillment.

Business Strategy 

Our objective is to continue to expand as a global value-added provider of health care products and services to office-based dental, animal health and medical practitioners. To accomplish this, we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies: 

&#8226; 

&#160; Increase penetration of our existing customer base . We have over 1 million customers worldwide and we intend to increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our position as their primary supplier. 

&#8226; 

&#160; Increase the number of customers we serve . This strategy includes increasing the number and productivity of field sales consultants, as well as using our customer database to focus our marketing efforts in all of our operating segments. In the dental business, we provide products and services to traditional dental practices as well as new emerging segments, such as dental service organizations and community health centers. Leveraging our unique assets and capabilities, we offer solutions to address these new markets. In the medical business, we have expanded to serve customers located in settings outside of the traditional office, such as urgent care clinics, retail and occupational health settings. As settings of health care shift, we remain committed to serving these practitioners and providing them with the products and services they need. 

&#8226; 

&#160; Leverage our value-added products and services . We continue to increase cross-selling efforts for key product lines utilizing a consultative selling process. In the dental business, we have significant cross-selling opportunities between our dental practice management software users and our dental distribution customers. In the animal health business, we have opportunities to cross-sell practice management software and other products. In the medical business, we have opportunities to expand our vaccine, injectables and other pharmaceuticals sales to health care practitioners, as well as cross-selling core products and electronic health record and practice management software. Our strategy extends to providing health systems, integrated delivery networks and other large group and multi-site health care organizations, that include physician clinics, these same value added products and services. As physicians and health systems closely align, we have increased access to opportunities for cross-marketing and selling our product and service portfolios. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

&#8226; 

&#160; Pursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures . Our acquisition strategy includes acquiring businesses and entering into joint ventures complementary to ours that will provide, among other things, additional sales to be channeled through our existing distribution infrastructure, access to additional product lines and field sales consultants and an opportunity to further expand into new geographic markets. 

Markets Served 

Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S. population is increasingly using health care services. Between 2015 and 2025, the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 12%. Between 2015 and 2035, this age group is expected to grow by approximately 25%. This compares with expected total U.S. population growth rates of approximately 8% between 2015 and 2025 and approximately 15% between 2015 and 2035. 

In the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases. There is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity, and this is being driven in the U.S. by lower insurance reimbursement rates. At the same time, there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage. 

We support our dental professionals through the many SKUs that we offer, as well as through important value-added services, including practice management software, electronic claims processing, financial services and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner&#8217;s efficiency. 

The animal health market, impacted by growing companion pet ownership and care, as well as increased focus on safety and efficiency in livestock production, continues to provide additional growth opportunities for us. We support the animal health practitioners we serve through the distribution of biologicals, pharmaceuticals, supplies and equipment and by actively engaging in the development, sale and distribution of veterinary practice management software. 

There continues to be a migration of procedures from acute-care settings to physicians&#8217; offices, a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us. There also is the continuing use of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care settings. We believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician practitioner. 

Additionally, we are expanding our dental full-service model, our animal health presence and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist. Through our &#8220;Schein Direct&#8221; program, we also have the capability to provide door-to-door air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world.

Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Quarterly Results 

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. 

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions. Revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters. We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future. Quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including: 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; costs of developing new applications and services; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; unexpected regulatory actions, or government regulation generally; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; exclusivity requirements with certain suppliers may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other suppliers; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; loss of sales representatives; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; costs associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; general market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; restructuring costs; 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; the adoption or repeal of legislation; and 

&#160; &#8226; 

&#160; changes in accounting principles. 

Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate. If our financial results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline. 

&#160; 

Governmental Regulations 

Operating, Security and Licensure Standards 

Certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Among the United States federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. We are also subject to comparable foreign regulations. 

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDC Act&#8221;) and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, reporting, marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state. Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, serves as the legal basis for the United States Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as &#8220;HCT/P products.&#8221; 

The federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and pre-empts state law. Title II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (&#8220;DSCSA&#8221;), will be phased in over 10 years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. The law&#8217;s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs began to take effect in January 2015, subject to certain enforcement delays by the FDA. For example, the FDA announced that in light of difficulties experienced by some dispensers in establishing electronic systems to handle required product tracing information, it would delay to March 1, 2016 its enforcement of certain track and trace requirements scheduled to apply to dispensers on July 1, 2015, although this delay does not affect current DSCSA requirements that apply to other trading partners, such as manufacturers and wholesale distributors. The DSCSA product tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree requirements and pre-empt state requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the DSCSA requirements. Also in January 2015, the DSCSA required manufacturers and wholesale distributors to have systems in place by which they can identify whether a product in their possession or control is a &#8220;suspect&#8221; or &#8220;illegitimate&#8221; product, and handle it accordingly. 

The DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers (&#8220;3PLs&#8221;), and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities. The DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs. Beginning January 1, 2015, the DSCSA required wholesalers and 3PLs to submit annual reports to the FDA, which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the name and address of each facility and contact information. According to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area. Current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the FDA issues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA, which to date, the FDA has not yet issued. 

We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable DSCSA requirements. 

The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (&#8220;FDAAA&#8221;) and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (&#8220;FDASIA&#8221;) amended the FDC Act to require the FDA to promulgate regulations to implement a Unique Device Identification System. The FDA issued a final rule on September 24, 2013 implementing the Unique Device Identification System, requiring the labels of most medical devices to bear a unique device identifier (&#8220;UDI&#8221;), and prescribing the content and format of the UDI. The rule also requires the submission of certain information concerning UDI-labeled devices to an FDA database, the Global Unique Device Identification Database (&#8220;GUDID&#8221;). Additional FDA UDI guidance has subsequently been issued, and the FDA&#8217;s UDI regulations are being phased in over seven years from the rule&#8217;s promulgation in September 2013, beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class III medical devices) and ending with the lowest-risk devices. For the lowest-risk, Class I medical devices, a Universal Product Code may take the place of a UDI on the device&#8217;s label. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The FDA&#8217;s UDI regulations require certain entities, referred to as &#8220;labelers,&#8221; to develop and include UDIs on the labels of medical devices, and to directly mark certain devices with UDIs. Labelers are entities that cause a device&#8217;s label to be applied or modified, without any subsequent replacement or modification. Typically, these entities are device manufacturers, specification developers, single-use device reprocessors, convenience kit assemblers, repackagers and relabelers. 

Violations of the UDI regulations, including failure to include a UDI on a device&#8217;s label after the effective date for the device type, result in the misbranding of the device. The FDC Act makes it unlawful to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce a misbranded device. It is also unlawful to cause a device to become misbranded. 

We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable UDI requirements. 

Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (&#8220;DEA&#8221;) permitting us to handle controlled substances. We are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times. We are subject to inspection by the DEA. 

Certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale. These businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P products, or own pharmacy operations, or install, maintain or repair equipment. In addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil and/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example, human bone products) for valuable consideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring, processing, storing and distributing that tissue. We are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers, seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. Foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign powers. Furthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell, which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm. Our customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation. 

Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions. There have also been increasing efforts by various levels of government globally to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. 

Certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors. 

Health Care Fraud 

Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations. Some of these laws, referred to as &#8220;false claims laws,&#8221; prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as &#8220;anti-kickback laws,&#8221; prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. 

&#160; 

The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of &#8220;relators,&#8221; who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws. Under the federal False Claims Act relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of total recoveries. Also, violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in treble damages, and each false claim submitted can be subject to a penalty of up to $11,000 per claim. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties. The Health Care Reform Law significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, which could lead to the possibility of increased whistleblower or relator suits, and among other things made clear that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability. 

The United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other. As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance. 

We also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years. 

Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance. 

While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Health Care Reform 

The United States Health Care Reform Law adopted through the March 2010 enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage. 

The Health Care Reform Law requirements include a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 (a moratorium was imposed beginning January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2017 and therefore the tax does not apply to sales during that period) and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may affect sales. The Health Care Reform Law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health insurance. The Health Care Reform Law has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been interpreted. As a result, while upholding the law generally, the United States Supreme Court has effectively made the Health Care Reform Law&#8217;s Medicaid expansion voluntary for each state. There has been an effort by the political party in control of Congress to repeal some or all of the law. The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law affects our ability to plan. 

&#160; 

A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity. On February 1, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) released the final rule to implement the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Under this rule, data collection activities began on August 1, 2013, and as required under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, CMS publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities. 

Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals, and we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous. We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers. While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements, our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us. 

Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records 

The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings, and has developed and continues to develop policies on regulating clinical decision support tools and other types of software as medical devices. Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products. 

In addition, our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals. These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies. For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and implementing regulations (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;). HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches. 

We also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records. These customers are subject to laws and regulations, such as HIPAA, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers&#8217; comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation. 

Federal initiatives provide a program of incentive payments available to certain health care providers involving the adoption and use of certain electronic health care records systems and processes. The initiatives include providing, among others, physicians and dentists, with financial incentives, if they meaningfully use certified electronic health record technology (&#8220;EHR&#8221;) in accordance with applicable requirements. In addition, Medicare-eligible providers that fail to timely adopt certified EHR systems and meet &#8220;meaningful use&#8221; requirements for those 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

systems in accordance with regulatory requirements are to be subject to cumulative Medicare reimbursement reductions, which reductions for applicable health professionals (including physicians and dentists) began on January 1, 2015. Qualification for the incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that have certain capabilities for meaningful use pursuant to evolving standards adopted by CMS and by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (&#8220;ONC&#8221;) of the Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;). Generally, initial (&#8220;Stage 1&#8221;) standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2011, and more demanding &#8220;Stage 2&#8221; standards addressed criteria for periods beginning in 2014. On October 6, 2015, CMS and ONC released comprehensive final rules with respect to the EHR program that, among other things, establish the more challenging &#8220;Stage 3&#8221; criteria, make certain adjustments to Stage 1 and Stage 2 standards (e.g., reducing the 2015 reporting period from a full year to 90 days), and finalize 2015 edition health information technology (HIT) certification criteria (which is now added to the existing 2014 edition HIT certification criteria, but not required until 2018). Notably, under the new rules, compliance with Stage 3 standards will be optional for providers in 2017, and would generally be required for all eligible providers (regardless of prior participation in the EHR incentive program) for 2018 reporting periods and subsequently. Developers and others involved in the manufacture of EHR program technology will have this interim period to develop and certify products, and work with customers to implement products for the 2018 EHR program period. In connection with the release of the October 6 rules, HHS has also stated it will continue to modify applicable EHR program standards. In addition, under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), which establishes the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS), over the next few years the EHR program is expected to become part of a more comprehensive federal quality measurement and incentive program, apparently with modified applicable requirements, and CMS has indicated that it may even supplant certain Stage 3 rules with more streamlined MIPS approaches.

&#160;

Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to incentive programs, and therefore we must maintain compliance with, and are affected by, these changing governmental criteria. 

HIPAA requires certain health care providers, such as physicians, to use certain transaction and code set rules for specified electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions. Commencing July 1, 2012, CMS required that electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions be conducted under a new HIPAA transaction standard called Version 5010. CMS has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry, the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission, called the ICD-10-CM. The ICD-10-CM standard was implemented on October 1, 2015, and claims with dates of service of October 1, 2015 or after must be submitted using ICD-10-CM code sets. Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements, and while we believe that our products have timely adopted the new standards, it is possible that the transition to these new standards, particularly the transition to ICD-10-CM, may result in a degree of disruption and confusion, thus potentially increasing the costs associated with supporting these products. 

There may be additional legislative initiatives in the future impacting health care. 

International Transactions 

In addition, United States and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the United States. 

While we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business, there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers&#8217; practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business. As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the health care distribution industry in the United States is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us. 

&#160;
