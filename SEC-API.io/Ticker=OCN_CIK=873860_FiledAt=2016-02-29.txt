 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW 

Ocwen Financial Corporation is a financial services holding company that, through its subsidiaries, is one of the largest mortgage companies in the United States. When we use the terms &#8220;Ocwen,&#8221; &#8220;OCN,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our,&#8221; we are referring to Ocwen Financial Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are headquartered in West Palm Beach, Florida with offices located throughout the United States (U.S.) and in the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) and operations in India and the Philippines. Ocwen Financial Corporation is a Florida corporation organized in February 1988. With its predecessors, Ocwen has been servicing residential mortgage loans since 1988. We have been originating forward mortgage loans since 2012 and reverse mortgage loans since 2013. 

BUSINESS LINES 

Servicing and Lending are our primary lines of business. Business activities that currently are individually insignificant are included in our Corporate Items and Other segment. 

Servicing 

Our Servicing business is primarily comprised of our core residential mortgage servicing business and currently accounts for the majority of our total revenues. Our servicing clients include some of the largest financial institutions in the U.S., including the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) (each, an Agency or, collectively, the GSEs), the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) and non-Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. As of December 31, 2015, we were the seventh largest servicer in the U.S. based on the unpaid principal balance (UPB) of our residential servicing portfolio of $251.0 billion . We also service a small portfolio of commercial loans. 

We are a leader in the servicing industry in foreclosure prevention and loss mitigation that helps families stay in their homes and improves financial outcomes for investors. Our leadership in the industry is evidenced by our high cure rate for delinquent loans and above average rate of continuing performance by homeowners whose loans we have modified. Ocwen has provided more loan modifications under the Federal Government&#8217;s Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) than any other mortgage servicer and 50% more than the next highest servicer, according to data published in the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s Making Home Affordable Third Quarter 2015 Program Performance Report. Overall, Ocwen has completed nearly 644,000 &#32;loan modifications from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2015, including over 54,000 &#32;modifications under Ocwen&#8217;s own Shared Appreciation Modification (SAM) program that incorporates the ability for our servicing clients to recoup a portion of the principal reductions granted if property values increase over time. 

Servicing involves the collection and remittance of principal and interest payments received from borrowers, the administration of mortgage escrow accounts, the collection of insurance claims, the management of loans that are delinquent or in foreclosure or bankruptcy, including making servicing advances, evaluating loans for modification and other loss mitigation activities and, if necessary, foreclosure referrals and the sale of the underlying mortgaged property following foreclosure (real estate owned or REO) on behalf of investors or other servicers. Master servicing involves the collection of payments from servicers and the distribution of funds to investors in mortgage and asset-backed securities and whole loan packages. We earn contractual monthly servicing fees (which are typically payable as a percentage of UPB) pursuant to servicing agreements as well as other ancillary fees in connection with our servicing activities. 

We also earn fees under both subservicing and special servicing arrangements with banks and other institutions that own the mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). The owners of MSRs may choose to hire Ocwen as a subservicer or special servicer instead of servicing the MSRs themselves for a variety of reasons, including not having a servicing platform or not having the necessary capacity or expertise to service some or all of their MSRs. In a subservicing context, where Ocwen does not own the MSRs, we may be engaged to perform all of the servicing functions previously described or it could be a limited engagement (e.g., subservicing only non-defaulted mortgage loans). As a subservicer, we may be obligated to make servicing advances, though most subservicing agreements provide for more rapid reimbursement of any advances from the owner of the servicing rights than if we were the servicer. Ocwen is also engaged as a special servicer. These engagements typically involve portfolios of defaulted mortgage loans, which require more work than performing mortgage loans and involve working out modifications or short sales with borrowers or taking properties through the foreclosure process. We typically earn subservicing and special servicing fees either as a percentage of UPB or on a per loan basis. 

Servicing advances are amounts that we, as servicer, are required to advance to or on behalf of our servicing clients if we do not receive such amounts from borrowers. These amounts include principal and interest payments, property taxes and 

insurance premiums and amounts to maintain, repair and market real estate properties on behalf of our servicing clients. Most of our advances have the highest reimbursement priority and are &#8220;top of the waterfall&#8221; so that we are entitled to repayment from respective loan or REO liquidations proceeds before most other claims on these proceeds, and in the majority of cases, advances in excess of respective loan or REO liquidation proceeds may be recovered from pool level proceeds. The costs incurred in meeting these obligations consist principally of the interest expense incurred in financing the servicing advances and the costs of arranging such financing. 

Reducing delinquencies is important to our business because it enables us to recover advances and recognize additional ancillary income, such as late fees, which we do not recognize on delinquent loans until they are brought current. Performing loans also require less work and are thus generally less costly to service. While increasing borrower participation in loan modification programs is a critical component of our ability to reduce delinquencies, the persistence of those modifications to remain current is also an important factor. As of December 31, 2015, only 22.4% of Ocwen modifications were 60 or more days delinquent as compared to non-Ocwen subprime servicer re-default rates of 27.0%, according to data from a leading independent third party mortgage industry data provider. According to the same data, Ocwen has modified a larger percentage of its subprime portfolio, 66.0% versus 59.3% for the non-Ocwen subprime servicers. The data also demonstrated an ability to generate greater cash flow to our servicing clients because it showed that 80.4% of Ocwen&#8217;s subprime borrowers have made 10 or more payments in the 12 months ending December 31, 2015 as compared to only 65.1% for other subprime servicers. 

While our Servicing business grew rapidly via portfolio and business acquisitions from 2010 to 2013, we made no significant acquisitions during 2014 or 2015. Our growth ceased primarily as a result of significant regulatory scrutiny, which resulted in our settlements with the New York Department of Financial Services (NY DFS) in December 2014 and the California Department of Business Oversight (CA DBO) in January 2015, which are discussed in greater detail in the Regulation section below. These settlements have significantly impacted our ability to grow our servicing portfolio, which naturally decreases over time through portfolio runoff, because we have agreed to restrictions in our consent orders with the NY DFS and CA DBO that effectively prohibit future acquisitions of servicing until we have satisfied the respective conditions in those consent orders. If we are unable to satisfy these conditions, we will be unable to grow our servicing portfolio through acquisitions. 

During 2015, we implemented a strategy to sell a portion of our Agency MSRs with the intent of reducing our exposure to interest rate movements, monetizing significant unrealized value and generating significant liquidity. We also desired to refocus our business on non-Agency servicing, where we believe we have traditional cost advantages. In a series of performing and non-performing MSR sales, we sold approximately $87.6 billion &#32;of UPB of MSRs, generating cumulative gains of $83.9 million &#32;and cash proceeds of $1.2 billion , $686.8 million &#32;of which was from sales proceeds and $486.3 million &#32;of which was via the recovery of advances. These proceeds, as well as ongoing cash from operating activities, were used to reduce our overall indebtedness by $1.4 billion &#32;during 2015. At this time, we remain a servicer of Agency and government-insured loans. However, we may enter into additional asset sales from time to time, if we view sale prices to be attractive. Additionally, we continue to originate and service new Agency and government-insured loans. 

Given the intense regulatory scrutiny and the subsequent investments Ocwen has made in its risk and compliance infrastructure, we believe the underlying economics of our Servicing business have likely been changed for the foreseeable future. We believe it is unlikely Ocwen will achieve meaningful profitability in its Servicing business in the near term unless there is a significant, structural change in the business model. While we believe such structural change is probably unlikely in the current regulatory environment, we are nonetheless intensely focused on improving our operations to enhance borrower experiences and improve efficiencies both of which we believe will drive stronger financial performance through lower overall costs. An additional way to improve our financial performance would be to significantly grow or re-scale our Servicing portfolio. Although we are currently constrained under our regulatory settlements, if we can successfully navigate the regulatory hurdles and demonstrate the progress we have achieved in the areas of risk management and compliance, we believe that any potential future sellers of non-Agency servicing rights would view Ocwen&#8217;s infrastructure in a favorable light and place significant consideration on our ability to provide not only strong servicing performance for both RMBS investors and borrowers, but also on our ability to service loans in a highly compliant manner. Despite this belief, we do not believe there is a large market for future bulk servicing transfers at this time, and therefore our ability to add additional servicing rights through purchase transactions may be limited in the near term. 

As a result of uncertainty regarding our ability to achieve meaningful profitability in our Servicing business in its current state and our ability to grow our Servicing portfolio, for both regulatory and market-based reasons, we are seeking to become a much larger asset generator to provide Ocwen with not only future servicing rights but also other future income streams. We intend to transform Ocwen over time by reinvesting cash flows generated by the Servicing business to grow not only our residential mortgage lending business but also to grow other new business lines, which we believe can diversify our income profile and assist us in returning Ocwen to profitability. We believe asset generation, through our residential mortgage lending business and our new business lines, will be Ocwen&#8217;s primary driver of growth for the future. There can be no assurances that our efforts to transform Ocwen in this manner will be successful. 

Lending 

In our Lending business, we originate and purchase conventional (conforming to the underwriting standards of the GSEs, collectively Agency loans) and government-insured (insured by the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) or Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)) forward mortgage loans through the correspondent, wholesale and retail lending channels of our Homeward Residential, Inc. (Homeward) operations. Per-loan margins vary by channel, with correspondent typically being the lowest margin and retail the highest margin. After origination, we generally package and sell the loans in the secondary mortgage market, through GSE and Ginnie Mae guaranteed securitizations and whole loan transactions. In 2016, we will securitize and sell forward loans through our Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (OLS) operations. We typically retain the associated MSRs, providing the Servicing business with a source of new MSRs to replenish our servicing portfolio and partially offset the impact of amortization and prepayments. The only jurisdiction where we currently do not retain servicing rights on new originations, other than recapture (which is our ability to convert borrowers in our current servicing portfolio into newly originated loans), is California, where we sell the forward mortgage loans servicing-released to meet a requirement of our January 2015 settlement with the CA DBO. Lending revenues include interest income earned for the period the loans are held by us, gain on sale revenue, which represents the difference between the origination value and the sale value of the loan, and fee income earned at origination. 

We are working to increase the scale and breadth of our Lending business. Although the slowing of the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) and the sale of Agency MSRs (which decreases loans available to re-finance) present challenges, we are focused on increasing conversion rates (i.e., recapture) on our existing servicing portfolio and expanding our correspondent channel through growing our third party origination businesses. Additionally we are exploring offering different products we believe we can originate profitably and with acceptable levels of risk. We believe our experience in servicing difficult loans will allow us to also help borrowers obtain loans that are more challenging to originate. Building the sales and operations capacity to meet this need is a goal for the business, as well as investment in the development of our LOS (Loan Operating System) and the continued use of process improvements to drive productivity. 

We historically have originated and purchased Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM or reverse mortgage loans) insured by FHA through our Liberty Home Equity Solutions, Inc. (Liberty) operations. Effective in January 2016, we will continue to originate and purchase reverse mortgage loans through Liberty but will securitize the reverse mortgage loans through our OLS operations. Loans originated under this program are guaranteed by the FHA, which provides investors with protection against risk of borrower default. The reverse channel provides both current period and future period gain on sale revenue from new originations as a result of subsequent tail draws taken by the borrower. While we are focused on current period reported earnings, we also utilize our market experience to invest in future asset value when returns are at an attractive level. These future cash flows are not guaranteed but viewed as probable given our historic asset quality and slow prepayment speeds. 

Correspondent Lending . Our forward and reverse correspondent lending channels purchase mortgage loans that have been originated by a network of approved third party lenders. 

All of the lenders participating in our correspondent lending program are approved by senior lending and credit management executives. We also employ an ongoing monitoring and renewal process for participating lenders that includes an evaluation of the performance of the loans they have sold to us. We perform a variety of pre- and post-funding review procedures to ensure that the loans we purchase conform to our requirements and to the requirements of the investors to whom we sell loans. 

Wholesale Lending . We originate loans through a network of approved brokers. Brokers are subject to a formal approval and monitoring process. We underwrite all loans originated through this channel consistent with the underwriting standards required by the ultimate investor prior to funding. 

Retail Lending . We originate forward and reverse mortgage loans directly with borrowers through our retail lending business. Our retail lending business utilizes our significant portfolio of borrowers being serviced to originate refinanced loans. Depending on borrower eligibility, we will refinance into conventional, government or non-Agency products. We also are increasing our ability to originate in the external retail market. Through lead campaigns and direct marketing, the Retail channel seeks to convert leads into higher margin loans in a cost efficient manner. 

We provide customary origination representations and warranties to investors in connection with our loan sales and securitization activities. We receive customary origination representations and warranties from our network of approved originators in connection with loans we purchase through our correspondent lending channel. We recognize the fair value of the liability for our representations and warranties at the time of sale. In the event we cannot remedy a breach of a representation or warranty, we may be required to repurchase the loan or provide an indemnification payment to the investor. To the extent that we have recourse against a third-party originator, we may recover part or all of any loss we incur. 

In 2015, we originated or purchased forward and reverse mortgage loans with a UPB of $3.9 billion &#32;and $809.7 million , respectively. Our Lending business provides us the opportunity to expand into new markets and offer new products, for example prime loans that exceed the GSE limits (jumbo loans) or non-Agency loans, as market and investor demand develops in that product segment. We do not currently expect to originate loans not considered qualified mortgages (Qualified Mortgages) by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). 

New Lines of Business 

Automotive Capital Services (ACS) 

In August 2015, we launched our ACS business on a pilot basis in two markets in Florida. ACS makes short-term inventory-secured loans to independent used car dealers to finance their inventory. Loans are typically outstanding for 30 to 60 days and structured as lines of credit on which the dealerships can draw to finance inventory purchases. We anticipate that ACS could provide meaningful growth and income diversification in future periods. After a successful four-month pilot period, we began expanding across select markets in the U.S. In 2015, ACS approved twenty-one credit applications. We issued outstanding credit lines for $10.9 million and had drawn $2.8 million as of the end of the year. For the time being, ACS will fund new originations with available corporate cash. When the business grows to sufficient size, we anticipate obtaining warehouse line financing to fund new volumes, and eventually anticipate launching securitizations when loan volume and market conditions permit. 

Liberty Rental Finance 

Through Homeward, Liberty Rental Finance has entered the rental property finance market. The business will provide mortgage loans to investors interested in purchasing foreclosed properties or refinancing existing rental properties for the purpose of improving financing terms. We expect to sell the mortgage loans to aggregators including both private investors and the GSEs. Liberty Rental Finance is currently licensed to lend in 38 states and plans to expand to all states in the future. We believe that our substantial experience in small balance commercial servicing and single- and multi-family REO management along with our large customer base of REO buyers provide competitive opportunities. 

Given the early launch status of the ACS and Liberty Rental Finance businesses and their present contribution to Ocwen, each is currently reported as a component of the Corporate Items and Other segment. 

The results of operations for each of our reportable operating segments (Servicing, Lending and Corporate Items and Other) are included in the individual business operations sections of Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Financial information related to reportable operating segments is provided in Note 23 &#8212; Business Segment Reporting . 

REGULATION 

Our business is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local governmental authorities, including the CFPB, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and various state agencies that license, audit and conduct examinations of our loan servicing, origination and collection activities. In addition, we operate under a number of regulatory settlements that subject us to ongoing monitoring or reporting. From time to time, we also receive requests from federal, state and local agencies for records, documents and information relating to our policies, procedures and practices regarding our mortgage servicing, origination and collection activities. The GSEs and their conservator, the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), Ginnie Mae, the United States Treasury Department, various investors, non-Agency securitization trustees and others also subject us to periodic reviews and audits. 

In the current regulatory environment, we have faced and expect to continue to face increased regulatory and public scrutiny as an organization as well as stricter and more comprehensive regulation of the entire mortgage sector. We continue to work diligently to assess and understand the implications of the regulatory environment in which we operate and to meet the requirements of the changing environment in which we operate. We devote substantial resources to regulatory compliance, while, at the same time, striving to meet the needs and expectations of our customers, clients and other stakeholders. Our failure to comply with applicable federal, state and local laws regulations and licensing requirements could lead to any of the following: 

&#8226; 

loss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our servicing and lending businesses; 

&#8226; 

governmental investigations and enforcement actions; 

&#8226; 

administrative fines and penalties and litigation; 

&#8226; 

civil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits and actions to recover incentive and other payments made by governmental entities; 

&#8226; 

breaches of covenants and representations under our servicing, debt or other agreements; 

&#8226; 

damage to our reputation; 

&#8226; 

inability to raise capital; or 

&#8226; 

inability to execute on our business strategy. 

We must comply with a large number of federal, state and local consumer protection laws including, among others, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and state foreclosure laws. These statutes apply to many facets of our business, including loan origination, default servicing and collections, use of credit reports, safeguarding of non-public personally identifiable information about our customers, foreclosure and claims handling, investment of and interest payments on escrow balances and escrow payment features, and mandate certain disclosures and notices to borrowers. These requirements can and do change as statutes and regulations are enacted, promulgated, amended, interpreted and enforced. 

The recent trend among federal, state and local lawmakers and regulators has been toward increasing laws, regulations and investigative proceedings with regard to residential real estate lenders and servicers. Over the past few years, state and federal lawmakers and regulators have adopted a variety of new or expanded laws and regulations and recommended practices, including the Dodd-Frank Act discussed below. These regulatory and legislative measures, or changes in enforcement practices, could, either individually, in combination or in the aggregate, require that we further change our business practices, impose additional costs on us, limit our product offerings, limit our ability to efficiently pursue business opportunities, negatively impact asset values and reduce our revenues. Accordingly, they could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. For additional information on these risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, below. 

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, constituted a sweeping reform of the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, including consumer financial products and services. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, a new federal entity responsible for regulating consumer financial services. The CFPB directly affects the regulation of residential mortgage servicing and lending in a number of ways. First, the CFPB has rule making authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to mortgage servicers and lenders, including TILA and RESPA, as reflected in the new rules for servicing and origination that went into effect in 2014. Second, the CFPB has supervision, examination and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services offered by certain non-depository institutions and large insured depository institutions. The CFPB&#8217;s jurisdiction includes those persons originating, brokering or servicing residential mortgage loans and those persons performing loan modification or foreclosure relief services in connection with such loans. Accordingly, we are subject to supervision, examination and enforcement by the CFPB. We are currently in receipt of three Civil Investigative Demands or investigative subpoenas from the CFPB seeking information about our servicing practices. If the CFPB were to bring an enforcement action against us, the resolutions of such action could have a material adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. 

While the CFPB&#8217;s rule-making and regulatory agenda relating to loan servicing and origination continues to evolve, to date it is apparent that the CFPB has taken a very active role in the mortgage industry, including but not limited to, the issuance of new servicing and origination rules that went into effect in 2014. We have devoted substantial resources and incurred significant compliance costs responding to the Dodd-Frank Act and rules and regulations issued thereunder, and we expect to continue to devote substantial resources and incur significant costs going forward. 

Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act contains the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (Mortgage Act). The Mortgage Act imposes a number of additional requirements on servicers of residential mortgage loans, such as OLS, by amending certain existing provisions and adding new sections to TILA and RESPA. The penalties for noncompliance with TILA and RESPA are also significantly increased by the Mortgage Act and could lead to an increase in lawsuits against mortgage servicers. 

Transfers of mortgage servicing are subject to regulation under federal consumer finance laws, including CFPB rules implementing RESPA that require servicers to, among other things, maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to facilitate the transfer of accurate information and documents during mortgage servicing transfers and properly evaluate loss mitigation applications that are in process at the time of transfer. The CFPB has advised mortgage servicers that its examiners will be carefully reviewing servicers&#8217; compliance with these and other regulations applicable to servicing transfers, and state mortgage regulators have supervisory power over any licensed institutions involved in a transaction. Accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to our compliance efforts and to engaging with such regulators in connection with our transfers of mortgage servicing, and we expect to continue to do so. If we fail to comply with regulations relating to servicing transfers in connection with our dispositions of MSRs, we could be subject to adverse regulatory actions, which could materially and adversely affect our business. 

There are a number of foreign laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations in India and the Philippines, including acts that govern licensing, employment, safety, taxes, insurance and the laws and regulations that govern the creation, continuation and the winding up of companies as well as the relationships between shareholders, our corporate entities, the 

public and the government in these countries. Non-compliance with the laws and regulations of India or the Philippines could result in (i) restrictions on our operations in these counties, (ii) fines, penalties or sanctions or (iii) reputational damage. 

We are subject to a number of ongoing federal and state regulatory examinations, consent orders, inquiries, requests for information and other actions, which could result in further adverse regulatory action against us. 

New York Department of Financial Services 

In December 2012, we entered into a consent order with the New York Department of Financial Services (NY DFS) in which we agreed to the appointment of a Monitor to oversee our compliance with an Agreement on Servicing Practices that we had entered into with the NY DFS in September 2011. After the Monitor began its work in 2013, the NY DFS began an investigation into Ocwen&#8217;s compliance with the servicing requirements specified in the Agreement on Servicing Practices as well as New York State laws and regulations relating to the servicing of residential mortgages. 

In December 2014, Ocwen reached a settlement with the NY DFS related to this investigation and entered into a consent order (the NY Consent Order) with the NY DFS to reflect such settlement. The settlement contained monetary and non-monetary provisions including the payment of a civil monetary penalty of $100.0 million &#32;and restitution in the amount of $50.0 million &#32;to certain New York borrowers. Non-monetary provisions included: the appointment of an independent Operations Monitor who shall, among other responsibilities, review and assess the adequacy and effectiveness of our operations, including providing periodic reporting on findings and progress, and review transactions with Altisource, Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. (HLSS), Altisource Residential Corporation (Residential) and Altisource Asset Management Corporation (AAMC); the appointment of two additional independent directors to the Board of Directors (which occurred in January 2015); the resignation of William C. Erbey as an officer and director, as of January 16, 2015, as well as from the boards of Altisource, HLSS, AAMC and Residential; and restrictions on the ability and/or timing of any future MSR acquisitions which effectively prohibit any such future acquisitions until we have satisfied certain specified conditions. The Operations Monitor, Goldin Associates LLC (Goldin), was appointed in March 2015. We must pay all reasonable and necessary costs of the Operations Monitor. The expenses associated with the Operations Monitor have and will continue to impact us, as the expenses are substantial and we have limited ability to control, monitor or contest the Operation Monitor&#8217;s charges. 

We continue to work cooperatively with the Operations Monitor. If we are found to have breached the terms of the NY Consent Order or if the NY DFS or the Operations Monitor were to allege non-compliance with New York laws or regulations, we could become subject to financial penalties or other regulatory action could be taken against us. The Operations Monitor also makes recommendations to Ocwen on various operational and governance matters. If we do not address such recommendations in a manner deemed satisfactory by the Operations Monitor and the NY DFS, we could be subject to additional scrutiny by the Operations Monitor or the NY DFS or other regulatory action could be taken against us. 

California Department of Business Oversight 

In January 2015, OLS reached an agreement with the CA DBO relating to our failure to produce certain information and documents during a routine licensing examination, which resulted in the CA DBO withdrawing its notice of hearing to suspend OLS&#8217; license in California. OLS and the CA DBO entered into a Consent Order pursuant to the California Residential Mortgage Lending Act (the CA Consent Order) with the CA DBO to reflect such settlement. The CA Consent Order addresses and resolves the examination disputes between the CA DBO and OLS, and does not involve any accusation or admission of wrongdoing with regard to OLS&#8217; servicing practices. 

Under the terms of the CA Consent Order, OLS paid the CA DBO a penalty of $2.5 million plus costs associated with the examination. We accrued the $2.5 million penalty as of December 31, 2014. OLS also agreed to cease acquiring any additional MSRs for loans secured in California until the CA DBO is satisfied that OLS can satisfactorily respond to the requests for information and documentation made in the course of a regulatory exam. 

In addition, the CA DBO has selected an independent third-party auditor (the CA Auditor) to assess OLS&#8217; compliance with laws and regulations impacting California borrowers for an initial term of two years, extendable for one year at the discretion of the CA DBO. OLS must pay all reasonable and necessary costs of the CA Auditor. The expenses associated with the CA Auditor have and will continue to impact us, as the expenses are substantial and we have limited ability to control, monitor or contest the CA Auditor&#8217;s charges. The CA Auditor will report periodically on its findings and progress and OLS must submit to the CA DBO a written plan to address and implement corrective measures and address any deficiencies identified by the CA Auditor. 

We continue to work cooperatively with the CA Auditor. As part of the CA Auditor&#8217;s work, from time to time the CA Auditor and the CA DBO have made observations regarding our compliance with various regulations and legal requirements, including the Consent Order. At this time, we believe that we will be able to resolve all matters related to such observations in a constructive manner with the CA DBO, and we are not aware of any issue that we believe will have a material impact on our financial condition. As part of these observations, the CA DBO has informed us of its position that certain onboarding activities relating to new California originations in 2015 were prohibited by the Consent Order and represent a material breach of the 

agreement. We disagree with this position. Given that we have already made adjustments to our processes for California originations, the CA DBO has not asked us to make any additional changes to such processes at this time. The CA DBO has also raised similar concerns related to our on-boarding of loans subject to subservicing agreements. The CA DBO is still evaluating this activity as it relates to the Consent Order. The CA DBO has not asked us to cease any subservicing activities, and these activities are not material to our overall operations. However, it is possible that the CA DBO could determine to take action against us, which could subject us to financial penalties or other regulatory action, and it is possible that the CA Auditor or the CA DBO could allege that other activities do not comply with California laws or regulations, which could also result in regulatory action against us. 

National Mortgage Settlement 

In February 2014, the Ocwen National Mortgage Settlement involving the CFPB and various state attorneys general and other state agencies that regulate the mortgage servicing industry (NMS Regulators), relating to various allegations regarding deficient mortgage servicing practices, including those with respect to foreclosures, was memorialized by a consent order entered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (District Court). 

We are tested on a quarterly basis on various metrics to ensure compliance with the Ocwen National Mortgage Settlement. These metrics relate to various aspects of our servicing business, and each has a proscribed error threshold. These metrics are tested by a dedicated group of Ocwen employees who do not report to the servicing business and are referred to as the Internal Review Group (IRG). The IRG tests these metrics, and reports their findings to the professional firms employed by the Office of Mortgage Settlement Oversight (OMSO). OMSO has ultimate authority to accept or reject the IRG&#8217;s findings, and OMSO reports its findings to the District Court. 

Exceeding the metric error rate threshold for the first time does not result in a violation of the settlement, but rather it is deemed a &#8220;potential violation&#8221; which then is subject to a cure period. Any potential violation requires us to submit a corrective action plan (CAP) to OMSO for approval and review, and all testing for that metric is suspended until the CAP is completed. Following the completion of the CAP, testing on that metric resumes by the IRG and any further fails in the cure period or the quarter following that cure period would subject us to financial penalties. These penalties start at an amount of not more than $1.0 million &#32;for the first uncured violation and increase to an amount of not more than $5.0 million &#32;for the second uncured violation. To date, OMSO&#8217;s reports have found six metrics where our testing has exceeded the applicable error rate threshold. Each of those metrics has been the subject of an agreed-upon CAP, and one of those potential fails have been deemed &#8220;cured&#8221; by OMSO as subsequent testing has not exceeded the metric error rate threshold. The remainder of the metrics are either still under CAPs or the post-cure testing has yet to be validated by OMSO. Moreover, we agreed with OMSO to deem an additional five metrics as having failed due to the letter-dating issues that were raised by the NY DFS in 2014, as the testing of those metrics could have been affected by that issue. Those metrics are subject to a &#8220;global CAP&#8221; that covers all letter-dating issues under the Ocwen National Mortgage Settlement, in addition to any metric-specific CAP plan. It is also possible that if we are found to have caused borrower harm, we would be subject to costs to remediate that harm. In addition, in the event that there were widespread metric failures, it is possible that OMSO or the District Court could determine that we were generally violating the settlement and seek to impose a broader range of financial, injunctive or other penalties on us. 

In December 2014, OMSO identified two issues involving our compliance with the Ocwen National Mortgage Settlement. The first concerned the adequacy and independence of our IRG, which is responsible for reporting on our compliance with the settlement. The second concerned the letter-dating issues discussed above. OMSO&#8217;s reports since then have identified the steps that we have taken to remediate these issues and acknowledged Ocwen&#8217;s cooperation. OMSO has recently reported that Ocwen&#8217;s IRG appears to be operating in conformity with the National Mortgage Settlement, and noted that the letter-dating issues are subject to the global CAP discussed above. 

We continue to work cooperatively with OMSO on ongoing testing and CAPs. While, to date, these issues have not resulted in financial or other penalties, if we are found to have breached the Ocwen National Mortgage Settlement, we could become subject to financial penalties or other regulatory action could be taken against us. 

Securities and Exchange Commission 

In April 2014, we received a letter from the staff of the New York Regional Office of the SEC (the Staff) informing us that it was conducting an investigation relating to Ocwen and making a request for voluntary production of documents and information relating to the April 2014 surrender of certain options to purchase our common stock by Mr. Erbey, our former Executive Chairman, including the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan and the related option grant and surrender documents. In June 2014, we received a subpoena from the SEC requesting production of various documents relating to our business dealings with Altisource, HLSS, AAMC and Residential and the interests of our directors and executive officers in these companies. Following our announcement in August 12, 2014 that we intended to amend our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014, we received an additional subpoena in September 2014 in relation to such amendments. In addition, we received a further subpoena in November 2014 requesting certain documents related to Ocwen&#8217;s agreement with Southwest Business Corporation, and related 

to Mr. Erbey&#8217;s approvals for specifically enumerated board actions. We have cooperated with the SEC in its investigation and believe that the investigation is substantially completed. 

On January 20, 2016, the SEC entered an administrative order resolving its investigation, which required Ocwen to pay, without admitting or denying liability, a $2.0 million civil money penalty and consent to the entry of an administrative order requiring that we cease and desist from any violations of Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act and certain related SEC rules promulgated thereunder. We had previously disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 that we had reached this resolution in principle with the SEC staff and that we had accrued $2.0 million as of September 30, 2015. 

Separately, on February 10, 2015, we received a letter from the Staff informing us that it was conducting an investigation relating to the use of collection agents by mortgage loan servicers. The letter requested that we voluntarily produce documents and information. We believe that the February 10, 2015 letter was also sent to other companies in the industry. On February 11, 2016, we received a letter from the Staff informing us that it was conducting an investigation relating to fees and expenses charged in connection with liquidated loans and REO properties held in non-agency RMBS trusts. The letter requested that we voluntarily produce documents and information. We are cooperating with the Staff on these matters. 

General 

In addition to the above matters, our mortgage origination and servicing businesses require one &#32;or more licenses in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our licensed entities are required to renew their licenses, typically on an annual basis, and to do so they must satisfy the license renewal requirements of each jurisdiction, which in some cases include the requirement to provide audited financial statements. Last year, our licensed entities did not satisfy the requirements for timely provision of financial statements due to the delay in finalizing the audits for the 2014 fiscal years of these entities. 

The same agencies that issue licenses to us engage in regular supervisory examinations of the licensable activities. We are also subject to supervision by the CFPB at the federal level, and it similarly has the authority to conduct regulatory examinations, in addition to its enforcement and investigatory powers. These examinations are part of our ordinary course business activities, and the mere existence of an examination is not typically indicative of anything unusual or material as to that business. We also receive information requests and other inquiries, both formal and informal in nature, from these agencies as part of their general regulatory oversight of our origination and servicing businesses. The GSEs and their conservator, FHFA, HUD, FHA, VA, Ginnie Mae, the United States Treasury Department, and others also subject us to periodic reviews and audits. We have in the past resolved, and may in the future resolve, matters via consent orders or payment of monetary amounts to settle issues identified in connection with examinations or regulatory or other oversight activities. 

We also have regular engagements with not only our state financial regulators, but also the attorneys general in the various states and the CFPB to address individual borrower complaints that they bring to our attention, or to respond to information requests and other inquiries. On occasion, we also engage with U.S. attorneys. Many of these matters are brought to our attention as a complaint that the entity is investigating, although some are formal investigations or proceedings. We are currently in receipt of three Civil Investigative Demands from the CFPB, one Civil Investigative Demand from the Massachusetts Attorney&#8217;s General Office and two subpoenas from the Office of the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts seeking information about various aspects of our servicing practices. 

To the extent that an examination, monitorship, audit or other regulatory engagement results in an alleged failure by us to comply with applicable law, regulation or licensing requirement, or if allegations are made that we have failed to comply with the commitments we have made in connection with our regulatory settlements (including commitments under any corrective action plans under such settlements) or if other regulatory actions of a similar or different nature are taken in the future against us, this could lead to (i) loss of our licenses and approvals to engage in our servicing and lending businesses, (ii) governmental investigations and enforcement actions, (iii) administrative fines and penalties and litigation, (iv) civil and criminal liability, including class action lawsuits, (v) breaches of covenants and representations under our servicing, debt or other agreements, (vi) inability to raise capital and (vii) inability to execute on our business strategy. Any of these occurrences could increase our operating expenses and reduce our revenues, hamper our ability to grow or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations. 

COMPETITION 

The financial services markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with large and small financial services companies, including bank and non-bank entities, in the servicing and lending markets. Large banks such as Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citibank are generally the largest participants in these markets, although we also compete against other large non-bank servicers such as Nationstar Mortgage LLC and Walter Investment Management. 

In the servicing industry, we compete on the basis of price, quality and counterparty risk. Potential counterparties also (1) assess our regulatory compliance track record and examine our systems and processes for maintaining and demonstrating regulatory compliance, and (2) consider our third-party servicer ratings. Certain of our competitors, especially large banks, may 

have substantially lower costs of capital and greater financial resources, which makes it challenging to compete. We believe that our competitive strengths flow from our ability to control and drive down delinquencies through the use of proprietary technology and processes and our lower cost to service non-performing, non-Agency loans. Notwithstanding these strengths, we have suffered reputational damage as a result of our regulatory settlements and the associated scrutiny of our business. We believe this has weakened our competitive position against both our bank and non-bank servicing competitors. In addition, our New York and California regulatory settlements effectively prohibit us from competing in the market for bulk servicing acquisitions at this time. 

In the lending industry, we face intense competition in most areas, including product offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. Some of our competitors, including the larger banks, have substantially lower costs of capital and strong retail presence, which makes it challenging to compete. On the other hand, the larger banks have tended to be less competitive in non-retail channels, especially in the wholesale channel. We believe our competitive strengths flow from our existing role as a mortgage servicer, which has traditionally enabled us to more efficiently capture refinance volume from our servicing portfolio, our customer service and our customer relationships. 

THIRD-PARTY SERVICER RATINGS 

Similar to other servicers, we are the subject of mortgage servicer ratings or rankings (collectively, ratings) issued and revised from time to time by rating agencies including Moody&#8217;s Investors Services, Inc. (Moody&#8217;s), Morningstar, Inc. (Morningstar), Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Services (S&#38;P) and Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch). Favorable ratings from these agencies are important to the conduct of our loan servicing and lending businesses.

Removed from review for downgrade in June 2015. 

In addition to servicer ratings, each of the rating agencies will from time to time assign an outlook (or a ratings watch such as Moody&#8217;s review status) to a mortgage servicer&#8217;s rating status. A negative outlook is generally used to indicate that a ranking &#8220;may be lowered,&#8221; while a positive outlook is generally used to indicate a ranking &#8220;may be raised.&#8221; 

Failure to maintain minimum servicer ratings could adversely affect o ur ability to sell or fund servicing advances going forward, could affect the terms and availability of debt financing facilities that we may seek in the future, and could impair our ability to consummate future servicing transactions or adversely affect our dealings with lenders, other contractual counterparties and regulators, including our ability to maintain our status as an approved servicer by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

Certain of our servicing agreements require that we maintain specified servicer ratings. Out of approximately 3,979 &#32;non-Agency servicing agreements, approximately 745 &#32;with $40.1 billion &#32;of UPB as of December 31, 2015 &#32;have minimum servicer ratings criteria. As a result of downgrades in our servicer ratings, termination rights have been triggered in 664 &#32;of these non-Agency servicing agreements. This represents approximately $34.3 billion &#32;in UPB as of December 31, 2015 , or approximately 18.3% &#32;of our total non-Agency servicing portfolio. Under 264 &#32;of the 664 &#32;triggered agreements, trustees and master servicers have sent notices to investors indicating that they did not currently intend to take action relating to the termination rights. In addition, in connection with 66 &#32;of the triggered agreements, the trustee or master servicer sent solicitation notices to investors asking whether or not the investor wanted to direct the trustee or master servicer to terminate Ocwen as servicer. The trustee or master servicer has announced results for 47 &#32;of the solicitations: 43 &#32;resulted in no direction to terminate and four &#32;resulted in the termination of Ocwen as servicer in early 2015 due to rating downgrades. The 264 &#32;notices regarding no action at this time and the 43 &#32;solicitations resulting in no direction to terminate Ocwen as servicer represent approximately $19.6 billion &#32;in UPB as of 

December 31, 2015 , or approximately 57.1% &#32;of the UPB of the non-Agency servicing agreements with triggered termination rights. Pursuant to our servicing agreements, generally we are entitled to payment of accrued and unpaid servicing fees through termination as well as all advances and certain other previously unreimbursed amounts, although we lose the future servicing fee revenue. The financial impact of the termination of servicing under the four &#32;servicing agreements was immaterial to our overall financial condition, as it represented only 0.17% &#32;of our overall servicing portfolio as of the time of transfer of servicing. However, we could be subject to further terminations, either as a result of recent servicer ratings downgrades or future adverse actions by rating agencies, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial condition and results of operations. 

See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business for further discussion of the adverse effects that a downgrade in our servicer ratings could have on our business, financing activities, financial condition or results of operations. 

USVI OPERATIONS 

As part of an initiative to reorganize the ownership and management of our global servicing assets and operations under a single entity and cost-effectively expand our U.S.-based origination and servicing activities, Ocwen formed Ocwen Mortgage Servicing, Inc. (OMS) in 2012 under the laws of the USVI where OMS has its principal place of business. OMS is located in a federally recognized economic development zone and in 2012 became eligible for certain benefits, which may have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate. 

ALTISOURCE SPIN-OFF AND ONGOING RELATIONSHIP 

In 2009, we completed the distribution of our Ocwen Solutions (OS) line of business (the Separation) via the spin-off of a separate publicly traded company, Altisource. OS consisted primarily of Ocwen&#8217;s former unsecured collections business, residential fee-based loan processing businesses and technology platforms. Since the spin-off, our relationship has been governed by a number of agreements that set forth the terms of our business with Altisource. 

Ocwen Financial Corporation and OMS are parties to a Services Agreement, a Technology Products Services Agreement, an Intellectual Property Agreement and a Data Center and Disaster Recovery Services Agreement with Altisource. Under the Services Agreements, Altisource provides various business process outsourcing services, such as valuation services and property preservation and inspection services, among other things. Altisource provides certain technology products and support services under the Technology Products Services Agreements and the Data Center and Disaster Recovery Services Agreements. These agreements expire August 31, 2025. Ocwen and Altisource have also entered into a Master Services Agreement pursuant to which Altisource provides certain loan origination services to Homeward and Liberty, and a General Referral Fee Agreement pursuant to which Ocwen receives referral fees which are paid out of the commission that would otherwise be paid to Altisource as the selling broker in connection with real estate sales services provided by Altisource. A Data Access and Services Agreement under which we agreed to make available to Altisource certain data from Ocwen&#8217;s servicing portfolio in exchange for a per asset fee was terminated on March 31, 2015. 

We are currently dependent on many of the services and products provided by Altisource under these long-term agreements, many of which include renewal provisions. For example, our servicing platform runs on an information technology system that we license from Altisource. If Altisource were to fail to fulfill its contractual obligations to us, including through a failure to provide services at the required level to maintain and support our systems, or if Altisource were to become unable to fulfill such obligations (for example, because it entered bankruptcy), our business and operations would suffer. In addition, if Altisource fails to develop and maintain its technology so as to provide us with a competitive platform, our business could suffer. 

Certain services provided by Altisource under these agreements are charged to the borrower and/or mortgage loan investor. Accordingly, such services, while derived from our loan servicing portfolio, are not reported as expenses by Ocwen. These services include residential property valuation, residential property preservation and inspection services, title services and real estate sales. Ocwen has commissioned a third-party study assessing the reasonableness of such fees and expenses and believes that they are broadly consistent with prevailing market rates. Similar to other vendors, in the event that Altisource&#8217;s activities do not comply with the applicable servicing criteria, we could be exposed to liability as the servicer and it could negatively impact our relationships with our servicing clients, borrowers or regulators, among others. 

We have also entered into Support Services Agreements with Altisource that set forth certain services that Altisource and Ocwen may provide to each other in such areas as human resources, corporate services, Six Sigma, quality assurance, quantitative analytics, treasury, accounting, tax matters and strategic planning. These Support Services Agreements run through October 2017 and September 2018, respectively, with automatic one-year renewals thereafter. During 2014, we began reducing the amount of services provided to us under the Support Services Agreement. Beginning April 1, 2015, the only services that are regularly provided under these Support Services Agreements are corporate services such as vendor procurement for technology and facilities management services. We anticipate that we will cease all corporate services by the end of 2016. 

OUR SALES OF RIGHTS TO MSRS AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH NEW RESIDENTIAL INVESTMENT CORP. (NRZ) 

We have implemented an &#8220;asset-light&#8221; strategy pursuant to which we have sold rights to receive servicing fees, with respect to certain non-Agency MSRs (Rights to MSRs), together with the related servicing advances, to NRZ, who purchased these Rights to MSRs and assumed the rights and obligations under the associated agreements from Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. (HLSS) on April 6, 2015. Pursuant to our agreements with NRZ, NRZ has acquired Rights to MSRs and related servicing advances, and has assumed the obligation to fund new servicing advances in respect of the Rights to MSRs. We continue to service the loans for which the Rights to MSRs have been sold to NRZ and receive a servicing fee plus the right to retain ancillary income (other than net earnings on custodial and escrow accounts). References to NRZ as the counterparty in this annual report include HLSS for periods prior to April 6, 2015 because, following HLSS&#8217; sale of substantially all of its assets on April 6, 2015, NRZ, through its subsidiaries, is the owner of the Rights to MSRs and has assumed HLSS&#8217; rights and obligations under the associated agreements. 

Including our initial transaction on March 5, 2012, through 2014, we completed sales of Rights to MSRs and related servicing advances for serviced loans with a UPB of $202.4 billion (based on UPB at the time of sale). Together, these transactions are referred to as the NRZ/HLSS Transactions. We did not complete any sales of Rights to MSRs to NRZ during 2014 or 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we serviced loans with an outstanding UPB of approximately $137.1 billion &#32;for which the Rights to MSRs have been sold to NRZ. 

Our sales of Rights to MSRs have had two primary benefits. First, they enabled us to operate our business in a manner that allowed us to keep less capital on our balance sheet because we did not need to fund servicing advances on the loans for which Rights to MSRs have been sold. Second, when we sold Rights to MSRs, we were able to redeploy the proceeds to acquire additional MSRs. We sold the Rights to MSRs, and related servicing advances, for substantially all of the MSRs we owned or acquired through the third quarter 2013. 

We entered into the Rights to MSRs transactions because we had a counterparty with a cost of capital and an investment profile that meant, under the economic terms we agreed, that it was attractive for them to take on the servicing advance funding and other obligations relating to the Rights to MSRs while it was attractive for us to retain the servicing obligations. The specific MSRs for which Rights to MSRs were sold were selected following negotiations between the parties. All of our Rights to MSRs transactions relate to non-Agency MSRs, primarily due to the fact that servicing advances on Agency MSRs are generally more difficult to finance than non-Agency MSRs. 

On April 6, 2015, in consideration for OLS&#8217; consent to the assignment by HLSS to NRZ of all HLSS&#8217; right, title and interest in, to and under our agreements with HLSS, we amended our Master Servicing Rights Purchase Agreement and Sale Supplements (the Amendment). The Amendment extends and, we believe, strengthens our relationship with NRZ. Most notably, the Amendment (i) extends the term of the agreements by two years or until April 30, 2020, whichever is earlier, provided that such extension will not apply with respect to any servicing agreement that, as of the date that it was scheduled to terminate under our original agreements, is affected by an uncured termination event due to a downgrade of our servicer rating to below average or lower by S&#38;P or to &#8220;SQ4&#8221; or lower by Moody&#8217;s, and (ii) limits NRZ&#8217;s ability to transfer the servicing of any or all of the servicing agreements underlying the Rights to MSRs until April 6, 2017 even if further OLS servicer rating downgrades were to occur. We were also able to secure the future monetization of certain clean-up call rights we own. The Amendment provides that we will sell to NRZ, on an exclusive and &#8220;as is&#8221; basis, all economic beneficial rights to the &#8220;clean-up call rights&#8221; to which we are entitled pursuant to servicing agreements that underlie Rights to MSRs owned by NRZ, for a payment upon exercise of 0.50% of the UPB of all performing mortgage loans (mortgage loans that are current or 30 days or less delinquent) associated with the applicable clean up-call. Generally, a clean-up call allows a servicer or master servicer to purchase the remaining loans and REO out of a securitization, after the stated principal balance of the loans in the securitization falls below a specified percentage (e.g., falls below 10% of the principal balance of the loans as of the cut-off date under the securitization). 

We continue to service the loans for which the Rights to MSRs have been sold to NRZ. Accordingly, in the event NRZ were unable to fulfill its advance funding obligations, as the servicer under our servicing agreements with the RMBS trusts, we would be contractually obligated to fund such advances under those servicing agreements. At December 31, 2015, NRZ had outstanding advances of approximately $5.2 billion &#32;in connection with the Rights to MSRs. 

The servicing fees payable under the servicing agreements underlying the Rights to MSRs are apportioned between us and NRZ as provided in our agreements with NRZ. NRZ retains a fee based on the UPB of the loans serviced, and OLS receives certain fees, including a performance fee based on servicing fees actually paid less an amount calculated based on the amount of servicing advances and cost of financing those advances. After the earlier of April 30, 2020 or eight years after the closing date of the initial sale of each tranche of Rights to MSRs, the apportionment of these fees with respect to such tranche is subject to re-negotiation. 

Beginning April 7, 2017, we are obligated to transfer legal ownership of the MSRs to NRZ if and when NRZ obtains all required third-party consents and licenses. If and when such transfer of legal ownership occurs, we will subservice the loans pursuant to a subservicing agreement, as amended, with NRZ. NRZ has agreed not to direct our replacement as servicer before April 6, 2017 except under certain limited circumstances. 

To the extent that any servicing agreements underlying Rights to MSRs are terminated as a result of a termination event thereunder, NRZ is entitled to payment of an amount equal to an amortized percentage of the purchase price for the related Rights to MSRs. 

Pursuant to the Amendment, beginning April 7, 2017, if a termination event related to a servicer rating downgrade is existing under the Master Servicing Rights Purchase Agreement and Sale Supplements, NRZ will have the right to direct the transfer of servicing with respect to an affected servicing agreement to a replacement servicer that obtains all required third-party consents and licenses. As of the date of this annual report, a termination event relating to a servicer rating downgrade exists because our current servicer rating from S&#38;P is below &#8220;Average.&#8221; If our servicer rating from S&#38;P is not upgraded to &#8220;Average&#8221; or better prior to April 7, 2017, NRZ will have the right to direct the transfer of any affected servicing agreements to a successor servicer that obtains all required third-party consents and licenses. Following any such transfer, we would no longer be entitled to receive future servicing fee revenue with respect to the transferred servicing agreement. 

Our agreements with NRZ provide that, if S&#38;P downgrades our servicer rating to below &#8220;Average&#8221; (which it has), we will compensate NRZ for certain increased costs associated with its servicing advance financing facilities, including increased costs of funding, to the extent such costs are the direct result of such downgrade. Any such compensation will continue for a maximum of 12 months and will not exceed $3.0 million for any calendar month or $36.0 million in the aggregate. In such circumstances, NRZ must use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in curing any potential cost increases by obtaining amendments to the relevant financing agreements. We incurred $14.3 million &#32;through December 31, 2015 in connection with this agreement, and will incur costs in connection with this agreement in future periods. We will make additional future payments in connection with this agreement that are currently anticipated to be in the range of $1.5 million to $1.9 million per month through May 2016 (and $1.0 million for June 2016). Actual future payments will vary based on NRZ's outstanding borrowings and movements in applicable floating interest rates, and may be higher than our estimates. 

While we have not sold any Rights to MSRs since 2013, we may, in the future, enter into transactions to sell Rights to MSRs (or enter into transactions which have similar economic effects) due to the benefits such transactions have in allowing us to carry less capital on our balance sheet and devote the capital that we do have to less capital intensive activities such as loan servicing and loan origination. Obviously, any future transactions would need to be on terms we deem to be economically attractive - it is not possible to determine exactly when or if we might agree on terms for such transactions. 

EMPLOYEES 

We had a total of approximately 10,500 &#32;and 11,400 employees at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. We maintain operations in the U.S., USVI, India and the Philippines. At December 31, 2015 , approximately 6,900 &#32;of our employees were located in India and approximately 700 &#32;in the Philippines. Of our foreign-based employees, more than 80% &#32;were engaged in our Servicing operations as of December 31, 2015 .
