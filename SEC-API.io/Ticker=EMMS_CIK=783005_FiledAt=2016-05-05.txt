 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

GENERAL 

We are a diversified media company, principally focused on radio broadcasting. Emmis owns 19 FM and 4 AM radio stations in New York, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Austin (Emmis has a 50.1% controlling interest in Emmis&#8217; radio stations located there), Indianapolis and Terre Haute, IN. One of the FM radio stations that Emmis currently owns in New York is operated pursuant to a Local Marketing Agreement ("LMA") whereby a third party provides the programming for the station and sells all advertising within that programming. Emmis also developed and licenses TagStation &#174; , a cloud-based software platform that allows a broadcaster to manage album art, meta data and enhanced advertising on its various broadcasts, and developed NextRadio &#174; , a smartphone application that marries over-the-air FM radio broadcasts with visual and interactive features on smartphones. 

In addition to our radio properties, we publish several city and regional magazines. Our publishing operations consist of Texas Monthly , Los Angeles , Atlanta , Indianapolis Monthly , Cincinnati, and Orange Coast . We also operate Digonex Technologies, Inc. ("Digonex"), a dynamic pricing business. 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

We are committed to improving the operating results of our core assets while simultaneously seeking future growth opportunities in related businesses. Our strategy is focused on the following operating principles: 

Develop unique and compelling content and strong local brands 

Most of our established local media brands have achieved and sustained a leading position in their respective market segments over many years. Knowledge of local markets and consistently producing unique and compelling content that meets the needs of our target audiences are critical to our success. As such, we make substantial investments in areas such as market research, data analysis and creative talent to ensure that our content remains relevant, has a meaningful impact on the communities we serve and reinforces the core brand image of each respective property. 

Extend the reach and relevance of our local brands through digital platforms 

In recent years, we have placed substantial emphasis on enhancing the distribution of our content through digital platforms, such as the Internet and smartphones. We believe these digital platforms offer excellent opportunities to further enhance the relationships we have with our audiences by allowing them to consume and share our content in new ways and providing us with new distribution channels for one-to-one communication with them. 

Deliver results to advertisers 

Competition for advertising revenue is intense and becoming more so. To remain competitive, we focus on sustaining and growing our audiences, optimizing our pricing strategy and developing innovative marketing programs for our clients that allow them to interact with our audiences in more direct and measurable ways. These programs often include elements such as on-air endorsements, events, contests, special promotions, Internet advertising, email marketing, text messaging and online video. Our ability to deploy multi-touchpoint marketing programs allows us to deliver a stronger return-on-investment for our clients while simultaneously generating ancillary revenue streams for our media properties. 

Extend sales efforts into new market segments 

Given the competitive pressures in many of our &#8220;traditional&#8221; advertising categories, we are expanding our network of advertiser relationships into not-for-profits, political advertising, corporate philanthropy, environmental initiatives and government agencies. These efforts primarily focus on the health care and education sectors. We believe our capabilities can address these clients&#8217; under-served needs. The early return on these efforts has been encouraging and we plan to shift additional resources toward these efforts over time. 

Enhance the efficiency of our operations 

We believe it is essential that we operate our businesses as efficiently as possible. In response to recent trends, we implemented a series of aggressive restructurings and cost cuts. We have also invested in common technology platforms across all of our radio and publishing entities to help further standardize our business processes. 

Effectively deploy technology to enhance the value of our media assets 

We continue to seek innovative ways to combine or enhance our scalable, low cost radio distribution system with digital systems like HD Radio &#174; &#32;and wireless broadband, as well as to enhance radio&#8217;s future through advances like TagStation and NextRadio. 

RADIO STATIONS 

In the following table, &#8220;Market Rank by Revenue&#8221; is the ranking of the market revenue size of the principal radio market served by our stations among all radio markets in the United States. Market revenue rankings are from BIA/Kelsey&#8217;s Media Access Pro database as of March 29, 2016. &#8220;Ranking in Primary Demographic Target&#8221; is the ranking of the station within its designated primary demographic target among all radio stations in its market based on the March 2016 Nielsen Audio, Inc. ("Nielsen") Portable People Meter results or, in the case of our Terre Haute stations, based on the Fall 2015 Nielsen Survey. A &#8220;t&#8221; indicates the station tied with another station for the stated ranking. &#8220;Station Audience Share&#8221; represents a percentage generally computed by dividing the average number of persons in the primary demographic listening to a particular station during specified time periods by the average number of such persons in the primary demographic for all stations in the market area as determined by Nielsen.

NEW TECHNOLOGIES 

We believe that the growth of new technologies present not only a challenge, but an opportunity for broadcasters and publishers. The primary challenge is increased competition for the time and attention of our listeners and readers. The opportunity is to further enhance the relationships we already have with our listeners and readers by expanding products and services offered by our stations and magazines and to increase distribution to portable devices like smartphones and tablets. 

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT 

We believe that to be successful, we must be integrally involved in the communities we serve. We see ourselves as community partners. To that end, each of our stations and magazines participates in many community programs, fundraisers and activities that benefit a wide variety of causes. Charitable organizations that have been the beneficiaries of our contributions, marathons, walkathons, concerts, fairs and festivals include, among others, The Salvation Army, Wish for Heroes, Habitat for Humanity, United Way, Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Make-A-Wish Foundation, March of Dimes, Homeboy Industries, Los Angeles Unified School District, American Red Cross, St. Jude, and the Harlem Chamber of Commerce. 

The National Association of Broadcasters Education Foundation (&#8220;NABEF&#8221;) has honored us with the Hubbard Award, honoring a broadcaster &#8220;for extraordinary involvement in serving the community.&#8221; Emmis was the second broadcaster to receive this prestigious honor, after the Hubbard family, for which the award is named. The NABEF also recognized Emmis&#8217; WQHT-FM in New York for its outreach after Hurricane Sandy, both for the news coverage it provided and the relief efforts it organized in the weeks after the storm. WIBC-FM was nominated for a national Crystal Award from the National Association of Broadcasters for our efforts in the community in 2014 and in 2016. 

INDUSTRY INVOLVEMENT 

We have an active leadership role in a wide range of industry organizations. Our senior managers have served in various capacities with industry associations, including as directors of the National Association of Broadcasters, the Radio Advertising Bureau, the Radio Futures Committee, the Nielsen Audio Advisory Council, the Media Financial Management Association, MPA - the Association of Magazine Media, the City and Regional Magazine Association and as founding members of the Magazine Publishers of America. Our chief executive officer has been honored with the National Association of Broadcasters&#8217; &#8220;National Radio Award&#8221; and as Radio Ink&#8217;s &#8220;Radio Executive of the Year.&#8221; Our management and on-air personalities have won numerous industry awards. 

COMPETITION 

Radio broadcasting stations compete with the other broadcasting stations in their respective market areas, as well as with other advertising media such as newspapers, cable, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, the Internet, satellite radio, direct marketing and mobile and wireless device marketing. Competition within the broadcasting industry occurs primarily in individual market areas, so that a station in one market (e.g., New York) does not generally compete with stations in other markets (e.g., Los Angeles). In each of our markets, our stations face competition from other stations with substantial financial resources, including stations targeting the same demographic groups. In addition to management experience, factors that are material to competitive position include the station&#8217;s rank in its market in terms of the number of listeners, authorized power, assigned frequency, audience characteristics, local program acceptance and the number and characteristics of other stations in the market area. We attempt to improve our competitive position with programming and promotional campaigns aimed at the demographic groups targeted by our stations. We also seek to improve our position through sales efforts designed to attract advertisers that have done little or no radio advertising by emphasizing the effectiveness of radio advertising in 

increasing the advertisers&#8217; revenues. The policies and rules of the Federal Communications Commission (the &#8220;FCC&#8221;) permit certain joint ownership and joint operation of local stations. Most of our radio stations take advantage of these joint arrangements in an effort to lower operating costs and to offer advertisers more attractive rates and services. Although we believe that each of our stations can compete effectively in its market, there can be no assurance that any of our stations will be able to maintain or increase its current audience ratings or advertising revenue market share. 

Although the broadcasting industry is highly competitive, barriers to entry exist. The operation of a broadcasting station in the United States requires a license from the FCC. Also, the number of stations that can operate in a given market is limited by the availability of the frequencies that the FCC will license in that market, as well as by the FCC&#8217;s multiple ownership rules regulating the number of stations that may be owned or controlled by a single entity, and cross ownership rules which limit the types of media properties in any given market that can be owned by the same person or company. 

ADVERTISING SALES 

Our stations and magazines derive their advertising revenue from local and regional advertising in the marketplaces in which they operate, as well as from the sale of national advertising. Local and most regional sales are made by a station&#8217;s or magazine&#8217;s sales staff. National sales are made by firms specializing in such sales, which are compensated on a commission-only basis. We believe that the volume of national advertising revenue tends to adjust to shifts in a station&#8217;s audience share position more rapidly than does the volume of local and regional advertising revenue. During the year ended February 29, 2016 , approximately 17% of our total advertising revenues were derived from national sales, and 83% were derived from local sales. For the year ended February 29, 2016 , our publishing entities derived a higher percentage of their advertising revenues from local and regional sales (85%) than our radio stations (83%). 

EMPLOYEES 

As of February 29, 2016 , Emmis had approximately 750 full-time employees and approximately 335 part-time employees. Approximately 35 employees are represented by unions at our various radio stations. We consider relations with our employees to be good. 

INTERNET ADDRESS AND INTERNET ACCESS TO SEC REPORTS 

Our Internet address is www.emmis.com . Through our Internet website, free of charge, you may obtain copies of our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. These reports will be available the same day we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the SEC. We have been making such reports available on the same day they are filed during the period covered by this report. 

FEDERAL REGULATION OF BROADCASTING 

Radio broadcasting in the United States is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Communications Act&#8221;), as amended in part by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the &#8220;1996 Act&#8221;). Radio broadcasting is prohibited except in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the public interest, convenience and necessity would be served by the grant of such license. The FCC has the power to revoke licenses for, among other things, false statements made in applications or willful or repeated violations of the Communications Act or of FCC rules. In general, the Communications Act provides that the FCC shall allocate broadcast licenses for radio stations in such a manner as will provide a fair, efficient and equitable distribution of service throughout the United States. The FCC determines the operating frequency, location and power of stations; regulates the equipment used by stations; and regulates numerous other areas of radio broadcasting pursuant to rules, regulations and policies adopted under authority of the Communications Act. The Communications Act, among other things, prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of an entity holding such a license without the prior approval of the FCC. Under the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of media that compete with broadcast stations. 

The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of specific FCC regulations and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act as well as FCC rules, public notices and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations. Legislation has been introduced from time to time which would amend the Communications Act in various respects, and the FCC from time to time considers new regulations or amendments to its existing regulations. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted or whether new or amended FCC regulations will be adopted or what their effect would be on Emmis. 

LICENSE RENEWAL. Radio stations operate pursuant to broadcast licenses that are ordinarily granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight years and are subject to renewal upon approval by the FCC. The following table sets forth our FCC license expiration dates in addition to the call letters, license classification, antenna elevation above average terrain (for our FM stations only), power and frequency of all owned stations as of February 29, 2016:

1 &#32;Under the Communications Act, a license expiration date is extended automatically pending action on the renewal application. 

Under the Communications Act, at the time an application is filed for renewal of a station license, parties in interest, as well as members of the public, may apprise the FCC of the service the station has provided during the preceding license term and urge the denial of the application. If such a petition to deny presents information from which the FCC concludes (or if the FCC concludes on its own motion) that there is a &#8220;substantial and material&#8221; question as to whether grant of the renewal application would be in the public interest under applicable rules and policy, the FCC may conduct a hearing on specified issues to determine whether the renewal application should be granted. The Communications Act provides for the grant of a renewal application upon a finding by the FCC that the licensee: 

&#8226; 

has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; 

&#8226; 

has committed no serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC rules; and 

&#8226; 

has committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC rules which would constitute a pattern of abuse. 

If the FCC cannot make such a finding, it may deny the renewal application, and only then may the FCC consider competing applications for the same frequency. In a vast majority of cases, the FCC renews a broadcast license even when petitions to deny have been filed against the renewal application. 

REVIEW OF OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS. The FCC is required by statute to review all of its broadcast ownership rules on a quadrennial basis ( i.e. , every four years) and to repeal or modify any of its rules that are no longer &#8220;necessary in the public interest.&#8221; 

Despite several such reviews and appellate remands, the FCC&#8217;s rules limiting the number of radio stations that may be commonly owned, or owned in combination with a television station, in a local market have remained largely intact. The FCC's previous ownership reviews have been subject to litigation. The most recent court decision was issued by the Third Circuit in July 2011 and upheld the FCC&#8217;s decisions regarding all of its rules except for a revised newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, which the Court vacated and remanded to the Commission based on the Court&#8217;s finding that the agency had failed to provide adequate notice and opportunity for comment on the changes to that rule. The Supreme Court denied petitions for certiorari of the Third Circuit&#8217;s decision in June 2012. In 2010, the FCC again commenced a quadrennial review of its broadcast ownership rules, which it subsequently incorporated into the record of its 2014 quadrennial review launched in April 2014. Both the quadrennial review proceeding and the court appeals remain pending, and we cannot predict whether these 

proceedings will result in modifications of the ownership rules or the impact (if any) that such modifications would have on our business. 

The discussion below reviews the pertinent ownership rules currently in effect as well as the changes in the newspaper/broadcast rule adopted in the FCC&#8217;s December 2007 decision, which the FCC has largely proposed to reinstate in its 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews. 

Local Radio Ownership : 

The local radio ownership rule limits the number of commercial radio stations that may be owned by one entity in a given radio market based on the number of radio stations in that market: 

&#8226; 

if the market has 45 or more radio stations, one entity may own up to eight stations, not more than five of which may be in the same service (AM or FM); 

&#8226; 

if the market has between 30 and 44 radio stations, one entity may own up to seven stations, not more than four of which may be in the same service; 

&#8226; 

if the market has between 15 and 29 radio stations, one entity may own up to six stations, not more than four of which may be in the same service; and 

&#8226; 

if the market has 14 or fewer radio stations, one entity may own up to five stations, not more than three of which may be in the same service, however one entity may not own more than 50% of the stations in the market. 

Each of the markets in which our radio stations are located has at least 15 radio stations. 

For purposes of applying these numerical limits, the FCC has also adopted rules with respect to (i) so-called local marketing agreements, or &#8220;LMAs,&#8221; by which the licensee of one radio station provides programming for another licensee&#8217;s radio station in the same market and sells all of the advertising within that programming and (ii) so-called joint sale agreements, or &#8220;JSAs,&#8221; by which the licensee of one station sells the advertising time on another station in the market. Under these rules, an entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15% of the broadcast time, or sells more than 15% of the advertising time, on another radio station in the same market pursuant to an LMA or JSA is generally required to count the station toward its media ownership limits even though it does not own the station. As a result, in a market where we own one or more radio stations, we generally cannot provide programming to another station under an LMA, or sell advertising on another station pursuant to a JSA, if we could not acquire that station under the local radio ownership rule. In the 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews, the FCC has also sought comment on whether to expand the categories of agreements that are considered for purposes of evaluating compliance with the ownership rules to include other types of agreements such as &#8220;shared services agreements&#8221; and/or &#8220;local news service&#8221; agreements. 

On April 26, 2012, a subsidiary of Emmis entered into an LMA with New York AM Radio, LLC pursuant to which, commencing April 30, 2012, it began purchasing from Emmis the right to provide programming on radio station WEPN-FM, 98.7 FM, New York, NY until August 31, 2024, subject to certain conditions. Disney Enterprises, Inc., the parent company of New York AM Radio, LLC, has guaranteed the obligations under the LMA. Emmis&#8217; subsidiary will retain ownership of the 98.7 FM FCC license during the term of the LMA and received an annual fee of $8.4 million for the first year of the term under the LMA, which fee increases by 3.5% each year thereafter until the LMA&#8217;s termination. 

Although the FCC&#8217;s quadrennial review decisions have not changed the numerical caps under the local radio rule, the FCC adjusted the rule in June 2003 by deciding that both commercial and noncommercial stations could be counted in determining the number of stations in a radio market. The decision also altered the definition of the relevant local market for purposes of the rule. The FCC &#8220;grandfathered&#8221; existing station &#8220;clusters&#8221; not in compliance with the numerical caps as calculated pursuant to the new market definition, but provided that they could be sold intact only to small businesses meeting certain requirements. In December 2007, the FCC expanded this policy to allow an owner to sell a grandfathered station cluster to any &#32;buyer, so long as the buyer committed to file, within 12 months, an application with the FCC to transfer the excess station(s) to an eligible small business or to a trust for ultimate sale to such an entity. Subsequently, however, the Third Circuit vacated the FCC&#8217;s selected definition of small businesses eligible to purchase clusters that exceed the numerical limits. The change in market definition appears to impact the Austin, Texas market, such that we exceed the numerical cap for FM stations. If we chose to sell our Austin cluster of stations, we would likely therefore have to &#8220;spin off&#8221; one FM station to a separate buyer. The FCC has proposed to retain intact its local radio ownership rule, and has sought comment on whether to retain intact its previous definition of eligible small businesses or to adopt one of several alternatives, in its most recent quadrennial reviews. 

Cross-Media Ownership : 

The FCC&#8217;s radio/television cross-ownership rule generally permits the common ownership of the following combinations in the same market, to the extent permitted under the FCC&#8217;s television duopoly rule and local radio rules: 

&#8226; 

up to two commercial television stations and six commercial radio stations or one commercial television station and seven commercial radio stations in a market where at least 20 independent media voices will remain post-merger; 

&#8226; 

up to two commercial television stations and four commercial radio stations in a market where at least 10 independent media voices will remain post-merger; and 

&#8226; 

two commercial television stations and one commercial radio station in a market with less than 10 independent media voices that will remain post-merger. 

For purposes of this rule, the FCC counts as &#8220;voices&#8221; commercial and non-commercial broadcast television and radio stations as well as some daily newspapers and no more than one cable operator. The FCC will consider permanent waivers of its revised radio/television cross-ownership rule only if one of the stations is a &#8220;failed station.&#8221; The FCC has proposed to eliminate this rule in its most recent quadrennial reviews. 

FCC rules also generally prohibit common ownership of a daily newspaper and a radio or television station in the same local market. In its December 2007 quadrennial review decision, the FCC adopted rules that contained a presumption in favor of allowing ownership of one television or radio station in combination with one daily newspaper in the 20 largest media markets. In smaller markets, there would have been a presumption against allowing such ownership. In the case of proposed TV/newspaper combinations, the TV station could not be among the top four ranked stations in its market, and at least eight independently owned and operated TV stations would have had to remain in the market post-transaction. As noted above, the Third Circuit vacated these changes to the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership ban on procedural grounds. The FCC has largely proposed to reinstate the standards applicable to proposed newspaper/TV combinations in its most recent quadrennial reviews, while at the same time seeking comment on whether to eliminate the newspaper/radio cross-ownership rule. 

ATTRIBUTION OF OWNERSHIP INTERESTS. In applying its ownership rules, the FCC has developed specific criteria that it uses to determine whether a certain ownership interest or other relationship with an FCC licensee is significant enough to be &#8220;attributable&#8221; or &#8220;cognizable&#8221; under its rules. Specifically, among other relationships, certain stockholders, officers and directors of a broadcasting company are deemed to have an attributable interest in the licenses held by that company, such that there would be a violation of the FCC&#8217;s rules where the broadcasting company and such a stockholder, officer or director together hold attributable interests in more than the permitted number of stations or a prohibited combination of outlets in the same market. The FCC&#8217;s regulations generally deem the following relationships and interests to be attributable for purposes of its ownership restrictions: 

&#8226; 

all officer and director positions in a licensee or its direct/indirect parent(s); 

&#8226; 

voting stock interests of at least 5% (or 20%, if the holder is a passive institutional investor, i.e. , a mutual fund, insurance company or bank); 

&#8226; 

any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company where the limited partner or member has not been &#8220;insulated&#8221; from the media-related activities of the LP or LLC pursuant to specific FCC criteria; 

&#8226; 

equity and/or debt interests which, in the aggregate, exceed 33% of the total asset value of a station or other media entity (the &#8220;equity/debt plus policy&#8221;), if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of the station&#8217;s total weekly programming (usually pursuant to a time brokerage, local marketing or network affiliation agreement) or is a same-market media entity ( i.e. , broadcast company or newspaper). In December 2007, the FCC increased these limits under certain circumstances where the equity and/or debt interests are in a small business meeting certain requirements. Subsequently, however, the Third Circuit vacated the FCC&#8217;s definition of small businesses eligible to take advantage of the increased limits. The FCC has sought comment on whether to retain intact its previous definition of eligible small businesses or to adopt one of several alternatives, in its most recent quadrennial reviews. 

To assess whether a voting stock interest in a direct or indirect parent corporation of a broadcast licensee is attributable, the FCC uses a &#8220;multiplier&#8221; analysis in which non-controlling voting stock interests are deemed proportionally reduced at each non-controlling link in a multi-corporation ownership chain. 

Under existing FCC policy, in the case of corporations having a &#8220;single majority shareholder,&#8221; the interests of minority shareholders are generally not deemed attributable. Because Jeffrey H. Smulyan&#8217;s voting interest in the Company currently exceeds 50%, this exemption appears to apply to the Company. Elimination of the exemption is, however, under consideration by the FCC. If the exemption is eliminated, or if Mr. Smulyan&#8217;s voting interest falls to or below 50%, then the interests of any minority shareholders that meet or exceed the thresholds described above would become attributable and would be combined with the Company&#8217;s interests for purposes of determining compliance with FCC ownership rules. 

Ownership-rule conflicts arising as a result of aggregating the media interests of the Company and its attributable shareholders could require divestitures by either the Company or the affected shareholders. Any such conflicts could result in Emmis being unable to obtain FCC consents necessary for future acquisitions. Conversely, Emmis&#8217; media interests could operate to restrict other media investments by shareholders having or acquiring an interest in Emmis. 

ALIEN OWNERSHIP. Under the Communications Act, no FCC license may be held by a corporation if more than one-fifth of its capital stock is owned or voted by aliens or their representatives, a foreign government or representative thereof, or an entity organized under the laws of a foreign country (collectively, &#8220;Non-U.S. Persons&#8221;). Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC license may be granted to an entity directly or indirectly controlled by another entity of which more than one-fourth of its capital stock is owned or voted by Non-U.S. Persons if the FCC finds that the public interest will be served by 

the denial of such license. The FCC staff had interpreted this provision to require an affirmative public interest finding to permit the grant or holding of a license, and had made such a finding only in limited circumstances. In November 2013 the FCC clarified that it would accept requests to allow foreign investment above 25% in broadcast holding companies, and that it would evaluate those requests on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the requesting party had provided a sufficient public interest showing. In October 2015, the FCC proposed rules to simplify and streamline the process for requesting authority to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees. The FCC also sought comment on related matters, including revisions to the methodology that broadcasters may use to assess their compliance with the 25% limit. The foregoing restrictions on alien ownership apply in modified form to other types of business organizations, including partnerships and limited liability companies. In addition, an LMA with a foreign owned company is not prohibited as long as the non-foreign holder of the FCC license continues to control and operate the station. Our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated Code of By-Laws authorize the Board of Directors to prohibit such restricted alien ownership, voting or transfer of capital stock as would cause Emmis to violate the Communications Act or FCC regulations. 

ASSIGNMENTS AND TRANSFERS OF CONTROL. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant such approval, the FCC considers a number of factors, including compliance with the various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the &#8220;character&#8221; of the assignee or transferee and those persons holding attributable interests therein and compliance with the Communications Act&#8217;s limitations on alien ownership as well as other statutory and regulatory requirements. When evaluating an assignment or transfer of control application, the FCC is prohibited from considering whether the public interest might be served by an assignment of the broadcast license or transfer of control of the licensee to a party other than the assignee or transferee specified in the application. 

Emmis acquired WBLS and WLIB from a subsidiary of YMF Media (&#8220;YMF&#8221;), which itself had acquired those stations from a subsidiary of Inner City Broadcasting. Several individuals filed petitions to deny the application requesting FCC approval of the assignment of the stations&#8217; licenses from Inner City to YMF, which the Media Bureau denied. Several petitioners filed an application for review of the Media Bureau decision, which the Commission denied. These petitioners appealed the Commission&#8217;s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The D.C. Circuit dismissed the case, but the petitioners may still appeal to the United States Supreme Court. No party challenged the subsequent assignment of the stations&#8217; licenses from YMF to Emmis, and the time for filing any such challenges has expired. However, in March 2015, one party filed a lawsuit in the Federal District Court of New York challenging the transfer of the assets of WBLS-FM and WLIB-AM from Inner City to YMF, and claimed that Emmis had exerted undue influence in securing the FCC's consent to the transfer of the FCC licenses of WBLS-FM and WLIB-AM from YMF to Emmis. An amended complaint was filed in February 2016. Although both cases remain pending, Emmis believes the claims presented lack merit. 

PROGRAMMING AND OPERATION. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the &#8220;public interest.&#8221; Beginning in the late 1970s, the FCC gradually relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station&#8217;s community of license. However, licensees are still required to present programming that is responsive to community problems, needs and interests and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness. 

Federal law prohibits the broadcast of obscene material at any time and the broadcast of indecent material during specified time periods; these prohibitions are subject to enforcement by the FCC and carry fines of up to $325,000 per violation. The company has received, and may receive in the future, letters of inquiry or other notifications concerning alleged violations of the indecency rules at certain of its stations. We cannot predict the outcome of any indecency complaint proceeding or investigation or the extent or nature of future FCC enforcement actions. 

The FCC&#8217;s indecency rules have also been the subject of litigation. In July 2010, the Second Circuit held the FCC&#8217;s indecency standards to be unconstitutionally vague in violation of the First Amendment. The Second Circuit later vacated the agency decision at issue in another appeal based on its earlier decision. The FCC challenged these rulings in the Supreme Court. In June 2012 the Supreme Court vacated the Second Circuit&#8217;s decision, finding that the FCC had failed to provide adequate notice regarding the contours of its indecency policy with respect to the broadcasts at issue in the underlying proceedings, but leaving open the possibility that the agency might be able to enforce the prohibition on broadcast indecency in the future. The Third Circuit issued a decision vacating another FCC indecency ruling in November 2011, and the Supreme Court denied the FCC&#8217;s request for review of this decision. It is not clear how the FCC will apply these judicial decisions to outstanding complaints, including those involving Emmis stations, or how they will impact future FCC policies in this area. The FCC has also solicited public comment on whether, and if so how, to revise its indecency enforcement policies, in a proceeding that remains pending. 

Federal law also imposes sponsorship identification (or &#8220;payola&#8221;) requirements, which mandate the disclosure of information concerning programming that is paid for by third parties. The company has received, and may receive in the future, letters of inquiry or other notifications concerning alleged violations of the sponsorship identification rules at certain of its stations. We cannot predict the outcome of any sponsorship identification complaint proceeding or investigation or the extent or nature of future FCC enforcement actions. 

Stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identification, equal employment opportunities, contest and lottery advertisements, and technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation. 

Failure to observe FCC rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary fines, the grant of &#8220;short-term&#8221; (less than the maximum term) license renewals or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license. 

ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PROPOSED CHANGES. The FCC has adopted rules implementing a low power FM (&#8220;LPFM&#8221;) service, and approximately 800 such stations are in operation. In November 2007, the FCC adopted rules that, among other things, enhance LPFM&#8217;s interference protection from subsequently-authorized full-service stations. Congress then passed legislation eliminating certain minimum distance separation requirements between full-power and LPFM stations, thereby reducing the interference protection afforded to FM stations. As required by the legislation, the FCC in January 2012 submitted a report to Congress indicating that the results of a statutorily mandated economic study indicated that, on the whole, LPFM stations do not currently have, and in the future are unlikely to have, a demonstrable economic impact on full-service commercial FM radio stations. In March 2012, the FCC modified its rules to permit the processing of additional LPFM applications and to implement the legislative requirements regarding interference protection. The FCC opened a window for the filing of applications seeking authority to construct or make major changes to LPFM facilities which extended from October 15 through November 14, 2013, and in which it received more than 2,800 LPFM applications. The FCC continues to process the applications submitted during the window and, despite the findings of the March 2012 FCC study, we cannot predict whether any LPFM stations will actually interfere with the coverage of our radio stations. 

In June 2009, the FCC adopted rules that allow an AM radio station to use currently authorized FM translator stations to retransmit the AM station&#8217;s programming within the AM station&#8217;s authorized service area. In October 2015, the FCC issued an Order that adopted a two-stage process for AM radio stations to acquire additional FM translators, which began in early 2016 and is expected to conclude in 2017. The FCC also adopted certain changes to its rules that govern AM radio stations, and sought comment on additional changes to those rules. The October 2015 proceeding remains pending. 

The FCC also previously authorized the launch and operation of a satellite digital audio radio service (&#8220;SDARS&#8221;) system. In July 2008, the two original SDARS companies-Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc. and XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc.-merged into a new company called Sirius XM, which currently provides nationwide programming service. Sirius XM also offers channels that provide local traffic and weather information for major cities. 

In October 2002, the FCC issued an order selecting a technical standard for terrestrial digital audio broadcasting (&#8220;DAB,&#8221; also known as high definition radio or &#8220;HD Radio&#8221;). The in-band, on-channel (&#8220;IBOC&#8221;) technology chosen by the agency allows AM and FM radio broadcasters to introduce digital operations and permits existing stations to operate on their current frequencies in either full analog mode, full digital mode, or a combination of both (at reduced power). In March 2005, the FCC announced that, pending adoption of final rules, it would allow stations on an interim basis to broadcast multiple digital channels. In March 2007, the FCC adopted service rules for HD Radio &#174; . Significantly, the FCC decided to allow FM stations to broadcast digital multicast streams without seeking prior FCC authority, to provide datacasting services, to lease excess digital capacity to third parties, and to offer subscription services pursuant to requests for experimental authority. Under the new rules, FM stations may operate in the &#8220;extended hybrid mode,&#8221; which provides more flexibility for multicasting and datacasting services; and may use separate analog and digital antennas without seeking prior FCC authority. FM translators, FM boosters and low power FM stations may also broadcast digitally where feasible, and AM stations may now operate digitally during nighttime hours. The new rules mandate that broadcasters offering digital service provide at least one free over-the-air signal comparable in quality to their analog signal and that they simulcast their analog programming on their main digital stream, and prohibit broadcasters from operating exclusively in digital. The FCC declined either to set any mandatory deadline for broadcasters to convert to digital operations or to impose additional public interest obligations (beyond those that already apply to analog broadcasters) on digital broadcasters. The FCC did, however, adopt a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on (among other things) whether additional public interest obligations are necessary, including consideration of a requirement that radio stations report their public service programming in detail on a standardized form and post that form and all other contents of their public inspection files on the station&#8217;s website. The FCC subsequently imposed an online public file requirement on television stations and, in January 2016, announced that it would extend that requirement to radio stations. In January 2010, the FCC revised its DAB service rules to allow FM DAB stations to increase the permitted power levels of DAB transmissions. In September 2008, shortly after approving the Sirius-XM merger, the FCC sought comment on whether it should mandate the inclusion of HD Radio &#174; &#32;features in satellite radio receivers. That proceeding remains pending, and we cannot predict its outcome or the impact that a decision might have on our business. 

In order to broadcast musical compositions or to stream them over the Internet, Emmis must pay royalties to copyright owners of musical compositions (typically, songwriters and publishers). These copyright owners often rely on organizations known as performing rights organizations, which negotiate licenses with copyright users for the public performance of their compositions, collect royalties, and distribute them to copyright owners. The three major performing rights organizations, from which Emmis 

has licenses and to which Emmis pays royalties, are the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, Broadcast Music, Inc., and SESAC, Inc.. These rates are set periodically and are often negotiated by organizations acting on behalf of broadcasters. They may increase in the future. It also is possible that songwriters or publishers may disassociate with these performing rights organizations, or that additional such organizations could emerge in the future. One new organization has been formed, but the scope of its repertory is not clear and it is not clear that it licenses compositions that have not already been licensed by the other organizations. If a significant number of musical composition copyright owners withdraw from the established performing rights organizations, or if new performing rights organizations form to license compositions that are not already licensed, Emmis&#8217; royalty rates or negotiation costs could increase. 

In order to stream music over the Internet, Emmis must also obtain licenses and pay royalties to the owners of copyrights in sound recordings (typically, artists and record companies). These royalties are in addition to royalties for Internet streaming that must also be paid to performance rights organizations. For the license period 2006-2015, Emmis has been paying royalty rates for non-interactive Internet streaming of sound recordings in accordance with a settlement agreement reached in February 2009 between the National Association of Broadcasters (&#8220;NAB&#8221;) and SoundExchange (the entity that represents the recording industry and receives royalty payments from webcasters). On March 9, 2011, the Copyright Royalty Board (&#8220;CRB&#8221;) published statutory royalty rates and terms for non-interactive Internet streaming of sound recordings for 2011-2015. The rates published by the CRB do not apply to services, like Emmis&#8217; Internet streaming services, that are governed by the NAB-SoundExchange settlement. For radio broadcasters, however, the CRB modeled the statutory rates after the rates agreed to in the settlement; both sets of rates increase from 0.17 cent per listener per song in 2011 to 0.25 cent per listener per song in 2015. The CRB has recently completed its proceeding to set rates for the 2016-2020 license period. The CRB set a rate during this period for performances by non-subscription noninteractive services of 0.17 cent per listener per song, and a rate for noninteractive subscription services of 0.22 cent per listener per song. Both rates are subject to changes that mirror changes in the Consumer Price Index. We expect SoundExchange to appeal the CRB&#8217;s decision, and we cannot predict the outcome of that appeal. 

In addition, lawsuits have been filed under various state laws challenging the right of digital audio transmission services and broadcasters to publicly perform or reproduce sound recordings fixed prior to February 15, 1972 (&#8220;pre-1972 sound recordings&#8221;) without a license. Such sound recordings currently are exempt from federal copyright protection. The 1976 Copyright Act provides that pre-1972 sound recordings may be the subject of state copyright protection until 2067. As a result, there are various protections of pre-1972 sound recordings in place across various states, and the scope of protections and of exceptions and limitations to those protections varies from state to state. Moreover, the existence or scope of any public performance right in pre-1972 sound recordings is unclear. In 2014, courts in California and New York issued decisions in favor of the putative copyright owners against a digital transmission service. In 2015, a court in Florida ruled in favor of the digital transmission service, holding that no state public performance right exists under Florida law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (in New York) recently heard an appeal of the New York decision and has asked the New York State Court of Appeals to officially advise on the issue. We expect these other cases to be appealed. If appellate courts affirm these rulings and the decisions are interpreted to apply to radio broadcasting or Internet streaming, this could impede Emmis&#8217; ability to broadcast and/or stream pre-1972 sound recordings and/or increase its costs. 

Legislation also has previously been introduced in Congress that would require the payment of performance royalties to artists, musicians, or record companies whose music is played on terrestrial radio stations, ending a long-standing copyright law exception. If enacted, such legislation could have an adverse impact on the cost of music programming. 

In December 2007, the FCC initiated a proceeding to consider imposing requirements intended to promote broadcasters&#8217; service to their local communities, including (i) requiring stations to establish a &#8220;community advisory board,&#8221; (ii) reinstating a requirement that a station&#8217;s main studio be in its community of license and (iii) imposing local programming &#8220;guidelines&#8221; that, if not met, would result in additional scrutiny of a station&#8217;s license renewal application. While many broadcasters have opposed these proposals, we cannot predict how the FCC will resolve the issues. 

Congress and the FCC also have under consideration, and may in the future consider and adopt, new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of additional matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation, ownership and profitability of our broadcast stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our broadcast stations and/or affect our ability to acquire additional broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions. Such matters include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; 

proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees; 

&#8226; 

proposals to repeal or modify some or all of the FCC&#8217;s multiple ownership rules and/or policies; 

&#8226; 

proposals to change rules relating to political broadcasting; 

&#8226; 

technical and frequency allocation matters; 

&#8226; 

AM stereo broadcasting; 

&#8226; 

proposals to modify service and technical rules for digital radio, including possible additional public interest requirements for terrestrial digital audio broadcasters; 

&#8226; 

proposals to restrict or prohibit the advertising of beer, wine and other alcoholic beverages; 

&#8226; 

proposals to tighten safety guidelines relating to radio frequency radiation exposure; 

&#8226; 

proposals permitting FM stations to accept formerly impermissible interference; 

&#8226; 

proposals to reinstate holding periods for licenses; 

&#8226; 

changes to broadcast technical requirements related to the implementation of SDARS; 

&#8226; 

proposals to modify broadcasters&#8217; public interest obligations; 

&#8226; 

proposals to limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenses by advertisers; and
