BUSINESS 

&#8203;

General 

James River Group Holdings, Ltd. is a Bermuda-based insurance holding company. We own and operate a group of specialty insurance and reinsurance companies founded by members of our management team. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 73% of our group-wide gross written premiums originated from the U.S. excess and surplus (&#8220;E&#38;S&#8221;) lines market. Substantially all of our business is casualty insurance and reinsurance, and for the year ended December 31, 2015, we derived 98% of our group-wide gross written premiums from casualty insurance and reinsurance. Our objective is to generate compelling returns on tangible equity, while limiting underwriting and investment volatility. We seek to accomplish this by consistently earning profits from insurance and reinsurance underwriting while managing our capital opportunistically. Our group includes three specialty property-casualty insurance and reinsurance segments: Excess and Surplus Lines, Specialty Admitted Insurance and Casualty Reinsurance. In all of our segments, we tend to focus on accounts associated with small or medium-sized businesses. 

We write very little property or catastrophe insurance and no property catastrophe reinsurance. For the year ended December 31, 2015, property insurance and reinsurance represented 2% of our gross written premiums. When we do write property insurance, we buy reinsurance to significantly mitigate our risk. We have structured our reinsurance arrangements so that our estimated net pre-tax loss from a 1/1000 year probable maximum loss event is no more than $10.0 million on a group-wide basis. 

We report our business in four segments: Excess and Surplus Lines, Specialty Admitted Insurance, Casualty Reinsurance and Corporate and Other. 

The Excess and Surplus Lines segment offers E&#38;S commercial lines liability and property insurance in every U.S. state and the District of Columbia through James River Insurance Company (&#8220;James River Insurance&#8221;) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, James River Casualty Company (&#8220;James River Casualty&#8221;). James River Insurance and James River Casualty are both non-admitted carriers. Non-admitted carriers writing in the E&#38;S market are not bound by most of the rate and form regulations imposed on standard market companies, allowing them flexibility to change the coverage terms offered and the rate charged without the time constraints and financial costs associated with the filing of such changes with state regulators. In 2015, the average account in this segment generated annual gross written premiums of approximately $19,000. The Excess and Surplus Lines segment distributes primarily through wholesale insurance brokers. Members of our management team have participated in this market for over three decades and have long-standing relationships with the wholesale agents who place E&#38;S lines accounts. The Excess and Surplus Lines segment produced 54.0% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The Specialty Admitted Insurance segment focuses on niche classes within the standard insurance markets, such as workers&#8217; compensation coverage for residential contractors, light manufacturing operations, transportation workers and healthcare workers in North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. This segment has admitted licenses in 48 states and the District of Columbia. While this segment has historically focused on workers&#8217; compensation business, we are growing our fronting business and our other commercial lines through our program business. We believe we can earn substantial fees in our program and fronting business by writing policies and then transferring all or a substantial portion of the underwriting risk position to other capital providers that pay us a fee for fronting or ceding the business to them. The Specialty Admitted Insurance segment accepts applications for insurance from a variety of sources, including independent retail agents, program administrators and managing general agents (&#8220;MGAs&#8221;). The Specialty Admitted Insurance segment produced 15.9% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The Casualty Reinsurance segment consists of JRG Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (&#8220;JRG Re&#8221;), our Bermuda domiciled reinsurance subsidiary, which provides proportional and working layer casualty reinsurance to third parties and to our U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries. The Casualty Reinsurance segment&#8217;s underwriting results only include the results of reinsurance written with unaffiliated companies 

and does not include the premiums and losses ceded under our internal quota share arrangement described below, which are captured in our Excess and Surplus Lines and Specialty Admitted Insurance segments, respectively. Typically, we structure our reinsurance contracts (also known as treaties) as quota share arrangements, with loss mitigating features, such as commissions that adjust based on underwriting results. We frequently include risk mitigating features in our excess working layer treaties, which allows the ceding company to capture a greater percentage of the profits should the business prove more profitable than expected, while providing us with additional premiums should the business incur higher than expected losses. We believe these structures best align our interests with the interests of our cedents. Treaties with loss mitigation features including sliding scale ceding commissions represented 86% of the gross premiums written by our Casualty Reinsurance segment during 2015. We typically do not assume large individual risks in our Casualty Reinsurance segment, nor do we write property catastrophe reinsurance. Two of the three largest unaffiliated accounts written by JRG Re during 2015 were ceded from E&#38;S carriers. The Casualty Reinsurance segment distributes through traditional reinsurance brokers. The Casualty Reinsurance segment produced 30.1% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

We have intercompany reinsurance agreements under which we cede 70% of the net written premiums of our U.S. subsidiaries (after taking into account third-party reinsurance) to JRG Re. This business is ceded to JRG Re under a proportional, or quota-share, reinsurance treaty that provides for an arm&#8217;s length ceding commission. From a management perspective, the economic results (underwriting profits or losses) of this business that are reflected herein in our Excess and Surplus Lines and Specialty Admitted Insurance reporting segments exclude the effects of both the intercompany quota share and pooling agreements. At December 31, 2015, approximately 67% of our cash and invested assets were held in Bermuda, which has a favorable operating environment, including an absence of corporate income or investment taxes. We pay a 1% excise tax on premiums ceded to JRG Re. 

The Corporate and Other segment consists of the management and treasury activities of our holding companies and interest expense associated with our debt. 

In 2015, our operating subsidiaries wrote a total of&#8201; $572.2 million in gross written premiums, allocated by segment and underlying market as follows:

Best Company (&#8220;A. M. Best&#8221;) financial strength rating for our group&#8217;s regulated insurance subsidiaries is &#8220;A-&#8221; (Excellent), with a &#8220;positive outlook.&#8221; This rating reflects A.M. Best&#8217;s opinion of our insurance subsidiaries&#8217; financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations to policyholders and is not an evaluation directed towards the protection of investors. 

The financial strength ratings assigned by A.M. Best have an impact on the willingness of brokers and agents to submit applications for insurance to our regulated subsidiaries and on the risk profiles of the submissions for insurance that our subsidiaries receive. The &#8220;A-&#8221; (Excellent), with a &#8220;positive outlook&#8221; ratings assigned to our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are consistent with our business plans and we believe allow our subsidiaries to actively pursue relationships with the agents and brokers identified in their marketing plans.

Our History 

In 2002, a group of experienced insurance executives with a history of starting and operating profitable specialty insurance operations created James River Group, Inc. (&#8220;James River Group&#8221;). James River Group was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market (symbol: JRVR) in 2005 and consistently produced attractive underwriting results. James River Group had two insurance company subsidiaries, James River Insurance and Stonewood Insurance Company (&#8220;Stonewood Insurance&#8221;). Both of these subsidiaries as well as James River Group are now subsidiaries of ours. 

In 2007, James River Group&#8217;s management team decided to enhance James River Group&#8217;s long-term profitability by combining the earnings power of James River Group with the efficiency of an affiliated Bermuda domiciled reinsurer. A group of investors led by affiliates of D. E. Shaw &#38; Co., L.P. acquired James River Group, at which point it ceased trading as a public company. Simultaneously, the investors and management founded and capitalized JRG Re, and we began the process of building our present company. 

In December 2014, we completed an initial public offering of our common shares (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;). Affiliates of D. E. Shaw &#38; Co., L.P. and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and its affiliate (collectively, the &#8220;Selling Shareholders&#8221;), sold all of the common shares in the IPO. Neither the Company nor any of its management and other owners sold shares in the IPO. The total number of our common shares sold in the IPO by the Selling Shareholders, including shares acquired by the underwriters upon exercise of an option to purchase additional shares, was 11,740,516. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe we have the following competitive strengths: 

Proven and Strong Management Team Whose Financial Interests are Aligned with Shareholders . Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J. Adam Abram, has a history of forming and managing profitable specialty insurance companies. Mr. Abram was the founder of Front Royal Group in 1992, which was sold to Argo Group International Holdings Limited (Nasdaq: AGII) in August 2001. In 2002, Mr. Abram formed James River Group, our predecessor company, which enjoyed strong underwriting profits until it was sold to James River Group Holdings, Ltd. in December 2007. Mr. Abram has also founded and run successful businesses in the banking and commercial real estate sectors. 

Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Robert P. Myron, who has served in various capacities with our group since 2010, has a history of working in a senior management capacity in the insurance and reinsurance industries in both the United States and Bermuda. Mr. Myron has significant experience working in finance, underwriting and operations of several different insurance and reinsurance companies over the course of his career. 

Our Chief Financial Officer, Gregg Davis, has been with our group and its predecessors since 1992 and was the Chief Financial Officer of Front Royal Group, working alongside Mr. Abram for almost two decades. 

The President and Chief Executive Officer of our Excess and Surplus Lines segment, Richard Schmitzer, who has been with our group since July 2009, has a history of working in a senior management capacity in the E&#38;S lines industry. Mr. Schmitzer has significant experience working in underwriting and operations of several different insurance companies over the course of his career. 

Dennis Johnson, the President and Chief Executive Officer of our Casualty Reinsurance segment, has a long track-record underwriting specialty reinsurance risks, particularly in the small account market where we concentrate. 

Steven Hartman, the President and Chief Executive Officer of our Specialty Admitted Insurance segment, has extensive experience as a reinsurance underwriter, and has the experience and industry knowledge to build out our fronting and program business. 

Each of Messrs. Abram, Myron, Davis and Schmitzer invested in the IPO. All members of our executive management have equity grants that we believe help align their interests with those of our long-term shareholders. 

Broad Underwriting Expertise . We strive to be innovative in tailoring our products to provide solutions for our distribution partners and insureds, and we are willing to entertain insuring many types of risk classifications. As a result, we believe we are a &#8220;go to&#8221; market for a wide variety of risks. We are able to structure solutions for our insureds and the wholesale brokers with whom we work because of our deep technical expertise and experience in the niches and specialties we underwrite. 

Conservative Risk Management with an Emphasis on Lowering Volatility . We earn our profits by taking underwriting and investment risk. We underwrite many classes of insurance and invest in many types of assets. We actively seek to avoid underwriting business or making investments that expose us to an unacceptably high risk of causing large losses. 

We seek to limit our catastrophic underwriting exposure in all areas, but in particular to property risks and catastrophic events. Our U.S. primary companies purchase reinsurance from unaffiliated reinsurers to reduce our net exposure to any one risk or occurrence. In addition, our policy forms and pricing are subject to regular formal analysis to ensure we are insuring the types of risks we intend and that we are being appropriately compensated for taking on those risks. When we write reinsurance, we seek to avoid catastrophic risks and contractually limit the amount of exposure we have to any one risk or occurrence. We prefer to structure our assumed reinsurance treaties as proportional or quota share reinsurance, which is generally less volatile than excess of loss or catastrophe reinsurance. We believe this structure aligns our interests with those of the ceding company. 

We attempt to improve risk-adjusted returns in our investment portfolio by allocating a portion of our portfolio to investments where we take measured risks based upon detailed knowledge of certain niche asset classes. High quality fixed maturity securities make up approximately 65% of our investment portfolio, but we are comfortable allocating a portion of our assets to non-traditional investments. We consider non-traditional investments to include investments that are (1) unrated bond or fixed income securities (2) non-listed equities or (3) investments that generally have less liquidity than rated bond or fixed income securities or listed equities. We characterize these investments as non-traditional. Non-traditional investments held at December 31, 2015 and their respective percentage of our total invested assets at such date consist of syndicated bank loans (15.4%), interests in limited liability companies that invest in renewable energy opportunities (2.1%), limited partnerships that invest in debt or equity securities (1.4%), and a private debt security (0.4%). While we are willing to make investments in non-traditional types of investments, we seek to avoid asset classes and investments that we do not understand or that could expose us to inappropriate levels of risk. The weighted average credit rating of our portfolio of fixed maturity securities, bank loans and redeemable preferred stocks as of December 31, 2015 was &#8220;A.&#8221; This portfolio had a weighted average duration of approximately 3.5 years for this portfolio as of December 31, 2015. 

Talented Underwriters and Operating Leadership . The managers of our 15 underwriting divisions have an average of over 25 years of industry experience, substantial subject matter expertise and deep technical knowledge and have been successful and profitable underwriters for us in the specialty casualty insurance and reinsurance sectors. Our segment presidents have an average of 32 years of experience and all have extensive backgrounds and histories working in management capacities in specialty casualty insurance and reinsurance. 

Robust Technology and Data Capture . We seek to ground our underwriting decisions in reliable historical data and technical evaluation of risks. Our underwriters utilize intuitive systems and differentiated technologies, many of which are proprietary. We have implemented processes to capture extensive data on our book of business, before, during and after the underwriting analysis and decision. We use the data we collect to inform and, we believe, improve our judgment about similar risks as we refine our underwriting criteria. We use the data we collect in regular formal review processes for each of our lines of business and significant reinsurance treaties. 

Focus on Small and Medium-Sized Casualty Niche and Specialty Business . We believe that small and medium-sized casualty accounts, in niche areas where we focus, are consistently among the most attractive subsets of the property casualty insurance and reinsurance market. We think the unique characteristics of the risks within these markets require each account to be individually underwritten in an efficient manner. Many carriers have chosen either to reject business that requires individual underwriting or have attempted to automate the underwriting of this highly variable business. While we use technology to greatly reduce the 

cost of individually underwriting these accounts in our Excess and Surplus Lines and Specialty Admitted Insurance segments, we continue to have our underwriters make individual judgments regarding the underwriting and pricing of accounts. We believe this approach is more likely to produce consistent results over time and across markets. In addition, while we believe that the insurance and reinsurance industry is generally overcapitalized at this time, and that rates in certain property and casualty sectors are &#8220;soft&#8221; or &#8220;softening,&#8221; we are currently achieving stable rates and experiencing benign loss trends in our Excess and Surplus Lines and Specialty Admitted Insurance segments, which represented 69.9% of our gross written premiums for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. We believe that there are compelling opportunities for measured but profitable growth in many sectors of the insurance markets we target. 

Active Claims Management . Our U.S.-based primary insurance companies actively manage claims as part of keeping losses and loss adjustment expenses low. We attempt to investigate and settle all covered claims promptly and thoroughly, which we generally accomplish through direct contact with the insured and other affected parties. We have been able to close 90% of claims within three to five years, and as of December 31, 2015, our reserves for claims incurred but not reported were approximately 68% of our total net loss reserves.

Efficient Operating Platform . Our Bermuda domicile and operations provide for capital flexibility and an efficient tax structure. At December 31, 2015, approximately 67% of our cash and invested assets were held in Bermuda, which benefits from a favorable operating environment, including an absence of corporate income or investment taxes. We also have a competitive expense ratio, as we carefully manage personnel and all other costs throughout our group while growing our business. In addition, Bermuda has many advantages as a place of domicile, including a large population of experienced insurance executives, a deep market for reinsurance business and a well-established regulatory regime that has fostered the acceptance of Bermuda-based reinsurers by rating agencies and insurance buyers. 

Our Strategy 

We believe our approach to our business will help us achieve our goal of generating compelling returns on tangible equity while limiting volatility in our financial results. This approach involves the following: 

Generate Consistent Underwriting Profits . We seek to make underwriting profits each and every year. We attempt to find ways to grow in markets that we believe to be profitable, but are less concerned about growth than maintaining profitability in our underwriting activities (without regard to investment income). Accordingly, we are willing to reduce the premiums we write when we cannot achieve the pricing and contract terms we believe are necessary to meet our financial goals. 

Maintain a Strong Balance Sheet . Balance sheet integrity is key to our long-term success. In order to maintain balance sheet integrity, we seek to estimate the amount of future obligations, especially reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, in a consistent and appropriate fashion. Excluding 2012, we have had favorable loss reserve development for each prior year period since 2008. From December 31, 2007 through 2015, we have experienced $121.5 million of cumulative net favorable reserve development. 

Focus on Specialty Insurance Markets . By focusing on specialty markets in which our underwriters have particular expertise and in which we have fewer competitors than in standard markets, we have greater flexibility to price and structure our products in accordance with our underwriting strategy. We believe underwriting profitability can best be achieved through restricting our risk taking on insurance and reinsurance to niches where, because of our expertise, we can distinguish ourselves in the underwriting and pricing process. 

Use Timely and Accurate Data . We design our internal processing and data collection systems to provide our management team with accurate and relevant information in real-time. Our data warehouse collects premium, commission and claims data, including detailed information regarding policy price, terms, conditions and the nature of the insured&#8217;s business. This data allows us to analyze trends in our business, including results by individual agent or broker, underwriter and class of business and expand or contract our operations quickly in response to market conditions. We rely on our information technology systems in this process. Additionally, the claims staff also contributes to our underwriting operations through its communication of claims information to our underwriters. 

Respond Rapidly to Market Opportunities and Challenges . We plan to grow our business to take advantage of opportunities in markets in which we believe we can use our expertise to generate consistent underwriting profits. We seek to measure rates monthly and react quickly to changes in the rates or terms the market will accept. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our Excess and Surplus Lines segment gross written premiums increased by 22.2% over the same period in 2014. In this favorable pricing environment, we have taken steps to grow and are increasing gross written premiums across most underwriting divisions in this segment. In 2015, we enjoyed growth in our General Casualty, Manufacturers and Contractors, Energy, Excess Property, Environmental and Allied Health divisions within our Excess and Surplus Lines segment. During the same period, we felt rates were not generally adequate for risks submitted to our Professional Liability, Medical Professionals, and Life Sciences divisions, and we reduced our writings in those divisions. This very specific evaluation of each risk or class of risks is a hallmark of our underwriting. 

When market conditions have been challenging, or when actual experience has not been as favorable as we anticipated, we have tried to act quickly to evaluate our situation and to make course corrections in order to protect our profits and preserve tangible equity. Our actions have included reducing our writings when margins tightened and exiting lines or classes of business when we believed the risk of continuing in a line outweighed the potential rewards from underwriting. We do not hesitate to increase loss estimates when we determine that it is appropriate. 

Manage Capital Actively . We seek to make &#8220;both sides&#8221; of our balance sheet generate better than average risk-adjusted returns. We invest and manage our capital with a goal of consistently increasing tangible equity for our shareholders and generating attractive returns on tangible equity. We intend to expand our premium volume and capital base to take advantage of opportunities to earn an underwriting profit or to reduce our premium volume and capital base if attractive underwriting opportunities are not available. We expect to finance our future operations with a combination of debt and equity and do not intend to raise or retain more capital than we believe we can profitably deploy in a reasonable time frame. We may not, however, always be able to raise capital when needed. We declared $47.8 million of dividends to our shareholders ($1.64 per share) during 2015 and $70.0 million of dividends to our shareholders ($2.45 per share) in 2014, as we had excess capital beyond the level needed to support our insurance operations. In 2013, we repurchased 7.5 million of our common shares for a total purchase price of&#8201; $110.8 million. Our ratings from A.M. Best are very important to us and maintaining them will be a principal consideration in our decisions regarding capital management. 

Our Structure 

The chart below displays our corporate structure as it pertains to our holding and operating subsidiaries. 

Business Segments 

Excess and Surplus Lines Segment 

We report our U.S.-based E&#38;S lines of business in our Excess and Surplus Lines segment. We underwrite non-admitted business through our subsidiaries, James River Insurance and James River Casualty, from offices in Richmond, Virginia; Scottsdale, Arizona; and Atlanta, Georgia. James River Insurance is our largest subsidiary as measured by gross written premiums (54.0% of total gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015 came from our Excess and Surplus Lines segment) and has been engaged in E&#38;S insurance for 13 years. James River Insurance has had a consistent record of underwriting profits since its second year of operation. We added James River Casualty in 2009 to give us the ability to write E&#38;S risks in Ohio. 

E&#38;S lines insurance focuses on insureds that generally cannot purchase insurance from standard lines insurers typically due to perceived risk related to their businesses. Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment underwrites property casualty insurance on an E&#38;S lines basis in all states and the District of Columbia. Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment distributes its policies through a network of appointed independent wholesale brokers throughout the United States. In 2015, our Excess and Surplus Lines segment&#8217;s gross written premiums grew by 22.2% over 2014. The Excess and Surplus Lines segment produced an average combined ratio of 82.0% from 2009 through 2015. 

Companies that underwrite on an E&#38;S lines basis operate under a different regulatory structure than standard market carriers. E&#38;S lines carriers are generally permitted to craft the terms of the insurance contract to suit the particular risk they are assuming. Also, E&#38;S lines carriers are, for the most part, free of rate regulation. In contrast, standard market carriers are generally required to use approved insurance forms and to charge rates that have been authorized by or filed with state insurance departments. However, as E&#38;S carriers, our insurance subsidiaries in the Excess and Surplus Lines segment are not backed by any state&#8217;s guarantee fund, and in most states these subsidiaries may only write coverage for an insured after they have been denied coverage by the standard market and signed declarations stating that the insured is aware that it will not have access to any state guarantee funds should these subsidiaries be unable to satisfy their obligations. 

Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment writes policies for a wide range of businesses and does not write personal lines insurance. Applications for insurance come through appointed wholesale brokers who are generally approached by retail agents after their clients have been rejected by standard markets. 

With the exception of one small program which had total gross written premiums of approximately $5.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Excess and Surplus Lines segment does not grant any underwriting authority to brokers or agents, and instead, all underwriting decisions are made by one of our over 100 underwriters who work within James River Insurance&#8217;s twelve underwriting divisions. Policies are individually underwritten. The leaders of these twelve divisions average 32 years of experience. 

All claims for business written by the Excess and Surplus Lines segment are managed by its internal claims department although we do use independent adjusters for inspection of certain claims.

The chart below identifies the Excess and Surplus Lines segment&#8217;s divisions and sets forth the amount of gross written premiums for the years 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011 fiscal years by each division.

The Excess and Surplus Lines segment distributes its products through a select group of licensed E&#38;S lines brokers that we believe can produce reasonable volumes of quality business for James River Insurance consistently. These brokers procure policies for their clients from us as well as from other insurance companies. At December 31, 2015, the segment had authorized 127 broker groups to work with us. The Excess and Surplus Lines segment generally makes broker authorizations by brokerage office and underwriting division. With the exception of its small hired and non-owned auto program (combined premiums of approximately $5.5 million for 2015) the Excess and Surplus Lines segment does not grant its brokers underwriting or claims authority. 

Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment selects its brokers based upon management&#8217;s review of the experience, knowledge and business plan of each broker. While many of our Excess and Surplus Lines segment&#8217;s brokers have more than one office, we evaluate each office as if it were a separate entity. Often, our Excess and Surplus Lines segment authorizes some but not all offices owned by a brokerage for specialized lines of business. Brokers must be able to demonstrate an ability to competently produce both the quality and quantity of business that we seek. Brokers unable to produce consistently profitable business, or who produce unacceptably low volumes of business, may be terminated. Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment&#8217;s underwriters regularly visit with brokers in their offices in order to discuss the products that we offer and the needs of the brokers. We believe the personal relationships we foster with individual brokers and our ability to respond to a wide variety of risks placed by these brokers make us an important market for them. 

Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment&#8217;s two largest brokers produced $129.9 million of gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing approximately 42.1% of the Excess and Surplus Lines segment&#8217;s gross written premiums for 2015. The two largest brokers produced $87.9 million (BB&#38;T Insurance Services) and $42.0 million of gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The top two brokers each accounted for more than 10% of our gross written premiums in this segment for such year. Our third largest broker produced $29.4 million of gross written premiums in 2015. 

In 2015 and 2014, our Excess and Surplus Lines segment paid an average commission to producers of 16.1% and 17.0%, respectively, of gross written premiums.

Underwriting 

Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment&#8217;s staff includes over 100 individuals directly employed in underwriting policies. We believe our internal business processing systems allow us to maintain a high ratio of underwriters to total employees.

We are very selective about the policies we bind. Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment binds approximately 3% of new submissions and one out of every six quotes. We realize all excess and surplus lines applications have already been rejected by the standard market. If our underwriters cannot reasonably expect to bind coverage at the combination of premiums and coverage that meet our standards, they are encouraged to quickly move on to another prospective opportunity. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received approximately 166,400 submissions (new and renewal), quoted 37,300 policies and bound 12,300 policies. 

When we accept risk in our Excess and Surplus Lines segment, we are careful to establish terms that are suited to the risk and the pricing. As an excess and surplus lines writer, we use our freedom of rate and form in order to make it possible to take on risks that have already been rejected by admitted carriers who have determined they cannot insure these risks on approved forms at filed rates. 

We attempt to craft policies that offer affordable protection to our insureds by tailoring coverage in ways that make potential losses more predictable and are intended to reduce claims costs. For example, we frequently use a &#8220;punitive damages exclusion&#8221; and &#8220;defense inside the limits&#8221; endorsements, intended to prevent excessive defense costs; &#8220;assault and battery&#8221; exclusions or sub limits that are less than the full policy limits which allows us to quantify and limit our losses more precisely than in policies without the exclusion; and &#8220;classification limitation&#8221; and &#8220;specified location&#8221; endorsements that limit coverage to known exposures and locations. We have no material exposure to asbestos, lead paint, silica, mold, or nuclear, biological, or chemical terrorism. 

We design our internal processing and data collection systems to provide our management team with accurate and relevant information in real-time. Our data warehouse collects premium, commission and claims data, including detailed information regarding policy price, terms, conditions and the nature of the insured&#8217;s business. This data allows us to analyze trends in our business, including results by individual broker, underwriter and class of business and expand or contract our operations quickly in response to market conditions. We rely on our information technology systems in this process. Additionally, the claims staff also contributes to our underwriting operations through its communication of claims information to our underwriters. 

Claims 

Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment&#8217;s claims department consists of approximately 100 claims professionals who have an average of 10 years of claims experience in the property casualty industry as of December 31, 2015. 

Our excess and surplus lines business generally results in claims from premises/operations liability, professional liability, hired, and non-owned auto liability, auto physical damage, first party property losses and products liability. We believe the key to effective claims management is timely and thorough claims investigation. We seek to complete all investigations and adjust reserves appropriately as soon as is practicable after the receipt of a claim. We seek to manage the number of claims per adjuster to allow adjusters sufficient time to investigate and resolve claims. Each quarter, senior management reviews each case above a specified amount to ensure that the front-line adjuster has recognized and is addressing the key issues in the case and has adjusted the reserve to the appropriate amount. We keep the settlement authority of front-line adjusters low to ensure the practice of having two or more members of the department participate in the decision as to whether to settle or defend. In addition, cases with unusual damage, liability or policy interpretation issues are subjected to peer reviews on a weekly basis. Members of the underwriting staff participate in this process. Prior to any scheduled mediation or trial involving a claim, claims personnel conduct further peer review to make sure all issues and exposures have been adequately analyzed. We believe that effective management of litigation avoids delays and associated additional costs. 

Our claims staff also contributes to our underwriting operations through communication of claims information to our underwriters. The Vice President of Claims heads our forms committee, which reviews and develops all policy forms and exclusions and is also a member of the underwriting review committee. 

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 90% of claims were closed within five years in the Excess and Surplus Lines segment. 

The calendar year loss ratios for the Excess and Surplus Lines segment for the last nine years were 56.1% for 2007, 61.4% for 2008, 62.6% for 2009, 54.9% for 2010, 48.5% for 2011, 52.6% for 2012, 40.4% for 2013, 55.2% for 2014, and 54.5% for 2015. 

Specialty Admitted Insurance Segment 

The Falls Lake Group comprises our other U.S. insurance segment, Specialty Admitted Insurance. We established this segment in 2004 to underwrite workers&#8217; compensation insurance for residential contractors in North Carolina. Initially, we only sought licensure in North Carolina. Later, as our plans for this segment evolved, we sought and obtained additional licensure. The Falls Lake Group Companies are currently licensed to underwrite admitted insurance in 48 states and the District of Columbia. The Falls Lake Group consists of Falls Lake National Insurance Company (an Ohio domiciled company), Stonewood Insurance Company (a North Carolina domiciled company), Falls Lake General Insurance Company (an Ohio domiciled company), and Falls Lake Fire and Casualty Company (a California domiciled company). 

We plan to use our broader licensure and management expertise to earn substantial fee income as well as underwriting profits. The Specialty Admitted Insurance segment consists of: 

&#8226; 

our traditional workers&#8217; compensation business (39.5% of 2015 gross written premiums in this segment, 50.7% in 2014, 97.3% in 2013, and 100% in 2012; and 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

program and fronting business written through selected MGAs, insurance carriers, and other producers (60.5% of 2015 gross written premiums in this segment, 49.3% in 2014, 2.7% in 2013, and 0.0% in 2012). 

&#8203;

Traditional Workers&#8217; Compensation Business 

Our individual risk workers&#8217; compensation business remains a regionally focused effort. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 70% of our workers&#8217; compensation direct written premiums were in North Carolina, 17% were in Virginia, 10% were in South Carolina and 3% were in Tennessee. Due to more favorable market conditions currently, we are currently growing this business line. Construction workers as a class, regardless of industry, represented approximately 33% of the direct premiums in force in our workers&#8217; compensation book in 2015. Other significant classes include healthcare employees (19%), goods and services (13%), and manufacturing workers (13%). We view our workers&#8217; compensation business as a core competency, and seek to make consistent underwriting profits from it. We also recognize the cyclical nature of this line, and are prepared to contract the business rapidly when rates decline or the regulatory or economic environment makes it difficult to contain costs. We distribute our workers&#8217; compensation product through independent agents. 

Program Business 

As part of our plan to become less susceptible to admitted market cycles, we have begun to expand into program business. In a program arrangement, we give selected MGAs authority to produce, underwrite and administer policies that meet our underwriting and pricing guidelines. We enter into these arrangements selectively with agents who have significant experience and market presence in specialty risks. Seven programs were active and producing business as of December 31, 2015 and had combined gross written premiums of&#8201; $33.6 million for 2015. The underwriting is subject to regular audit by our staff, and we have electronic access to the underwriting systems of these agents, which facilitates our real-time supervision of their work. An example of the type of risks we take on in these programs is school bus and para transit programs in northeastern states. We focus our coverage on casualty risks, although some incidental property insurance is written. We seek to limit our risk generally through reinsurance either on a proportional or excess of loss basis, or both. We generally take up to $500,000 of loss per occurrence or per risk, net of reinsurance. 

Under the terms of these program agreements, we pay lower commissions when underwriting profits are low or lacking and we increase commissions when the business proves particularly profitable. In addition, we typically build in a substantial &#8220;spread&#8221; between the commission we earn from our reinsurers 

and the commissions paid to the MGA. This spread enhances our underwriting returns. We distribute our program business through MGAs and program managers.

For initial claims oversight and administration in our program business, we generally outsource frequency layer claims management to third-party administrators for the first $50,000 of a claim, and then assume direct control above this amount. 

Fronting Business 

Our Specialty Admitted Insurance segment has a small but growing fronting business, also intended to reduce our susceptibility to market cycles (three programs in place as of December 31, 2015, with combined gross written premiums of&#8201; $19.7 million for 2015). Fronting means that we issue insurance policies for another insurance entity or capital pool that may not have the licenses or rating to serve its desired market. The issuance of our policy makes us contractually responsible to the insured in the event they experience a covered loss. In our fronting business, we expect that claims will be paid by the party for whom we agreed to front. Typically, for these fronting arrangements, we require a deposit of liquid assets into a collateral trust equal to or greater than the amount of any and all receivables that we have from the entity with whom we have written the fronting arrangement. In many instances, we seek and receive collateral in excess of any and all actuarially estimated receivables from such company to provide protection against unforeseen adverse performance. We charge fees as a percentage of gross written premiums for issuing these policies. We establish fronting opportunities through a variety of sources, including direct carrier relationships, MGAs and reinsurance brokers. 

Similar to our program business, for initial claims oversight and administration in our fronting business, we generally outsource frequency layer claims management to the insurance entity or capital pool in the fronting arrangement for the first $50,000, and then assume direct control above this amount. 

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 90.0% of claims were closed within three years in the Specialty Admitted Insurance segment. 

Our objective over time, is to utilize the combination of fee income and underwriting profits available to our Specialty Admitted Insurance segment to generate returns on tangible equity consistent with results in our Excess and Surplus Lines segment. Additionally, we expect that this fee income will become material in future periods and provide us with a steady revenue stream relatively insulated from the pricing cycles of the admitted insurance market.

Casualty Reinsurance Segment 

We report our business of writing insurance for insurance companies in our Casualty Reinsurance segment. We participate in the reinsurance business through our Bermuda domiciled reinsurance subsidiary, JRG Re, which is a Class 3B reinsurer. JRG Re provides proportional and working layer insurance to third parties and to our U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries. For purposes of management evaluation, this segment&#8217;s underwriting results only include premiums ceded by, and losses incurred with respect to business assumed from unaffiliated companies and does not include premiums and losses ceded under the internal quota share arrangement described below. Business flows to JRG Re from the following two sources: 

&#8226; 

We provide proportional and working layer reinsurance to unaffiliated U.S.-based insurance companies. We underwrote $172.5 million in gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015. Of the third-party premiums written by JRG Re, 52% is for general liability coverage (much of this business is E&#38;S premium), 19% is workers&#8217; compensation insurance, 16% is personal auto coverage, 8% is commercial auto coverage, and the rest is excess casualty or non-medical professional liability. We typically structure our reinsurance policies as quota share arrangements with loss and risk mitigating features that align our interest with that of the ceding companies. At December 31, 2015, 97% of our third-party treaties are written as &#8220;proportional&#8221; arrangements and 86% of our treaties are subject to loss mitigation features. We purchase very little retrocessional coverage in this segment. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

We also have a direct intercompany reinsurance agreement under the terms of which 70% of the net written premiums of our U.S. subsidiaries (after taking into account third-party reinsurance) 

&#8203;

&#8203;

are ceded to JRG Re in Bermuda. In 2015, our U.S. subsidiaries ceded $208.7 million in premiums to JRG Re. This business is ceded to JRG Re under a proportional, or quota-share, reinsurance treaty that has an arm&#8217;s length ceding commission. We do not pay corporate income tax on earnings (including investment income) in Bermuda. We do, however, pay a 1% U.S. Federal excise tax on premiums ceded to JRG Re. 

Almost all of the segment&#8217;s premiums are for casualty coverages. The Casualty Reinsurance segment writes very little property business and virtually no reinsurance designed to respond to catastrophic events of any kind. For example, we had a $203,000 loss in our Casualty Reinsurance segment from Superstorm Sandy, which occurred in 2012, entirely from one treaty where we reinsured property exposures on motorcycles. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our Casualty Reinsurance segment generated an underwriting loss of&#8201; $2.6 million when analyzed as a stand-alone entity, without the benefit of the premiums ceded from our Excess and Surplus Lines segment and Specialty Admitted Insurance segment. 

The Casualty Reinsurance segment conducted business with three brokers that generated $127.6 million of gross written premiums for the Casualty Reinsurance segment in the year ended December 31, 2015, representing 73.8% of the gross written premiums of the Casualty Reinsurance segment for such year. The three largest brokers produced $84.9 million (Atlantic Intermediaries), $27.4 million, and $15.3 million of gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, only the two largest brokers produced more than 10% of the segment&#8217;s gross written premiums for the year. 

Underwriting profits and investment income earned by our Bermuda reinsurance company are exempt from U.S. taxation. One effect of the quota share arrangement between our domestic companies and JRG Re is that an increasing percentage of our assets are located in Bermuda. At December 31, 2015, approximately 67% of our total cash and invested assets were located in Bermuda. 

Corporate and Other Segment 

Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer and other holding company employees are part of the Corporate and Other segment. This is where we set and direct strategy for the group as a whole as well as high level objectives for each of the three operating segments. We make all capital management, capital allocation, treasury functions, information technology and group wide risk management decisions in this segment. Our decisions at this level also include reinsurance purchasing. 

Financial Information About Segments 

Financial and other information by segment for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 is set forth in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Purchase of Reinsurance 

We routinely purchase reinsurance for our Excess and Surplus Lines and Specialty Admitted Insurance segments and, less frequently purchase retrocessional coverage for our Casualty Reinsurance segment to reduce volatility by limiting our exposure to large losses and to provide capacity for growth. In a reinsurance transaction, an insurance company transfers, or cedes, all or part of its exposure in return for a portion of the premium. In a retrocession transaction, a reinsurer transfers, or cedes, all or part of its exposure in return for a portion of the premium. Our companies remain legally responsible for the entire obligation to policyholders and ceding companies, irrespective of any reinsurance or retrocession coverage we may purchase. Typically, we pay claims from our own funds and then seek reimbursement from the reinsurer or retrocessionaire, as applicable. There is credit exposure with respect to losses ceded to the extent that any reinsurer or retrocessionaire is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations ceded by us under reinsurance or retrocessional treaties. The ability to collect on reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance is subject to many factors, including the solvency of the counterparty and their interpretation of contract language and other factors. We currently have no disputes with any reinsurer or retrocessionaire and we are not aware of any credit problems with any of the group&#8217;s reinsurers or retrocessionaires.

Purchased Property Reinsurance 

Our focus on return on tangible equity leads us to avoid lines of business that are exposed to high degrees of volatility. The Excess and Surplus Lines segment writes a limited book of excess property risks (approximately $12.5 million direct written premiums in 2015). The risks assumed in this book are geographically dispersed and significantly reinsured to limit losses. The Excess and Surplus Lines segment retains up to $5.0 million per risk on our excess property book; however, the average retained amount per risk is approximately $3.2 million. In our Specialty Admitted Insurance segment, we focus on casualty business, but we do write a limited amount of property insurance, principally through our programs and fronting business. The focus in our Casualty Reinsurance segment is also primarily casualty business, but we do have a small amount of assumed business with property exposure. 

In our Excess and Surplus Lines segment, we purchased a surplus share reinsurance treaty specifically designed to cover property risks. The surplus share treaty along with facultative reinsurance helps ensure that our net retained limit per risk will be $5.0 million or below. Additionally, we purchased catastrophe reinsurance of&#8201; $40.0 million in excess of a $5.0 million retention that is intended to cover the 1,000 year modeled PML on the segment&#8217;s excess property book (in the aggregate). Where the Specialty Admitted Insurance segment incurs incidental property risks in its program book of business, the segment is covered for $4.0 million in excess of&#8201; $1.0 million per occurrence. This is also intended to cover the 1,000 year modeled PML on any property exposures the Specialty Admitted Insurance segment assumes. In our Casualty Reinsurance segment, we believe that our maximum loss from a catastrophic event is approximately $1.0 million, and we do not currently purchase retrocessional reinsurance coverage for property-catastrophe risks. In aggregate, therefore, we believe our pre-tax group-wide PML from a 1,000 year catastrophic event is approximately $10.0 million, inclusive of reinstatement premiums payable. 

Purchased Casualty Reinsurance 

In our Excess and Surplus Lines segment, in four of our divisions we only write $1.0 million per occurrence limits (Manufacturers &#38; Contractors, General Casualty, Small Business and Sports and Entertainment), and we do not purchase any reinsurance for these policies. In our other divisions, where we issue policies with larger limits, we purchase reinsurance in excess of&#8201; $1.0 million per occurrence. 

In our Specialty Admitted Insurance segment at December 31, 2015, we retain the first $600,000 per occurrence in losses on individual risk workers&#8217; compensation policies and are reinsured above that level to $30.0 million per occurrence, with a maximum reinsured recovery of&#8201; $10.0 million for any one life. On other lines of business in our program and fronting business, we purchase proportional reinsurance and excess of loss reinsurance to limit our exposure to no more than $500,000 per occurrence. 

For both our Excess and Surplus Lines segment and our Specialty Admitted Insurance segment, we purchase a clash and contingency reinsurance treaty that covers us for $6.0 million in excess of&#8201; $2.5 million which would cover us, for example, in a situation where we have multiple insureds who have losses from the same event. 

In our Casualty Reinsurance segment, we currently do not purchase any material retrocessional reinsurance. In prior periods, we have purchased proportional retrocessional coverage for particular situations related to specific treaties, but have only done so on a limited basis.

For 2015, our top ten reinsurers represented 86.5% of our total ceded reinsurance recoverables, and all of these reinsurance recoverables were from reinsurers with an A.M. Best rating of&#8201; &#8220;A-&#8221; (Excellent) or better or are collateralized with letters of credit or by a trust agreement. The following table sets forth our ten most significant reinsurers by amount of reinsurance recoverables and the amount of reinsurance recoverables pertaining to each such reinsurer as well as its A.M.

These reinsurers are unrated, and we are collateralized for the recoverable amounts. 

&#8203;

Reserve Policy 

Over time, many insurance companies have underestimated the cost of future losses associated with insurance policies issued. We seek to establish reserves that will adequately meet our obligations. We have six actuaries on staff, and we engage independent actuarial consultants to review our decisions regarding reserves twice a year. 

When setting our reserves, we use a blend of actuarial techniques that are chosen to reflect the nature of the lines of insurance we underwrite. We seek to be consistent and transparent in establishing our reserves. 

In many cases, several years may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss and our eventual payment of the loss. We establish loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for the ultimate payment of all losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred. We estimate the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses using individual case-basis valuations of reported claims. We also use statistical analyses to estimate the cost of losses that have been incurred but not reported to us. These estimates are based on historical information and on estimates of future trends that may affect the frequency of claims and changes in the average cost of claims that may arise in the future. We also consider various factors such as: 

&#8226; 

Loss emergence and insured reporting patterns; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Underlying policy terms and conditions; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Business and exposure mix; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Trends in claim frequency and severity; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Changes in operations; 

&#8203;

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Emerging economic and social trends; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Inflation; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Changes in the regulatory and litigation environments; and 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Discussions with third-party actuarial consultants. 

&#8203;

The procedures we use to estimate loss reserves assume that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future events. It also assumes that adequate historical or other data exists upon which to make these judgments. These estimates are by their nature subjective and imprecise, and ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses may vary from established reserves. 

Our Reserve Committee consists of our Chief Actuary, our President and Chief Operating Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Accounting Officer. Additionally, the presidents and chief actuaries of each of our three insurance segments assist in the evaluation of reserves in their respective segments. The Reserve Committee meets quarterly to review the actuarial recommendations made by each chief actuary and uses its best judgement to determine the best estimate to be recorded for the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses on our quarterly balance sheet. 

The following table reflects our reserve development by segment during the calendar years 2015 to 2008 individually and in aggregate.

Among the indicators of reserve strength that we monitor closely are the number of claims outstanding from a given year and the amount of IBNR reserves held on our balance sheet for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. As a general rule, every known claim has a specific case reserve established against it which management believes is adequate to resolve the claim and pay attendant expenses. 

A significant portion of reported claims from prior policy years were closed at December 31, 2015. The table below sets forth the percentage of claims closed by policy year for our Excess and Surplus Lines and Specialty Admitted Insurance segments for the policy years indicated.

We maintain reserves for specific claims incurred and reported, reserves for claims incurred but not reported and reserves for uncollectible reinsurance when appropriate. Our ultimate liability may be greater or less than current reserves. In the insurance industry, there is always the risk that reserves may prove inadequate. We continually monitor reserves using new information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques. Anticipated inflation is reflected implicitly in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and the review of historical development. We do not discount our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses to reflect estimated present value. 

The following table presents the development of balance sheet property casualty loss reserves calculated in accordance with GAAP, as of December 31 in each of the years 2007 through 2015. This table does not present accident or policy year development data. The top line of the table shows the gross reserves as of December 31 for each of the indicated years and is reconciled to the net reserve by adjusting for reinsurance recoverables. This represents the estimated amount of net loss and loss adjustment expense arising in the current year and all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date, including IBNR reserves. The table also shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves as adjusted for new information received as of the end of each succeeding year. 

The estimates change as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years. The &#8220;net cumulative redundancy&#8221; represents the aggregate change to date from the original estimate on the third line of the table, &#8220;reserves for property casualty losses originally stated, net of reinsurance.&#8221; The &#8220;gross cumulative redundancy&#8221; represents the aggregate change to date from the original estimate on the top line of the table, &#8220;gross reserves for property casualty losses.&#8221; The table also shows the cumulative net paid amounts as of successive years with respect to the net reserve liability. For example, the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses net of reinsurance at the end of 2008 for 2008 and all prior years was originally estimated to be $354.1 million. Seven years later, as of December 31, 2015, this amount was re-estimated to be $280.9 million, of which $264.2 million had been paid, leaving a reserve of $16.7 million for losses and loss adjustment expenses for 2008 and prior years remaining unpaid as of December 31, 2015.

For example, the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses developed a $73.1 million redundancy from December 31, 2008 to December 31, 2015. Conditions and trends that have affected the development of loss reserves in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on the table. Gross cumulative redundancy is presented before deductions for reinsurance. Gross deficiencies and redundancies may be significantly more or less than net deficiencies and redundancies due to the nature and extent of applicable reinsurance. 

See Note 6 to the Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussion under &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; for a discussion of estimates and assumptions related to the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses. 

Investment Strategy 

One benefit of reinsuring a portion of our business to a Bermuda affiliate is that we have been able to build, and expect to continue building, a substantial asset base in a domicile where corporate earnings, including investment returns, are not taxed. At December 31, 2015, approximately 67.0% of our cash and invested assets were held in Bermuda with the remainder held by our U.S. subsidiaries. 

The prolonged low interest rate environment has made it more difficult for insurance companies to earn attractive returns on capital because of reduced investment income. Our premium growth has allowed us to build our asset base. Cash and invested assets now represent 2.9 times our tangible equity. 

We attempt to generate better than market average risk-adjusted returns in our investment portfolio by taking measured risks based upon detailed knowledge of certain niche asset classes. We seek to make &#8220;both sides&#8221; of the balance sheet work to generate better than market average risk-adjusted returns. While we are willing to make investments in non-traditional types of investments, we avoid risks that we do not understand well, as well as structures or situations we think could cause substantial loss of capital. 

The majority of our investment portfolio is invested in what we refer to as our Core Portfolio of investment grade fixed income securities. This portfolio provides predictable income with low risk of principal loss. We seek to augment the return on the Core Portfolio by investing in bank loans, higher yielding securities and private investments. We designed these strategies to improve our investment return and are focused on opportunistic investing in areas where we believe our management, directors or employees have expertise or understanding of the risk and return of the investment. 

Our strategy is designed to earn higher returns than an investment grade fixed income strategy alone while maintaining a high overall credit rating and investing in asset classes and allocations that are consistent with the insurance regulatory and rating agency framework within which we operate. We generally focus on securities that provide some current income. 

A summary of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2015 is as follows:

&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 1,244.3 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; We have generally managed our overall portfolio to a duration of 3 to 5 years. At December 31, 2015, the average duration of our investment portfolio, excluding bank loans, was 4.3 years, and the duration for bank loans is 0.2 years (since nearly all of them have floating rates of interest), resulting in an approximate duration for the entire portfolio of 3.5 years. 

Core Portfolio 

The Core Portfolio consists of cash and investment grade fixed income securities. Our objective in the Core Portfolio is to earn attractive risk-adjusted returns with a low risk of loss of principal. We use a third-party manager(s) to manage the Core Portfolio. 

Bank Loans 

The Bank Loan portfolio primarily consists of investments in participations in syndicated bank loans, but may also include a small allocation of bonds. Bank loans in our portfolio are generally senior secured loans with an average credit quality of&#8201; &#8220;B&#8221; and floating interest rates based on spreads over LIBOR. We believe bank loans are an attractive asset class because (1) floating-rate loans help to reduce our risk of loss in the event of rising interest rates, (2) the loans are generally senior secured, (3) the asset class has a history of relatively high recovery rates in the event of default, (4) the portfolio provides an attractive yield and 

(5) the maturities of the loans are relatively short (average of 5 years). We invest in this asset class by owning individual loan participations that are carried at amortized cost less any loan loss allowance. We have over five years of experience in investing in this asset class through a third-party manager.

Incremental Yield Portfolio 

The Incremental Yield Portfolio consists of investments in low investment grade and below investment grade bonds, preferred stocks, dividend paying common equities and publicly-traded partnerships. The average credit quality of the fixed income securities in this portfolio as of December 31, 2015 is BBB. We generally invest in fixed income securities where we believe that risk of default is low relative to the potential yield on the securities. Historically, we made significant purchases of below investment grade securities that were trading at a discount to par. More recently as such opportunities are limited, we have been opportunistically investing in high yield securities where we believe we have expertise or an understanding of the risk. We own preferred stocks, generally in the financial services industry. In some instances, we will purchase common equity securities and master limited partnerships. However, these purchases are generally used as an effective means to get access to some high yielding asset class. As of December, 2015, only $10.9 million of the Incremental Yield Portfolio is invested in common equities and master limited partnerships. The Incremental Yield Portfolio was initiated in 2010. 

Private Investment Portfolio 

We make selective investments in private debt or equity securities in areas where we see significant opportunity or attractive risk and return characteristics. We focus on investments where we believe we have an understanding of the risk and opportunity and have the ability to monitor them closely. At December 31, 2015, we held ten private investments and one publicly-traded equity investment with a total carrying value of&#8201; $63.9 million. Our portfolio consists of investments in wind and solar energy, banking, and small cap equities, loans of middle market private equity sponsored companies, and equity tranches of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). We are opportunistic in our private investment strategy and our portfolio may grow or shrink based on the opportunities available to us. Despite being only 4.9% of our portfolio, we believe our Private Investment Portfolio has added meaningful returns to our tangible equity. Our Private Investment strategy has significant risk and not all investments are successful. As a result, we intentionally keep this portfolio as a small portion of the overall investment portfolio. 

Our recent total returns on our portfolio are as follows:

We consider a portion of our investment portfolio to be invested in non-traditional investments. We consider non-traditional investments to include investments that are (1) not rated bond or fixed income securities (2) non-listed equities or (3) investments that generally have less liquidity than rated bond or fixed income securities or listed equities. Non-traditional investments held at December 31, 2015 and their respective percentage of our total invested assets at such date consist of syndicated bank loans (15.4%), interests in limited liability companies that invest in renewable energy opportunities (2.1%), limited partnerships that invest in debt or equity securities (1.4%), and private debt securities (0.9%). We will continue to actively review opportunities to invest in non-traditional assets and may invest in additional non-traditional assets in the future. 

Our invested assets totaled $1,244.3 million as of December 31, 2015. The weighted average credit rating of our portfolio of fixed maturity securities, bank loans and redeemable preferred stocks as of December 31, 2015 was &#8220;A&#8221;. We have intentionally maintained a cautious interest rate risk position by 

having an average duration of approximately 3.5 years at December 31, 2015. This duration represents an increase from our duration at December 31, 2014 and 2013. Based on the current duration of 3.5 years, a 1.0% increase in interest rates would result in a pretax decline in the market value of our portfolio of approximately $43.3 million. 

Insurance Cycle Management and Growth 

The insurance and reinsurance business is cyclical in nature, with &#8220;hard&#8221; and &#8220;soft&#8221; cycles. Hard markets occur when insurance underwriters limit their exposure in a line of business or across their entire portfolio. When underwriters exercise restraint, insurance buyers are forced to pay more to induce underwriters to cover their risks. A hard market can also be created by economic expansions when capital committed to backing insurance policies does not grow as fast as the demand for insurance. There is generally a correlation between interest rates and the willingness of insurance companies to commit their capital to writing insurance. When fixed income yields are low, insurance companies need to raise insurance prices to improve underwriting results in order to offset loss of investment income. 

We are currently in a growth phase for our U.S. primary operations. In both our Excess and Surplus Lines and Specialty Admitted Insurance segments, we are experiencing growth in premiums driven by stable rates as well as increases in policy count and exposures. The table below shows the changes in gross written premiums we have experienced in our operating segments from 2013 through 2015.

The recession in the United States from 2008 to 2010 was a significant driver of these soft market conditions. 

Our Excess and Surplus Lines segment is the most sensitive to hard and soft markets. We have, therefore, sought to diversify this business by geography, line of business and also revenue stream. From 2006 to 2010, we reduced the gross written premiums in this business from $249.1 million to $116.1 million, or 53.4%. While we have been growing this business, and achieving increasing or stable rates for several periods through December 31, 2015, there will likely be periods in the future where our growth moderates, stagnates or turns negative. 

We believe, however, that our Excess and Surplus Lines segment will be able to make an underwriting profit regardless of the state of the underwriting cycle. This belief has been borne out by our historical results in this segment which has had a weighted average combined ratio of 82.8% for the period from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2015. 

Traditionally, admitted insurance lines have been very susceptible to market cycles. We believe this trend is continuing. We seek to isolate ourselves from these trends in our Specialty Admitted Insurance segment by writing lines of business we believe are slightly less competitive, by prudently purchasing reinsurance and by being willing to dramatically reduce our writings when market conditions warrant. 

A material portion of the profitability we seek to achieve from our program and fronting business will come from fee income that is generated via policies that are issued by our insurance companies and then mostly or wholly reinsured to third parties. Because we earn substantial fees from underwriting business on which we retain little or no insurance risk, this business can be profitable to us even in soft market conditions. We have written $55.0 million of gross written premiums for fronting and program business for 2015 ($12.4 million on a net basis), and we expect that this fee income will become material in future periods and provide us with a steady revenue stream that will be relatively insulated from conditions in the admitted insurance market.

In the Casualty Reinsurance segment, we have the ability to manage the cycle by growing or shrinking our business according to market conditions and the corresponding prices and terms being offered for the assumption of specific risks. We have a small team of seven people in Bermuda who underwrite and administer the business written by JRG Re in Bermuda. Accordingly, our overhead is low and does not necessitate us growing this business from its current size. 

Competition 

We compete in a variety of markets against a variety of competitors depending on the nature of the risk and coverage being underwritten. The competition for any one account may range from large international firms to smaller regional companies in the domiciles in which we operate. To remain competitive, our strategy includes, among other measures: (1) focusing on rate adequacy and underwriting discipline, (2) leveraging our distribution network, (3) controlling expenses, (4) maintaining financial strength and issuer credit ratings and (5) providing quality services to agents and policyholders. 

Excess and Surplus Lines 

Competition within the E&#38;S lines marketplace comes from a wide range of carriers. In addition to mature E&#38;S companies that operate nationwide, there is competition from carriers formed in recent years. The Excess and Surplus Lines segment may also compete with national and regional carriers from the standard market willing to underwrite selected accounts on an admitted basis. Competitors in this segment include Scottsdale Insurance Company (Nationwide Mutual Group), Markel Corporation, Burlington Insurance Group, AXIS Capital Holdings Limited, Arch Capital Group Ltd., Admiral Insurance Co. (W. R. Berkley Corporation), Lexington Insurance Company (American International Group, Inc.), Mt. Hawley Insurance Company (RLI Corporation), Colony Specialty Insurance Company (Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd.), and Houston Casualty Company (a subsidiary of Tokio Marine). 

Specialty Admitted Insurance 

Due to the diverse nature of the products offered by the Specialty Admitted Insurance segment, competition comes from various sources. The majority of the competition for our workers&#8217; compensation bsuiness comes from regional companies or regional subsidiaries of national carriers in the domiciles in which they operate. National carriers tend to compete for program accounts along all product lines. Competitors in our workers&#8217; compensation business include Builders Mutual Insurance Company, Accident Fund, W. R. Berkley Corporation, American Interstate Insurance Company (AMERISAFE, Inc.), and Amtrust. Competition for our fronting business includes State National Group, Republic Insurance Group, QBE, Allied World, and Amtrust. 

Casualty Reinsurance 

The reinsurance industry is highly competitive. We expect to compete with major reinsurers, most of which are well-established, have a significant operating history and strong financial strength ratings and have developed long-standing client relationships. Competitors in this segment include Maiden Holdings, Ltd., Hamilton Re, Ltd., PartnerRe Ltd. and Third Point Reinsurance Ltd. 

Regulation 

Bermuda Insurance Regulation 

The Insurance Act 1978 and related rules and regulations (the &#8220;Insurance Act&#8221;) which regulates the insurance business of JRG Re provides that no person shall carry on insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer under the Insurance Act by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the &#8220;BMA&#8221;). The BMA is required by the Insurance Act to determine whether the applicant is a fit and proper body to be engaged in the insurance business and, in particular, whether it has, or has available to it, adequate knowledge and expertise. The registration of an applicant as an insurer is subject to its complying with the terms of its registration and such other conditions as the BMA may impose at any time.

The Insurance Act does not distinguish between insurers and reinsurers; companies are registered under the Insurance Act as &#8220;insurers&#8221;. The Insurance Act uses the defined term &#8220;insurance business&#8221; to include reinsurance.

The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards on Bermuda insurance companies, as well as auditing and reporting requirements. The Insurance Act also grants to the BMA powers to supervise, investigate and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies. 

Certain significant aspects of the Bermuda insurance regulatory framework applicable to Class 3B insurers are set forth below. 

Classification of Insurers 

The Insurance Act distinguishes between insurers carrying on long-term business, insurers carrying on general business and insurers carrying on special purpose business. There are six classifications of insurers carrying on general business, ranging from Class 1 insurers (pure captives) to Class 4 insurers (large commercial underwriters). JRG Re is licensed as a Class 3B insurer and is regulated as such under the Insurance Act. 

Classification as a Class 3B insurer 

A body corporate is registrable as a Class 3B insurer where (1) 50% or more of its net premiums written or (2) 50% or more of its net loss and loss expense provisions, represent unrelated business and its total net premiums written from unrelated business are $50.0 million or more. 

Minimum Paid-Up Share Capital 

A Class 3B insurer is required to maintain fully paid up share capital of at least $120,000. 

Principal Office and Principal Representative

A Class 3B insurer is required to maintain a head and a principal office in Bermuda and to appoint and maintain a principal representative in Bermuda. For the purposes of the Insurance Act, the principal office of JRG Re is located at Wellesley House, 2 nd Floor, 90 Pitts Bay Road, Pembroke, HM 08, Bermuda. JRG Re&#8217;s principal representative is Kevin B. Copeland, the Chief Financial Officer of JRG Re.

Without a reason acceptable to the BMA, a Class 3B insurer may not terminate the appointment of its principal representative, and the principal representative may not cease to act as such, unless 30 days&#8217; notice in writing to the BMA is given of the intention to do so.

It is the duty of the principal representative to forthwith notify the BMA when the principal representative reaches the view that there is a likelihood of the Class 3B insurer becoming insolvent or when the principal representative has knowledge or reasonable grounds for believing that a reportable &#8220;event&#8221; has occurred. Examples of a reportable &#8220;event&#8221; include a failure by the Class 3B insurer to comply substantially with a condition imposed upon it by the BMA relating to a solvency margin or a liquidity or other ratio, a significant loss reasonably likely to cause the Class 3B insurer to fail to comply with its enhanced capital requirement (discussed below) and the occurrence of a material change (as such term is defined under the Insurance Act) in its business operations.

Within 14 days of such notification to the BMA, the principal representative must furnish the BMA with a written report setting out all the particulars of the case that are available to the principal representative.

Where there has been a significant loss which is reasonably likely to cause the Class 3B insurer to fail to comply with its enhanced capital requirement, the principal representative must also furnish the BMA with a capital and solvency return reflecting an enhanced capital requirement prepared using post-loss data. The principal representative must provide this within 45 days of notifying the BMA regarding the loss.

Furthermore, where a notification has been made to the BMA regarding a material change, the principal representative has 30 days from the date of such notification to furnish the BMA with unaudited interim statutory financial statements in relation to such period as the BMA may require, together with a general business solvency certificate in respect of those statements.

Loss Reserve Specialist

A Class 3B insurer is required to appoint an individual approved by the BMA to be its loss reserve specialist. In order to qualify as an approved loss reserve specialist, the applicant must be an individual qualified to provide an opinion in accordance with the requirements of the Insurance Act and the BMA must be satisfied that the individual is fit and proper to hold such an appointment.

A Class 3B insurer is required to submit annually an opinion of its approved loss reserve specialist with its capital and solvency return. The loss reserve specialist&#8217;s opinion must state, among other things, whether or not the aggregate amount of technical provisions shown in the statutory economic balance sheet as at the end of the relevant financial year (i) meets the requirements of the Insurance Act and (ii) makes reasonable provision for the total technical provisions of the insurer under the terms of its insurance contracts and agreements.

Annual Financial Statements

A Class 3B insurer must prepare and submit, on an annual basis, both audited GAAP (as defined below) and statutory financial statements.

The Insurance Act prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of statutory financial statements (which include, in statutory form, an economic balance sheet, income statement, a statement of economic capital and surplus and notes thereto). The statutory financial statements include detailed information and analysis regarding premiums, claims, reinsurance and investments of the insurer.

In addition, a Class 3B insurer is also required to prepare and submit to the BMA financial statements which have been prepared under generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards (&#8220;GAAP financial statements&#8221;). The Class 3B insurer&#8217;s annual GAAP financial statements, and the auditor&#8217;s report thereon, and the statutory financial statements are required to be filed with the BMA within four months from the end of the relevant financial year (unless specifically extended with the approval of the BMA). The statutory financial statements do not form a part of the public records maintained by the BMA but the GAAP financial statements are available for public inspection.

Declaration of Compliance

At the time of filing its statutory financial statements, a Class 3B insurer is also required to deliver to the BMA a declaration of compliance, in such form and with such content as may be prescribed by the BMA, declaring whether or not the Class 3B insurer has, with respect to the preceding financial year (i) complied with all requirements of the minimum criteria applicable to it, (ii) complied with the minimum margin of solvency as at its financial year end, (iii) complied with the applicable enhanced capital requirements as at its financial year end, and (iv) observed any limitations, restrictions or conditions imposed upon issuance of its license, if applicable. The declaration of compliance is required to be signed by two directors of the Class 3B insurer, and if the Class 3B insurer has failed to comply with any of the requirements referenced in (i) through (iii) above or observe any limitations, restrictions or conditions imposed upon issuance of its license, if applicable, the Class 3B insurer will be required to provide the BMA with particulars of such failure in writing. A Class 3B insurer shall be liable to a civil penalty by way of a fine for failure to comply with a duty imposed on it in connection with the delivery of the declaration of compliance.

Annual Statutory Financial Return and Annual Capital and Solvency Return

A Class 3B insurer is required to file with the BMA a statutory financial return no later than four months after its financial year end (unless specifically extended with the approval of the BMA).

The statutory financial return includes, among other matters, the statutory financial statements and the calculations for the Class 3B insurer&#8217;s minimum solvency margin and liquidity ratio.

In addition, each year a Class 3B insurer is also required to file with the BMA a capital and solvency return along with its annual statutory financial return. The prescribed form of capital and solvency return comprises the Class 3B insurer&#8217;s Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (&#8220;BSCR&#8221;) model or an approved internal capital model in lieu thereof&#8201; (more fully described below), various schedules and the opinion of the loss reserve specialist.

Neither the statutory financial return nor the capital and solvency return is available for public inspection.

Quarterly Financial Statements

A Class 3B insurer is required to prepare and file quarterly financial returns with the BMA on or before the last day of the months of May, August and November of each year. The quarterly financial returns consist of&#8201; (i) quarterly unaudited financial statements for each financial quarter (which must minimally include a balance sheet and income statement and must also be recent and not reflect a financial position that exceeds two months), and (ii) a list and details of material intra-group transactions that the Class 3B insurer is a party to and the Class 3B insurer&#8217;s risk concentrations, which would also include, among other things, details surrounding reinsurance and retrocession arrangements, the 10 largest exposures to counterparties and any other counterparty exposures exceeding 10% of the Class 3B insurer&#8217;s statutory capital and surplus.

Public Disclosures

Pursuant to recent amendments to the Insurance Act all commercial insurers and insurance groups are required to prepare and file with the BMA, and also publish on their website, a financial condition report. The BMA has discretion to approve modifications and exemptions to the public disclosure rules on application by an insurer if, among other things, the BMA is satisfied that the disclosure of certain information will result in a competitive disadvantage or compromise confidentiality obligations of the insurer.

Independent Approved Auditor

A Class 3B insurer must appoint an independent auditor who will audit and report on the Class 3B insurer&#8217;s GAAP financial statements and provide audit assurance that its statutory financial statements were derived from its GAAP financial statements, each of which are required to be filed annually with the BMA.

Non-insurance Business

No Class 3B insurer may engage in non-insurance business unless that non-insurance business is ancillary to its core business. Non-insurance business means any business other than insurance business and includes carrying on investment business, managing an investment fund as operator, carrying on business as a fund administrator, carrying on banking business, underwriting debt or securities or otherwise engaging in investment banking, engaging in commercial or industrial activities and carrying on the business of management, sales or leasing of real property.

Enhanced Capital Requirements and Minimum Solvency Margin

A Class 3B insurer is required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus at a level equal to or in excess of its enhanced capital requirement (&#8220;ECR&#8221;) which is established by reference to either the BSCR model or an approved internal capital model.

The BSCR model is a risk-based capital model which provides a method for determining a Class 3B insurer&#8217;s capital requirements (statutory economic capital and surplus) by taking into account the risk characteristics of different aspects of the Class 3B insurer&#8217;s business. The BSCR formulas establish capital requirements for eight categories of risk: fixed income investment risk, equity investment risk, interest rate/liquidity risk, premium risk, reserve risk, credit risk, catastrophe risk and operational risk. For each category, the capital requirement is determined by applying factors to asset, premium, reserve, creditor, probable maximum loss and operation items, with higher factors applied to items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.

While not specifically referred to in the Insurance Act, the BMA has also established a target capital level (&#8220;TCL&#8221;) for each Class 3B insurer equal to 120% of its ECR. While a Class 3B insurer is not currently required to maintain its statutory economic capital and surplus at this level, the TCL serves as an early warning tool for the BMA, and failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL will likely result in increased regulatory oversight.

Any Class 3B insurer which at any time fails to meet its applicable enhanced capital requirement shall, upon becoming aware of that failure, or of having reason to believe that such a failure has occurred, immediately notify the BMA in writing, and within 14 days of such notification, file with the BMA a written report containing particulars of the circumstances leading to the failure and a plan detailing the manner, specific actions to be taken and time within which the Class 3B insurer intends to rectify the failure. Within 45 days of becoming aware of that failure, or of having reason to believe that such a failure has occurred, a Class 3B insurer shall furnish the BMA with (i) unaudited statutory economic balance sheets and unaudited interim statutory financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP covering such period as the BMA may require; (ii) the opinion of a loss reserve specialist in relation to total general business insurance technical provisions as set out in the statutory economic balance sheet, where applicable; (iii) a general business solvency certificate in respect of the financial statements; and (iv) a capital and solvency return reflecting an enhanced capital requirement prepared using post failure data where applicable.

Prior to January 1, 2016, a Class 3B insurer was required to have general business assets that exceed the value of its general business liabilities by an amount greater than the amount prescribed by the Insurance Act as its Minimum Solvency Margin (&#8220;MSM&#8221;). The MSM that a Class 3B insurer was required to maintain with respect to its general business was the greater of&#8201; (i) $1.0 million, or (ii) 20% of the first $6.0 million of net premiums written; if in excess of&#8201; $6.0 million, the figure is $1.2 million plus 15% of net premiums written in excess of&#8201; $6.0 million (iii) 15% of the aggregate of loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves, or (iv) 25% of the ECR as reported at the end of the relevant year. The BMA is in the process of revising the provisions of the Insurance Act relating to the MSM, but it is anticipated that there will be no material changes.

If at any time a Class 3B insurer fails to meet its MSM requirements, it must, upon becoming aware of such failure, immediately notify the BMA and, within 14 days thereafter, file a written report with the BMA containing particulars of the circumstances that gave rise to the failure and setting out its plan detailing specific actions to be taken and the expected timeframe in which the Class 3B insurer intends to rectify the failure.

Eligible Capital

To enable the BMA to better assess the quality of a Class 3B insurer&#8217;s capital resources, the Class 3B insurer is required to disclose the makeup of its capital in accordance with the recently introduced &#8220;3-tiered eligible capital system&#8221;. Under this system, all of the Class 3B insurer&#8217;s capital instruments will be classified as either basic or ancillary capital which in turn will be classified into one of three tiers based on their &#8220;loss absorbency&#8221; characteristics. Highest quality capital will be classified Tier 1 Capital, and lesser quality capital will be classified as either Tier 2 Capital or Tier 3 Capital. Under this regime, up to certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may be used to support a Class 3B insurer&#8217;s MSM, ECR and TCL.

The characteristics of the capital instruments that must be satisfied to qualify as Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital are set out in the Insurance (Eligible Capital) Rules 2012, and amendments thereto. Under these rules, Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may, until January 1, 2026, include capital instruments that do not satisfy the requirement that the instrument be non-redeemable or settled only with the issuance of an instrument of equal or higher quality upon a breach, or if it would cause a breach, of the ECR.

Minimum Liquidity Ratio

The Insurance Act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business insurers. Prior to January 2016, a Class 3B insurer engaged in general business was required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities. Relevant assets included cash and time deposits, quoted investments, unquoted bonds and debentures, first liens on real estate, investment income due and accrued, accounts and premiums receivable, reinsurance balances receivable, funds held by ceding reinsurers, and any other assets which the BMA, on application in any particular case made to it with reasons, accepts in that case.

Certain categories of assets which, unless specifically permitted by the BMA, did not automatically qualify as relevant assets, such as unquoted equity securities, investments in and advances to affiliates and real estate and collateral loans.

The relevant liabilities were total general business insurance reserves and total other liabilities less deferred income tax and sundry liabilities (by interpretation, those not specifically defined) and letters of credit and guarantees. The BMA is in the process of revising the provisions of the Insurance Act relating to the minimum liquidity, but it is anticipated that there will be no material changes.

Code of Conduct

The Insurance Code of Conduct (the &#8220;Insurance Code&#8221;) prescribes the duties, standards, procedures and sound business principles which must be complied with by all companies registered under the Insurance Act. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Code will be taken into account by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner as prescribed by the Insurance Act, may result in the BMA exercising its powers of intervention and investigation (see below) and will be a factor in calculating the operational risk charge under the insurer&#8217;s BSCR or approved internal model.

Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions

A Class 3B insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying a dividend if it is in breach of its MSM, ECR or minimum liquidity ratio or if the declaration or payment of such dividend would cause such a breach. Where a Class 3B insurer fails to meet its MSM or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year, it is prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends during the next financial year without the approval of the BMA.

In addition, a Class 3B insurer is prohibited from declaring or paying in any financial year dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus (as shown on its previous financial year&#8217;s statutory balance sheet), unless it files (at least seven days before payment of such dividends) with the BMA an affidavit signed by at least two directors (one of whom must be a Bermuda resident director if any of the Class 3B insurer&#8217;s directors are resident in Bermuda) and the principal representative stating that it will continue to meet its solvency margin and minimum liquidity ratio. Where such an affidavit is filed, it shall be available for public inspection at the offices of the BMA.

Reduction of Capital 

No general business insurer may reduce its total statutory capital by 15% or more, as set out in its previous year&#8217;s financial statements, unless it has received the prior approval of the BMA. Total statutory capital consists of the insurer&#8217;s paid in share capital, and its contributed surplus (sometimes called additional paid in capital) and any other fixed capital designated by the BMA as statutory capital (such as letters of credit).

A Class 3B insurer seeking to reduce its statutory capital by 15% or more, as set out in its previous year&#8217;s financial statements, is also required to submit an affidavit signed by at least two directors (one of whom must be a Bermuda-resident director if any of the Class 3B insurer&#8217;s directors are resident in Bermuda) and the principal representative stating that the proposed reduction will not cause it to fail its relevant margins and such other information as the BMA may require. Where such an affidavit is filed, it shall be available for public inspection at the offices of the BMA.

Supervision, Investigation and Intervention

The BMA may, by notice in writing served on a registered person or a designated insurer, require the registered person or designated insurer to provide such information and/or documentation as the BMA may reasonably require with respect to matters that are likely to be material to the performance of its supervisory functions under the Insurance Act. In addition, it may require the auditor, underwriter, accountant or any other person with relevant professional skill of such registered person or a designated insurer to prepare a report on any aspect pertaining thereto. In the case of a report, the person so appointed shall immediately give the BMA written notice of any fact or matter of which he becomes aware or which indicates to him that any condition attaching to his registration under the Insurance Act is not or has not, or may not be or may not have, been fulfilled and that such matters are likely to be material to the 

performance of its functions under the Insurance Act. If it appears to the BMA to be desirable in the interests of the clients of a registered person or relevant insurance group, the BMA may also exercise these powers in relation to subsidiaries, parent companies and other affiliates of the registered person or designated insurer.

If the BMA deems it necessary to protect the interests of the policyholders or potential policyholders of an insurer or insurance group, it may appoint one or more competent persons to investigate and report on the nature, conduct or state of the insurer&#8217;s or the insurance group&#8217;s business, or any aspect thereof, or the ownership or control of the insurer or insurance group. If the person so appointed thinks it necessary for the purposes of his investigation, he may also investigate the business of any person who is or has been, at any relevant time, a member of the insurance group or of a partnership of which the person being investigated is a member. In this regard, it shall be the duty of every person who is or was a controller, officer, employee, agent, banker, auditor, accountant, barrister, attorney or insurance manager to produce to the person appointed such documentation as he may reasonably require for the purpose of the investigation, and to attend and answer questions relevant to the investigation and to otherwise provide such assistance as may be necessary in connection therewith.

Where the BMA suspects that a person has failed to properly register under the Insurance Act or that a registered person or designated insurer has failed to comply with a requirement of the Insurance Act or that a person is not, or is no longer, a fit and proper person to perform functions in relation to a regulated activity, it may, by notice in writing, carry out an investigation into such person (or any other person connected thereto). In connection therewith, the BMA may require every person who is or was a controller, officer, employee, agent, banker, auditor, accountant, barrister, attorney or insurance manager to make a report and produce such documents in his care, custody and control and to attend before the BMA to answer questions relevant to the BMA&#8217;s investigation and to take such actions as the BMA may direct. The BMA may also enter any premises for the purposes of carrying out its investigation and may petition the court for a warrant if&#8201; (i) it believes a person has failed to comply with a notice served on him, (ii) there are reasonable grounds for suspecting the incompleteness of any information, or documentation produced in response to such notice, or (iii) that its directions will not be complied with or that any relevant documents would be removed, tampered with or destroyed.

If it appears to the BMA that the business of the registered insurer is being conducted in a way that there is a significant risk of the insurer becoming insolvent or unable to meet its obligations to its policyholders, or that the insurer is in breach of the Insurance Act or any conditions imposed upon its registration, or the minimum criteria stipulated in the Insurance Act is not or has not been fulfilled in respect of a registered insurer, or that a person has become a controller without providing the BMA with the appropriate notice or in contravention of a notice of objection, or the registered insurer is in breach of its ECR, the BMA may issue such directions as it deems desirable for safeguarding the interests of the policyholders or potential policyholders of the insurer or the insurance group. The BMA may, among other things, direct an insurer (i) not to take on any new insurance business, (ii) not to vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase its liabilities, (iii) not to make certain investments, (iv) to realize certain investments, (v) to maintain or transfer to the custody of a specified bank, certain assets, (vi) not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions or to restrict the making of such payments, (vii) to limit its premium income, (viii) not to enter into any specified transaction with any specified persons or persons of a specified class, (ix) to provide such written particulars relating to the financial circumstances of the insurer as the BMA thinks fit, (x) to obtain the opinion of a loss reserve specialist and to submit it to the BMA, and (xi) to remove a controller or officer.

Fit and Proper Controller

The BMA maintains supervision over the controllers of all registered insurers in Bermuda.

A controller includes (i) the managing director of the registered insurer or its parent company, (ii) the chief executive of the registered insurer or of its parent company, (iii) a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder controller, and (iv) any person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the registered insurer or of its parent company are accustomed to act.

The definition of shareholder controller is set out in the Insurance Act, but generally refers to (i) a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a shareholders&#8217; meeting of the 

registered insurer or its parent company, (ii) a person who is entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting power at any shareholders&#8217; meeting of such registered insurer or its parent company, or (iii) a person who is able to exercise significant influence over the management of the registered insurer or its parent company by virtue of its shareholding or its entitlement to exercise, or control the exercise of, the voting power at any shareholders&#8217; meeting.

A shareholder controller that owns 10% or more, but less than 20% of the shares as described above is defined as a 10% shareholder controller. A shareholder controller that owns 20% or more, but less than 33% of the shares as described above is defined as a 20% shareholder controller. A shareholder controller that owns 33% or more but less than 50% of the shares as described above is defined as a 33% shareholder controller. A shareholder controller that owns 50% or more of the shares as described above is defined as a 50% shareholder controller.

As the shares of JRG Re&#8217;s parent company are traded on a recognized stock exchange, a person who becomes a 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% shareholder controller of the insurer, shall, within 45 days, notify the BMA in writing that he or she has become such a controller. A shareholder controller of such an insurer shall serve notice in writing on the BMA within 45 days of reducing or disposing of shares such that it ceases to be a 50%, 33%, 20% or 10% shareholder controller.

Any person who fails to give any such notice is guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of&#8201; $25,000.

The BMA may file a notice of objection to any person who has become a controller of any description where it appears that such person is not or is no longer, a fit and proper person to be a controller of the registered insurer. Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the person concerned a preliminary written notice stating the BMA&#8217;s intention to issue formal notice of objection and the reasons for which it appears that the person is not or no longer considered a fit and proper person. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, the person served may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA, which shall be taken into account by the BMA in making their final determination. Any person who continues to be a controller of any description after having received a notice of objection shall be guilty of an offense and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of $25,000 (and a continuing fine of&#8201; $500 per day for each day that the offense is continuing) or, if convicted on indictment, to a fine of&#8201; $100,000 or two years in prison or both.

Notification of Material Changes

All registered insurers are required to give notice to the BMA of their intention to effect a material change within the meaning of the Insurance Act. For the purposes of the Insurance Act, the following changes are material: (i) the transfer or acquisition of insurance business being part of a scheme falling within, or any transaction relating to a scheme of arrangement under, Section 25 of the Insurance Act or Section 99 of the Companies Act of Bermuda, 1981 (the &#8220;Companies Act&#8221;), (ii) the amalgamation with or acquisition of another firm, (iii) engaging in unrelated business that is retail business, (iv) the acquisition of a controlling interest in an undertaking that is engaged in non-insurance business which offers services and products to persons who are not affiliates of the insurer, (v) outsourcing all or substantially all of the company&#8217;s actuarial, risk management compliance and internal audit functions, (vi) outsourcing all or a material part of an insurer&#8217;s underwriting activity, (vii) the transfer other than by way of reinsurance of all or substantially all of a line of business; (viii) the expansion into a material new line of business, (ix) the sale of an insurer, and (x) outsourcing the role of the chief executive or senior executive performing the duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters.

No registered insurer shall take any steps to give effect to a material change unless it has first served notice on the BMA that it intends to effect such material change, and before the end of 30 days, either the BMA has notified such company in writing that it has no objection to such change or that period has lapsed without the BMA having issued a notice of objection.

Before issuing a notice of objection, the BMA is required to serve upon the person concerned a preliminary written notice stating the BMA&#8217;s intention to issue a formal notice of objection. Upon receipt of the preliminary written notice, the person served may, within 28 days, file written representations with the BMA which shall be taken into account by the BMA in making their final determination.

Notification by Registered Person of Change of Controllers and Officers

A Class 3B insurer is required to give written notice to the BMA of the fact that a person has become, or ceased to be, a controller or officer of the Class 3B insurer within 45 days of becoming aware of such fact. An officer in relation to a registered insurer means a director, chief executive or senior executive performing duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters.

Disclosure of Information

In addition to powers under the Insurance Act to investigate the affairs of an insurer, the BMA may require certain information from an insurer (or certain other persons) to be produced to the BMA. Further, the BMA has been given powers to assist other regulatory authorities, including foreign insurance regulatory authorities, with their investigations involving insurance and reinsurance companies in Bermuda if it is satisfied that the assistance being requested is in connection with the discharge of regulatory responsibilities and that such cooperation is in the public interest. The grounds for disclosure are limited and the Insurance Act provides for sanctions for breach of the statutory duty of confidentiality.

Cancellation of Insurer&#8217;s Registration

An insurer&#8217;s registration may be cancelled by the BMA on certain grounds specified in the Insurance Act. Failure by the insurer to comply with its obligations under the Insurance Act, or if the BMA believes that the insurer has not been carrying on business in accordance with sound insurance principles, would be such grounds.

Certain Other Bermuda Law Considerations

Corporate Bermuda Law Considerations

Although James River Group Holdings, Ltd. is incorporated in Bermuda, it is designated as a non-resident for Bermuda exchange control purposes by the BMA. Pursuant to its non-resident status, James River Group Holdings, Ltd. may engage in transactions in currencies other than the Bermuda dollar, and there are no restrictions on its ability to transfer funds (other than funds denominated in Bermuda dollars) in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to non-residents who are holders of its common shares in currencies other than the Bermuda dollar.

In accordance with Bermuda law, share certificates are issued only in the names of corporations, other separate legal entities or individuals. In the case of an applicant acting in a special capacity (for example, as an executor or trustee), certificates may, at the request of the applicant, record the capacity in which the applicant is acting. Notwithstanding the recording of any such special capacity, we are not bound to investigate or incur any responsibility in respect of the proper administration of any such estate or trust. We will take no notice of any trust applicable to any of our common shares whether or not we have notice of such trust.

Each of James River Group Holdings, Ltd. and JRG Re is incorporated in Bermuda as an &#8220;exempted company.&#8221; Under Bermuda law, exempted companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda from a principal place of business in Bermuda. As a result, they are exempt from Bermuda laws restricting the percentage of share capital that may be held by non-Bermudians, but they may not participate in certain business transactions, including: (i) the acquisition or holding of land in Bermuda except that required for their business held by way of lease or tenancy for a term not exceeding 50 years or, with the consent of the Minister of Economic Development granted in his discretion, land by way of lease or tenancy for a term not exceeding 21 years in order to provide accommodation or recreational facilities for its officers and employees, (ii) the taking of mortgages on land in Bermuda to secure an amount in excess of B.D.$50,000 without the consent of the relevant Ministers, (iii) the acquisition of any bonds or debentures secured by any land in Bermuda, other bonds or debentures issued by the Bermuda government or a public authority, or (iv) the carrying on of business of any kind in Bermuda, except in furtherance of their business carried on outside Bermuda or under license granted by the Minister of Economic Development. JRG Re is a licensed insurer in Bermuda, and so it may carry on activities from Bermuda that are related to and in support of its insurance business.

Each of James River Group Holdings, Ltd. and JRG Re must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act regulating the payment of dividends and making distributions from contributed surplus. A company may not declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus, if there are reasonable grounds for believing that (i) it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or (ii) the realizable value of the assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. In addition, certain provisions of the Insurance Act will limit our ability to pay dividends.

Under the Companies Act, where a Bermuda company issues shares at a premium (that is, for a price above the par value), whether for cash or otherwise, a sum equal to the aggregate amount or value of the premium on those shares must be transferred to an account called &#8220;the share premium account.&#8221; The provisions of the Companies Act relating to the reduction of the share capital of a company apply as if the share premium account were paid up share capital of that company, except for certain matters such as: (i) paying up unissued shares to be issued as fully paid bonus shares, (ii) writing off preliminary expenses, commissions or offering a discount on any issue of shares or (iii) providing for the premiums payable on redemption of shares. The paid up share capital may not be reduced if, on the date the reduction is to be effected, there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is, or after the reduction would be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due. See &#8220;&#8212; Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions&#8221;. 

Exempted companies, such as James River Group Holdings, Ltd. and JRG Re must comply with Bermuda resident representation provisions under the Companies Act. We do not believe that such compliance will result in any material expense to us.

Securities may be offered or sold in Bermuda only in compliance with the provisions of the Investment Business Act 2003 and the Exchange Control Act 1972 and related regulations of Bermuda which regulate the sale of securities in Bermuda. In addition, specific permission is required from the BMA, pursuant to the provisions of the Exchange Control Act 1972 and related regulations, for all issuances and transfers of securities of Bermuda companies, other than in cases where the BMA has granted a general permission. The BMA, in its policy dated June 1, 2005, provides that where any equity securities, which would include our common shares, of a Bermuda company are listed on an appointed stock exchange (the NASDAQ Stock Market is deemed to be an appointed stock exchange under Bermuda law), general permission is given for the issue and subsequent transfer of any securities of the company from and to a non-resident, for as long as any equity securities of the company remain so listed.

We have received consent from the BMA to issue, grant, create, sell and transfer freely any of our shares, stock, bonds, notes (other than promissory notes), debentures, debenture stock, units under a unit trust scheme, shares in an oil royalty, options, warrants, coupons, rights and depository receipts to and among persons who are either resident or non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes.

Bermuda Work Permit Considerations

Under Bermuda law, non-Bermudians (other than spouses of Bermudians and individuals holding permanent resident&#8217;s certificates or working resident&#8217;s certificates) may not engage in any gainful occupation in Bermuda without the appropriate governmental standard work permit.

Standard work permits can be obtained for a one-, two-, three-, four- or five-year period. Where a standard work permit is being applied for, it is a requirement that the job must be advertised for three days (within an eight-day period) in the local newspaper. Should no Bermudian (or spouse of a Bermudian or holder of a permanent resident&#8217;s certificate or working resident&#8217;s certificate) meet the minimum standards as stipulated in the advertisement, the employer may then apply for a standard work permit for the non-Bermudian. Employers must complete a Recruitment Disclosure Form and provide information, including the qualifications of all applicants. The Department of Immigration will compare the qualifications and experience of any Bermudian applicants (or spouse of a Bermudian or holder of a permanent resident&#8217;s certificate or working resident&#8217;s certificate) to that stipulated in the advertisement and to the non-Bermudian to be satisfied that the role could not have been filled by a Bermudian (or spouse of a Bermudian or holder of a permanent resident&#8217;s certificate or working resident&#8217;s certificate). In addition to the advertising, there are also many other documents that are required prior to the Department of Immigration making their decision.

If the position for which the standard work permit is being applied is that of a Chief Executive Officer or Senior Executive, the Minister of Home Affairs may, on occasion, waive the requirement to advertise.

If an employer wishes to change an employee&#8217;s job title, provided that the job description, duties, remuneration and benefits remain unchanged, the employer does not need to advertise or obtain the permission of the Minister of Home Affairs to do this, but it must inform the Department of Immigration and pay the necessary fee after the change has occurred.

If an employer wishes to promote an employee currently on a work permit from his current job to another within the same business, the permission of the Minister of Home Affairs must first be obtained. The employer will need to provide evidence of internal recruitment efforts and consideration of internal Bermudian candidates.

A temporary work permit can take up to 10 working days to process and a standard work permit can take up to four weeks to process.

U.S. Insurance Regulation

State Regulation

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by their state of domicile, as well as those states in which they do business. The purpose of such regulation and supervision is primarily to provide safeguards for policyholders, rather than to protect the interests of shareholders. The insurance laws of the various states establish regulatory agencies with broad administrative powers, including the power to grant or revoke operating licenses and regulate trade practices, investments, premium rates, deposits of securities, the form and content of financial statements and insurance policies, dividend limitations, cancellation and non-renewal of policies, accounting practices and the maintenance of specified reserves and capital for the protection of policyholders.

The payment of dividends by our subsidiaries to us is limited by statute. In general, the laws and regulations applicable to our domestic insurance subsidiaries limit the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions that they may declare or pay within any 12 month period without advance regulatory approval. In Ohio, the domiciliary state of James River Insurance, Falls Lake General Insurance Company (formerly Stonewood General Insurance Company) (&#8220;Falls Lake General&#8221;) and Falls Lake National Insurance Company (formerly Stonewood National Insurance Company) (&#8220;Falls Lake National&#8221;), this limitation is the greater of statutory net income for the preceding calendar year or 10% of the statutory surplus at the end of the preceding calendar year, provided that such dividends may only be paid out of the earned surplus of each of the companies without obtaining regulatory approvals. In North Carolina, the domiciliary state of Stonewood Insurance, this limitation is the greater of statutory net income excluding realized capital gains for the preceding calendar year or 10% of the statutory surplus at the end of the preceding calendar year, provided that such dividends may only be paid out of unassigned surplus without obtaining regulatory approval. In Virginia, the domiciliary state of James River Casualty Company, this limitation is the greater of statutory net income excluding realized capital gains of the preceding calendar year or 10% of the statutory surplus at the end of the preceding calendar year, provided that such dividends may only be paid out of unassigned surplus without obtaining regulatory approval. In California, the domiciliary state of Falls Lake Fire and Casualty Company, this limitation is the greater of statutory net income for the preceding calendar year or 10% of the statutory surplus at the end of the preceding calendar year, provided that such dividends may only be paid out of unassigned surplus without obtaining regulatory approval. Moreover, as a condition to obtaining its license in California, Falls Lake Fire and Casualty Company provided a commitment to the California Department of Insurance that it would not pay any shareholder dividends for a five year period commencing January 1, 2016. In addition, insurance regulators have broad powers to prevent reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels and could refuse to permit the payment of dividends calculated under any applicable formula.

Premium rate regulation varies greatly among jurisdictions and lines of insurance. In most states in which our subsidiaries write insurance, premium rates for the various lines of insurance are subject to either prior approval or limited review upon implementation. States require rates for property casualty insurance that are adequate, not excessive, and not unfairly discriminatory.

Our insurance subsidiaries are required to file quarterly and annual reports with the appropriate regulatory agency in its state of domicile and with The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;) based on applicable statutory regulations, which differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Their business and accounts are subject to examination by such agencies at any time.

Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that limit an insurer&#8217;s ability to withdraw from a particular market. For example, states may limit an insurer&#8217;s ability to cancel or non-renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the states, except pursuant to a plan approved by the state insurance department. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict our ability to exit unprofitable marketplaces in a timely manner.

State laws governing insurance holding companies and insurance companies also impose standards on certain transactions between related companies, which include, among other requirements, that all transactions be fair and reasonable, that an insurer&#8217;s surplus as regards policyholders be reasonable and adequate in relation to its liabilities and that expenses and payments be allocated to the appropriate party in accordance with customary accounting practices. These transactions between related companies include transfers of assets, loans, reinsurance agreements, service agreements, certain dividend payments by the insurance companies and certain other material transactions. In 2012, the NAIC adopted significant changes to the insurance holding company act and regulations (the &#8220;NAIC Amendments&#8221;). The NAIC Amendments, when adopted by the various states, are designed to respond to perceived gaps in the regulation of insurance holding company systems in the United States. One of the major changes is a requirement that an insurance holding company system&#8217;s ultimate controlling person submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an &#8220;enterprise risk report&#8221; that identifies activities, circumstances or events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied properly, are likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. Other changes include (i) requiring a controlling person to submit prior notice to its domiciliary insurance regulator of its divestiture of control, (ii) having detailed minimum requirements for cost sharing and management agreements between an insurer and its affiliates and (iii) expanding the types of agreements between an insurer and its affiliates to be filed with its domiciliary insurance regulator. The NAIC Amendments must be adopted by the individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective. Each of California, North Carolina, Ohio, and Virginia, the states in which our U.S. Insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, include this enterprise risk report. In addition, in 2012 the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (the &#8220;ORSA Model Act&#8221;). The ORSA Model Act, when adopted by the various states, will require an insurance holding company system&#8217;s Chief Risk Officer to submit at least annually to its lead state insurance regulator an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report (&#8220;ORSA&#8221;). The ORSA is a confidential internal assessment appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of an insurer, conducted by that insurer of the material and relevant risks identified by the insurer associated with an insurer&#8217;s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. The ORSA Model Act must be adopted by the individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective. Each of California, Ohio, and Virginia, the states in which several of our U.S. Insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, adopted and require an ORSA filing, while North Carolina has yet to adopt this requirement into its insurance laws.

The insurance holding company laws and regulations of the states in which our insurance companies are domiciled also generally require that before a person can acquire direct or indirect control of an insurer domiciled in the state, and in some cases prior to divesting its control, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurer&#8217;s domiciliary state insurance regulator. In addition to insurance holding company laws and regulations, under the Organizational Permit issued by the California Department of Insurance to Falls Lake Fire and Casualty Company, Falls Lake Fire and Casualty Company, as a new insurer, was required to enter into an agreement with Falls Lake National Insurance Company restricting the transfer of Falls Lake Fire and Casualty Company&#8217;s shares. Under the Organizational Permit and the Agreement Restricting Shares, Falls Lake National cannot directly or indirectly transfer the shares of Falls Lake Fire and Casualty Company to anyone without the prior written approval of the California Department of Insurance. These laws and the similar conditions applicable to Falls Lake Fire and Casualty Company&#8217;s shares may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent an investment in or a change of control involving us, or one or more of our regulated subsidiaries, including transactions that our 

management and some or all of our shareholders might consider desirable. Pursuant to applicable laws and regulations, &#8220;control&#8221; over an insurer is generally presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote or holds proxies representing, 10 percent or more of the voting securities of that insurer. Indirect ownership includes ownership of the Company&#8217;s common shares.

Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurance companies doing business in a state can be assessed for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to such insolvent companies&#8217; policyholders and claimants. Maximum assessments allowed in any one year generally vary between one percent and two percent of annual premiums written in that state, but it is possible that caps on such assessments could be raised if there are numerous or large insolvencies. In most states, guaranty fund assessments are recoverable either through future policy surcharges or offsets to state premium tax liabilities.

The admitted market is subject to more state regulation than the E&#38;S market, particularly with regard to rate and form filing requirements, restrictions on the ability to exit lines of business, premium tax payments and membership in various state associations, such as guaranty funds. Some states have deregulated their commercial insurance markets. We cannot predict the effect that further deregulation would have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

The state insurance regulators utilize a risk-based capital model to help assess the capital adequacy of insurance companies and identify insurers that are in, or are perceived as approaching, financial difficulty. This model establishes minimum capital needs based on the risks applicable to the operations of the individual insurer. The risk-based capital requirements for property casualty insurance companies measure three major areas of risk: asset risk, credit risk and underwriting risk. Companies having less statutory surplus than required by the risk-based capital requirements are subject to varying degrees of regulatory scrutiny and intervention, depending on the severity of the inadequacy. At December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries had total adjusted statutory capital of&#8201; $176.9 million, which is in excess of the minimum risk-based capital requirement.

From time to time, states consider and/or enact laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. States also consider and/or enact laws that impact the competitive environment and marketplace for property casualty insurance.

Federal Regulation

The U.S. federal government generally has not directly regulated the insurance industry except for certain areas of the market, such as insurance for flood, nuclear and terrorism risks. However, the federal government has undertaken initiatives or considered legislation in several areas that may impact the insurance industry, including tort reform, corporate governance and the taxation of reinsurance companies. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) established the Federal Insurance Office which is authorized to study, monitor and report to Congress on the insurance industry and to recommend that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&#8220;FSOC&#8221;) designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the U.S. financial stability in the event of the insurer&#8217;s material financial distress or failure. In December 2013, the Federal Insurance Office issued a report on alternatives to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increasing national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states. In addition, legislation has been introduced from time to time that, if enacted, could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in the regulation of the insurance industry, including federal licensing in addition to or in lieu of state licensing and reinsurance for natural catastrophes. Changes to federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including changes in federal taxation, can also significantly impact the insurance industry and us.

On January 12, 2015, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 and its successors, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 (collectively, the &#8220;Terrorism Acts&#8221;), were extended until 2020. Under the Terrorism Acts, commercial property and casualty insurers, in exchange for making terrorism insurance available, may be entitled to be reimbursed by the Federal Government for a portion of their aggregate losses. As required by the Terrorism Acts, we offer policyholders in specific lines of commercial insurance the option to elect terrorism coverage. 

In order for a loss to be covered under the Terrorism Acts, the loss must meet the aggregate industry loss minimum and must be the result of an act of terrorism as certified by the Secretary of the Treasury. Beginning in 2016, insurers participating in the Terrorism Acts will be required to provide information regarding insurance coverage for terrorism losses, including; (i) lines of business with exposure to such losses, (ii) premiums earned on such coverage, (iii) geographical location of exposures, (iv) pricing of such coverage, (v) the take-up rate for such coverage, and (vi) the amount of private reinsurance for acts of terrorism purchased.

Geographic Information 

For each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, 100% of our gross written premiums and net earned premiums were generated from policies issued to U.S.-based insureds. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 367 employees located in the United States and eight employees located in Bermuda. All of our employees are full time. Our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and we are not aware of any current efforts to implement such an agreement. We believe we have good working relations with our employees. 

Intellectual Property 

We hold U.S. federal service mark registration of our corporate logo and several other company trademark registrations or applications for registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Such registrations protect our intellectual property from confusingly similar use. We monitor our trademarks and service marks and protect them from unauthorized use as necessary. 

We use licensed and proprietary systems and technologies in our underwriting. The licenses have terms that expire at various times through 2028. We believe that we can utilize other available systems and technologies in the event that the licenses are not renewed upon their expiration. 

Available Information 

We file annual reports on Form 10-K, current reports on Form 8-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other information with the SEC. Members of the public may read and copy materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
