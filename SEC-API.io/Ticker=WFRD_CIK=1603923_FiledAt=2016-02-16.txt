Strategy 

&#160; 

Our primary objective is to build stakeholder value through profitable growth in our core product lines with disciplined use of capital and a strong customer focus. 

&#160; 

Principal components of our strategy include: 

&#8226; 

Continuously improving the efficiency, productivity and quality of our products and services and their &#160; respective delivery to our customers, in order to grow revenues and operating margins and generate free cash flow from our core operations (Formation Evaluation and Well Construction and Completion and Production) and Land Drilling Rigs operations in all of our geographic markets at a rate exceeding underlying market activity; 

&#8226; 

A commitment to the innovation, invention and integration, development and commercialization of new &#160; products and services that meet the evolving needs of our customers across the reservoir lifecycle; and 

&#8226; 

Further extending the process, productivity, quality, safety and competency across our global infrastructure to meet client demands for our core products and services in an &#160; operationally efficient manner. 

Markets 

&#160; 

We are a leading provider of equipment and services to the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry. Demand for our industry&#8217;s services and products depends upon commodity prices for oil and gas, the number of oil and natural gas wells drilled, the depth and drilling conditions of wells, the number of well completions, the depletion and age of existing wells and the level of workover activity worldwide. 

Technology has become increasingly critical to the oil and natural gas marketplace as a result of the maturity of the world&#8217;s oil and natural gas reservoirs, accelerating production decline rates and the focus on complex well designs, including deep-water prospects. Clients continue to seek, test and use production-enabling technologies at an increasing rate. We have invested a substantial amount of our time and resources into building our technology offerings, which help us provide our clients with more efficient tools to find and produce oil and natural gas. We believe our products and services enable our clients to reduce their costs of drilling and production and/or increase production rates. Furthermore, these offerings afford us additional opportunities to sell our core products and services to our clients. 

&#160;

Formation Evaluation and Well Construction 

Within the Formation Evaluation and Well Construction business group we provide formation evaluation services from early well planning to reservoir management services, including core analysis, surface logging, well site geochemistry, logging while drilling and wireline services. Our full suite of formation evaluation services has broad applications across all types of reservoirs. We also provide well construction services to help clients ensure well integrity for the full life cycle of the well using reliable casing and tubing strings, cementation design, reliable liner top isolation and methods that ensure the well reaches total depth in the best condition possible. Further descriptions of our product lines are as follows: 

Managed-Pressure Drilling consists of several drilling techniques including closed-loop drilling, air drilling, managed-pressure drilling and underbalanced drilling. 

Drilling Services includes directional drilling, logging while drilling, measurement while drilling and rotary steerable systems. This service line also includes our full range of downhole equipment including high temperature motors, wireline steering tools, air rotary hammer drills, casing exit systems, downhole deployment valves and downhole data acquisition equipment. 

Tubular Running Services consists of a wide variety of tubular connection and installation services for the drilling, completion and workover of an oil or &#32; natural gas well, including liner systems, solid expandable systems, zonal isolation products and swellable well-construction technologies. We also specialize in critical-service installations. 

Drilling Tools includes our patented drilling jars, underreamers, rotating control devices, downhole tools, drillpipe and related tools, tubular handling equipment and other pressure-control equipment used in drilling oil and natural gas wells. We also offer wellhead systems to reduce time in changing wellhead sizes while increasing safety procedures, production monitoring and optimization, and flow measurement which measures how much oil, water and gas is flowing in a well. 

Wireline Services &#32;includes open hole and cased-hole logging services to measure the physical properties of underground formations and help determine the location and potential deliverability of oil and gas from a reservoir. It also includes production and produced water systems for fracturing, production disposal and enhanced oil recovery operations. We also offer global petroleum consulting services in the geoscience and engineering domain.

Other Business Data 

&#160; 

Competition 

We provide our products and services worldwide and compete in a variety of distinct segments with a number of competitors. Our principal competitors include Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes, National Oilwell Varco, Cameron International, Noble Energy, Nabors Industries and Frank&#8217;s International. We also compete with various other regional suppliers that provide a limited range of equipment and services tailored for local markets. Competition is based on a number of factors, including performance, safety, quality, reliability, service, price, response time and, in some cases, breadth of products. See &#8220; Item 1A. &#8211; Risk Factors &#32;&#8211; The oilfield services business is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed. Additionally, the impact of consolidation and acquisitions of our competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.&#8221; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials as well as parts and components made by other manufacturers and suppliers for use in our manufacturing. Many of the products or components of products sold by us are manufactured by other parties. We are not dependent in any material respect on any single supplier for our raw materials or purchased components. 

Customers 

&#160; 

Substantially all of our customers are engaged in the energy industry. Most of our international sales are to large international or national oil companies and these sales have resulted in a concentration of receivables from certain national oil companies worldwide, especially in Latin America. As of December 31, 2015 , our receivables from Latin America customers accounted for 38% &#32;of our net outstanding accounts receivable balance with $205 million &#32;due from Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (&#8220;PDVSA&#8221;) and $47 million &#32;from Petroleos Mexicanos (&#8220;Pemex&#8221;). During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , no individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

Our services are usually short-term in nature, day-rate based and cancellable should our customer wish to alter the scope of work. Consequently, our backlog of firm orders is not material to the Company. 

Research, Development and Patents 

&#160; 

We maintain world-class technology and training centers throughout the world. Additionally, we have research, development and engineering facilities that are focused on improving existing products and services and developing new technologies to meet customer demands for improved drilling performance and enhanced reservoir productivity. Our expenditures for research and development totaled $231 million &#32;in 2015 , $290 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;and $265 million &#32;in 2013 . 

&#160; 

As many areas of our business rely on patents and proprietary technology, we seek patent protection both inside and outside the U.S. for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. We amortize patents over the years that we expect to benefit from their existence, which is limited by the life of the patent, and ranges from three to 20 years. 

&#160; 

Although in the aggregate our patents are important to the manufacturing and marketing of many of our products and services, we do not believe that the loss of any one of our patents would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Weather and natural phenomena can temporarily affect the level of demand for our products and services. Spring months in Canada and winter months in the North Sea and Russia can affect our operations negatively. Additionally, heavy rains or an exceedingly cold winter in a given region or climate changes may impact our results. The unpredictable impact of climate changes or unusually harsh weather conditions could lengthen the periods of reduced activity and have a detrimental impact to our results of operations. The widespread geographical locations of our operations serve to mitigate the overall impact of the seasonal nature of our business. 

Federal Regulation and Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the energy industry in general and the environment in particular. Our 2015 &#32;expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations were not material, and we currently do not expect the cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations for 2016 &#32;to be material. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 39,500 &#32;employees. Certain of our operations are subject to union contracts. These contracts cover approximately 17% &#32; o f our employees. We believe that our relationship with our employees is generally satisfactory. 

In response to the significant decline in the price of crude oil and a lower level of exploration and production spending, starting in 2014 and throughout 2015, we reduced our overall costs and workforce to better align with anticipated activity levels. The workforce reductions in 2014 and throughout 2015 totaled approximately 20,300 employees. In response to continued decline and lower prices of crude oil and natural gas and the continued decline in the anticipated level of exploration and production spending in 2016, we initiated a reduction in force plan to reduce our overall costs and workforce to align with the anticipated activity levels and expect to complete a further workforce reduction of 6,000 employees in the first half of 2016.
