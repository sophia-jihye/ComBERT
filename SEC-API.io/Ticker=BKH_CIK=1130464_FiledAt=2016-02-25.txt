BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

History and Organization 

Black Hills Corporation, a South Dakota corporation (together with its subsidiaries, referred to herein as the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;), is a growth-oriented, vertically-integrated energy company headquartered in Rapid City, South Dakota. Our predecessor company, Black Hills Power and Light Company, was incorporated and began providing electric utility service in 1941. It was formed through the purchase and combination of several existing electric utilities and related assets, some of which had served customers in the Black Hills region since 1883. In 1956, we began producing, selling and marketing various forms of energy through non-regulated businesses. 

We operate in the United States with two major business groups: Utilities and Non-regulated Energy. Our Utilities Group is comprised of regulated Electric Utilities and regulated Gas Utilities segments, and our Non-regulated Energy Group is comprised of Power Generation, Coal Mining and Oil and Gas segments.

Oil and Gas 

Our Electric Utilities segment generates, transmits and distributes electricity to approximately 207,200 &#32;electric customers in South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado and Montana and also distributes natural gas to approximately 44,200 &#32;gas utility customers of Cheyenne Light in and around Cheyenne, Wyoming. Our Gas Utilities segment serves approximately 547,300 &#32;natural gas utility customers in Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas. Our Electric Utilities own 841 &#32;MW of generation and 8,703 &#32;miles of electric transmission and distribution lines, and our Gas Utilities own 645 &#32;miles of intrastate gas transmission pipelines and 19,494 &#32;miles of gas distribution mains and service lines. Our Utilities Group generated net income of $117 million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 , and had total assets of $3.7 billion at December 31, 2015 . 

&#32;8 

Our Power Generation segment produces electric power from its generating plants and sells the electric capacity and energy primarily to our utilities under long-term contracts. Our Coal Mining segment produces coal at our coal mine near Gillette, Wyoming, and sells the coal primarily under long-term contracts to mine-mouth electric generation facilities including our own regulated and non-regulated generating plants. Our Oil and Gas segment engages in the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas, primarily in the Rocky Mountain region. In 2015, we began transitioning the Oil and Gas business to support utilities through a Cost of Service Gas Program. See the Key Elements of our Business Strategy in Item 7. Our Non-regulated Energy Group generated net income (loss) of $(135) million &#32;for the year ended December 31, 2015 , and had total assets of $0.3 billion &#32;at December 31, 2015 . 

SourceGas Acquisition: &#32;&#32;On February 12, 2016, Black Hills Utility Holdings acquired SourceGas Holdings, LLC from investment funds managed by Alinda Capital Partners and GE Energy Financial Services, a unit of General Electric Co., pursuant to the purchase and sale agreement executed on July 12, 2015. SourceGas primarily operates four regulated natural gas utilities serving approximately 429,000 customers in Arkansas, Colorado, Nebraska and Wyoming and a 512 mile regulated intrastate natural gas transmission pipeline in Colorado. The combined company will serve approximately 1.2 million customers in eight states. Financial results for the SourceGas utilities will be reported under our Gas Utilities segment. For additional information on this acquisition, see the Key Elements of our Business Strategy in Item 7 and Note 2 - SourceGas Acquisition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 

Segment reporting transition of Cheyenne Light&#8217;s Natural Gas distribution 

Through December 31, 2015, Cheyenne Light&#8217;s natural gas operations have been included in our Electric Utilities Segment as these natural gas operations were consolidated within Cheyenne Light since its acquisition. Effective January 1, 2016, the natural gas operations of Cheyenne Light will be reported under our Gas Utilities Segment. This change is a result of our business segment reorganization to, among other things, integrate all regulated natural gas operations, including the SourceGas Acquisition, into our Gas Utilities Segment which will be led by the Group Vice President, Natural Gas Utilities. Likewise, all regulated electric utility operations will be reported in our Electric Utilities Segment, which will be led by the Group Vice President, Electric Utilities. 

Segment Financial Information 

We discuss our business strategy and other prospective information in Item 7 - Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Financial information regarding our business segments is incorporated herein by reference to Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, and particularly Note 5 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Discontinued Operations in the accompanying financial information includes the results of our Energy Marketing segment sold in February 2012. The buyer asserted certain purchase price adjustments, some that we accepted, and several that we disputed. The disputed claims were substantially resolved through a binding arbitration decision dated January 17, 2014. We expensed an additional $1.1 million in 2013 related to the claims assigned to arbitration from purchase price adjustments we accepted through a partial settlement agreement with the buyer. Results for 2013 include the resolution of all previously unresolved purchase price adjustments. 

&#32;9

Black Hills Power owns 35% of a DC transmission tie that interconnects the Western and Eastern transmission grids, which are independently-operated transmission grids serving the western United States and eastern United States, respectively. This transmission tie, which is 65% owned by Basin Electric, provides transmission access to both the WECC region in the West and the MAPP region in the East. The transfer capacity of the tie is 200 MW from West to East, and 200 MW from East to West. Black Hills Power's electric system is located in the WECC region. This transmission tie allows us to buy and sell energy in the Eastern grid without having to isolate and physically reconnect load or generation between the two transmission grids, thus enhancing the reliability of our system. It accommodates scheduling transactions in both directions simultaneously, provides additional opportunities to sell excess generation or to make economic purchases to serve our native load and contract obligations, and enables us to take advantage of power price differentials between the two grids. 

Black Hills Power has firm point-to-point transmission access to deliver up to 50 MW of power on PacifiCorp&#8217;s transmission system to wholesale customers in the WECC region through 2023. 

&#32;13 

Black Hills Power also has firm network transmission access to deliver power on PacifiCorp&#8217;s system to Sheridan, Wyoming, to serve our power sales contract with MDU through 2017, with the right to renew pursuant to the terms of PacifiCorp&#8217;s transmission tariff. 

In order to serve Cheyenne Light&#8217;s existing load, Cheyenne Light has a network transmission agreement with Western Area Power Association&#8217;s Loveland Area Project. 

Operating Agreements. Our Electric Utilities have the following material operating agreements: 

&#8226; 

Shared Services Agreements - 

&#9702; 

Black Hills Power, Cheyenne Light, and Black Hills Wyoming are parties to a shared facilities agreement, whereby each entity charges for the use of assets by the affiliate entity.

Utilities Group Business Characteristics 

Seasonal Variations of Business 

Our Electric Utilities and Gas Utilities are seasonal businesses and weather patterns may impact their operating performance. Demand for electricity and natural gas is sensitive to seasonal cooling, heating and industrial load requirements, as well as market price. In particular, demand is often greater in the summer and winter months for cooling and heating, respectively. Because our Electric Utilities have a diverse customer and revenue base, and we have historically optimized the utilization of our electric power supply resources, the impact on our operations may not be as significant when weather conditions are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. Conversely, for our Gas Utilities, natural gas is used primarily for residential and commercial heating, so the demand for this product depends heavily upon weather throughout our service territories, and as a result, a significant amount of natural gas revenue is normally recognized in the heating season consisting of the first and fourth quarters. 

Competition 

We generally have limited competition for the retail distribution of electricity and natural gas in our service areas. Various restructuring and competitive initiatives have been discussed in several of the states in which our utilities operate. These initiatives would be aimed at increasing competition or providing for distributed generation. To date, these initiatives have had no material impact on our utilities. Although we face competition from independent marketers for the sale of natural gas to our industrial and commercial customers, in instances where independent marketers displace us as the seller of natural gas, we still collect a distribution charge for transporting the gas through our distribution network. In Colorado, our electric utility is subject to rules which may require competitive bidding for generation supply. Because of these rules, we face competition from other utilities and non-affiliated independent power producers for the right to provide electric energy and capacity for Colorado Electric when resource plans require additional resources. 

Rates and Regulation 

Current Rates 

Our utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of the public utilities commissions in the states where they operate. The commissions oversee services and facilities, rates and charges, accounting, valuation of property, depreciation rates and various other matters. The public utility commissions determine the rates we are allowed to charge for our utility services. Rate decisions are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, capital expenditures, the prudence of costs we incur, views concerning appropriate rates of return, the rates of other utilities, general economic conditions and the political environment. Certain commissions also have jurisdiction over the issuance of debt or securities, and the creation of liens on property located in their states to secure bonds or other securities.

GCA, Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery/DSM/Capital Infrastructure Automatic Adjustment Mechanism 

N/A 

We produce and/or distribute electricity in four states: Colorado, South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. The regulatory provisions for recovering the costs to supply electricity vary by state. In all states, subject to thresholds noted below, we have cost adjustment mechanisms for our Electric Utilities that allow us to pass the prudently-incurred cost of fuel and purchased power through to customers. These mechanisms allow the utility operating in that state to collect, or refund, the difference between the cost of commodities and certain services embedded in our base rates and the actual cost of the commodities and certain services without filing a general rate case. Some states in which our utilities operate also allow the utility operating in that state to automatically adjust rates periodically for the cost of new transmission or environmental improvements and, in some instances, the utility has the opportunity to earn its authorized return on new capital investment immediately. 

&#32;26 

Some of the mechanisms we have in place include the following by utility and state: 

In South Dakota, Black Hills Power has: 

&#8226; 

An annual adjustment clause which provides for the direct recovery of increased fuel and purchased power cost incurred to serve South Dakota customers. Additionally, the ECA contains an off-system sales sharing mechanism in which South Dakota customers will receive a credit equal to 70% of off-system power marketing operating income. The ECA allows methodology to directly assign renewable resources and firm purchases to the customer load. In Wyoming, a similar fuel and purchased power cost adjustment is also in place. 

&#8226; 

An approved vegetation management recovery mechanism that allows for recovery of and a return on prudently-incurred vegetation management costs. 

&#8226; 

An approved annual Environmental Improvement Cost Recovery Adjustment tariff which recovers costs associated with generation plant environmental improvements. 

&#8226; 

An approved FERC Transmission Tariff based on a formulaic approach that determines the revenue component of Black Hills Power&#8217;s open access transmission tariff. 

In Wyoming, Cheyenne Light has: 

&#8226; 

An annual cost adjustment mechanism that allows us to pass the prudently-incurred costs of fuel and purchased power through to electric customers. As of October 1, 2014, the annual cost adjustment allows for recovery of 85% of coal and coal related costs, and recovery of 95% of purchased power costs, transmission, and natural gas costs. 

&#8226; 

An approved FERC Transmission Tariff that determines the revenue component of Cheyenne Light&#8217;s open access transmission tariff. 

In Colorado, Colorado Electric has: 

&#8226; 

A quarterly ECA rider that allows us to recover forecasted increases or decreases in purchased energy and fuel costs, including the recovery for amounts payable to others for the transmission of the utility's electricity over transmission facilities owned by others, symmetrical interest, and the sharing of off-system sales margins, less certain operating costs (customer receives 90%). The ECA provides for not only direct recovery, but also for the issuance of credits for decreases in purchased energy, fuel costs and eligible energy resources. Additionally, Colorado allows an annual TCA rider that includes nine months of actual transmission investment and three months of forecasted investment, with an annual true-up mechanism. 

&#8226; 

Effective January 1, 2015, a rider to recover a return on the construction costs of a $65 million natural gas-fired combustion turbine that will replace the retired W.N. Clark power plant. 

We distribute natural gas in five states: Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and Wyoming. All of our Gas Utilities and Cheyenne Light&#8217;s natural gas distribution have GCAs that allow us to pass the prudently-incurred cost of gas and certain services through to the customer between rate cases. Some of the mechanisms we have in place include the following: 

&#8226; 

In Kansas, we have a tariff pass-through mechanism for weather normalization, as well as tariffs that provide timely recovery of certain capital expenditures and property tax fluctuations. 

&#8226; 

In Kansas and Nebraska, we are allowed to recover the portion of uncollectible accounts related to gas costs through GCAs. 

&#8226; 

In Iowa, we have a Capital Infrastructure Automatic Adjustment Mechanism that allows for recovery of certain capital infrastructure investments. 

&#8226; 

In Nebraska, we have an Infrastructure System Replacement Cost mechanism that allows for recovery of certain capital infrastructure investments.

____________________ 

(a) 

In January 2015, Kansas Gas implemented new base rates in accordance with the rate request approval received on December 16, 2014 from the KCC to increase base rates by $5.2 million. This increase in base rates allows Kansas Gas to recover infrastructure and increased operating costs. The approval was a Global Settlement and did not stipulate return on equity and capital structure. 

(b) 

In January 2015, Colorado Electric implemented new rates in accordance with the CPUC approval received on December 19, 2014 for an annual electric revenue increase of $3.1 million. The approval also allowed a 9.83% return on equity and a capital structure of 49.83% equity and 50.17% debt, as well as approving implementation of a construction financing rider. This approval allows Colorado Electric to recover increased operating expenses and infrastructure investments, including those for the Busch Ranch Wind Farm, placed in service late 2012. The implementation of the rider also allows Colorado Electric to recover a return on the construction costs for a $65 million natural gas-fired combustion turbine that will replace the retired W.N. Clark power plant. 

(c) 

On March 2, 2015, the SDPUC issued an order approving a rate stipulation and agreement authorizing an increase for Black Hills Power of $6.9 million in annual electric revenue. The agreement was a Global Settlement and did not stipulate return on equity and capital structure. The SDPUC&#8217;s decision provides Black Hills Power a return on its investment in Cheyenne Prairie and associated infrastructure, and provides recovery of its share of operating expenses for this natural gas-fired facility. Black Hills Power implemented interim rates on October 1, 2014, coinciding with Cheyenne Prairie&#8217;s commercial operation date. Final rates were approved on April 1, 2015, effective October 1, 2014.

On March 17, 2015, Iowa Gas filed with the IUB for a capital investment recovery surcharge increase of $0.9 million. Iowa Gas received approval from the IUB on May 28, 2015. 

(e) 

On April 6, 2015, Nebraska Gas filed with the NPSC for a capital investment recovery surcharge increase of $1.5 million. Nebraska Gas received approval from the NPSC on July 27, 2015. 

Cost of Service Gas Program Filings 

On September 30, 2015, Black Hills Corp.&#8217;s utility subsidiaries submitted applications with respective state utility regulators seeking approval for a Cost of Service Gas Program in Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wyoming. An application was submitted in Colorado on November 2, 2015. The Cost of Service Gas Program is designed to provide long-term natural gas price stability for the Company&#8217;s utility customers, along with a reasonable expectation of customer savings over the life of the program. If approved, our non-utility affiliate will acquire natural gas reserves and/or drill wells to produce natural gas for the program for up to 50% of weather normalized annual firm demand for our utilities. The proposed Cost of Service Gas Program model has a capital structure of 60% equity and 40% debt, and seeks a utility-like return. Based on historical performance, the cost of production is expected to be more stable and predictable than the spot market price of natural gas. 

We currently have hearing dates with the commissions in all six states. The scheduled hearing for Iowa is in March 2016, for Nebraska in April 2016, for Kansas and Wyoming in May 2016, for South Dakota in June 2016, and for Colorado in July 2016. The program is not necessarily dependent on approvals from all states, however, the total program volumes depend on the sum of volumes approved by the various state commissions. Our long-term target for the program is up to 50% (38 Bcf) of annual demand for our gas utilities and gas-fired electric generation. 

&#32;28 

Other State Regulations 

Certain states where we conduct electric utility operations have adopted renewable energy portfolio standards that require or encourage our Electric Utilities to source, by a certain future date, a minimum percentage of the electricity delivered to customers from renewable energy generation facilities. At December 31, 2015 , we were subject to the following renewable energy portfolio standards or objectives: 

&#8226; 

Colorado . Colorado adopted a renewable energy standard that has two components: (i) electric resource standards and (ii) a 2% retail rate impact for compliance with the electric resource standards. The electric resource standards require our Colorado Electric subsidiary to generate, or cause to be generated, electricity from renewable energy sources equaling: (i) 20% of retail sales from 2015 to 2019; and (ii) 30% of retail sales by 2020. Of these amounts, 3% must be generated from distributed generation sources with one-half of these resources being located at customer facilities. The net annual incremental retail rate impact from these renewable resource acquisitions (as compared to non-renewable resources) is limited to 2%. The standard encourages the CPUC to consider earlier and timely cost recovery for utility investment in renewable resources, including the use of a forward rider mechanism. We are currently in compliance with these standards. 

On June 23, 2015, Colorado Electric filed for a CPCN with the CPUC to acquire the planned 60 MW Peak View Wind Project, to be located near Colorado Electric's Busch Ranch wind farm. This renewable energy project was originally submitted in response to Colorado Electric's all-source generation request on May 5, 2014. The project will be built by Invenergy Wind Development Colorado LLC and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. On September 24, 2015, Colorado Electric filed an uncontested Settlement Agreement that would approve the build transfer proposal. The settlement provides for recovery of the costs of the project through Colorado Electric&#8217;s Electric Cost Adjustments and Renewable Energy Standard Surcharge for 10 years, after which Colorado Electric can propose base rate recovery. The settlement requires Colorado Electric to make an annual comparison of the cost of the renewable energy generated by the facility against the bid cost of a PPA from the same facility for the first 10 years. The Commission determined it did not need to hold a hearing regarding the settlement and considered and approved the project on October 21, 2015. Pending final approvals and permits, Colorado Electric will purchase the project for approximately $109 million through progress payments throughout 2016, with ownership transfer occurring just before achieving commercial operation. 

&#8226; 

Montana . In 2005, Montana established a renewable portfolio standard that requires public utilities to obtain a percentage of their retail electricity sales from eligible renewable resources. In March 2013, Black Hills Power filed a petition with the MTPSC requesting a waiver of the renewable portfolio standards primarily due to exceeding the applicable &#8220;cost cap&#8221; included in the standards. In March 2013, the Montana Legislature adopted legislation that had the effect of excluding Black Hills Power from all renewable portfolio standard requirements under State Senate Bill 164, primarily due to the very low number of customers we have in Montana and the relatively high cost of meeting the renewable requirements. 

&#8226; 

South Dakota . South Dakota has adopted a renewable portfolio objective that encourages, but does not mandate utilities to generate, or cause to be generated, at least 10% of their retail electricity supply from renewable energy sources by 2015. 

&#8226; 

Wyoming . Wyoming currently has no renewable energy portfolio standard. 

Absent a specific renewable energy mandate in the territories we serve, our current strategy is to prudently incorporate renewable energy into our resource supply, seeking to minimize associated rate increases for our utility customers. Mandatory portfolio standards have increased and may continue to increase the power supply costs of our Electric Utility operations. Although we will seek to recover these higher costs in rates, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to secure full recovery of the costs we pay to be in compliance with standards or objectives. We cannot at this time reasonably forecast the potential costs associated with any new renewable energy standards that have been or may be proposed at the federal or state level. 

&#32;29 

Federal Regulation 

Energy Policy Act. Black Hills Corporation is a holding company whose assets consist primarily of investments in our subsidiaries, including subsidiaries that are public utilities and holding companies regulated by FERC under the Federal Power Act and PUHCA 2005. 

Federal Power Act . The Federal Power Act gives FERC exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, all public utilities subject to FERC&#8217;s jurisdiction must maintain tariffs and rate schedules on file with FERC that govern the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. Public utilities are also subject to accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements administered by FERC. FERC also places certain limitations on transactions between public utilities and their affiliates. Our public Electric Utility subsidiaries provide FERC-jurisdictional services subject to FERC&#8217;s oversight. 

Our Electric Utilities, Black Hills Colorado IPP and Black Hills Wyoming are authorized by FERC to make wholesale sales of electric capacity and energy at market-based rates under tariffs on file with FERC. As a condition of their market-based rate authority, each files Electric Quarterly Reports with FERC. Black Hills Power owns and operates FERC-jurisdictional interstate transmission facilities and provides open access transmission service under tariffs on file with FERC. Our Electric Utilities are subject to routine audit by FERC with respect to their compliance with FERC&#8217;s regulations. 

The Federal Power Act authorizes FERC to certify and oversee a national electric reliability organization with authority to promulgate and enforce mandatory reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and operators of the bulk-power system. FERC has certified NERC as the electric reliability organization. NERC has promulgated mandatory reliability standards and NERC, in conjunction with regional reliability organizations that operate under FERC&#8217;s and NERC&#8217;s authority and oversight, enforces those mandatory reliability standards. 

PUHCA 2005 . PUHCA 2005 gives FERC authority with respect to the books and records of a utility holding company. As a utility holding company with centralized service company subsidiaries, BHSC and Black Hills Utility Holdings, we are subject to FERC&#8217;s authority under PUHCA 2005. 

Environmental Matters 

We are subject &#32; to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and the safety and health of personnel and the public. These laws and regulations affect a broad range of our utility activities and generally regulate: (i) the protection of air and water quality; (ii) the identification, generation, storage, handling, transportation, disposal, record-keeping, labeling, reporting of and emergency response in connection with hazardous and toxic materials and wastes, including asbestos; and (iii) the protection of plant and animal species and minimization of noise emissions. 

Based on current regulations, technology and plans, the following table contains our current estimates of capital expenditures expected to be incurred over the next three years to comply with current environmental laws and regulations as described below, including regulations that cover water, air, soil and other pollutants, but excluding plant closures and the cost of new generation. The ultimate cost could be significantly different from the amounts estimated.

Water Issues 

Our facilities are subject to a variety of state and federal regulations governing existing and potential water/wastewater discharges and protection of surface waters from oil pollution. Generally, such regulations are promulgated under the Clean Water Act and govern overall water/wastewater discharges through NPDES and storm water permits. All of our facilities that are required to have such permits have those permits in place and are in compliance with discharge limitations and plan implementation requirements. The EPA proposed effluent limitation guidelines and standards on June 7, 2013 and published the final rule on November 3, 2015. This rule will have an impact on the Wyodak Plant, requiring conversion to a dry method of handling coal ash and further restrictions of constituent concentrations in any off-site discharges. The terms of this new regulation become effective at the next permit renewal, which will be in 2020. Additionally, the EPA regulates surface water oil pollution through its oil pollution prevention regulations. All of our facilities subject to these regulations have compliant prevention plans in place. 

Air Emissions 

Our generation facilities are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of air quality. These laws and regulations cover, among other pollutants, carbon monoxide, SO 2 , NO x , mercury, particulate matter and GHG. Power generating facilities burning fossil fuels emit each of the foregoing pollutants and, therefore, are subject to substantial regulation and enforcement oversight by various governmental agencies. 

Clean Air Act 

Title IV of the Clean Air Act created an SO 2 &#32;allowance trading regime as part of the federal acid rain program. Each allowance gives the owner the right to emit one ton of SO 2 . Certain facilities are allocated allowances based on their historical operating data. At the end of each year, each emitting unit must possess allowances sufficient to cover its emissions for the preceding year. Allowances may be traded, so affected units that expect to emit more SO 2 &#32;than their allocated allowances may purchase allowances on the open market. 

Title IV applies to several of our generation facilities, including the Neil Simpson II, Neil Simpson CT, Lange CT, Wygen II, Wygen III, Pueblo Airport Generating Station, Cheyenne Prairie and Wyodak plants. Without purchasing additional allowances, we currently hold sufficient allowances to satisfy Title IV at all such plants through 2045. For future plants, we plan to secure the requisite number of allowances by reducing SO 2 &#32;emissions through the use of low sulfur fuels, installation of &#8220;back end&#8221; control technology, use of banked allowances and if necessary, the purchase of allowances on the open market. We expect to integrate the cost of obtaining the required number of allowances needed for future projects into our overall financial analysis of such new projects. 

Title V of the Clean Air Act requires that all of our generating facilities obtain operating permits. All of our existing facilities have received Title V permits, with the exception of Wygen III, Pueblo Airport Generating Station and Cheyenne Prairie Generating Station. Wygen III, Pueblo Airport Generating Station and Cheyenne Prairie Generating Station are allowed to operate under their construction permit until the Title V permit is issued by the state. The Title V application for Wygen III was submitted in January 2011, with the permit expected in 2016. The Pueblo Airport Generating Station Title V application was filed in September 2012, with the permit expected in 2016. The Cheyenne Prairie Generating Station Title V application was submitted in 2015. All applications were filed in accordance with regulatory requirements. 

In 2011, the EPA issued the Industrial and Commercial Boiler Regulations for Area Sources of Hazardous Air Pollutants, with updates on December 21, 2012, which impose emission limits, fuel requirements and monitoring requirements. The rule had a compliance deadline of March 21, 2014. Due to costs to retrofit these plants, we suspended operations at the Osage plant in October 2010 and suspended operations at the Ben French facility on August 31, 2012. We permanently retired Osage, Ben French and Neil Simpson I on March 21, 2014. In conjunction with the Colorado Clean Air Clean Jobs Act, the CPUC issued an order approving the closure of the W.N. Clark facility no later than December 31, 2013. The W.N. Clark facility suspended operations December 31, 2012 and was retired on December 31, 2013 &#32;in accordance with the Colorado Clean Air Clean Jobs Act. 

&#32;31 

On February 16, 2012, the EPA published in the Federal Register the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Coal and Oil Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units (MATS), with an effective date of April 16, 2012. This rule imposes requirements for mercury, acid gases, metals and other pollutants. Affected units had a compliance deadline of April 16, 2015, with a pathway defined to apply for a one year extension due to certain limited circumstances. The current state air permits for Wygen II and Wygen III provide mercury emission limits and monitoring requirements with which we are in compliance. Neil Simpson II, Wygen II and Wygen III have been utilized for internal study and review of mercury emission control technology and have mercury monitors in place. Due to mercury absorbent issues encountered in 2015, the state of Wyoming approved a one year compliance deadline extension to April 16, 2016 for Neil Simpson II, Wygen II and Wygen III, for mercury only. The other components of the MATS rule remain in effect and these plants are in compliance with those requirements. The Wyodak plant is in compliance with all requirements of the MATS regulation. 

In August 2012, the EPA proposed revisions to the Electric Utility New Source Performance Standards for stationary combustion turbines. This rule is expected to be finalized in 2016 and, as proposed, will be applicable to the Pueblo Airport Generating Station, Cheyenne Prairie and eventually all the combustion turbines in our fleet. Among other things, the rule seeks to eliminate startup exemptions and clearly define overhauls for impact on the EPA&#8217;s New Source Review regulations, with the intention of eventually bringing all units under the applicability of this rule. The primary impact is expected to be on our older existing units, which will eventually be required to meet tighter NO x &#32;emission limitations. 

By May 3, 2013, all of our diesel generator engines were required to comply with the EPA&#8217;s Stationary Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engine Hazardous Air Pollutant regulations. Evaluations were completed, emission control equipment was installed and emission testing confirmed compliance with those requirements. 

The EPA published a more stringent ozone ambient standard on October 26, 2015. This regulation lowered the ozone standard from 75 to 70 ppb which will result in a continuation of the Denver, Colorado and Colorado North Front Range non-attainment status. Wyoming monitoring data from the Gillette and Cheyenne, Wyoming regions indicate compliance with the new limit. The primary impact on Black Hills operations could potentially be tighter NOx emission limits on new power generation units. 

In 2011, the State of Wyoming issued a letter requiring Neil Simpson II to include startup and shutdown SO 2 &#32;and NO x &#32;emissions when evaluating compliance with permitted emission limits. This represented a significant change from requirements provided in the original 1993 air permit. Minor engineered design changes were made to improve scrubber performance during startup. Those changes enabled the unit to meet the new requirements. The unit was previously fitted with state of the art low NO x &#32;burners that support compliance with this new requirement. Also in 2014, Neil Simpson II, Wygen II and Wygen III converted startup fuel from diesel to natural gas to support potential start-up requirements and future GHG state compliance plans. 

Regional Haze 

In January 2011, the states of Wyoming and South Dakota submitted their plans to EPA Region VIII, identifying NO x , SO 2 &#32;and particulate matter emission reductions intended to meet the Class I Areas (National Parks and Wilderness Areas) visibility improvement requirements under the EPA&#8217;s Regional Haze Program. Although none of our South Dakota or Wyoming power plants were included in those plans, we anticipate that Neil Simpson II will eventually be included in required five year progress reports. The state of Wyoming is currently developing their initial progress report for submittal in the spring of 2016. Neil Simpson II is not currently a discussion item in that report. 

A number of our power plants have been subject to new state and EPA regulations issued in recent years. As the result of these regulations and the associated costs to retrofit many of our older generating plants, we have since permanently retired the following plants:

The Wyodak Power Plant is included in EPA's January 30, 2014 Regional Haze Federal Implementation Plan, which includes significant additional NO x &#32;controls by March 1, 2019. Our share of those costs is estimated at $20 million. The State of Wyoming and PacifiCorp filed requests for reconsideration and Administrative Stay with EPA and the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. On September 9, 2014, the 10th Circuit stayed EPA&#8217;s NO x &#32;requirement for Wyodak pending outcome of the appeal, which is anticipated to be settled by the summer of 2016. 

Greenhouse Gas Regulations 

We utilize a diversified energy portfolio of power generation assets that include a fuel mix of coal, natural gas and wind sources, and minimal quantities of both solar and hydroelectric power. Of these generation resources, coal-fired power plants are the most significant sources of CO 2 &#32;emissions. 

On June 3, 2010, the EPA promulgated the GHG Tailoring Rule, implementing regulations of GHG for permitting purposes. This rule will impact us in the event of a major modification at an existing facility or in the event we establish a new major source of GHG emissions, as defined by EPA regulations. Upon renewal of operating permits for existing permitted facilities, monitoring and reporting requirements will be implemented. This rule established the basis for EPA&#8217;s October 23, 2015 suite of GHG emission rules for existing, new, modified and reconstructed facilities. The portion of this rule-making that applies to existing power generation sources is known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP). The portion of this rule-making that applies to new generating units effectively prohibits new coal-fired power plants from being constructed until carbon capture and sequestration becomes technically and economically feasible. The basis of the CPP regulation is to decrease existing coal-fired generation, increase the utilization of existing gas-fired combined cycle generation, increase renewable energy and increase use of demand side management. States are required to develop and submit compliance plans to EPA, with the initial submittal due by September 2016. The rule allows for a two year extension to submit a final plan and the states we operate in have indicated they will be submitting the extension request. Also on October 23, 2015, EPA proposed a Federal Implementation Plan, which will be imposed on any state that fails to submit a plan or fails to include the required contents of the plan. That rule will contain the modeling standards for CPP compliance and will be an integral part of state plan development. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court entered an order staying the Clean Power Plan. The stay of the CPP will remain in place until the U.S. Supreme Court either denies a petition for certiorari following the U.S. Court of Appeals&#8217; decision on the substantive challenges to the CPP, if one is submitted, or until the U.S. Supreme Court enters judgment following grant of a petition for certiorari. The effect of the order is to delay the CPP&#8217;s compliance deadlines until challenges to the CPP have been fully litigated and the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled. We do not expect a final judicial decision on challenges to the CPP earlier than mid-2017. While we cannot predict the terms of state plans, any limits on CO 2 &#32;emissions at our existing plants could have a material impact on our customer rates, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. In 2015, we met with South Dakota, Wyoming and Colorado regulatory agencies to discuss the rule implementation and potential compliance pathways. 

Wyoming passed GHG legislation in 2012 and 2013, enabling the state to implement the EPA&#8217;s GHG program. Wyoming adopted and submitted a GHG regulatory program to the EPA, which the EPA approved and published in the November 22, 2013 Federal Register. As of December 23, 2013, Wyoming has full jurisdiction over the GHG permitting program which includes the transfer of the Cheyenne Prairie EPA GHG air permit, to the state of Wyoming. This eliminates the increased time, expense and considerable risk of obtaining a permit from the EPA. 

In 2015, we reported 2014 GHG emissions from our Power Generation and Gas Utilities in order to comply with the EPA&#8217;s GHG Annual Inventory regulation, issued in 2009. We continue to report annual GHG emissions as required by the EPA. Climate change issues are the subject of a number of lawsuits, the outcome of which could impact the utility industry. We will continue to review GHG impacts as legislation or regulation develops and litigation is resolved. 

New or more stringent regulations or other energy efficiency requirements could require us to incur significant additional costs relating to, among other things, the installation of additional emission control equipment, the acceleration of capital expenditures, the purchase of additional emissions allowances or offsets, the acquisition or development of additional energy supply from renewable resources and the closure of certain generating facilities. To the extent our regulated fossil-fuel generating plants are included in rate base, we will attempt to recover costs associated with complying with emission standards or other requirements. We will also attempt to recover the emission compliance costs of our non-regulated fossil-fuel generating plants from utility customers and other purchasers of the power generated by our non-regulated power plants, including utility affiliates. Any unrecovered costs could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In addition, future changes in environmental regulations governing air emissions could render some of our power generating units more expensive or uneconomical to operate and maintain. 

&#32;33 

Solid Waste Disposal 

Various materials used at our facilities are subject to disposal regulations. Under state permits, we dispose of all solid wastes collected as a result of burning coal at our power plants in approved ash disposal sites. Ash and waste from flue gas, sulfur and mercury removal from the Wyodak, Neil Simpson II, Wygen II and Wygen III plants are deposited in mined areas at the WRDC coal mine. These disposal areas are currently located below some shallow water aquifers in the mine. In 2009, the State of Wyoming confirmed its past approval of this practice and as part of the five year mine permit renewal process that is currently underway, the state has confirmed approval of this practice. None of the solid waste from the burning of coal is currently classified as hazardous material, but the waste does contain minute traces of metals that could be perceived as polluting if such metals leached into underground water. We conducted investigations which concluded that the wastes are relatively insoluble and will not measurably affect the post-mining ground water quality. 

We permanently retired the Osage power plant on March 21, 2014. This plant had an on-site ash impoundment that was near capacity. An application to close the impoundment was approved on April 13, 2012. Site closure work was completed and the state issued an approval of closure activities on October 21, 2014. Post-closure monitoring activities will continue for 30 years. In September 2013, Osage also received a permit to close the small industrial rubble landfill. Site work has been completed and the state issued an approval of closure activities on October 21, 2014. Post closure monitoring will continue for 30 years. As of August 31, 2012, we suspended operations at Ben French and the plant was permanently retired on March 21, 2014. The Ben French temporary ash holding area was closed in accordance with state guidelines, with the state issuing a closure certification on March 14, 2014. 

Our W.N. Clark plant, which suspended operations on December 31, 2012 and was retired on December 31, 2013 , sent coal ash to a permitted, privately-owned landfill. While we do not believe that any substances from our solid waste disposal activities will pollute underground water, we can provide no assurance that pollution will not occur over time. In this event, we could incur material costs to mitigate any resulting damages. 

For our Pueblo Airport Generation Station in Pueblo, Colorado, we posted a bond with the State of Colorado to cover the costs of remediation for a waste water containment pond permitted to provide wastewater storage and processing for this zero discharge facility. 

Agreements are in place that require PacifiCorp and MEAN to be responsible for any costs related to the solid waste from their ownership interest in the Wyodak plant and Wygen I plant, respectively. As operator of Wygen III, Black Hills Power has a similar agreement in place for any such costs related to solid waste from Wygen III. Under their separate but related operating agreements, Black Hills Power, MDU and the City of Gillette each share the costs for solid waste from Wygen III according to their respective ownership interests. 

Additional unexpected material costs could also result in the future if any regulatory agency determines that solid waste from the burning of coal contains a hazardous material that requires special treatment, including previously disposed solid waste. In that event, the regulatory authority could hold entities that dispose of such waste responsible for remedial treatment. On December 19, 2014, the EPA Administrator signed coal ash regulations designating coal ash as a solid waste. These regulations are not applicable to our operations as all our coal ash is used as mine backfill. However, it is expected that the U.S. Office of Surface Mining will develop similar regulations, anticipated to be proposed in early 2016. 

Manufactured Gas Processing 

Some federal and state laws authorize the EPA and other agencies to issue orders compelling potentially responsible parties to clean up sites that are determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment. 

As a result of the Aquila Transaction, we acquired whole and partial liabilities for several former manufactured gas processing sites in Nebraska and Iowa which were previously used to convert coal to natural gas. The acquisition provided for a $1.0 million insurance recovery, now valued at approximately $1.4 million , which will be used to help offset remediation costs. The remediation cost estimate could change materially due to results of further investigations, actions of environmental agencies or the financial viability of other responsible parties. 

&#32;34 

In March 2011, Nebraska Gas executed an Allocation, Indemnification and Access Agreement with the successor to the former operator of the Nebraska MGPs. Under this agreement, Nebraska Gas received $1.9 million from the successor to the operator of Nebraska Gas to remediate two sites in Nebraska (Blair and Plattsmouth). The successor is responsible for remediation activity at the two remaining sites in Nebraska (Columbus and Norfolk). While the successor has performed remediation work at Columbus and Norfolk, due to disagreements over management of remaining groundwater contamination, the EPA has indicated they will be proposing to include the Norfolk site on the National Priority List. While we do not expect a financial impact from this action, we cannot be assured of that until the process has run its course. Nebraska Gas enrolled Blair and Plattsmouth in Nebraska&#8217;s Voluntary Cleanup Program. Site remediation was completed in September 2012. Both of these Nebraska sites were required to monitor groundwater quality for a minimum two-year period ending in 2015. We have not yet received state approval for &#8220;no further action&#8221;. In late 2015, groundwater concentrations were proposed and approved by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality as meeting steady or declining pollution levels. We assembled our final removal action completion reports to formally close the site, and submitted reports to the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality in December 2015. 

As of December 31, 2015, we estimate a range of approximately $2.9 million &#32;to $6.1 million &#32;to remediate the MGP site in Council Bluffs, Iowa, of which we could be responsible for up to 25% of the costs. In 2014, we began the process of evaluating legal and corporate successorship avenues for cost recovery from other potential responsible parties. At this time, no parties have been formally named nor have we determined the degree to which they are responsible. There are currently no regulatory requirements or deadlines for cleanup. However, late in 2015 we were notified that the EPA would like to perform site assessments to determine current contamination levels. Depending on the results of the investigation, the priority for cleanup as well as communications with potential responsible parties may be elevated. 

Prior to Black Hills Corporation&#8217;s ownership, Aquila received rate orders that approved recovery of environmental cleanup costs in certain jurisdictions. We anticipate recovery of current and future remediation costs would be allowed. Additionally, we may pursue recovery or agreements with other potentially responsible parties when and where permitted. 

Non-regulated Energy Group 

Our Non-regulated Energy Group, which operates through various subsidiaries, produces and sells electric capacity and energy through a portfolio of generating plants, produces and sells coal from our mine located in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and acquires, explores for, develops and produces natural gas and crude oil primarily in the Rocky Mountain region. The Non-regulated Energy Group consists of three business segments for reporting purposes: 

&#8226; 

Power Generation 

&#8226; 

Coal Mining 

&#8226; 

Oil and Gas 

Power Generation Segment 

Our Power Generation segment, which operates through Black Hills Electric Generation and its subsidiaries, acquires, develops and operates our non-regulated power plants. As of December 31, 2015 , we held varying interests in independent power plants operating in Wyoming and Colorado with a total net ownership of approximately 269 &#32;MW. 

Portfolio Management &#32; 

We produce electric power from our generating plants and sell the electric capacity and energy, primarily to affiliates under a combination of mid- to long-term contracts, which mitigates the impact of a potential downturn in future power prices. We currently sell a substantial majority of our non-regulated generating capacity under contracts having terms greater than one year.

Black Hills Colorado IPP owns and operates this facility. This facility provides capacity and energy to Colorado Electric under a 20-year PPA with Colorado Electric. This PPA is accounted for as a capital lease on the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 

(b) 

On February 12, 2016, Black Hills Electric Generation entered into a definitive agreement to sell a &#32; 49.9% , non-controlling interest in Black Hills Colorado IPP for $215 million &#32; to AIA Energy North America LLC, an infrastructure investment platform managed by Argo Infrastructure Partners. &#32;&#32; The sale is expected to close in April of 2016, pending receipt of regulatory approval from FERC. Black Hills Colorado IPP will continue to own and operate the facility. 

Black Hills Wyoming - Wygen I. &#32;&#32;The Wygen I generation facility is a mine-mouth, coal-fired power plant with a total capacity of 90 MW located at our Gillette, Wyoming energy complex. We own 76.5% &#32;of the plant and MEAN owns the remaining 23.5%. We sell 60 MW of unit-contingent capacity and energy from this plant to Cheyenne Light under a PPA that expires on December 31, 2022 . The PPA includes an option for Cheyenne Light to purchase Black Hills Wyoming&#8217;s ownership interest in the Wygen I facility through 2019. The purchase price in the contract related to the option is $2.6 million &#32;per MW adjusted for capital additions and reduced by depreciation over 35 years starting January 1, 2009 (approximately $5 million per year). The net book value of Wygen I at December 31, 2015 &#32;was $74 million &#32;and if Cheyenne Light had exercised the purchase option at year-end 2015, the estimated purchase price would have been approximately $155 million and would be subject to WPSC and FERC approval in order to obtain regulatory treatment. Cheyenne Light has delayed consideration of exercising the purchase option pending the state of Wyoming finalizing their State Implementation Plans to comply with the EPA&#8217;s Clean Power Plan. Wyoming has until June 30, 2016 to submit their final plans to the EPA. We sell excess power from our generating capacity into the wholesale power markets when it is available and economical. 

Black Hills Colorado IPP - Pueblo Airport Generation . The Pueblo Airport Generation Station consists of two 100 MW combined-cycle gas-fired power generation plants located at a site shared with Colorado Electric. The plants commenced operation on January 1, 2012 and the assets are accounted for as a capital lease under a 20-year PPA with Colorado Electric, which expires on December 31, 2031. Under the PPA with Colorado Electric, any excess capacity and energy shall be for the benefit of Colorado Electric.

Operating Agreements. Our Power Generation segment has the following material operating agreements: 

&#8226; 

Economy Energy PPA and other ancillary agreements 

&#9702; 

Black Hills Wyoming sold its CTII 40 MW natural gas-fired generating unit to the City of Gillette, Wyoming on September 3, 2014. Under the terms of the sale, Black Hills Wyoming entered into ancillary agreements to operate CTII, and provide use of shared facilities including a ground lease and dispatch generation services. In addition, the agreement includes a 20-year economy energy PPA that contains a sharing arrangement in which the parties share the savings of wholesale power purchases made when market power prices are less than the cost of operating the generating unit. 

&#8226; 

Shared Services Agreements 

&#9702; 

Black Hills Power, Cheyenne Light and Black Hills Wyoming are parties to a shared facilities agreement, whereby each entity charges for the use of assets by the affiliate entity. 

&#9702; 

Black Hills Colorado IPP and Colorado Electric are parties to a facility fee agreement, whereby Colorado Electric charges Black Hills Colorado IPP for the use of Colorado Electric assets. 

&#9702; 

Black Hills Colorado IPP, Cheyenne Light and Black Hills Power are parties to a Spare Turbine Use Agreement, whereby Black Hills Colorado IPP charges Black Hills Power and Cheyenne Light a monthly fee for the availability of a spare turbine to support the operation of Cheyenne Prairie Generating Station. 

&#9702; 

Black Hills Colorado IPP and Black Hills Wyoming receive certain staffing and management services from BHSC. 

&#8226; 

Jointly Owned Facilities 

&#9702; 

Black Hills Wyoming and MEAN are parties to a shared joint ownership agreement, whereby Black Hills Wyoming charges MEAN for administrative services, plant operations and maintenance on their share of the Wygen I generating facility over the life of the plant. 

Competition. &#32;&#32;The independent power industry consists of many strong and capable competitors, some of which may have more extensive operating experience or greater financial resources than we possess. 

With respect to the merchant power sector, FERC has taken steps to increase access to the national transmission grid by utility and non-utility purchasers and sellers of electricity and foster competition within the wholesale electricity markets. Our Power Generation business could face greater competition if utilities are permitted to robustly invest in power generation assets. Conversely, state regulatory rules requiring utilities to competitively bid generation resources may provide opportunity for independent power producers in some regions. 

The Energy Policy Act of 1992. &#32;&#32;The passage of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 encouraged independent power production by providing certain exemptions from regulation for EWGs. EWGs are exclusively in the business of owning or operating, or both owning and operating, eligible power facilities and selling electric energy at wholesale. EWGs are subject to FERC regulation, including rate regulation. We own two EWGs: Wygen I and 200 MW (two 100 MW combined-cycle gas-fired units) at the Pueblo Airport Generating Station. Our EWGs were granted market-based rate authority, which allows FERC to waive certain accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements imposed on public utilities with cost-based rates. 

Environmental Regulation. &#32;&#32;Many of the environmental laws and regulations applicable to our regulated Electric Utilities also apply to our Power Generation operations. See the discussion above under the &#8220;Environmental&#8221; and &#8220;Regulation&#8221; captions for the Utilities Group for additional information on certain laws and regulations. 

Clean Air Act . The Clean Air Act impacts our Power Generation business in a manner similar to the impact disclosed for our Electric Utilities. Our Wygen I and Pueblo Airport Generating facilities are subject to Titles IV and V of the Clean Air Act and have the required permits in place or have applications submitted in accordance with regulatory time lines. As a result of SO 2 &#32;allowances credited to us from the installation of sulfur removal equipment at our jointly owned Wyodak plant, we hold sufficient allowances for our Wygen I plant through 2045, without purchasing additional allowances. The EPA&#8217;s MACT rule described in the Utilities Group section will apply to Wygen I. 

&#32;37 

Clean Water Act . The Clean Water Act impacts our Power Generation business in a manner similar to the impact described above for our Electric Utilities. Each of our facilities that is required to have NPDES permits have those permits and are in compliance with discharge limitations. The EPA also regulates surface water oil pollution prevention through its oil pollution prevention regulations. Each of our facilities regulated under this program have the requisite pollution prevention plans in place. 

Solid Waste Disposal . We dispose of all Wygen I coal ash and scrubber wastes in mined areas at our WRDC coal mine under the terms and conditions of a state permit. The factors discussed under this caption for the Utilities Group also impact our Power Generation segment in a similar manner. 

Greenhouse Gas Regulations. &#32;&#32; The EPA&#8217;s GHG Tailoring Rule described in the Utilities Group section will apply to the Wygen I and the Pueblo Airport Generating units upon a major modification, upon operating permit renewal or in the case of Pueblo Airport Generating Station, upon initial issuance of the Title V operating permit. 

Coal Mining Segment 

Our Coal Mining segment operates through our WRDC subsidiary. We surface mine, process and sell primarily low-sulfur sub-bituminous coal at our coal mine near Gillette, Wyoming. The WRDC coal mine, which we acquired in 1956 from Homestake Gold Mining Company, is located in the Powder River Basin. The Powder River Basin contains one of the largest coal reserves in the United States. We produced approximately 4.1 million &#32;tons of coal in 2015 . 

During our surface mining operations, we strip and store the topsoil. We then remove the overburden (earth and rock covering the coal) with heavy equipment. Removal of the overburden typically requires drilling and blasting. Once the coal is exposed, we drill, fracture and systematically remove it, using front-end loaders and conveyors to transport the coal to the mine-mouth generating facilities. We reclaim disturbed areas as part of our normal mining activities by back-filling the pit with overburden removed during the mining process. Once we have replaced the overburden and topsoil, we re-establish vegetation and plant life in accordance with our approved Post Mining Topography plan. 

In a basin characterized by thick coal seams, our overburden ratio, a comparison of the cubic yards of dirt removed to a ton of coal uncovered, had in recent years trended upwards. The overburden ratio at December 31, 2015 was 1.5, which increased from the prior year as we continued mining in areas with higher overburden. We expect our stripping ratio to increase to approximately 1.9 &#32;by the end of 2016 as we mine back into areas with higher overburden. 

Mining rights to the coal are based on four federal leases and one state lease. The federal leases expire between March 31, 2021 to October 31, 2025 and the state lease expires on August 1, 2023. The duration of the leases varies; however, the lease terms generally are extended to the exhaustion of economically recoverable reserves, as long as active mining continues. We pay federal and state royalties of 12.5% of the selling price of all coal. As of December 31, 2015 , we estimated our recoverable coal reserves to be approximately 204 million &#32;tons, based on a life-of-mine engineering study utilizing currently available drilling data and geological information prepared by internal engineering studies. The recoverable coal reserve life is equal to approximately 49 &#32;years at the current expected production levels. Our recoverable coal reserve estimates are periodically updated to reflect past coal production and other geological and mining data. Changes in mining methods or the utilization of new technologies may increase or decrease the recovery basis for a coal seam. Our recoverable coal reserves include reserves that can be economically and legally extracted at the time of their determination. We use various assumptions in preparing our estimate of recoverable coal reserves. See Risk Factors under Coal Mining for further details. 

Substantially all of our coal production is currently sold under contracts to: 

&#8226; 

Black Hills Power for use at its Neil Simpson II plant. This contract is for the life of the plant; 

&#8226; 

Cheyenne Light for use at its Wygen II plant. This contract is for the life of the plant; 

&#8226; 

the 362 MW Wyodak power plant owned 80% by PacifiCorp and 20% by Black Hills Power. PacifiCorp is obligated to purchase a minimum of 1.5 million tons of coal each year of the contract term, subject to adjustments for planned outages. Black Hills Power is also obligated to purchase a minimum of 0.375 million tons of coal per year for its 20% share of the power plant. This contract expires at the end of December 2022; 

&#8226; 

the 110 MW Wygen III power plant owned 52% by Black Hills Power, 25% by MDU and 23% by the City of Gillette to which we sell approximately 600,000 tons of coal each year. This contract expires June 1, 2060; 

&#32;38 

&#8226; 

the 90 MW Wygen I power plant owned 76.5% by Black Hills Wyoming and 23.5% by MEAN to which we sell approximately 500,000 tons of coal each year. This contract expires June 30, 2038; and 

&#8226; 

certain regional industrial customers served by truck to which we sell a total of approximately 150,000 tons of coal each year. These contracts have terms of one to five years. 

Our Coal Mining segment sells coal to Black Hills Power and Cheyenne Light for all of their requirements under cost-based agreements that regulate earnings from these affiliate coal sales to a specified return on our coal mine&#8217;s cost-depreciated investment base. The return calculated annually is 400 basis points above A-rated utility bonds applied to our coal mining investment base. Black Hills Power made a commitment to the SDPUC, the WPSC and the City of Gillette that coal for Black Hills Power&#8217;s operating plants would be furnished and priced as provided by that agreement for the life of the Neil Simpson II plant and through June 1, 2060, for Wygen III. The agreement with Cheyenne Light provides coal for the life of the Wygen II plant. 

The price of unprocessed coal sold to PacifiCorp for the Wyodak plant is determined by the coal supply agreement described above. The agreement included a price adjustment in 2014, and an additional price adjustment in 2019. The price adjustments essentially allow us to retain the full economic advantage of the mine's location adjacent to the plant. The price adjustments are based on the market price of coal plus considerations for the avoided costs of rail transportation and a coal unloading facility which PacifiCorp would have to incur if it purchased coal from another mine. In addition, the agreement also provides for the monthly escalation of coal price based on an escalation factor. 

WRDC supplies coal to Black Hills Wyoming for the Wygen I generating facility for requirements under an agreement using a base price that includes price escalators and quality adjustments through June 30, 2038 and includes actual cost per ton plus a margin equal to the yield for Moody&#8217;s A-Rated 10-Year Corporate Bond Index plus 400 basis points with the base price being adjusted on a 5-year interval. The agreement stipulates that WRDC will supply coal to the 90 MW Wygen I plant through June 30, 2038. 

Competition. Our primary strategy is to sell the majority of our coal production to on-site, mine-mouth generation facilities under long-term supply contracts. Historically, off-site sales have been to consumers within a close proximity to the mine. Rail transport market opportunities for WRDC coal are limited due to the lower heating value (Btu) of the coal, combined with the fact that the WRDC coal mine is served by only one railroad, resulting in less competitive transportation rates. Management continues to explore the limited market opportunities for our product through truck transport. 

Additionally, coal competes with other energy sources, such as natural gas, wind, solar and hydropower. Costs and other factors relating to these alternative fuels, such as safety, environmental considerations and availability affect the overall demand for coal as a fuel. 

Environmental Regulation. &#32;&#32;The construction and operation of coal mines are subject to environmental protection and land use regulation in the United States. These laws and regulations often require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining licenses, permits and approvals from federal, state and local agencies. Many of the environmental issues and regulations discussed under the Utilities Group also apply to our Coal Mining segment. Specifically, the EPA is examining plans to reduce methane emissions from coal mines as part of President Obama&#8217;s Climate Action Plan. 

Operations at WRDC must regularly address issues arising due to the proximity of the mine disturbance boundary to the City of Gillette and to residential and industrial development. Homeowner complaints and challenges to the permits may occur as mining operations move closer to residential development areas. Specific concerns could include damage to wells, fugitive dust emissions and vibration and nitrous oxide fumes from blasting. 

Ash is the inorganic residue remaining after the combustion of coal. Ash from our Wyoming power plants, as well as PacifiCorp&#8217;s Wyodak power plant, is disposed of in the mine and is utilized for backfill to meet permitted post-mining contour requirements. On December 19, 2014, the EPA signed national disposal regulations regulating coal ash as a solid waste. While these regulations do not address mine backfill, it is expected the U.S. Office of Surface Mining will collaborate with the EPA and propose mine backfill regulations in early 2016. These regulations may increase the cost of ash disposal for the power plants and/or increase backfill costs for the coal mine. 

&#32;39 

Mine Reclamation. &#32;&#32;Reclamation is required during production and after mining has been completed. Under applicable law, we must submit applications to, and receive approval from, the WDEQ for any mining and reclamation plan that provides for orderly mining, reclamation and restoration of the WRDC mine. We have approved mining permits and are in compliance with other permitting programs administered by various regulatory agencies. The WRDC coal mine is permitted to operate under a five year mining permit issued by the State of Wyoming. The current permit expires in 2016 and the application for renewal was filed in 2015 per state requirements. Based on extensive reclamation studies, we have accrued approximately $19 million &#32;for reclamation costs as of December 31, 2015 . Mining regulatory requirements continue to increase, which impose additional cost on the mining process. 

Oil and Gas Segment 

Our Oil and Gas segment, which conducts business through BHEP and its subsidiaries, acquires, explores for, develops and produces natural gas and crude oil in the United States primarily in the Rocky Mountain region. In 2015, we began transitioning our Oil and Gas business toward supporting our planned Cost of Service Gas Program and similar programs in partnership with other utilities, while maintaining the upside value optionality of our Piceance Basin and other assets. In the current low energy commodity price environment, we can best utilize our oil and gas expertise to develop and operate the Cost of Service Gas Program on behalf of our utility businesses and similar programs in partnership with third-party utilities. Our oil and gas strategy for the last several years has been to prove up the potential of the Mancos formation for our southern Piceance Basin asset, while improving our drilling and completion practices for the Mancos. Drilling and completion costs have trended down as we focus on efficiencies and cost reductions. Sustained low oil and natural gas prices have also resulted in reduced costs for drilling and completion services, equipment and materials. We are currently assessing the Piceance wells to determine their potential fit for a Cost of Service Gas Program. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the principal assets of our Oil and Gas segment included: (i) operating interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, including properties in the San Juan Basin (with holdings primarily on the tribal lands of the Jicarilla Apache Nation in New Mexico and Southern Ute Nation in Colorado), the Powder River Basin (Wyoming) and the Piceance Basin (Colorado); (ii) non-operated interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, including wells located in various producing basins in several states; and (iii) a 44.7% ownership interest in the Newcastle gas processing plant and associated gathering system located in Weston County, Wyoming. The plant, operated by Western Gas Partners, LP, is adjacent to our producing properties in that area and BHEP&#8217;s production accounts for more than 55% of the facility&#8217;s throughput. We also own natural gas gathering, compression and treating facilities, and water collection and delivery systems serving the operated San Juan and Piceance Basin properties and working interests in similar facilities serving our Wyoming properties. 

At December 31, 2015 , we had total reserves of approximately 105 &#32;Bcfe, of which natural gas comprised 70% , crude oil comprised 20% &#32;and NGLs comprised 10% . The majority of our reserves are located in select crude oil and natural gas producing basins in the Rocky Mountain region. Approximately 18% &#32;of our reserves are located in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico, primarily in the East Blanco Field of Rio Arriba County; 25% &#32;are located in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, primarily in the Finn-Shurley Field of Weston and Niobrara counties; and 50% &#32;are located in the Piceance Basin of western Colorado, primarily in Mesa county. 

Summary Oil and Gas Reserve Data 

The summary information presented for our estimated proved developed and undeveloped crude oil, natural gas, and NGL reserves and the 10% discounted present value of estimated future net revenues is based on reports prepared by Cawley Gillespie &#38; Associates, an independent consulting and engineering firm located in Fort Worth, Texas. Reserves were determined consistent with SEC requirements using a 12-month average product price calculated using the first-day-of-the-month price for each of the 12 months in the reporting period held constant for the life of the properties. Estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net revenues are based on a number of variables, which may differ from actual results. Reserves for crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs are reported separately and then combined for a total MMcfe (where oil and NGLs in Mbbl are converted to an MMcfe basis by multiplying Mbbl by six). 

The SEC definition of &#8220;reliable technology&#8221; allows the use of any reliable technology to establish reserve volumes in addition to those established by production and flow test data. This definition allows, but does not require us, to book PUD locations that are more than one location away from a producing well. We elected to only include PUDs which are one location away from a producing well in our volume reserve estimate. Companies are allowed, but not required, to disclose probable and possible reserves. We have elected not to report these additional reserve categories. Additional information on our oil and gas reserves, related financial data and the SEC requirements can be found in Note 21 &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#32;40 

We maintain adequate and effective internal controls over the reserve estimation process as well as the underlying data upon which reserve estimates are based. The primary inputs to the reserve estimation process are comprised of technical information, financial data, ownership interest and production data. All field and reservoir technical information, which is updated annually, is assessed for validity when the reservoir engineers hold technical meetings with geoscientists, operations and land personnel to discuss field performance and to validate future development plans. Our internal engineers and our independent reserve engineering firm, CG&#38;A, work independently and concurrently to develop reserve volume estimates. Current revenue and expense information is obtained from our accounting records, which are subject to external quarterly reviews, annual audits and internal controls over financial reporting. All current financial data such as commodity prices, lease operating expenses, production taxes and field commodity price differentials are updated in the reserve database and then analyzed to ensure that they have been entered accurately and that all updates are complete. Our current ownership in mineral interests and well production data are also subject to the aforementioned internal controls over financial reporting and they are incorporated in the reserve database and verified to ensure their accuracy and completeness. Once the reserve database has been entirely updated with current information and all relevant technical support materials have been assembled, CG&#38;A meets with our technical personnel to review field performance and future development plans to further verify their validity. Following these reviews, the reserve database, including updated cost, price and ownership data, is furnished to CG&#38;A so they can prepare their independent reserve estimates and final report. Access to our reserve database is restricted to specific members of the engineering department. 

CG&#38;A is a Texas Registered Engineering Firm. Our primary contact at CG&#38;A is Mr. Zane Meekins. Mr. Meekins has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering since 1989. Mr. Meekins is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas and has over 28 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering and over 26 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He graduated from Texas A&#38;M University in 1987 with a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. Mr. Meekins meets or exceeds the education, training and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers and he is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. 

BHEP&#8217;s Engineering Manager is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing our third party reserve estimates. He has 29 years of experience as a petroleum engineer. He has over 22 years of experience working closely with internal and third party qualified reserve estimators in major and mid-sized oil and gas companies. He graduated from the University of Wyoming in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering. 

In 2014, we began to separate the NGL production and reserves from the prior years reported wet natural gas reserves and production. NGL production and reserves are processed volumes received by taking the wellhead gas to a gas plant where the various components are extracted into a dry natural gas stream and a natural gas liquids stream. NGL volumes reported are in barrels and are the weighted volumes of the various liquids components; ethane (if recovered), propane, isobutane, normal butane, and natural gasoline. Presently, ethane is not being recovered at any of the facilities that process our natural gas production. 

&#32;41 

Minor differences in amounts may result in the following tables relating to oil and gas reserves due to rounding. 

The following tables set forth summary information concerning our estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves, by basin, as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 :

___________________ 

(a) 

The decrease to proved undeveloped reserves is primarily due to our completion efforts in 2015 on our existing wells and our decision to limit additional drilling and exploration, driven by current year economic conditions. See Note 21 &#32;in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.

Drilling Activity 

In 2015 , we participated in drilling 21 gross ( 11 &#32;net) development and exploratory wells, with a net well success rate of 81% . A development well is a well drilled within a proved area of a reservoir known to be productive. An exploratory well is a well drilled to find and/or produce oil or gas in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in a previously productive field or to extend a known reservoir. Gross wells represent the total wells we participated in, regardless of our ownership interest, while net wells represent the sum of our fractional ownership interests within those wells. 

The following tables reflect the wells completed through our drilling activities for the last three years.

Approximately 15% (44,469 gross and 28,933 net acres), 5% (20,668 gross and 8,970 net acres) and 2% (14,229 gross and 4,642 net acres) of our undeveloped acreage could expire in 2016 , 2017 &#32;and 2018 , respectively, if production is not established on the leases or further action is not taken to extend the associated lease terms. Decisions on extending leases are based on expected exploration or development potential under the prevailing economic conditions. 

Competition. &#32;&#32;The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. We compete with a substantial number of companies ranging from those that have greater financial resources, personnel, facilities and in some cases technical expertise, to a multitude of smaller, aggressive new start-up companies. Many of these companies explore, produce and market crude oil and natural gas. The primary areas in which we encounter considerable competition are in recruiting and maintaining high quality staff, locating and acquiring leasehold acreage, acquiring producing oil and gas properties, and obtaining sufficient drilling rig and contractor services, acquiring economical costs for drilling and other oil and gas services and marketing our production of oil, gas, and NGLs. 

Seasonality of Business . Weather conditions affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also temporarily inhibit production and delay drilling activities, which in turn impacts our overall business plan. The demand for natural gas is typically higher in the fourth and first quarters of our fiscal year, which sometimes results in higher natural gas prices. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations on a quarterly basis may not reflect results which may be realized on an annual basis. 

Delivery Commitments. In 2012, we entered into a ten-year gas gathering and processing contract for natural gas production from our properties in the Piceance Basin in Colorado, under which we pay a gathering fee per Mcf. This take or pay contract requires us to pay the fee on a minimum of 20,000 Mcf per day, regardless of the volume delivered. The ten-year term of the agreement became effective in first quarter of 2014 upon completion of the processing infrastructure capable of handling the committed volumes. In 2014, our delivery of production did not meet the minimum requirement, and in 2015, we did not meet the minimum requirements of this contract until mid-February. We now have excess production capacity from wells completed in 2015, and four additional wells which have not yet been completed, and do not foresee any challenges in our ability to meet this commitment. 

Operating Regulation. &#32;&#32;Crude oil and natural gas development and production activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing a wide variety of matters. Regulations often require multiple permits and bonds to drill, complete or operate wells, establish rules regarding the location of wells, well construction, surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled, timing of when drilling and construction activities can be conducted relative to various wildlife and plant stipulations and plugging and abandoning of wells. We are also subject to various mineral conservation laws and regulations, including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing/proration units, the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, when voluntary pooling of lands and leases cannot be accomplished. The effect of these regulations may limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill. 

&#32;50 

Various federal agencies within the United States Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Land Management, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, along with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to crude oil and natural gas operations and administration of royalties on federal onshore and tribal lands. These regulations include such matters as lease provisions, drilling and production requirements, environmental standards and royalty considerations. Each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation possessing the power to enforce laws and regulations independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These tribal laws and regulations include various taxes, fees and other conditions that apply to lessees, operators and contractors conducting operations on tribal lands. One or more of these factors may increase our cost of doing business on tribal lands and impact the expansion and viability of our gas, oil and gathering operations on such lands. 

In addition to being subject to federal and tribal regulations, we must also comply with state and county regulations, which have been going through significant change over the last several years. New regulations have increased costs and added uncertainty with respect to the timing and receipt of permits. We expect additional changes of this nature to occur in the future. 

Environmental Regulations. &#32;&#32;Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into, and the protection of, the environment. We must account for the cost of complying with environmental regulations in planning, designing, drilling, operating and abandoning wells. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures (such as spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, storm water pollution prevention plans, groundwater monitoring, state air quality permits and underground injection control disposal permits), chemical storage or use, the remediation of petroleum-product contamination, identifying cultural resources and investigating threatened and endangered species. Certain states, such as Colorado, impose storm water requirements more stringent than the EPA&#8217;s and are actively implementing and enforcing these requirements. We take a proactive role in working with these agencies to ensure compliance. 

Under state, federal and tribal laws, we could also be required to remove or remediate previously disposed waste, including waste disposed of or released by us, or prior owners or operators, in accordance with current laws, or to otherwise suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas, or to perform remedial well plugging operations or clean-up activities to prevent future contamination. We generate waste that is already subject to the RCRA and comparable state statutes. The EPA and various state agencies limit the disposal options for those wastes. It is possible that certain oil and gas wastes which are currently exempt from regulation, such as RCRA wastes, may in the future be designated as wastes under RCRA or other applicable statutes. 

Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice, which has been used extensively for decades in the oil and gas industry to enhance the production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. We routinely apply hydraulic fracturing techniques on our crude oil and natural gas properties. Our hydraulic fracturing mixture is approximately 90% water, 9.5% sand and 0.5% of certain chemical additives to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to enhance flow of hydrocarbons into the well-bore. Chemicals used in the fracturing process are publicly posted as required by state regulations. The process is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions; however, the EPA does assert federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities when diesel comprises part of the fracturing fluid. In addition, several agencies of the federal government including the EPA and the BLM are conducting studies of the fracture stimulation process, which may result in additional regulations. In the event federal, state, local or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are conducting, or plan to conduct operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such regulations, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from utilizing fracture stimulation which may effectively preclude the drilling of wells. In May 2013, the U.S. Department of the Interior&#8217;s BLM re-proposed rules regulating the use of hydraulic fracturing on Federal and Indian Lands, and issued the final rule March 20, 2015. Subsequently on September 30, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction preventing the BLM from enforcing the final rule on federal and Indian lands. Regardless of the rule status, we already employ these practices in our hydraulic fracturing operations as described below, and if this rule should be re-issued, it will have minimal impact on our operations. All of these new or proposed regulations are expected to result in additional costs to our operations. 

In 2011 and 2012, the EPA issued several air quality regulations that impact our operations. These include emission standards for reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE requirements), new source performance standards for VOCs and SO 2 &#32;and hazardous air pollutant standards for oil and natural gas production, as well as natural gas transmission and storage (Quad O requirements). Since 2011, we have been in compliance with these new requirements and have been meeting the Quad O green completion requirements (directing flowback gas from natural gas wells to sales) effective January 2015. 

&#32;51 

In 2013, we participated in the State of Colorado&#8217;s stakeholder process to incorporate EPA Quad O requirements into state regulation. State regulations were finalized in early 2014. New Mexico incorporated Quad O regulations, effective December 19, 2013. Wyoming incorporated Quad O regulations effective January 3, 2014. 

Our policy is to meet or exceed all applicable local, state, tribal and federal regulatory requirements when drilling, casing, cementing, completing and producing wells that we operate. We follow industry best practices for each project to ensure safety and minimize environmental impacts. Effective wellbore construction and casing design, in accordance with established recommended practices and engineering designs, is important to ensure mechanical integrity and isolation from ground water aquifers throughout drilling, hydraulic fracturing and production operations. We place priority on drilling practices that ensure well control throughout the construction and completion phases. 

We conduct groundwater sampling before and after our drilling and completion operations. While this is a requirement in Colorado and Wyoming, we conduct this sampling in all states in which we act as the operator for these activities. 

Our wells are constructed using one or more layers of steel casing and cement to form a continuous barrier between fluids in the well and the subsurface strata. The only subsurface strata connected to the inside of the wellbore are the intervals that we perforate for the purpose of producing oil and gas. We isolate potential sources of ground water by cementing our surface and/or protection casing back to surface. In areas where additional protection may be necessary or required by regulations, we will cement the intermediate and or production casing string(s) back to surface. The casing is pressure-tested to ensure integrity. We typically also run a cement bond log to determine the quality of the bond between the cement and the casing and the cement and the subsurface strata. Surface and/or protection casing string pressures are monitored when a well is stimulated. We also conduct a combination of tests during the life of the well to verify wellbore integrity. Our wells are designed to prevent natural gas and other produced fluids from migrating or leaking for the life of the well. We employ qualified companies to monitor the pressure response to ensure that rate and pressure of fracturing treatment proceeds as planned. Unexpected changes in the rate or pressure are immediately evaluated and necessary action taken. We use the most effective and efficient water management options available. The handling, storage and disposal of produced water meets or exceeds all applicable state, local, tribal and federal regulatory standards and requirements. 

Greenhouse Gas Regulations. &#32;&#32;The EPA promulgated an amendment to its GHG reporting requirements in November 2010, adding Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems to the mandatory annual reporting requirements. Initial data gathering commenced on January 1, 2011, with the first annual report submitted to the EPA in 2012. The EPA added additional reporting requirements in 2011. On October 22, 2015, the EPA expanded coverage to gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. The first annual reports of emissions calculated using these new requirements are due to be submitted by March 31, 2017 to cover 2016 emissions. We are currently expanding our current inventory system to accommodate these new requirements. This is a permanent program, with GHG emission reports now due to the EPA on an annual basis. The Oil and Gas segment is also impacted by GHG regulation in the state of New Mexico. Other states may implement their own such programs in the future. 

On January 14, 2015, the Obama Administration announced a goal to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40-45% from 2012 levels, by 2025. Accordingly, on September 18, 2015, the EPA proposed standards for methane and VOC emissions from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources. The proposed rule, scheduled for finalization in 2016, also includes provisions for clarifying permitting requirements for determination of major/minor source status. The outcome of this proposal could create permitting delays if a final aggregation definition would require permitting our facilities as major sources. Additionally, EPA plans to work with industry and states to reduce methane from existing oil and gas operations and is exploring regulatory opportunities for applying remote sensing technologies to further improve the identification and quantification of methane and VOC emissions. 

In 2015, the Department of Interior&#8217;s BLM was scheduled to propose rules for new and existing oil and gas wells on public lands, targeting reduction or elimination of venting, flaring and leaks of natural gas. That proposal has not yet been issued for public comment. 

Ozone Regulations. &#32;&#32;In 2015, the EPA developed guidelines for states to use in reducing ozone-forming pollutants from existing oil and gas systems in areas that do not meet the ozone health standard. The new ozone standards, finalized October 26, 2015 are not expected to impact our current operations. However, the new regulations are very close to background levels, the ozone concentration level that the average person is exposed to, and may have an impact on future development.
