 Item 1. BUSINESS. 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We are an intellectual property company that owns patented and unpatented intellectual property. Spherix Incorporated was formed in 1967 as a scientific research company and for much of our history pursued drug development, including through Phase III clinical studies, which were largely discontinued in 2012. In 2012 and 2013, we shifted our focus to being a firm that owns, develops, acquires and monetizes intellectual property assets. Through our acquisitions of 108 patents and patent applications from Rockstar Consortium US, LP (&#8220;Rockstar&#8221;) and acquisition of several hundred patents issued to Harris Corporation as a result of our acquisition of North South Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;North South&#8221;), we have expanded our activities in wireless communications and telecommunication sectors including antenna technology, Wi-Fi, base station functionality and cellular. 

&#160;

During July 2013, we acquired 7 patents in the field of mobile communications from Rockstar. This acquisition represented the first transaction believed to have been completed by Rockstar with any publicly traded company. Rockstar was launched in 2011 as an intellectual property licensing company to manage a patent portfolio related to the pre-bankruptcy technology and businesses of Nortel Networks (&#8220;Nortel&#8221;). Rockstar was formed by Apple, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, Sony Corporation, Blackberry Limited and LM Ericsson Telephone Company. 

&#160;

During September 2013, we acquired 222 patents in the fields of wireless communications, satellite, solar, and radio frequency and 2 patents in the field of pharmaceutical distribution from North South. The 222 patents had been developed by Harris Corporation, a leader in defense communications and electronics and acquired by North South prior to our acquisition of North South.

&#160;

During December 2013, we acquired an additional 101 patents and patent applications from Rockstar in consideration for approximately $60 million of our securities consisting of common stock and preferred stock. The patents had been developed by Nortel and acquired by Rockstar following Nortel&#8217;s bankruptcy in 2011. The December 2013 acquisition includes patents covering internet access, and video and data transmission, among other things. We believe that many of the acquired Nortel/Rockstar patents are standard essential patents, meaning they potentially cover various industry standards in wide use (although there is no assurance that a court or third-party would agree with such description).

&#160;

We presently have active lawsuits pending against Uniden and VTech. We intend to bring additional lawsuits in respect of our patents in the future.

&#160;

Since our shift in focus to an intellectual property monetization platform, we have not generated any significant revenues. We have incurred losses from operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Our net loss attributable to common stockholders was approximately $42.3 million, including $0.3 million of deemed dividend related to immediate accretion of beneficial conversion feature of convertible preferred stock and $9.5 million of deemed capital contribution on extinguishment of preferred stock for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our accumulated deficit was $135.3 million at December 31, 2015. Our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $30.5 million.

&#160;

On March 24, 2015, we received a deficiency notice from NASDAQ that the bid price of our common stock no longer met NASDAQ&#8217;s continued listing requirements. According to the notice, in order to regain compliance with the NASDAQ listing rules, our common stock would need to have a closing bid price of at least $1.00 per share for at least 10 consecutive trading days no later than September 21, 2015. On September 22, 2015, we received a letter from NASDAQ granting us an additional 180 days, or until March 21, 2016, to regain compliance. On March 4, 2016, our common stock underwent a 1-for-19 reverse stock split. On March 18, 2016, we received a letter from NASDAQ informing us that we had regained compliance with NASDAQ&#8217;s continued listing requirements.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On November 23, 2015, we and RPX Corporation (&#8220;RPX&#8221;) entered into a Patent License Agreement (the &#8220;RPX License Agreement&#8221;) under which the Company granted RPX the right to sublicense various patent license rights to certain RPX members. The consideration to the Company included: (i) the transfer to the Company for cancellation of its remaining outstanding Series I Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series I Preferred Stock&#8221;), as to which a $5,000,000 mandatory redemption payment would have been due from the Company on or by December 31, 2015; (ii) the transfer to the Company for cancellation of 13%, or 57,076 shares, of its Series H Convertible Preferred Stock (the &#8220;Series H Preferred Stock&#8221;) then held by RPX, having a total carrying amount of $4,765,846 at the time the stock was issued to Rockstar; (iii) cancellation of the only outstanding security interest on 101 of the Company&#8217;s patents and patent applications acquired from Rockstar that originated at Nortel, which security interest had previously been transferred to RPX by Rockstar (&#8220;RPX Security Interest&#8221;); and (iv) $300,000 in cash to the Company.

&#160;

In consideration of the above, we granted RPX the rights to grant: (i) to Juniper Networks, Inc. (&#8220;Juniper&#8221;), a non-sublicensable, non-transferrable sublicense solely to use the six patents that had been asserted against Juniper by the Company (&#8220; Asserted Patents &#8221;); and (ii) to Apple, Blackberry, Cisco, Google, Huawei, Ericsson, Microsoft and Sony, to the extent those parties did not already have licenses to our patents, a non-sublicensable, non-transferrable sublicense to use our existing portfolio. Prior to our ownership of the patents originating at Nortel, each of Apple, Blackberry, Ericsson, Microsoft and Sony had previously been granted full licenses to those patents. In addition, we separately granted Huawei a license with respect to Huawei&#8217;s network routers and switches. We also granted RPX the rights to grant Cisco and Google a sublicense under patents transferred to us through November 23, 2017. We have since dismissed our then-existing litigations against Cisco and Juniper and Cisco requested dismissal of its two petitions requesting inter partes re-examination (&#8220; IPR &#8221;) of certain of our patents at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

&#160;

Further, we have agreed, until May 23, 2015 (the &#8220; Standstill Period &#8221;) that: (a) we and RPX will engage in good faith negotiations for the grant of additional license rights to RPX&#8217;s other members in exchange for additional consideration to us; (b) we will not divest, transfer, or exclusively license any of our current patents; (c) neither RPX nor any RPX affiliate will challenge, or knowingly and intentionally assist others in challenging, the validity, enforceability, or patentability of any of our patents in any court or administrative agency having jurisdiction to consider the issue; and (d) we will not bring an action against current RPX members for patent infringement.

&#160;

Following the Standstill Period, as a result of the release of the RPX Security Interest, we may leverage, divest, transfer or exclusively license our patents in a manner that is beneficial to us and our stockholders. We retain the right to bring claims under our patents at any time against other parties who are not licensees or beneficiaries under the RPX License. We also retain our rights, following the Standstill Period, to bring claims under our patents against current RPX members who did not become licensees or beneficiaries during the Standstill Period and, with respect to Juniper, under all of our patents other than the six Asserted Patents.

&#160;

Our principal executive offices are located at 1350 Ave of the Americas, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10019, and our telephone number is (646) 532-2963.

&#160;

Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol SPEX.

&#160;

Our Business Model 

&#160;

We are a patent commercialization company focused on generating revenues from the monetization of intellectual property, or IP. Such monetization includes, but is not limited to, acquiring IP from patent holders in order to maximize the value of the patent holdings by conducting and managing a licensing campaign, or through the settlement and litigation of patents. We intend to generate revenues and related cash flows from the granting of intellectual property rights for the use of patented technologies that we own, or that we manage for others. To date, we have generated minimal revenues and no assurance can be provided that our business model will be successful.

&#160;

We continually work to enhance our portfolio of intellectual property through acquisition and strategic partnerships. Our mission is to partner with inventors, or other entities, who own undervalued intellectual property. We then work with the inventors or other entities to commercialize the IP. Currently, we own over 290 patents and patent applications.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our Products and Services 

&#160;

We acquire IP from patent holders in order to maximize the value of their patent holdings by conducting and managing a licensing campaign. Some patent holders tend to have limited internal resources and/or expertise to effectively address the unauthorized use of their patented technologies or they simply make the strategic business decision to outsource their intellectual property licensing. They can include individual inventors, large corporations, universities, research laboratories and hospitals. Typically, we, or an operating subsidiary, acquire a patent portfolio in exchange for securities of the Company, an upfront cash payment, a percentage of our operating subsidiary&#8217;s net recoveries from the licensing and enforcement of the portfolio, or a combination of the foregoing.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We expect to encounter significant competition from others seeking to acquire interests in intellectual property assets and monetize such assets. This includes an increase in the number of competitors seeking to acquire the same or similar patents and technologies that we may seek to acquire. Most of our competitors have much longer operating histories, and significantly greater financial and human resources, than we do. Entities such as Vringo, Inc. (NYSE MKT: VRNG), VirnetX Holding Corp. (NYSE MKT: VHC), Acacia Research Corporation (NASDAQ: ACTG), RPX Corporation (NASDAQ: RPXC), Marathon Patent Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARA) and others presently market themselves as being in the business of creating, acquiring, licensing or leveraging the value of intellectual property assets. We expect others to enter the market as the true value of intellectual property is increasingly recognized and validated. In addition, competitors may seek to acquire the same or similar patents and technologies that we may seek to acquire, making it more difficult for us to realize the value of its assets.

&#160;

We also compete with venture capital firms, strategic corporate buyers and various industry leaders for technology acquisitions and licensing opportunities. Many of these competitors may have more financial and human resources than we do. As we become more successful, we may find more companies entering the market for similar technology opportunities, which may reduce our market share in one or more technology industries that we currently rely upon to generate future revenue.

&#160;

Other companies may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to our patented technologies that we may acquire and/or out-license. Many potential competitors may have significantly greater resources than we do. Technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors could render certain of the technologies owned or controlled by our operating subsidiaries obsolete and/or uneconomical.

&#160;

Intellectual Property and Patent Rights 

&#160;

Our intellectual property is primarily comprised of trade secrets, patented know-how, issued and pending patents, copyrights and technological innovation.

&#160;

Our portfolio is currently comprised of over 290 patents and patent applications. Our patent portfolio includes both U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications in the wireless communications and telecommunication sectors including data, optical and voice technology, antenna technology, Wi-Fi, base station functionality, and cellular. We also own patents related to artificial sweetener and prescription refill technology. 

&#160;

Most of our patents are publicly accessible on the Internet website of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office at www.uspto.gov.

&#160;

The lives of our patent rights have a wide duration. Certain patents have already expired and the latest patents do not expire until 2026.

&#160;

Patent Enforcement Litigation 

&#160;

We may often be required to engage in litigation to enforce our patents and patent rights. We are, or may become a party to ongoing patent enforcement related litigation, alleging infringement by third parties of certain of the patented technologies owned or controlled by us. The material litigations in which we are currently engaged are described in greater detail in Item 3 of this Annual Report.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We employ 4 individuals, all on a full-time basis as of December 31, 2015. We do not have employees that are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
