GENERAL 

&#160;

(&#8220;Alpha Pro Tech,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is the parent company of Alpha Pro Tech, Inc. and Alpha ProTech Engineered Products, Inc.

Our executive offices are located at 60 Centurian Drive, Suite 112, Markham, Ontario, Canada L3R 9R2, and our telephone number is (905) 479-0654. Our website is located at www.alphaprotech.com.

&#160; 

BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Alpha Pro Tech is in the business of protecting people, products and environments. We accomplish this by developing, manufacturing and marketing a line of high-value, disposable protective apparel and infection control products for the cleanroom, industrial, pharmaceutical, medical and dental markets through our wholly owned subsidiary, Alpha Pro Tech, Inc. We also manufacture a line of building supply construction weatherization products through our wholly owned subsidiary, Alpha ProTech Engineered Products, Inc. Our products are sold under the "Alpha Pro Tech" brand name, as well as under private label. 

&#160; 

Our products are grouped into three business segments: (1) the Building Supply segment, consisting of construction weatherization products, such as housewrap and synthetic roof underlayment as well as other woven material; (2) the Disposable Protective Apparel segment, consisting of disposable protective apparel, such as shoecovers, bouffant caps, gowns, coveralls, lab coats, frocks and other miscellaneous products; and (3) the Infection Control segment, consisting of face masks and eye shields. All financial information presented herein reflects the current segmentation. 

&#160; 

Our principal strategy focuses on developing, producing and marketing differentiated, innovative high value products that protect people, products and environments. Our key sales growth strategies are based on communicating directly with end users and developing innovative products to suit individual end users&#8217; needs. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our products are used primarily in cleanrooms, industrial safety manufacturing environments and health care facilities, such as hospitals, laboratories and dental offices, as well as building and re-roofing sites. Our products are distributed principally in the United States of America (&#8220;United States&#8221; or &#8220;U.S.&#8221;) through a network consisting of purchasing groups, national distributors, local distributors, independent sales representatives, and our own sales and marketing force. 

&#160; 

PRODUCTS 

&#160; 

Our principal products are grouped into three business segments: 

&#160; 

Building Supply: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Housewrap 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Synthetic roof underlayment 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Other woven material 

&#160; 

Disposable Protective Apparel: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Shoecovers 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Bouffant caps 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Gowns 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Coveralls 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Lab coats 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Frocks 

&#160; 

Infection Control: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Face masks 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Eye shields 

&#160; 

Building Supply 

&#160; 

The Building Supply segment consists of a line of construction supply weatherization products, namely housewrap and synthetic roof underlayment, as well as other woven material. This line of products is a natural extension of our core capabilities: creating proprietary products designed to protect people and environments. 

&#160; 

The usage of these construction supply weatherization products offers great advantages in decreasing the time that it takes to construct a home, as well as reducing costs. The housewrap, under the trademark REX&#8482;, offers a weather resistant barrier and, to the homeowner, years of lower energy consumption. REX&#8482; Wrap and REX&#8482; Wrap Plus are woven and coated polypropylene micro perforated weather resistant barriers, and REX&#8482; Wrap Fortis is a highly engineered composite made up of a high-strength woven fabric, a monolithic breather film and a non-woven sheet, offering a high-strength non-perforated membrane. 

&#160; 

The proprietary synthetic roof underlayment, REX&#8482; SynFelt, has the ability to resist the environment, as opposed to conventional organic roofing underlayment that is prone to rapid degradation and mold growth. We also manufacture and distribute TECHNOply&#8482; and TECHNO&#8482; SB, economy versions of our synthetic roof underlayment, to capture market share in the lower end of the market. 

&#160; 

These products are manufactured in our manufacturing facility in Valdosta, Georgia and through our joint venture in India, as described in more detail below under &#8220;Manufacturing.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Disposable Protective Apparel 

&#160; 

The Disposable Protective Apparel segment includes many different styles of disposable products, such as shoecovers, bouffant caps, gowns, coveralls, lab coats, frocks and other miscellaneous products. The vast majority of these products are manufactured by subcontractors in Asia and, to a much lesser extent, a subcontractor in Mexico, as described in more detail below under &#8220;Manufacturing.&#8221; 

Certain proprietary products are made using materials supplied by us. 

&#160; 

Infection Control 

&#160; 

The Infection Control segment includes face masks and eye shields. Our face masks come in a wide variety of filtration efficiencies and styles. Our patented Positive Facial Lock&#174; feature provides a custom fit to the face to prevent blow-by for better protection. The term "blow-by" is used to describe the potential for infectious material to enter or escape a facemask without going through the filter as a result of gaps or openings in the face mask. Our Magic Arch&#174; feature holds the mask away from the nose and mouth, creating a comfortable breathing chamber. One of our masks that incorporates both the Positive Facial Lock&#174; feature and the Magic Arch&#174; feature is the &#8220;N-95 Particulate Respirator face mask,&#8221; which was recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#8220;CDC&#8221;) to combat the spread of the H1N1 Influenza A pandemic in 2009. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

All eye shields are made from an optical-grade polyester film and have a permanent anti-fog feature. This provides the wearer with extremely lightweight, distortion-free protection that can be worn for hours, and the eye shields will not fog up from humidity and/or perspiration. An important feature of all face masks and eye and face shields is that they are disposable, which eliminates the possibility of cross infection between patients and saves users, such as hospitals, the expense of sterilization after every use. 

&#160; 

This segment could experience increased demand during outbreaks of infectious disease, such as H1N1 in 2009 and Ebola in 2014. 

&#160; 

As described in more detail below under &#8220;Manufacturing,&#8221; our face masks are primarily manufactured in our facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. Our eye shields are produced in our facility in Nogales, Arizona and assembled by a subcontractor in Mexico. 

&#160; 

Financial information related to the three segments can be found in Activity of Business Segments (Note 14) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

MARKETS 

&#160; 

Our products are sold to the following markets: construction weatherization products (building supply products) are sold to construction supply and roofing distributors, and disposable protective apparel and infection control products are sold to the industrial, cleanroom, medical and dental markets. 

&#160; 

Our target markets are construction building supply and roofing distributors, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing, medical device manufacturing, lab animal research, high technology electronics manufacturing (which includes the semi-conductor market), and medical and dental distributors. 

&#160; 

DISTRIBUTION 

&#160; 

We rely primarily on a network of independent distributors for the sale of our products. 

&#160; 

We do not generally have backlog orders, as orders are usually placed for shipment and shipped within 30 days. Appropriate levels of inventories are maintained to supply distributors on a timely basis. From time to time, we will stockpile inventory for periods of unusually high demand. 

&#160; 

Payment terms are normally net 30 days from the date of shipment. All pricing and payment for our products are in U.S. dollars. Authorized returns must be unopened, in good condition and in the original carton and may be returned within 90 days of the original date of shipment. All authorized returns are subject to a restocking fee of 20% of the original invoice.
