Corporate Organization 

&#160;

Uranium Energy Corp. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 16, 2003 under the name &#8220;Carlin Gold Inc.&#8221; During 2004, we changed our business operations and focus from precious metals exploration to uranium exploration in the United States. On January 24, 2005, we completed a reverse stock split of our common stock on the basis of one share for each two outstanding shares and amended our Articles of Incorporation to change our name to &#8216;Uranium Energy Corp.&#8217;. Effective February 28, 2006, we completed a forward stock split of our common stock on the basis of 1.5 shares for each outstanding share and amended our Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized capital from 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share to 750,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. In June 2007, we changed our fiscal year end from December 31 to July 31.

&#160;

On December 31, 2007, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, UEC Resources Ltd., under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada. Effective December 18, 2009, we acquired a 100% interest in the South Texas Mining Venture, L.L.P., a Texas limited liability partnership, from each of URN Resources Inc., a subsidiary of Uranium One Inc., and Everest Exploration, Inc. On September 3, 2010, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, UEC Paraguay Corp., under the laws of the State of Nevada. Effective May 24, 2011, we acquired a 100% in interest in Piedra Rica Mining S.A., a private company incorporated in Paraguay. Effective September 9, 2011, we acquired a 100% interest in Concentric Energy Corp., a private company incorporated in the State of Nevada. Effective March 30, 2012, we acquired a 100% interest in Cue Resources Ltd., a formerly publicly-traded company incorporated in the Province of British Columbia, Canada.

&#160;

Our principal offices are located at 500 North Shoreline Boulevard, Suite 800N, Corpus Christi, Texas 78401 and 1030 West Georgia Street, Suite 1830, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 2Y3.

&#160;

General Business 

&#160;

We are engaged in uranium mining and related activities, including exploration, pre-extraction, extraction and processing, on uranium projects located in the United States and Paraguay. We utilize in-situ recovery (&#8220;ISR&#8221;) mining where possible which we believe, when compared to conventional open pit or underground mining, requires lower capital and operating expenditures with a shorter lead time to extraction and a reduced impact on the environment. We do not expect, however, to utilize ISR mining for all of our mineral rights in which case we would expect to rely on conventional open pit and/or underground mining techniques. We have one uranium mine located in the State of Texas, the Palangana Mine, which utilizes ISR mining and commenced extraction of uranium oxide (&#8220;U 3 O 8 &#8221;), or yellowcake, in November 2010. We have one uranium processing facility located in the State of Texas, the Hobson Processing Facility, which processes material from the Palangana Mine into drums of U 3 O 8 , our only sales product and source of revenue, for shipping to a third-party storage and sales facility. Since commencement of uranium extraction from the Palangana Mine in November 2010 to July 31, 2015, the Hobson Processing Facility has processed 578,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 . At July 31, 2016, we had no uranium supply or &#8220;off-take&#8221; agreements in place.

&#160;

Our fully-licensed and 100%-owned Hobson Processing Facility forms the basis for our regional operating strategy in the State of Texas, specifically the South Texas Uranium Belt where we utilize ISR mining. We utilize a &#8220;hub-and-spoke&#8221; strategy whereby the Hobson Processing Facility acts as the central processing site (the &#8220;hub&#8221;) for our Palangana Mine and future satellite uranium mining activities, such as our Burke Hollow and Goliad Projects, located within the South Texas Uranium Belt (the &#8220;spokes&#8221;). The Hobson Processing Facility has a physical capacity to process uranium-loaded resins up to a total of two million pounds of U 3 O 8 annually and is licensed to process up to one million pounds of U 3 O 8 annually.

&#160;

At July 31, 2016, we hold certain mineral rights in various stages in the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming and in the Republic of Paraguay, many of which are located in historically successful mining areas and have been the subject of past exploration and pre-extraction activities by other mining companies. We do not expect, however, to utilize ISR mining for all of our mineral rights in which case we would expect to rely on conventional open pit and/or underground mining techniques.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our operating and strategic framework is based on expanding our uranium extraction activities, which includes advancing certain uranium projects with established mineralized materials towards uranium extraction, and establishing additional mineralized materials on our existing uranium projects or through acquisition of additional uranium projects.

&#160;

During Fiscal 2016, uranium extraction at Production Area Authorizations (&#8220;PAA&#8221;) 1, 2 and 3 of the Palangana Mine continued to operate at a reduced pace since implementing our strategic plan in September 2013, to align our operations to a weak uranium market in a challenging post-Fukushima environment. This strategy has included the deferral of major pre-extraction expenditures and remaining in a state of operational readiness in anticipation of a recovery in uranium prices.

&#160;

During Fiscal 2016, the Company:

&#160;

&#183; entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement (the &#8220;Second Amended and Restated Agreement&#8221;) with its lenders and extended the $20,000,000 senior secured credit facility by deferring required principal payments to February 1, 2019 and by extending the maturity date to January 1, 2020; &#183; completed a registered offering of 12,364,704 units at a price of $0.85 per unit for gross proceeds of $10,510,000; &#183; completed an asset acquisition through the issuance of 1,333,560 restricted common shares and the payment of $50,000 in cash; &#183; continued to advance development of PAA 4 of the Palangana Mine; &#183; continued to advance exploration and permitting activities at the Burke Hollow Project; &#183; continued permitting work at the Anderson Project; &#183; appointed former United States Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham as Executive Chairman of the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors; and &#183; appointed Pat Obara as the Company&#8217;s Chief Financial Officer. &#160;

Uranium Industry Background 

&#160; 

With the world&#8217;s population exceeding seven billion people and growing, the need for electricity is rising and is an important driver for the projected long term increase in nuclear power generation and uranium demand. The world&#8217;s current operating fleet of nuclear power plants, in addition to the global growth in new reactors under construction and those planned, is testimony to the confidence in nuclear power to provide safe, economical, reliable carbon free energy as part of an overall energy supply mix. As of August 10, 2016, World Nuclear Association (&#8220;WNA&#8221;) data shows 445 reactors operable worldwide with 61 new reactors under construction, 170 reactors planned or on order and another 339 proposed. Translated into global uranium demand, Ux Consulting Company (&#8220;UxC&#8221;), a uranium market information source, projects base demand to increase from about 182 million pounds in 2016 to 190 million pounds in 2020 and about 210 million pounds by 2025.

&#160;

Nuclear generation in the United States remained stable in 2015, producing about 797 billion kilowatt-hours, accounting for 19.5% of the country&#8217;s total electrical generation as reported by the Nuclear Energy Institute. As of August 2016, the operating U.S. reactor fleet stands at 100 reactors, with four new commercial reactors in various stages of construction (Vogtle 3 and 4 in Georgia and Summer 2 and 3 in South Carolina). A new reactor, Watts Bar 2 in Tennessee has just been completed and is now in commercial operation. In addition, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has another 10 new reactor applications that are active. The U.S. remains the world&#8217;s largest consumer of uranium with annual requirements of about 50 million pounds of U 3 O 8 . The U.S. Energy Information Administration (&#8220;EIA&#8221;) reported domestic production totaled 3.3 million pounds in 2015, down 32% from 4.9 million pounds in 2014. This amounts to about 7% of U.S. reactor requirements in 2015 and highlights the U.S. dependency on foreign sources of uranium supply.

&#160;

Uranium production around the planet increased about 9% in 2015 from 145 to 158 million pounds of U 3 O 8 . The lion&#8217;s share of this new production came from the long anticipated and much delayed Cigar Lake project that was just beginning to ramp up in 2014. About 130 million pounds, or 83%, of the globe&#8217;s production came from Africa, Australia, Canada and Kazakhstan (UxC data). Kazakhstan remained the world&#8217;s largest producer, with about 62 million pounds produced or about 40% of the world&#8217;s total production. The projects in these areas are primarily controlled by five major producers, although some of these mines involve joint ventures with other entities. Many of the projects in various production areas are subject to heightened geopolitical and other risks. In choosing a long term supplier in this highly concentrated industry, these are important considerations for a utility relying on a secure uranium supply source to fuel their reactor needs.

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Japan&#8217;s March 11, 2011 earthquake and subsequent tsunami causing the Fukushima Daiichi accident has had a substantial impact on the nuclear fuel markets and resulted in a short term oversupply situation. As this oversupply has persisted in the nuclear fuel market during 2015, prices have remained under pressure. Uranium spot market prices have fallen over 64% from a March 1, 2011 pre-Fukushima price of $70.00 per pound to an 11 year low at $25.00 per pound in mid-July of 2016. Spot prices were up slightly off the low at around $26 per pound at the end of August 2016, a price well below almost all producers cost of production. Long-term contract (base price escalated) prices have also weakened and were published at $38 per pound in July 2016 after dropping from the pre-Fukushima level of $73 per pound. Since Fukushima, the spot and long-term contract price drops have resulted in the deferral or cancellation of several large uranium projects, removing 178 million pounds of supply that was projected to be online in the years 2014 to 2016, and another 58 million pounds in 2020 (UxC data).

&#160;

Most recently, the world&#8217;s largest uranium producer announced plans to shutter its U.S. operations that will remove about 2 million pounds per year of U.S. production. Additionally, many longer term high priced contracts are falling out of producer portfolios and will not be replaced at current market prices, likely forcing the suspension of higher cost production. We believe this trend is likely to continue absent a substantial and sustained increase in market price. Production cuts, project deferrals and cancellations further exacerbate the growing longer term gap between production and consumption and are likely to increase the prospects for an eventual strong rebound in uranium prices.

&#160;

While Japan&#8217;s return to nuclear power post Fukushima has been slower than expected, it&#8217;s still progressing with an ultimate goal of producing 20 to 22% of their electrical generation requirements from nuclear power. A total of 25 reactors have applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (&#8220;NRA&#8221;) for restart. To date, the NRA has approved seven reactors to resume commercial operations, of which three reactors have restarted, with Sendai 1 and 2 as well as Ikata 3 all operating smoothly.

&#160;

World base case demand was about 194 million pounds in 2015, exceeding the 158 million pounds of total production by about 36 million pounds. The gap between &#8220;Existing&#8221; production and consumption is projected to be near 20 million pounds per year in 2020, and increasing further to about 48 million pounds in 2023 (UxC Uranium Market Outlook Q2-2016). While projections show some of the gap could be partially filled with new production, there is question whether or not &#8220;Planned and Potential&#8221; production comes on line in accordance with expectations. So far, the difference between primary production and reactor demand is being filled with secondary market sources. This includes the U.S. Department of Energy (&#8220;DOE&#8221;) excess uranium inventories, enrichment underfeeding and tails re-enrichment programs as well as Russian stockpiles. Some progress has been made to curtail the amount of uranium that the DOE has been placing into the market, but their continued release of price insensitive material has had a clear, adverse material impact on market prices. While no definitive agreement has been reached, there are legislative and other efforts underway to limit or halt the material DOE is placing into the market.

&#160;

Ultimately, the forces of supply and demand will dictate the direction of future uranium pricing. The EIA reported that U.S. supplier inventories have decreased each year over the past four years with another drop in 2015 of 19% from 2014 levels. In past reports, UxC has noted &#8220;To the extent that fewer inventories are being held by suppliers, they are likely to be less aggressive selling material and thus pushing price lower.&#8221; Also in another recently issued report UxC stated &#8220;the market is transitioning from being inventory driven to being production driven.&#8221; Most planned projects have costs well above $50 per pound and many industry executives and analysts, including J.P. Morgan; have stated a minimum acceptable price to encourage new hard-rock conventional production is above $75 per pound.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The global growth in nuclear power is impressive, resulting in a near 40% growth rate in uranium consumption from 2016 through 2030. For this past year, the International Energy Agency reported that the &#8220;global addition to nuclear capacity in 2015 was 10.2 gigawatts, the highest growth in 25 years.&#8221; Much of this growth is coming from countries like China which plans to have over 97 gigawatt electrical (&#8220;GWe&#8221;) of nuclear generation in place by 2025. As of August 2016, China had 34 reactors that were operable with about 31 GWe of capacity. Other countries like India and Russia also have robust nuclear power expansion plans. These countries are embarking on sovereign-backed uranium acquisition programs, building inventory stockpiles for their future requirements. This also includes substantial long term contracting with Western suppliers and taking controlling interests in primary mine production capacity. In addition, Russia and China are aggressively pursuing programs to sell their reactors around the globe. In most cases the sales agreements contain turnkey provisions, including uranium supply as a component of the reactor package that will require far more uranium than they currently produce.

&#160;

In the United States, future growth in nuclear generation is likely to emerge from clean-air initiatives, like the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Clean Power Plan that mandates the U.S. utility industry reduce carbon emissions 32% by 2030. New U.S. reactor builds are a clear choice in meeting environmental goals and requirements with reliable clean air energy. Currently, about 60% of the U.S. carbon free electricity is generated from nuclear power. While there have been five U.S. nuclear plant closings in recent years and announcements of future closings for nine additional reactors, there is reasonable question if this will continue. Most of the U.S. reactors with potential to close are in merchant markets where they are forced to compete with heavily subsidized windpower, and what is currently cheap gas fired generation. However, gas fired generation is not environmentally friendly and producing CO 2 emissions that are expected to surpass that produced by coal this year. This is not consistent with clean air initiatives and should cause some States to revisit their plans to meet EPA mandates. The recent New York State Clean Energy Standard (&#8220;CES&#8221;) will keep New York nuclear units operational, avoiding costly pollution. As a result of this program, the FitzPatrick Plant that had previously planned to close will now continue operation. We believe other States will likely follow the CES template and keep their nuclear plants contributing to a clean energy supply mix.

&#160;

In total, the cumulative amount of global uncommitted demand over the next five years is 262 million pounds. This represents an 18% increase over the five year forward uncommitted demand evident in 2015. Older contracts are winding down from the previous contracting cycle and as a matter of practice, utilities typically contract for their open needs two to four years in advance of the requirement. As utilities return to the spot, mid and long term markets, the more recent inventory driven market is likely to wane and a production driven market should emerge. In summary, we believe supply and demand fundamentals have significant potential to force uranium prices upward. We believe the global climate-change push for carbon reduction, and critical air pollution concerns, like those in China, likely leaves nuclear power as the primary alternative for emission-free, base load, 24-7 generation.

&#160;

In-Situ Recovery (ISR) Mining 

&#160;

We utilize or plan on utilizing in-situ recovery or ISR uranium mining for our South Texas projects including the Palangana Mine and will continue to utilize ISR mining whenever such alternative is available to conventional mining. When compared to conventional mining, ISR mining requires lower capital expenditures and has a reduced impact on the environment, as well as a shorter lead time to uranium recovery.

&#160;

ISR mining involves circulating oxidized water through an underground uranium deposit, dissolving the uranium and then pumping the uranium-rich solution to the surface for processing. Oxidizing solution enters the formation through a series of injection wells and is drawn to a series of communicating extraction wells. To create a localized hydrologic cone of depression in each wellfield, more groundwater will be produced than injected. Under this gradient, the natural groundwater movement from the surrounding area is toward the wellfield, providing control of the injection fluid. Over-extraction is adjusted as necessary to maintain a cone of depression which ensures that the injection fluid does not move outside the permitted area.

&#160;

The uranium-rich solution is pumped from the ore zone to the surface and circulated through a series of ion exchange columns located at the mine site. The solution flows through resin beds inside an ion exchange column where the uranium bonds to small resin beads. As the solution exits the ion exchange column, it is mostly void of uranium and is re-circulated back to the wellfield and through the ore zone. Once the resin beads are fully-loaded with uranium, they are transported by truck to the Hobson Processing Facility and transferred to a tank for flushing with a brine solution, or elution, which strips the uranium from the resin beads. The stripped resin beads are then transported back to the mine and reused in the ion exchange columns. The uranium solution, now free from the resin, is precipitated out and concentrated into a slurry mixture and fed to a filter press to remove unwanted solids and contaminants. The slurry is then dried in a zero-emissions rotary vacuum dryer, packed in metal drums and shipped out as uranium concentrates, or yellowcake, to ConverDyn for storage and sales.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Each project is divided into a mining unit known as a PAA which lies inside an approved Mine Permit Boundary. Each PAA will be developed, extracted and restored as one unit and will have its own set of monitor wells. It is common to have multiple PAAs in extraction at any one time with additional units in various states of exploration, pre-extraction and/or restoration.

&#160;

After mining is complete in a PAA, aquifer restoration will begin as soon as practicable and will continue until the groundwater is restored to pre-mining conditions. Once restoration is complete, a stability period of no less than one year is scheduled with quarterly baseline and monitor well sampling. Wellfield reclamation will follow after aquifer restoration is complete and the stability period has passed.

&#160;

Hobson Processing Facility 

&#160; 

The Hobson Processing Facility is located in Karnes County, Texas, about 100 miles northwest of Corpus Christi. It was originally licensed and constructed in 1978, serving as the hub for several satellite mining projects until 1996, and completely refurbished in 2008. On December 18, 2009, we acquired the Hobson Processing Facility as part of the acquisition of South Texas Mining Venture, L.L.P.

&#160;

With a physical capacity to process uranium-loaded resins up to a total of two million pounds of U 3 O 8 annually and licensed to process up to one million pounds of U 3 O 8 annually, our fully-licensed and 100%-owned Hobson Processing Facility forms the basis for our &#8220;hub-and-spoke&#8221; strategy in the State of Texas, specifically the South Texas Uranium Belt where we utilize ISR mining.

&#160;

Palangana Mine 

&#160;

We hold various mining lease and surface use agreements generally having an initial five-year term with extension provisions, granting us the exclusive right to explore, develop and mine for uranium at the Palangana Mine, a 7,094-acre property located in Duval County, Texas, approximately 100 miles south of the Hobson Processing Facility. These agreements are subject to certain royalty and overriding royalty interests indexed to the sale price of uranium.

&#160;

On December 18, 2009, we acquired the Palangana Mine as part of the acquisition of South Texas Mining Venture, L.L.P. In November 2010, the Palangana Mine commenced uranium extraction utilizing ISR mining and in January 2011, the Hobson Processing Facility began processing resins received from the Palangana Mine.

&#160;

Material Relationships Including Long-Term Delivery Contracts 

&#160;

We entered into a multi-year uranium sales contract in June 2011, as amended in January 2012, requiring the delivery of a total 320,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 by us over a three-year period starting in August 2011. The sales price was based on published market price indicators at the time of delivery. During the year ended July 31, 2012 and 2013 (&#8220;Fiscal 2012&#8221; and &#8220;Fiscal 2013&#8221;), a total of 290,000 pounds of U 3 O 8 were sold under this contract and during Fiscal 2014, the remaining delivery commitment of 30,000 pounds under this contract was cancelled at no cost to the Company. At July 31, 2016, we had no uranium supply or &#8220;off-take&#8221; agreements in place.

&#160;

Given that there are up to approximately 60 different companies as potential buyers in the uranium market, we are not substantially dependent upon any single customer to purchase the uranium extracted by us.

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160;

The timing of our uranium concentrate sales is dependent upon factors such as extraction results from our mining activities, cash requirements, contractual requirements and perception of the uranium market. As a result, our sales are neither tied to nor dependent upon any particular season. In addition, our ability to extract and process uranium does not change on a seasonal basis. Over the past ten years, uranium prices have tended to decline during the calendar third quarter before rebounding during the fourth quarter, but there does not appear to be a strong correlation.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Mineral Rights 

&#160;

In Texas, our mineral rights are held exclusively through private leases from the owners of the land/mineral/surface rights with varying terms. In general, these leases provide for uranium and certain other specified mineral rights only including surface access rights for an initial term of five years and renewal for a second five-year term. Production royalties apply which are calculated on a sliding-scale basis tied to the gross sales price of uranium. Remediation of the property is required in accordance with regulatory standards, which may include the posting of reclamation bonds.

&#160;

In Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming, our mineral rights are held either exclusively or through a combination of federal mining claims and state and private mineral leases. Remediation of the property is required in accordance with regulatory standards, which may include the posting of reclamation bonds. Our federal mining claims consist of both unpatented lode and placer mining claims registered with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) and the appropriate counties. These claims provide for all mineral rights including surface access rights for an indefinite period. Annual maintenance requirements include BLM claim fees of $155 per claim due on September 1. Our state mineral leases are registered with the applicable state. These leases provide for all mineral rights including surface access rights, subject to a production royalty of 5% in Wyoming, ranging from a five-year term in Arizona to a ten-year term in Wyoming. Annual maintenance requirements include lease fees of $1 and $2 per acre and minimum exploration expenditure requirements of $10 and $20 per acre in Arizona. Our private mineral leases are negotiated directly with the owners of the land/mineral/surface rights with varying terms. These leases provide for uranium and certain other specified mineral rights only including surface access rights, subject to production royalties, for an initial term of five years and renewal for a second five-year term.

&#160;

Under the mining laws of the Republic of Paraguay, title to mineral rights for the Yuty Project is held through a &#8220;Mineral Concession Contract&#8221; approved by the National Congress and signed between the Government of the Republic of Paraguay and the Company, and title to mineral rights for the Coronel Oviedo Project is held through a &#8220;Mineral Permit&#8221; granted by the Ministry of Public Works and Communications. These mineral rights provide for the exploration of metallic and non-metallic minerals and precious and semi-precious gems within the territory of Paraguay for up to a 6-year period, and for the exploitation of minerals for a minimum period of 20 years from the beginning of the production phase, extendable for an additional ten years.

&#160;

&#160;

Yuty Project, Paraguay 

&#160;

We hold an undivided 100% interest in one exploitation concession in the Yuty Project, a 289,680-acre property located in Paraguay, subject to an overriding royalty payable of $0.21 for each pound of uranium produced from the property.

&#160;

Coronel Oviedo Project, Paraguay 

&#160; 

We hold an undivided 100% interest in one exploration permit in the Coronel Oviedo Project, a 464,548-acre property located in Paraguay, subject to a 1.5% gross overriding royalty over which we have an exclusive right and option at any time to acquire 0.5% for $166,667 and a right of first refusal to acquire all or any portion of the remaining 1.0%.

&#160;

Environmental Regulation 

&#160;

Our activities will be subject to existing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Our operations will be subject to stringent environmental regulation by state and federal authorities including the Railroad Commission of Texas (the &#8220;RCT&#8221;), the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (&#8220;TCEQ&#8221;) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;).

&#160;

In Texas, surface extraction and exploration for uranium is regulated by the RCT, while in-situ uranium extraction is regulated by the TCEQ. An exploration permit is the initial permit granted by the RCT that authorizes exploration drilling activities inside an approved area. This permit authorizes specific drilling and plugging activities requiring documentation for each borehole drilled. All documentation is submitted to the RCT on a monthly basis and each borehole drilled under the exploration permit is inspected by an RCT inspector to ensure compliance. At July 31, 2016, the Company held one exploration permit in each of Bee, Duval, Goliad and Live Oak Counties.

&#160;

Before in-situ uranium extraction can begin in Texas, a number of permits must be granted by the TCEQ.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A Mine Area Permit application is required for submission to the TCEQ to establish a specific permit area boundary, aquifer exemption boundary and the mineral zones of interests or production zones. The application also includes a financial surety plan to ensure funding for all plugging and abandonment requirements. Funding for surety is in the form of cash or bonds, including an excess of 15% for contingencies and 10% for overhead, adjusted annually for inflation. At July 31, 2016, the Company held two Mine Area Permits, one for the Palangana Mine and another for the Goliad Project.

&#160;

A Radioactive Material License (&#8220;RML&#8221;) application is also required for submission to the TCEQ for authorization to operate a uranium recovery facility. The application includes baseline environmental data for soil, vegetation, surface water and groundwater along with operational sampling frequencies and locations. A Radiation Safety Manual is a key component of the application which defines the environmental health and safety programs and procedures to protect employees and the environment. Another important component of the application is a financial surety mechanism to insure plant and wellfield decommissioning is properly funded and maintained. Surety funding is in the form of cash or bonds and includes an excess of 15% for contingencies and 10% for overhead, adjusted annually for inflation. At July 31, 2016, the Company held RMLs for its Palangana Mine, Goliad Project and the Hobson Processing Facility.

&#160;

Production Area Authorization applications are also required for submission to the TCEQ to establish specific extraction areas inside the Mine Area Permit boundary. These are typically 30 to 100 acre units that have been delineated and contain producible quantities of uranium. The PAA application includes baseline water quality data that is characteristic of that individual unit, proposes upper control limits for monitor well analysis and also establishes restoration values. The application will also include a financial security plan for wellfield restoration and reclamation which must be funded and in place prior to commencing uranium extraction. At July 31, 2016, the Company held four PAA permits for its Palangana Mine and one for its Goliad Project.

&#160;

A Class I disposal well permit application is also required for submission to the TCEQ for authorization for deep underground wastewater injection. It is the primary method for disposing of excess fluid from the extraction areas and for reverse osmosis concentrate during the restoration phase. This permit authorizes injection into a specific injection zone within a designated injection interval. The permit requires continuous monitoring of numerous parameters including injection flow rate, injection pressure, annulus pressure and injection/annulus differential pressure. Mechanical integrity testing is required initially and annually to ensure the well is mechanically sound. Surety funding for plugging and abandonment of each well is in the form of cash or bonds, including 15% for contingencies and 10% for overhead, adjusted annually for inflation. At July 31, 2016, the Company held two Class I disposal well permits for the following projects: Hobson Processing Facility, Palangana Satellite Facility, Burke Hollow Project and the Goliad Project.

&#160;

The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (&#8220;SDWA&#8221;) creates a regulatory program to protect groundwater and is administered by the EPA. The SDWA allows states to issue underground injection control (&#8220;UIC&#8221;) permits under two conditions: the state&#8217;s program must have been granted primacy and the EPA must have granted an aquifer exemption upon the state&#8217;s request. Texas, being a primacy state, is therefore authorized to grant UIC permits and makes the official requests for an aquifer exemption to the EPA. The aquifer exemption request is submitted by the Company to the TCEQ, and once approved, is then submitted by the TCEQ to the EPA for concurrence and final issuance. At July 31, 2016, the Company held an aquifer exemption for the Palangana Mine and an aquifer exemption for the Goliad Project.

&#160;

Waste Disposal 

&#160;

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes affect minerals exploration and production activities by imposing regulations on the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of &#8220;hazardous wastes&#8221; and on the disposal of non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 

&#160;

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) imposes joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances (collectively &#8220;Hazardous Substances&#8221;). These classes of persons or potentially responsible parties include the current and certain past owners and operators of a facility or property where there is or has been a release or threat of release of a Hazardous Substance and persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the Hazardous Substances found at such a facility. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties, to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs of such action. We may also in the future become an owner of facilities on which Hazardous Substances have been released by previous owners or operators. We may in the future be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities or property at which such substances have been released and for natural resource damages.

&#160;

Air Emissions 

&#160;

Our operations are subject to local, state and federal regulations for the control of emissions of air pollution. Major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent, federally imposed permitting requirements. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could require us to forego construction, modification or operation of certain air emission sources. In Texas, the TCEQ issues an exemption for those processes that meet the criteria for low to zero emission by issuing a Permit by Rule. Presently the Palangana Mine, the Hobson Processing Facility and the Goliad Project all have Permit by Rule covering air emissions.

&#160;

Clean Water Act 

&#160;

The Clean Water Act (&#8220;CWA&#8221;) imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes, including mineral processing wastes, into waters of the United States, a term broadly defined. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters. The CWA provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and other pollutants. It imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances. State laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil, criminal and administrative penalties and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or it derivatives, or other hazardous substances, into state waters. In addition, the EPA has promulgated regulations that may require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff. In the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes, we may be liable for penalties and costs. Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The uranium industry is highly competitive, and our competition includes larger, more established companies with longer operating histories that not only explore for and produce uranium, but also market uranium and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. Due to their greater financial and technical resources, we may not be able to acquire additional uranium projects in a competitive bidding process involving such companies. Additionally, these larger companies have greater resources to continue with their operations during periods of depressed market conditions.
