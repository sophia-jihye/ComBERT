 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General &#32; 

Potlatch Corporation is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that owns approximately 1.6 million &#32;acres of timberlands in Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Minnesota and Mississippi. We derive much of our income from investments in real estate, including the sale of standing timber. Through wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiaries, which we refer to collectively in this report as Potlatch TRS, we operate a real estate sales business and five wood products manufacturing facilities that produce lumber and plywood. 

Our businesses are organized into three operating segments: 

&#8226; 

Resource: Our Resource segment manages our timberlands to optimize revenue producing opportunities while adhering to our strict stewardship standards. Management activities include planting and harvesting trees and building and maintaining roads. The Resource segment also generates revenues from activities such as hunting leases, recreation permits and leases, mineral rights leases, biomass production and carbon sequestration. 

&#8226; 

Wood Products: Our Wood Products segment manufactures and markets lumber, plywood and residual products. 

&#8226; 

Real Estate: The business of our Real Estate segment consists primarily of the sale of land holdings deemed non-strategic or identified as having higher and better use alternatives. The Real Estate segment engages in real estate sales and limited subdivision activity through Potlatch TRS. 

Additional information regarding each of our operating segments is included in this section, as well as in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32; and &#32; Note 15: Segment Information &#32;in the &#32; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements . 

We are focused on the ownership of timberland, which we view as a unique and attractive asset due to the renewable nature of timber resources and timber&#8217;s long-term history of price appreciation in excess of inflation. Our primary objectives include using our timberland investments to generate income and maximizing the long-term value of our assets. We pursue these objectives by adhering to the following strategies: &#160; 

&#8226; 

Managing our timberlands to improve their long-term sustainable yield. &#32;We manage our timberlands in a manner designed to optimize the balance among timber growth, prudent environmental management and current cash flow, in order to achieve increasing levels of sustainable yield over the long-term. We may choose to harvest timber at levels above or below our current estimate of sustainability for short periods of time, for the purpose of improving the long-term productivity of certain timber stands or in response to market conditions. In addition, we focus on optimizing timber returns by continually improving productivity and yields through advanced silvicultural practices that take into account soil, climate and biological considerations. 

&#8226; 

Pursuing attractive acquisitions. &#32;We actively pursue timberland acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic criteria. The critical elements of our acquisition strategy generally include acquiring properties that complement our existing land base, are immediately cash flow accretive and have attractive timber or higher and better use (HBU) values. 

&#8226; 

Maximizing the value of our timberland real estate. &#32;A portion of our acreage is more valuable for recreational purposes or to other timberland or real estate investors rather than for growing timber. We continually assess the potential uses of our lands and manage them proactively for the highest value. We have identified approximately 20% of our timberlands as having values that are potentially greater than timberland values. 

&#8226; 

Practicing sound environmental stewardship. &#32;We pursue a program of environmental stewardship and active involvement in federal, state and local policymaking to maximize our assets&#8217; long-term value. We manage our timberlands in a manner consistent with the principles set forth by SFI &#174; or FSC &#174; . 

2015 FORM 10-K / &#32;3 

Potlatch Corporation, formerly known as Potlatch Holdings, Inc., was incorporated in Delaware in September 2005 to facilitate a restructuring to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. It is the successor to the business of the original Potlatch Corporation, which was incorporated in Maine in 1903. 

Effective January 1, 2006, we restructured our operations to qualify for treatment as a REIT. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal and state corporate income taxes on our income from investments in real estate that we distribute to our stockholders, including the income derived from the sale of standing timber. As of January 1, 2016, we are no longer subject to corporate taxes on certain built-in gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis on real property held since January 1, 2006) on sales of real property held by the REIT. We are required to pay federal corporate income taxes on income from our non-real estate investments, principally the operations of Potlatch TRS.

Business Segments &#32; 

Resource Segment &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Industry Background. The demand for timber depends primarily upon the markets for wood related products, including lumber, panel products, paper and other pulp-based products. The end uses for timber vary widely, depending on species, size and quality. Historically, timber demand has experienced cyclical fluctuations, although sometimes at different times and rates for products or geographic regions. The demand for sawlogs, lumber and other manufactured wood products is significantly dependent upon the level of new residential construction and remodeling activity, which, in turn, is affected by general economic and demographic factors, including population growth, new household formations, interest rates for home mortgages and construction loans, and credit availability. Increases in residential construction and remodeling activities are generally followed by higher lumber prices, which are usually followed by higher log prices. The demand for pulpwood is dependent on the paper and pulp-based manufacturing industries. Both pulpwood and sawlogs are affected by domestic and international economic conditions, global population growth and other demographic factors, industry capacity and the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to foreign currencies. Locally, timber demand also fluctuates due to the expansion or closure of individual wood products and pulp-based manufacturing facilities. 

Timber supplies can fluctuate depending upon factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies, as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to storm damage, unusual pest infestations such as the mountain pine beetle, or fires. Local timber supplies also change in response to prevailing timber prices. Rising timber prices often lead to increased harvesting on private timberlands, including lands not previously made available for commercial timber operations. The supply of timber generally is adequate to meet demand, although this could tighten in the event of higher demand due to U.S. housing starts, increased log and lumber exports, and the impacts from a natural disaster, such as fire, hurricane, earthquake, insect infestation, drought, disease, ice storms, windstorms, flooding or other factors. 

Timberland Acquisition. On December 7, 2014, we acquired approximately 201,000 acres of timberland in Alabama and Mississippi for $384 million. The acquisition complemented our existing ownership in our Southern Region. The acquired timber consisted of approximately 73% softwood and 27% hardwoods. We bought the timberland subject to three supply agreements. In addition, we assumed recreational leases that cover approximately 90% of the timberlands acquired. They are generally annual leases that are subject to renewal and generate approximately $1.5 million in annual revenues.

Operation. The primary business of the Resource segment is the management of our timberlands to optimize the value of all possible revenue producing opportunities while adhering to our strict stewardship standards. Management activities include planting and harvesting trees and building and maintaining roads. The segment also generates revenue from non-timber resources such as from hunting leases, recreation permits and leases, mineral rights leases, biomass production and carbon sequestration. 

We strive to maximize cash flow while managing our timberlands sustainably over the long-term. From time to time, we may choose, within the parameters of our environmental commitments, to harvest timber at levels above or below our estimate of sustainability for short periods in order to take advantage of strong demand or to adjust to weak demand. To maximize our timberlands' long-term value, we manage them intensively, based upon timber species and local growing conditions. Our harvest plans take into account changing market conditions, are designed to contribute to the growth of the remaining timber, and reflect our policy of environmental stewardship. We reforest our acreage in a timely fashion to enhance its long-term value. We employ silvicultural techniques to improve timber growth rates, including vegetation control, fertilization and thinning. In deciding whether to implement any silvicultural practice, we analyze the associated costs and long-term benefits, with the goal of achieving an attractive return over time. 

Inventory. &#32;As of the end of 2015, our estimated standing merchantable timber inventory was 66 million tons, including 36 million tons in the North and 30 million tons in the South. This estimate is derived using methods consistent with industry practice and is based on statistical methods and field sampling. The estimated inventory volume includes timber in environmentally sensitive areas where the timberlands are managed in a manner consistent with best management practices, state forest practice acts and the SFI &#174; &#32;or FSC &#174; &#32;forest management standards. 

The aggregate estimated volume of current standing merchantable timber inventory is updated annually to reflect increases due to reclassification of young growth to merchantable timber when the young growth meets defined diameter specifications, the annual growth rates of merchantable timber and the acquisition of additional merchantable timber, and to reflect decreases due to timber harvests and land sales. Timber volumes are estimated from cruises of the timber tracts, which are generally completed on a five to ten year cycle. Since the individual cruises collect field data at different times for specific sites, the growth model projects standing inventory from the cruise date to a common reporting date. Annual growth rates for the merchantable inventory have historically been in the range of 2% &#32; to &#32; 5% &#32;in the North and 6% to 9% in the South. 

Harvest. &#32;Our short-term and long-term harvest plans are critical factors in our long-term management process. Each year, we prepare a harvest plan designating the timber tracts and volumes to be harvested during that particular year. Each harvest plan reflects our analysis of the age, size and species distribution of our timber, as well as our expectations about harvest methods, growth rates, the volume of each species to be harvested, anticipated acquisitions and dispositions, thinning operations, regulatory constraints and other relevant information. Among other things, the optimal harvest cycles, or rotations, for timber vary by location and species and tend to change over time as a result of silvicultural advances, changes in the markets for different sizes and ages of timber and other factors. Since harvest plans are based on projections of weather, timber growth rates, regulatory constraints and other assumptions, many of which are beyond our control, there can be no assurance that we will be able to harvest the volumes projected or the specific timber stands designated in our harvest plans.

We expect our harvest level to range between 4.0 million and 4.8 million tons each year over the next several years, depending on market conditions and other factors, assuming no significant timberland acquisitions or dispositions. Based on our current projections, which are based on constant timberland holdings, and that take into consideration such factors as market conditions, the ages of our timber stands and recent timberland sales and acquisitions, we expect to harvest approximately 4.4 million tons in 2016. 

The Resource segment sells a portion of its logs at market prices to our wood products manufacturing facilities. Intersegment sales to our wood products manufacturing facilities in 2015 were approximately 20% of our total Resource segment revenues. The segment also sells sawlogs and pulpwood to a variety of forest products companies located near our timberlands. The segment&#8217;s customers range in size from small operators to multinational corporations. Idaho Forest Group, LLC operates five sawmills in Idaho and represented slightly more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2015, 2014 and 2013. The segment competes with owners of timberlands that operate in areas near our timberlands, ranging from private owners of small tracts of land to some of the largest timberland companies in the United States. The segment competes principally on the basis of distance to market, price, log quality and customer service. 

In 2015, approximately 38% of our harvest volumes in both the Northern and Southern regions were sold under log supply agreements. We expect approximately the same amount to be sold under log supply agreements in 2016. In general, our log supply contracts require a specified volume of timber to be delivered to defined customer facilities at prices that are adjusted periodically to reflect market conditions. Prices in our Northern region contracts are adjusted periodically by species to prevailing market prices for logs, lumber, wood chips and other residuals. Prices in our Southern region contracts are adjusted every three months for pine and hardwood logs based on prevailing market prices for logs. Currently our log supply agreements are in place for one to six years. 

Other. &#32;Our timberlands include a wide diversity of softwood and hardwood species and are certified to either the SFI &#174; &#32;or FSC &#174; &#32;standards. We adhere to principles that include commitments to sustainable forestry, responsible practices, forest health and productivity, and protection of special sites. We are generally able to sell some FSC &#174; -certified logs at premium prices. 

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those relating to the environment, endangered species, our forestry activities and health and safety. Due to the significance of regulation to our business, we integrate wildlife, habitat and watershed management into our resource management practices. We also take an active approach to regulatory developments by participating in standard-setting where possible. We work cooperatively with regulators to create voluntary conservation plans that address environmental concerns while preserving our ability to operate our timberlands efficiently. Despite our active participation in governmental policymaking and regulatory standard-setting, there can be no assurance that endangered species, environmental and other laws will not restrict our operations or impose significant costs, damages, penalties and liabilities on us. In particular, we anticipate that endangered species and environmental laws will generally become increasingly stringent. 

The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our lands may be affected by natural disasters such as fire, insect infestation, disease, ice storms, hurricanes, wind storms, floods and other weather conditions and causes. We assume substantially all risk of loss to the standing timber we own from fire and other hazards, consistent with industry practice in the United States, because insuring for such losses is not practicable. 

Wood Products Segment 

Our Wood Products segment manufactures and markets lumber, plywood and residual products at five mills located in Arkansas, Idaho, Michigan and Minnesota. The segment&#8217;s products are largely commodity products, which are sold through our sales offices to end users, retailers or wholesalers for nationwide distribution primarily for use in home building, industrial products and other construction activity.

Capacity represents the proven annual production capabilities of the facility under normal operating conditions and producing a normal product mix. Normal operating conditions are based on the configuration, efficiency and the number of shifts worked at each individual facility. In general, the definition includes two shifts per day for five days (two 40-hour shifts) per week at each facility, which is consistent with industry-wide recognized measures. Production can exceed capacity due to efficiency gains and overtime. 

2 &#160; 

mmbf stands for million board feet; mmsf stands for million square feet, 3/8 inch panel thickness basis. 

We are the eighth largest lumber manufacturer in the U.S. We believe that competitiveness in this industry is largely based on individual mill efficiency and on the availability of competitively priced raw materials on a facility-by-facility basis, rather than the number of mills operated. This is due to the fact that it is generally not economical to transfer logs between or among facilities, which might permit a greater degree of specialization and operating efficiencies. Instead, each facility must utilize the raw materials that are available to it in a relatively limited geographic area. For these reasons, we believe we are able to compete effectively with companies that have a larger number of mills. We compete based on product quality, customer service and price. We can produce and sell FSC &#174; -certified products that generally command premium pricing. 

For our Wood Products operations, the principal raw material used is logs, which are obtained from our Resource segment or purchased on the open market. We generally do not maintain long-term supply contracts for a significant volume of logs. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, 33%, 38% and 39% of our log purchases, respectively, were provided by our Resource segment. 

Real Estate Segment 

The activities of our Real Estate segment consist primarily of the sale of selected non-core timberland real estate, which consists of three categories of property: HBU, rural recreational real estate and non-strategic. 

&#8226; 

HBU properties have characteristics that provide primarily home site or other development potential as a result of superior location or other attractive amenities. These properties tend to have a much higher value than timberlands. 

&#8226; 

Rural recreational real estate properties also have a higher value than timberlands, but do not have the same developmental potential as HBU properties. For example, these properties may be appropriate for hunting, conservation or secondary rural housing. 

&#8226; 

Non-strategic properties often have locational or operational disadvantages for us, and are typically on the fringe of our ownership areas. 

The Real Estate segment engages in real estate sales and limited subdivision activities through Potlatch TRS. 

From time to time, we also take advantage of opportunities to sell timberland where we believe pricing to be particularly attractive, to match a sale with a purchase of more desirable property while deferring taxes in a like-kind exchange (LKE) transaction, or to meet various other financial or strategic objectives. Sales of conservation properties and conservation easements on our properties are also included in this segment. Results for the segment depend on the demand for our non-core timberlands, the types of properties sold, the basis of these properties and the timing of closings of property sales. Although large sales of non-strategic properties can cause results that are not comparable or predictable between periods, we have maintained a relatively consistent level of rural real estate and HBU sales. 

2015 FORM 10-K / &#32;7 

A main focus of this segment is to continually assess the highest value use of our lands. We conduct periodic stratification assessments on our lands and as new lands are acquired. The following tools are used in assessing our lands: 

&#8226; 

on-the-ground analysis and verification of modeling assumptions; 

&#8226; 

electronic analysis, using geographic information systems; and 

&#8226; 

certain measured and ranked attributes, such as timber potential, recreational opportunities, accessibility, special features and population and demographic trends. 

We have identified approximately 285,000 acres of non-core timberland real estate. This includes approximately 75,000 acres of HBU property, 80,000 acres of non-strategic timberland and 130,000 acres of rural recreational real estate property. Sales of these lands are expected to occur over a decade or more, with the goal of utilizing LKE transactions or other tax-advantaged methods when it is appropriate. 

Seasonality &#32; 

Log and pulpwood sales volumes in our Resource segment are typically lower in the first half of each year as winter rains in the Southern region and spring thaw in the Northern region limit timber harvesting operations due to softened roadbeds and wet logging conditions that restrict access to logging sites. The third quarter is typically our Resource segment's strongest production quarter. Real Estate dispositions and acquisitions can be adversely affected when access to any properties to be sold or considered for acquisition is limited due to adverse weather conditions. Demand for our manufactured wood products typically decreases in the winter months when construction activity is slower and increases in the spring, summer and fall when construction activity is generally higher. 

Geographic Areas &#32; 

All of our timberlands, wood products manufacturing facilities and other real estate assets are located within the continental United States. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, approximately 1%, 1%, and 2% of the respective year's Wood Products' segment revenues were derived from sales of manufactured wood products to Canada and Mexico. The remainder of our revenues were from domestic sales. 

Environmental Regulation &#32; 

Our operations are subject to laws and regulations, including those relating to the environment, endangered species, our forestry activities and health and safety. Due to the significance of regulation to our business, we integrate wildlife, habitat and watershed management into our resource management practices. We also take an active approach to regulatory developments by participating in standard-setting where possible. We work cooperatively with regulators to create voluntary conservation plans that address environmental concerns while preserving our ability to operate our timberlands efficiently. 

Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, particularly relating to air and water quality, or their enforcement, may require significant expenditures by us or may adversely affect our timberland management and harvesting activities. 

Similarly, a number of species indigenous to our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered or have been proposed for one or the other status under the Endangered Species Act. As a result, our activities in or adjacent to the habitat of these species may be subject to restrictions on the harvesting of timber, reforestation activities and the construction and use of roads. 

We expect legislative and regulatory developments in the area of climate change to address carbon dioxide emissions and renewable energy and fuel standards. It is unclear as of this date how any such developments will affect our business. 

At this time, we believe that federal and state laws and regulations related to the protection of endangered species and air and water quality will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We anticipate, however, that increasingly strict laws and regulations relating to the environment, natural resources and forestry operations, as well as increased social concern over environmental issues, may result in additional restrictions on us, leading to increased costs, additional capital expenditures and reduced operating flexibility. 

&#32;8 &#32;&#32;/ POTLATCH CORPORATION 

There is extensive federal and state environmental regulation with respect to air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management, site remediation, forestry operations, and threatened and endangered species. We are also subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes relating to the health and safety of our employees. We maintain environmental and safety compliance programs and conduct regular internal and independent third-party audits of our facilities and timberlands to monitor compliance with these laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental regulations is a significant factor in our business and requires capital expenditures as well as additional operating costs. 

We believe that our manufacturing facilities and timberland operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We cannot be certain, however, that situations that give rise to material environmental liabilities will not be discovered. 

Information regarding potentially material environmental proceedings is included in Note 14: Commitments and Contingencies &#32;in the &#32; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;contained in this report and incorporated herein by reference. 

Employees &#32; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 927 employees. The workforce consisted of 231 salaried, 661 hourly and 35 temporary or part-time employees. As of December 31, 2015, 18% &#32;of the workforce was covered under one collective bargaining agreement, which expires in May 2016.
