 ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We design, develop and sell rechargeable advanced lithium-ion batteries for industrial uses, including our first-ever UL 2771 Listed lithium-ion &#8220; LiFT Pack&#8221; forklift batteries. We have developed an innovative high power battery cell management system (&#8220; BMS&#8221;) and have structured our business around this core technology. Our proprietary BMS provides three critical functions to our battery systems: 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226;

Cell Balancing : This is performed by adjusting the capacity of each cell in a storage system according to temperature, voltage, and internal impedance metrics. This cell balancing management assures longevity of the overall system. 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226;

Monitoring : This is performed by way of a physical connection to individual cells for monitoring voltage and performing calculations from basic metrics to determine remaining capacity and internal impedance. This monitoring assures accurate measurements to best manage the system and assure longevity. 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226;

Error Reporting : This is performed by analyzing data from system monitoring and making decisions on whether the system is operating out of normal specifications. This error reporting is crucial to system management as it ensures ancillary devices are not damaging the storage system and will give the operator an opportunity to take corrective action to maintain long overall system life. 

&#160;

Using ou r proprietary BMS technology, we are able to offer completely integrated energy storage solutions or custom modular standalone systems to our clients. In addition, we have also developed a suite of complementary technologies and products that accompany and enhance the abilities of our core BMS products to meet the needs of the growing advanced energy storage market. 

&#160; 

Current Business Strategy 

&#160;

We are primarily focusing on the lift equipment market targeting dealers and distributors, and secondarily, on the airline ground support equipment market. We believe that these markets will be the strongest for aggressive revenue growth over the coming year. A Prototype Agreement with NACCO confirmed that our advanced energy storage systems can address a broad range of lift equipment. We initially focused our efforts on the original equipment manufacturer (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) market. However, such efforts proved to be time consuming and elusive. In addition, working exclusively with one manufacturer would significantly limit our market opportunity. As such, we shifted our focus from an OEM market to a non-OEM, national distribution network across all OEM markets, which pose fewer barriers to entry. Currently, we are working with various lift equipment OEM&#8217;s, their dealers and battery distributors to bring our advanced energy storage systems to the lift equipment market. This provides a more direct market path to the consumer without the delays and issues that accompany dealing solely with the OEM. 

&#160;

We are leveraging from our prior experience of developing and shipping over 15 megawatts of battery packs in a variety of applications ranging from electrical vehicles, electric boats, and various industry specific applications. The current process of working with the lift equipment sector has included securing &#8220;technical approval&#8221; by the OEMs for compatibility with their equipment and then developing a sales network utilizing existing battery distributors and equipment dealers. Our product development has included pilot programs and trials with national account end users and industrial equipment manufacturers. Such pilot programs have been highly beneficial in providing us with the much needed feedback necessary to improve our battery packs. It also led us to securing a UL Listing on our LiFT Pack as more fully discussed below. 

&#160;

Our primary focus has been with our entry-level LiFT Pack line to power walkie pallet jack forklifts. During fiscal year 2016, the pace of sales has been limited by our focus on converting Flux &#8217;s production from small-run production and prototyping into large scale production of our UL-listed products. We purposely dialed down production over the last two quarters in order to incorporate the improvements gleaned from the UL review process last winter, as well as, implement important engineering features that stem from a model changeover. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we also developed specialized assembly and testing stations designed to speed production time frames by automating many facets of testing and assembly. We expect to see the results of these design and production enhancements, in the way of improved gross margins, during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, we are developing advanced energy storage systems for other related industrial equipment, por table power, and stationary grid applications ranging from 24-volt to 72-volt applications. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we successfully completed a pilot of our custom-developed, 72-volt battery pack to power electric aviation ground support equipment with a leading regional airline at Los Angeles International Airport. Prior to that, we shipped a 48-volt, 900 amp hour pack for robotic mining equipment to South America and developed a portable 24-volt battery pack for the US military, which is currently in the trial period . 

&#160;

In summary, we are developing a suite of complementary technologies and products that utilize our core BMS technology. Sales during the year ended June 30, 2016 were primarily to customers located throughout the United States. 

&#160; 

History 

&#160;

We were incorporated in Nevada in 1998 under the name Olerama, Inc. Since our incorporation, there have been several name changes, including the change in January 2010 where we changed our name to Lone Pine Holdings, Inc. and in May 2012, in connection with the reverse acquisition, we changed our name from Lone Pine Holdings, Inc. to our current name, Flux Power Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;Flux&#8221;). 

We operate our business through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Flux Power, Inc. (&#8220;Flux Power&#8221;). Flux Power was incorporated in October 2009 to provide solutions to exploit the lithium battery market for small electric vehicles and began shipping prototype product in the second quarter of 2010 while continuing to develop its intellectual property portfolio. 

&#160;

Reverse Acquisition of Flux Power Inc. 

&#160;

On June 14, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Flux Power (the &#8220; Reverse Acquisition&#8221;) pursuant to a Securities Exchange Agreement dated May 18, 2012 (&#8220;Exchange Agreement&#8221;) by and among Flux Power, and its shareholders, Mr. Christopher (&#8220;Chris&#8221;) Anthony, Esenjay Investments, LLC, and Mr. James Gevarges (collectively the &#8220;Flux Power Shareholders&#8221;). In connection with the Reverse Acquisition, we purchased 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Flux Power from the Flux Power Shareholders in exchange for 37,714,514 newly issued shares our common stock (&#8220;Exchange Shares&#8221;) based on an exchange ratio of 2.9547039 (&#8220;Share Exchange Ratio&#8221;). As a result of the Reverse Acquisition, the Flux Power Shareholders collectively owned approximately 91% of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, and Flux Power became our wholly-owned operating subsidiary. 

&#160;

The Reverse Acquisitio n has been reflected as a reverse merger where Flux was the surviving legal entity after the merger. Flux Power remained the accounting acquirer. The merger has been accounted for as a recapitalization as of the earliest period presented. Accordingly, the historical consolidated financial statements represented are those of Flux Power. 

&#160; 

DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS 

&#160;

Our Business 

&#160;

We are in the business of energy storage and battery management. In October 2009, we started to develop technologies for the adv anced energy storage market and began shipping prototype product in the second quarter of 2010 while continuing to develop our intellectual property portfolio. In 2011, we began shipping Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards validated products and then started shipping ancillary products to enhance our overall product line. Focusing on cell management of large format lithium cells, our technology dramatically extends the battery system life, lowering the overall cost of ownership to a level which makes lithium competitive with lead-acid in numerous applications. We have spent over five years developing lithium battery energy storage technology, including shipping over 15 megawatts of power in a variety of applications ranging from electrical vehicles to industrial equipment applications. 

&#160;

In January 2016, we obtained certification from Underwriters Laboratory (&#8220; UL&#8221;) on our LiFT Packs for forklift use listed to UL 2271. The UL Listing, issued by UL, a global safety science organization, demonstrates the quality, safety and reliability of our LiFT Pack line for customers, distributors, dealers and OEM partners. We believe we have emerged from this effort with a substantially enhanced product line, particularly in the areas of overall design and durability, as well as, features that improve our LiFT Packs&#8217; value and performance for customers. We passed our Initial Production Inspection by UL to allow LiFT Packs with the UL Listing to be shipped and two subsequent surprise UL inspections. We shipped our first UL certified LiFT Pack to our customers beginning in May 2016. Our LiFT Packs are now the first and only UL Listed lithium-ion batteries available. 

&#160;

In April 2016, we began piloting our custom-developed, 72-volt battery pack for use with electric aviation ground support equipment. The pilot program, organized by Averest, Inc., a leading distributor of industrial batteries and chargers for aviation ground support equipment, was with a leading regional airline at Los Angeles International Airport. The test program wrapped up in August 2016 and was deemed a success. Now, working with a distributor focused on the a irlines, we are planning to provide more test units for additional airlines. The successful development and 3-month pilot highlights the scalability of our design and engineering capabilities, as well as, our proprietary battery management technology for a broad array of motive power applications. Importantly it also moves us into a customer price point of roughly $20,000 to $25,000 per pack for several power rating alternatives, creating an excellent new leg of growth potential. 

&#160;

&#160;

We design, develop, and sell rechargeable advanced energy storage systems. We have developed an innovative high power battery cell management system (&#8220; BMS&#8221;) and have structured our business around this core technology. Our proprietary BMS provides three critical functions to our battery systems: 

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Cell Balancing : This is performed by continuously adjusting the capacity of each cell in a storage system according to temperature, voltage, and internal impedance metrics. This management assures longevity of the overall system. 

&#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Monitoring : This is performed through temperature probes, a physical connection to individual cells for voltage and calculations from basic metrics to determine remaining capacity and internal impedance. This monitoring assures 

accurate measurements to best manage the system and assure longevity.

&#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#9679;

Error reporting : This is performed by analyzing data from monitoring each individual cell and making decisions on whether the individual cell or the system is operating out of normal specifications. This error reporting is crucial to system management as it ensures ancillary devices are not damaging your storage system and will give the operator an opportunity to take corrective action to maintain long overall system life. 

&#160;

Using our proprietary battery management technology, we are able to offer completely integrated energy storage solutions or custom modular standalone systems to our clients. In addition, we have also developed a suite of complementary technologies and products that accompany and enhance the abilities of our BMS to meet the needs of the growing advanced energy storage market. 

&#160;

Industry Background for the Energy Stor age Market 

&#160;

The energy storage market has grown over recent years from one mostly reliant on lead-acid technologies created in the 1800s to one leveraging advanced chemistries and the corresponding ability to store more energy in less space. Back-up power has increasingly grown to depend on telematics to accurately gauge system health. Electric vehicles have adopted lighter weight energy storage to increase range and payload abilities and grid management applications have sought to increase the cycle life of their systems to assure better returns on their investments over the long term. We believe that all of these needs will cause the advanced energy storage market to grow exponentially over the next five (5) to ten (10) years. 

&#160; 

Lift Equipment - Material Handling Equipment 

&#160;

We currently focus our business on lift equipment. Lift equipment commonly called a forklift truck (also called a lift truck, a fork truck, or a forklift) is a powered industrial truck used to lift and transport materials. The modern f orklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale &#38; Towne Manufacturing. The forklift has since become an indispensable piece of equipment in manufacturing and warehousing operations. Lift equipment is produced in a range of power capacities from smaller lift type equipment such as a Walkie (ie ., pallet jack) to a ride-on forklift. Lift equipment vehicles are not new technology and don&#8217;t require new testing, which can cause delays in product placement. The existing lift equipment market primarily uses lead-acid batteries, which is a legacy technology and can lead to customer dissatisfaction with life cycles, performance, and additional maintenance costs. We believe the replacement of lead-acid batteries with lithium cells dramatically extends run time and the battery system life, lowering the overall cost of ownership to a level which makes lithium very competitive with lead-acid in numerous applications. 

&#160; 

Other Equipment Solutions 

&#160;

We have produced battery packs on an opportunistic basis for applications including robotic mining equipment, portable packs for field operations by the U.S. military, and solar, grid-tie energy storage in an office setting. We currently are building and selling prototypes for airport equipment, commonly called ground support equipment, to power the baggage/cargo trucks. These packs provide much higher levels of power ratings of up to 400 amp hours at 72 volts. Initial customer response indicates our packs to be performing very well with high satisfaction. 

&#160;

&#160; Battery Types 

&#160;

The most common battery technologies currently available to address forklift equipment, electric vehicle and grid management markets include the following: 

&#160; 

Lead-acid Batteries : Lead-acid is one of the most developed battery technologies as it has been in use since the 1800s. It is relatively easy to manufacture and is an inexpensive and ubiquitous energy storage medium. Automobile manufacturers use lead-acid for starter batteries and lead-acid has been used widely in electric vehicle and grid management solutions. Unfortunately, lead-acid batteries weigh more per unit of stored energy and have less power output per unit mass versus advanced energy storage system technologies and thus are not well suited for advanced applications such as grid management devices and electric vehicles. In addition, lead can be hazardous to the environment and there are efforts in many countries to phase this legacy technology out over time. 

&#160;

&#160;

Nickel Batteries : Nickel batteries, NiCd (nickel cadmium) or NiMH (nickel metal hydride) are durable and inexpensive technologies with relatively high power. Unfortunately, cadmium is not a safe material and exposure can result in health hazard to humans and damage to the environment. An alternative to the toxic NiCd battery is NiMH, which has greater energy versus lead-acid batteries and is more suitable to a wider range of applications. The NiMH was used in early electric vehicles and some other bulk storage applications. Unfortunately, these chemistries are not as energy dense as advanced lithium batteries and thus are now being leveraged out of the advanced energy storage system market by more energy dense chemistries. 

&#160;

&#160; Legacy Lithium Chemistries : Lithium batteries are more energy dense versus lead-acid, NiCd or NiMH batteries and are more volumetrically and weight efficient. Introduced in the 1990s, lithium batteries made their way into portable electronics devices like laptop computers and cell phones. Unfortunately, early lithium cobalt was prone to heat issues when arranged in large groups and if a battery cell were compromised a fire or explosion could result. This attribute made early lithium batteries unsuitable for large grid management devices and electric vehicles. The cobalt in these early cells was also a more expensive metal versus the compounds used in modern lithium batteries. 

&#160; 

Advanced Energy Storage Lithium Batteries : The current generation of advanced energy storage lithium batteries was developed in the late 1990s. These new chemistries improve upon energy density, volumetrics and weight metrics. There have also been great enhancements to the safety of these modern lithium batteries. Heat and catastrophic failure issues do not plague advanced energy storage systems today. There has also been a significant increase in modern lithium batteries&#8217; cycle life. This makes today&#8217;s advanced energy storage systems the most conducive to electric vehicle and grid management use. 

&#160; 

Other Technolog ies : Ultra capacitors and fuel cells have been proposed as potential alternatives or replacements to lithium batteries. Ultra capacitors deliver high power and have an extended cycle life but suffer from poor energy density. This makes them suitable for small burst power needs but not for grid storage and electric vehicle devices. Fuel cells generate energy converting a fuel, typically hydrogen to energy. Fuel cell systems offer good energy density but are poor performers in terms of power and cycle life. Fuel cell systems are suitable for devices with small power needs and short life spans but are generally not suitable for use in electric vehicles and grid management devices. 

&#160;

Current Advanced Energy Storage Application Needs 

&#160;

There are a number of featu res required of advanced energy storage applications today, such as: 

&#160; 

Target Application Power : An advanced energy storage system must be able to deliver the electrical power required. Electrical power, measured in watts, is the rate at which electrical energy is delivered. Electric industrial vehicles, in particular, need enough power to assure smooth acceleration through a systems discharge curve and grid management systems need enough power to meet load demands. 

&#160; 

Duration of Charge/Run Times : An advanced energy storage system must be able to provide a certain total amount of electrical energy. Total electrical energy is measured in watt hours and is the product of power and time. Advanced energy storage systems with greater energy can perform for a longer duration when compared to legacy technologies. For example, Lithium ion batteries provide up to 25% longer run times than legacy batteries of comparable capacity, or amps per hour rating. The total electrical energy of an advanced energy storage system determines an electric vehicle&#8217;s range per charge and a grid management device&#8217;s total power. 

&#160; &#160; 

High/Sustained Power : The energy that an advanced energy storage system can provide in total depends on the power requirements of the device in which it is installed. When an advanced energy storage system delivers higher power, the available energy of the advanced energy storage system is less than if it was delivering lower power. Advanced energy storage systems are better suited to deliver high power versus legacy lead-acid. For example, the higher power required to push a vehicle like an electrically propelled boat through the water would be detrimental to legacy power technologies because their lack of ability to operate as efficiently in high power applications. Advanced energy storage systems are able to supply a high power required without detriment to the energy storage system. 

&#160;

Safe Operation : For almost all industrial equipment, electric vehicle and grid management solutions, the safety of an advanced energy storage system is of utmost importance. Legacy lead-acid batteries tend to get hot with heavy operation and the toxic nature of these legacy chemistries can be troublesome in the event of a cell breach. Advanced energy storage systems focus on chemistries that do not violently react with oxygen so a cell breach is less likely to result in an explosion or fire. Lithium iron phosphate is known to be the &#8220;lithium chemistry of choice&#8221; for many large format applications due to its lower cost and greater safety attributes. 

&#160; 

Extended Life : The cycle life of an advanced energy storage system is the total number of times the system can be charged and discharged while still performing to specification in the device installed. Legacy lead-acid technologies often do not perform to specification past a several hundred cycles in industrial equipment applications. In comparison, an advanced energy storage system can last three to five times as long in the same application. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Volumetrics and Weight : The weight and size of advanced energy storage systems are of crucial importance to both portable power and grid management devices. In electric vehicles, where packaging space is precious, a lightweight system can greatly enhance range. In grid management devices that seek to extend current back-up power time benefit from better volumetrics and devices that shift load or peak-shave for improved average energy costs benefit from small advanced energy storage systems that keep connections between cells at a minimum. 

&#160; 

L owest Cost : Advanced energy storage systems provide power dense solutions with extended cycle life which, together, equate to very cost conscious solutions for most applications in the industrial vehicle equipment, portable power, and grid management market segments. We believe that, in our products, advanced energy storage systems can cost much less than legacy lead-acid technologies over the course of device operation. 

&#160;

Our Products and Services 

&#160;

We seek to gain market share in the advanced energy storage segment, with current focus on lift equipment, using our system technologies that extend life, a dd much needed safety mechanisms, and communication and cycle life memory tools. We are focused on cell and system management tools. From our modular 24-volt energy storage solutions to stackable charging, we provide the building blocks to create custom systems designed for a diverse set of applications. Whether it is vehicle or stationary storage systems, we provide capable systems that meet cost and performance targets which we believe, in many cases and based on the life cycle data of the lead-acid batteries provided by the manufacturers; outperform traditional lead-acid technologies on both metrics. Our systems use lithium-ion cells that are denser in energy than traditional lead-acid batteries, which allow our batteries to hold more charge over the same weight. In addition, our BMS protects the lithium-ion batteries enabling the lithium-ion batteries to reach their full life and cycle potential and outlasting lead-acid based batteries which would have to be replaced and thereby adding additional costs over the same time period. Our systems manage individual cells and their charge cycles, which generally allows for more consistent discharge capability and ease of maintenance over an unmanaged battery. Through our BMS, we have enhanced battery systems overall to provide safer, more reliable and extended life rechargeable energy storage systems for applications including motive, marine, industrial, military, stationary, and grid management markets. 

Based on our experience, we believe that, compared to our c ompetitors, our expertise in the large format energy storage market segment is paving the way for lower cost and higher performance solutions. 

&#160;

BMS . Our proprietary BMS product provides three critical functions for battery systems: cell balancing, monitoring parameters and reporting errors to the system. Our BMS monitors parameters and reports errors to other devices, which can then determine the best action to take to prevent failure. Another BMS function is system cell balancing. The BMS will analyze each battery cell in the system during charge and discharge to determine which cells to balance to prevent overcharging and allow the other batteries to catch-up and equalize capacity throughout the system. 

&#160; 

Battery Modules . We supply high-power, energy-dense advanced energy storage modules for the electrical vehicles, industrial, governmental and grid storage applications. Our primary product consists of the Flux Power 24-volt lithium pack and individual 3.2 volt cells in various sizes from 60AH to 900AH. We offer varying chemistries and configurations based on the applications. Our battery modules are designed for our BMS. We currently use Lithium-ion cells, specifically lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4). We are not in the business of developing new battery cell chemistries and are thus &#8220;agnostic&#8221; as to chemistry and can take advantage of new chemistries when available in the market. 

&#160; 

Chargers. Our smart charging solutions are designed to interface with our battery management system. Our smart chargers consist of both air-cooled and liquid-cooled chargers. These modular chargers can be stacked from 3kW - 300kW. 

&#160; 

Application Integration. We are one of the few developers to successfully integrate lithium packs in a variety of applications including industrial equipment to portable energy storage. The technology complexity of lithium requires knowledgeable engineering and testing. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

Customer Concentrations 

&#160; 

We currently sell products directly to our customers, through lift equipment dealers, or through battery distributors. Our direct customers vary from small companies to military integrators. 

&#160;

&#160;

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 201 5, we had three major customers that each represented more than 10% of our revenues on an individual basis, or approximately $341,000 or 47% of our total revenues . 

&#160; 

&#160;

Technology 

&#160;

We believe our cell management and communication tools extend battery system life and improve system performance by managing individual cells in a system, communicating individual cell conditions to ancillary devices, and communicating individual cell con ditions to other devices which either require or supply power. Whether it is vehicle, lift equipment or grid storage systems, we provide capable systems that meet cost and performance targets which we believe, in many cases and based on the life cycle data of the lead-acid batteries provided by the manufacturers; outperform traditional lead-acid technologies on both metrics. Our systems use lithium-ion cells that are denser in energy than traditional lead-acid batteries, which allow our batteries to hold more charge over the same weight. In addition, our BMS protects the lithium-ion batteries enabling the lithium-ion batteries to reach their full life and cycle potential and outlasting lead-acid based batteries which would have to be replaced and thereby adding additional costs over the same time period. Our systems manage individual cells and their charge cycles, which generally allow for more consistent discharge capability and ease of maintenance over an unmanaged battery by:

&#160;

Production process 

&#160;

Except for charger components and battery cells, we design all of our own products in-house and outsource manufacturing and assembly when possible.

&#160; 

Batteries. Since our battery management system and battery modules are not tied to any specific lithium-ion battery chemistry, we can source our batteries from a variety of manufacturers to meet our needs as well as our customer&#8217;s needs. During this past year, we have sourced our batteries from several suppliers, all having manufacturing operations in China, with some having wholesale warehouses in the United States. 

&#160;

Battery Modules and Packs . We design all of our battery modules and packs in-house. In addition, we occasionally design and assemble prototype battery packs and storage systems for our customers. 

&#160; 

Chargers. We currently buy chargers from several sources, all of whom are U.S. based suppliers. 

&#160;

BMS. We design our BMS modules/boards and have two granted patents. We source manufacturing of the boards to two local board houses. We are currently developing further technology enhancements to this BMS technology, including the use of more efficient board components. 

&#160;

In-House Product Assembly: 

&#160; 

BMS units, Chargers and CAN Current Sensors : Units are outsourced, programmed and tested at our facility before shipping. 

&#160;

24-volt Modules : We receive completed 24-volt module cases and lids. Cells are packed in the module cases, connected to BMS, and secured in place. Lids with BMS installed are programmed and calibrated. Each full unit is sealed and tested before shipping. 

&#160;

Volume sales will enable cost reductions by: 

&#160;

Manufacturability Optimization : We are currently building products to be as robust and full-featured as possible to meet initial demand that typically reflects smaller quantity needs. With investment in design, these premium components hopefully can be value-engineered with the goal to continue to offer full-featured devices at less than 50% of the cost. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Low Cost Version Designs : We will have a growing number of clients that do not need full-featured devices to make their products perform well. With working capital, we believe that we can design low cost options for customers which can be marketed at a deeper discount to our current full-featured products. 

&#160;

Advanced Manufacturing Capabilities : We are currently seeking out advanced manufacturing relationships to further enhance our abilities. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160;

We obtain a limited number of components and supplies included in our products from a small group of suppliers. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 we had three suppliers who accounted for more than 10% of our total purchases, on an individual basis. Purchases for these three suppliers totaled $793,000 for a total of 66% of our total purchases. 

&#160;

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 201 5, we had three suppliers who accounted for more than 10% of our total purchases, on an individual basis. Purchases for these three suppliers totaled $528,000, for a total of 66% of our total purchases. 

&#160;

In the past we have sourced Lithium batteries from a number of suppliers. We continuously assess our battery sourcing to improve consistency, responsiveness, and quality. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $1,296,000 and $655,000, respectively. Such expenses consist primarily of materials, supplies, salaries and personnel related expenses, stock-based compensation expense, consulting costs and other expenses. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increase in personnel costs and benefits, and material and labor costs associated with the project to obtain UL listing for our LiFT Packs, as well as, costs associated with the development and testing of a prototype battery pack for ground support equipment in partnership with a domestic airline. We currently perform our research and development at our facility in Vista, California. We seek to develop innovative new and improved products for cell and system management along with associated communication, display, current sensing and charging tools. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

Our competitors in the lift equipment sector are primarily major lead acid battery manufacturers, including, but not limited to: GNB, Hawker, Deka, Enersys, Crown Battery, Douglas and Interstate. We are not aware that these suppliers currently offer lithium-based products for lift equipment in any significant volume to end users, equipment dealers, OEMs or battery distributors. There are several new lithium products being introduced to the lift equipment sector, in apparent small volume, by several manufacturers who do not have ties to the major battery companies or OEM lift equipment manufacturers. 

&#160;

We believe that we have several technological and business advantages over our competitors, which will lead to our success in the advanced energy storage market. Our concentration on cell and sys tem management tools has allowed us to compete with a much lower capitalization structure. Further, since our BMS are not based on any specific cell chemistries, we can source cells from different manufacturers based on the performance needs and cost. This flexibility in cell sourcing allows us to provide complete storage systems at much lower cost versus our current competition. We are also differentiated by the ability to integrate battery packs successfully into a variety of applications. 

&#160;

Our UL Listing, received in January 2016, demonstrates the quality, safety and reliability of our LiFT Pack line for customers, distributors, dealers and OEM partners. We believe we have emerged from this effort with a substantially enhanced product line, particularly in the areas of overall design and durability, as well as, features that improve our LiFT Packs&#8217; value and performance for customers. Our LiFT Packs are now the first and only UL Listed lithium-ion batteries available. 

&#160; &#160; 

Our market ing and sales strategy is to actively pursue the following market segments: 

&#160;

Lift Equipment - Material Handling Equipment: The advantage of the lift equipment market is that it is an indispensable piece of equipment in manufacturing and warehousing operations. Lift equipment vehicles are not new technology and don&#8217;t require new testing which can cause delays in product placement. The existing lift equipment market uses lead-acid batteries, which is outdated technology and can lead to customer dissatisfaction with life cycles, performance, and additional maintenance costs. The replacement of lead-acid batteries with lithium cells dramatically extends the battery system life, lowering the overall cost of ownership to a level which makes lithium competitive with lead-acid in numerous applications. We believe with marketing efforts we will be able to reach larger target markets. 

&#160;

&#160;

Ground Support Equipment : Our products&#8217; telematics, modularity, longevity and low cost solutions fit with airport equipment solutions, commonly known as ground support equipment, operated by all airlines to transport baggage and related cargo. These applications are well suited to our modular and scalable pack designs and benefit from our pack innovation derived from LiFT Packs and the related harsh environments. We have conducted successful pilot programs and plan to continue introduction of these packs to a variety of customers, with expectations of significant revenue opportunity in the coming year. 

&#160; 

Military (Defense) and Municipal : Our products&#8217; longevity, easy integration and telematics make it a fit for energy storage applications for both the military and municipal markets. Although these markets have longer integration timelines, we believe they represent potentially significant additions to our revenue mix in future periods.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core te chnology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents pending, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. In addition to such factors as innovation, technological expertise and experienced personnel, we believe that a strong patent position is important to remain competitive. 

&#160;

We have developed our intellectual property portfolio through our continued investment in research and development, and through our acquisition of technologies from Epic Boats (an entity founded and controlled by Chris Anthony, our Chairman of the Board and former chief executive officer), Gottlieb Inventions, and Joseph Gottlieb. 

&#160;

In connection with our BMS, we are actively pursuing patent applications relating to determining battery life and remaining battery life cycles. Several patent applications relating to these inventions have been approved and others will be filed with the U.S. Patent &#38; Trademark Office. We are developing a certain number of BMS related patents. In addition, we have a number of trademark applications and registrations protecting the Flux Power name and logo. These include Flux, Flux Power, and the Flux Power logo. 

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, we have 5 patent applications pending with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, with two patents approved and issued. In addition, we intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology and to seek protection of our intellectual property internationally in a broad range of areas. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection. 

&#160;

Government Regula tions 

&#160; 

Product Safety Regulations . Our products are subject to product safety regulations by Federal, state, and local organizations. Accordingly, we may be required, or may voluntarily determine to obtain approval of our products from one or more of the organizations engaged in regulating product safety. These approvals could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and, if redesign were necessary, could result in a delay in the introduction of our products in various markets and applications. 

Environmental Regulations . Federal, state, and local regulations impose significant environmental requirements on the manufacture, storage, transportation, and disposal of various components of advanced energy storage systems. Although we believe that our operations are in material compliance with current applicable environmental regulations, there can be no assurance that changes in such laws and regulations will not impose costly compliance requirements on us or otherwise subject us to future liabilities. 

&#160;

Moreover, Federal, state, and local governments may enact additional regulations relating to the manufacture, storage, transportation, and disposal of components of advanced energy storage systems. Compliance with such additional regulati ons could require us to devote significant time and resources and could adversely affect demand for our products. There can be no assurance that additional or modified regulations relating to the manufacture, storage, transportation, and disposal of components of advanced energy systems will not be imposed. 

&#160;

Occupational Safety and Health Regulations . The California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (&#8220;Cal/OSHA&#8221;) and other regulatory agencies have jurisdiction over the operations of our Vista, California facility. Because of the risks generally associated with the assembly of advanced energy storage systems we expect rigorous enforcement of applicable health and safety regulations. Frequent audits by or changes, in the regulations issued by Cal/OSHA, or other regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over our operations, may cause unforeseen delays and require significant time and resources from our technical staff. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, we have twenty-eight (28) employees, of which twenty-six (26) are full-time and two (2) are part-time. We engage outside consultants for business development and operations or other functions from time to time. None of our employees are currently represented by a trade union.
