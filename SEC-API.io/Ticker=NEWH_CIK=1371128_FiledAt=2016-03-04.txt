 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. &#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are engaged in the development of innovative technologies and materials that we believe will reduce the cost per watt of electricity generated by Photovoltaic solar modules and the cost per watt of storing electrical energy. 

&#160; 

The process for producing electricity from sunlight is known as Photovoltaics. Photovoltaic is the science of capturing and converting sun light into electricity. We have developed BioBacksheet R , a high performance environment friendly back sheet for Photovoltaic solar panels. BioBacksheet R is a bottom most layer of the conventional photovoltaic panels that provides electrical insulation, protection from the environment, and an increase in the panel output. 

&#160; 

We are currently developing technologies and materials for storing electrical energy. We are focusing our research and product development efforts on low cost polymer-based components for supercapacitors and batteries that provide substantially higher capacity and lower cost compared to existing electrical storage devices. 

&#160; 

Industry Overview 

&#160; 

The solar industry relies on two distinctly different solar energy technologies. Solar energy can be converted directly into electricity using photovoltaic devices or into heat by solar thermal devices. Photovoltaic devices convert sunlight directly into electricity through a photovoltaic cell, commonly called a solar cell, a non-mechanical device usually made from silicon alloys. Solar thermal devices, on the other hand, are typically used for directly heating swimming pools, heating water for domestic use, and space heating of buildings. 

&#160; 

Our product development focus has been based on photovoltaic technology, thus we are currently a part of the photovoltaic segment of the industry. &#34;Photovoltaics&#34; is derived from the words photo, meaning light, and voltaic, meaning voltage producing. Sunlight, not heat, fuels photovoltaic cells. The cells, made mostly of the semiconductor silicon, convert sunlight directly into electricity. 

&#160; 

There remains a variety of techniques for manufacturing the coatings needed to create solar cells. Emerging thin film cell manufacturing holds much promise because the coatings use less silicon than traditional films and can be manufactured at low cost and in large volume. 

&#160; 

The simplest cells power watches and calculators; more complex systems provide power to the electric grid, and provide electricity to pump water, power communications equipment, light homes and run appliances. 

&#160; 

In photovoltaics, light particles called photons penetrate the cell and knock electrons free from the silicon atoms, creating an electric current. As long as light flows into the cell, electrons flow out of the cell. The cell does not use up its electrons and lose power, similar to a battery, as it is a converter that turns one kind of energy (sun light) into another (flowing electrons). 

&#160; 

Photovoltaic cells are typically combined into modules that hold about 40 cells. Ten such modules are mounted in photovoltaic arrays. Such arrays can be used to generate electricity for a single building or, in large numbers, for a power plant. 

&#160; 

Companies are manufacturing solar panels that look like construction materials, such as roof shingles. It is also possible to produce windows that have solar cells integrally constructed as part of the window surface or by placing thin films on the window. Photovoltaic technology can be combined with construction materials and be built into a building rather than added on top of a building. In such building-integrated photovoltaics, photovoltaic systems are incorporated into or become elements of a building's structure. 

&#160; 

Stand-alone photovoltaic systems produce power independently of the utility grid. In some off-the-grid locations, even one half kilometer from power lines, stand-alone photovoltaic systems can be more cost effective than extending power lines. They are especially appropriate for remote, environmentally sensitive areas, such as national parks, cabins, and remote homes. In rural areas, small stand-alone solar arrays often power farm lighting, fence chargers for electric fences, and solar water pumps, which provide water for livestock. Some hybrid systems combine solar power with other power sources such as wind or diesel. 

&#160; 

According to the 2013 edition of NPD Solarbuzz Marketbuzz, the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry is predicted to experience rapid growth over the following five years, with up to 100 gigawatts (GW) of annual installations, growing to $50 billion per year of PV module revenue by 2018. With all of these solar panels being installed, there is still one major challenge that prevents solar from being a primary and reliable source of power &#8211; the sun does not shine at night. As a result, solar users will switch to using electricity from the local power company during the evening hours. This switch causes sudden spikes in power demand on the grid and creates havoc at the local power company because the grid is not designed to respond to rapid demand changes. The key to solving this problem is efficient solar energy storage systems that can be charged and discharged rapidly, day in and day out. This will time-shift daytime solar energy for nighttime use with minimal reliance on the power grid.

&#160; 

According to a 2015 report by Solar Energy Industries Association, the demand for rooftop solar paired with energy storage systems will reach $1 billion in the U.S. by 2020, and will create pent up demand for cost effective solar energy storage solutions. Pairing solar panels with batteries means users can store power during the day and use it at night, reducing electricity bills. Those savings can be more significant for customers who pay higher rates for electricity during peak periods. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We have developed robust bio-based components that meet the stringent thermal and durability requirements of current solar module manufacturing processes. Our strategy was to identify those bio-based materials that are inherently durable, then apply proprietary material processes to enhance the desirable characteristics of these bio-based materials &#8211; turning them into robust and durable materials to be used as solar panel components. Based on long term environmental testing performed by the Company, we believe our BioBacksheet R is more durable than conventional petroleum based back sheets available in the market today. 

&#160; 

We developed multiple versions of our bio-based back sheet, and the latest version of the mono-layer BioBacksheet R successfully obtained Underwriters Laboratories&#8217; (UL) material certification in February 2011. This version of BioSolar Backsheet (BioBacksheet R ) is designed for conventional c-Si solar modules, which currently represents over 75 percent of solar modules produced in the world, as well as for certain thin film solar modules. The relative thermal index (RTI) rating of 130 degree C by UL was issued during the 3nd quarter of 2012, and a number of solar panel manufacturers have been able to obtain certifications on their panels incorporating BioBacksheet for UL/IEC, a required step before considering mass production. These back sheets are available in rolls of film for direct use in lamination and roll-to-roll assembly systems. 

&#160; 

We use Nylon 11 in our BioBacksheet. Nylon 11 is derived from castor bean oil. &#160; Our current supplier of this product is Arkema, Inc. (&#8220;Arkema&#8221;). We do not currently have an agreement with Arkema for the supply of Nylon 11 and there is currently no other known supplier of Nylon 11. If we are unable to obtain Nylon 11 for our products, we will seek alternative options, which may include Nylon 1010 or Nylon 12 for which there are many known suppliers. 

&#160; 

Since solar energy is only available during the day and naturally sporadic because of weather and cloud conditions, a large capacity and fast charge-discharge energy storage system is needed to quickly store the energy of the sun so that it can be used anytime &#8211; day or night. Therefore, solar energy storage systems need battery banks with high specific energy (Wh/Kg) to store as much energy as possible without increased size. At the same time, the systems need to provide high specific power (mAh/g) for fast charge to harvest as much energy as possible when the sunlight is available. Most importantly, the system should be able to handle large number of charge-discharge cycles possible before requiring battery replacement. 

&#160; 

We are currently developing low cost polymer-based components for supercapacitors and batteries that will provide substantially higher storage capacity at lower cost than currently available electrical energy storage devices. A battery contains two major parts, a cathode and an anode, that function together as the positive and negative sides. Today's state-of-the-art lithium-ion battery is limited by the storage capacity of its cathode, while the anode can store much more. Additionally, the materials used in batteries are still quite expensive.Based on our patent-pending supercapacitor technology that uses a novel conductive polymer material, we are developing a high capacity Super Cathode for use by battery manufacturers to create the ultimate high capacity, low cost lithium-ion battery. Our novel high capacity cathode is engineered from a polymer, similar to that of low-cost plastics used for household purposes. Through a smart chemical design, we are able to make the polymer hold an enormous amount of electrons. Instead of conventional cathodes that use lithium-ion intercalation chemistry, which is inherently slow, we exploit the fast redox-reaction properties of our polymer to enable rapid charge and discharge. 

&#160; 

Most lithium-ion batteries cannot retain more than 80% of its storage capacity after 1,000 charge-discharge cycles. The stable redox chemistry of our cathode material can enable much longer life. Our laboratory experiments have shown that our cathode can easily cycle over 50,000 times without degradation in supercapacitors, and we believe that it can be very effective in batteries as well. By enabling higher charge-discharge cycles, we can extend the life of lithium-ion batteries and further reduce the total cost of ownership. In certain applications such as off-grid solar energy storage where the batteries are fully charged and discharged daily, it is not cost-effective to use current lithium-ion batteries due to short replacement life. 

&#160; 

In June 2015, we filed a joint patent application with the University of California, Santa Barbara (&#8220;UCSB&#8221;)for a supercapacitor technology and are currently funding a sponsored research program to further its development. This invention forms the basis for our Super Battery technology. 

&#160; 

The lead inventors of the technology are UCSB professor Dr. Alan Heeger, the recipient of a Nobel Prize in 2000 for the discovery and development of conductive polymers, and Dr. David Vonlanthen, a post-doctoral researcher at UCSB. 

&#160;
