Our History 

We were incorporated in Delaware in 2001 as the successor to Medical Assurance, Inc. in conjunction with its merger with Professionals Group, Inc. ProAssurance has a history of growth through acquisitions. Acquisitions completed in the most recent five years include: 

&#8226; 

Independent Nevada Doctors Insurance Exchange, acquired November 30, 2012, 

&#8226; 

Medmarc Mutual Insurance Company and subsidiaries, acquired January 1, 2013, and 

&#8226; 

Eastern Insurance Holdings, Inc., acquired January 1, 2014. 

We provided the majority of the capital for Syndicate 1729 in November 2013, and Syndicate 1729 began active operations effective January 1, 2014. 

Our Strategy 

Our business objectives are to generate attractive returns on equity and book value per share growth for our shareholders. The basic components of our strategy for achieving these objectives are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Serve a broad spectrum of the healthcare market, providing specialized expertise to meet evolving demands . In addition to providing traditional products to healthcare providers in a number of professions, we are also leveraging our reach, expertise and financial strength to provide innovative and customized products to meet the risk management needs of larger organizations or groups. 

&#8226; 

Effectively manage capital. &#32;We carefully monitor use of our capital and consider various options for capital deployment, such as business expansion by our existing subsidiaries, opportunities that arise for mergers or acquisitions, share repurchases and payment of dividends. 

&#8226; 

Pursue profitable underwriting opportunities. &#32;We emphasize profitability, not market share. Key elements of our approach are prudent risk selection using established underwriting guidelines, appropriate pricing and adjusting our business mix as appropriate to effectively utilize capital and achieve market synergies. 

&#8226; 

Emphasize risk management. We seek to reduce risk at the corporate level by actively managing our enterprise risk and by maintaining strong internal controls. We also emphasize the importance of risk management to our insureds and offer training in the use of risk reduction tools and techniques. 

&#8226; 

Manage claims effectively. &#32;Our experienced claims teams have industry and insurance expertise that, with our extensive local knowledge, allows us to resolve claims in an effective manner, considering the circumstances of each claim. When practical, we utilize formalized claims management processes and protocols as a means of reducing claim costs. 

&#8226; 

Provide superior customer service. &#32;Our mission statement, We Exist to Protect Others, goes hand-in-hand with our corporate motto, "Treated Fairly." Our employees demonstrate our core values of integrity, relationships, leadership and enthusiasm every day and are focused on meeting the needs of our customers. 

&#8226; 

Maintain a conservative investment strategy. &#32;We believe that we follow a conservative investment strategy designed to emphasize the preservation of our capital and provide adequate liquidity for the prompt payment of claims. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of investment-grade, fixed-maturity securities of short-to medium-term duration. 

&#8226; 

Maintain financial stability . We are committed to maintaining claims paying ratings of "A" or better.

Prior to the acquisition of Eastern on January 1, 2014 we did not write significant amounts of workers' compensation premium. 

(3) 

Our written premium includes our 58% share of premiums written by Syndicate 1729 , including casualty premium assumed by Syndicate 1729 &#32;from our Specialty P&#38;C &#32;segment. We eliminate this inter-segment revenue. 

&#32;Additional detailed information regarding premium by individual product type within each of our insurance segments is provided in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis, Results of Operations, under the heading "Premiums Written." 

Our insurance exposures are primarily within the United States. As a result of our participation in Syndicate 1729 , we had net written premium of $4.7 million &#32;in 2015 &#32;and $1.9 million &#32;in 2014 &#32;associated with insurance exposures outside of the United States. In 2013, our non-United States exposure was nominal. 

Specialty Property and Casualty Segment 

Professional Liability Insurance 

Our professional liability business is primarily focused on providing professional liability insurance to healthcare providers. We target the full spectrum of the HCPL &#32;market, covering multiple categories of healthcare professionals and healthcare entities, including hospitals and other healthcare facilities. While most of our business is written in the standard market, we also offer professional liability insurance on an excess and surplus lines basis, and we offer alternative risk and self-insurance products on a custom basis. 

We utilize independent agencies and brokers as well as an internal sales force to write our HCPL &#32;business. For the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;approximately 63% &#32;of our HCPL &#32;gross premiums written were produced through independent insurance agencies or brokers. The agencies and brokers we use typically sell through professional liability insurance specialists who are able to convey the factors that differentiate our professional liability insurance products. In 2015 , our ten largest agencies, brokers or brokerage agencies produced approximately 26% &#32;of our healthcare related professional liability premium; individually, no one agency produced more than 10% &#32;of our healthcare related professional liability premium. 

In marketing our professional liability products we emphasize our financial strength, product flexibility, excellent claims and underwriting services, and risk resource services. We market our insurance products through our direct sales force and through our agents, as well as direct mailings, and advertising in industry-related publications. We also are involved in professional societies and related organizations and support legislation that will have a positive effect on healthcare and legal liability issues. We maintain regional underwriting centers which permit us to consistently provide a high level of customer service to both small and large accounts. 

We maintain claim processing centers where our internal claims personnel investigate and monitor the processing of our professional liability claims. We engage experienced, independent litigation attorneys in each venue to assist with the claims process as we believe this practice aids us in providing a defense that is aggressive, effective and cost-efficient. We evaluate the merit of each claim and determine the appropriate strategy for resolution of the claim, either seeking a reasonable good faith settlement appropriate for the circumstances of the claim or aggressively defending the claim. As part of the evaluation and preparation process for HCPL &#32;claims, we meet regularly with medical advisory committees in our key markets to examine claims, attempt to identify potentially troubling practice patterns and make recommendations to our staff. 

We also provide professional liability coverage to attorneys, but this is a less significant portion of our business, accounting for approximately 3% &#32;of our 2015 &#32;gross premiums written. We are licensed to do business in every state. 

Medical Technology and Life Sciences Insurance 

Our Medical Technology and Life Sciences business offers medical technology liability insurance for medical technology and life sciences companies that manufacture or distribute products that are almost all regulated by the United States Food and Drug Administration or similar regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions. Products insured include imaging and non-invasive diagnostic medical devices, orthopedic implants, pharmaceuticals, clinical lab instruments, medical instruments, dental products, and animal pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We also provide coverage for clinical trials and contract manufacturers. 

Underwriting decisions for our medical technology liability coverages consider the type of risk, the amount of coverage being sought, the expertise and experience of the applicant, and the expected volume of product sales. Close to 100% of our medical technology liability business is written through independent brokers. In 2015 , our top ten brokers generated approximately 44% &#32;of our medical technology and life sciences gross written premium, with no one agent representing more than 13% . We do not appoint agents for our medical technology liability business. 

Our medical technology liability claims are centrally processed in Chantilly, Virginia. We strongly defend these claims, with a negotiated settlement being the most frequent means of resolution. 

Workers' Compensation Segment 

Effective January 1, 2014, ProAssurance acquired Eastern, which offers workers' compensation products in the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, Midwest, and Gulf South regions of the continental United States. Our workers' compensation business consists of two major business activities: 

&#8226; 

Traditional workers' compensation insurance coverages provided to employers, generally those with 1,000 employees or less. Types of policies offered include guaranteed cost policies, policyholder dividend policies, retrospectively-rated policies, and deductible policies. 

&#8226; 

Alternative market workers&#8217; compensation solutions provided to individual companies, groups and associations whereby the premium written is 100% ceded to Eastern Re or an unaffiliated captive insurer. Of our total alternative market premiums written, approximately 89% &#32;in both 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;was ceded to SPC s operated 

through Eastern Re , our subsidiary domiciled in the Cayman Islands. Each SPC &#32;is owned, fully or in part, by an agency, group or association, hereafter referred to as cell participants. The SPC &#32;is operated solely for the benefit of cell participants of that particular cell, and the pool of assets of one segregated portfolio cell are statutorily protected from the creditors of any other SPC . The underwriting results and investment income of the segregated portfolio cells are shared with the cell participants in accordance with the terms of the cell agreements. We are a partial owner in selected SPC s and receive a share of the earnings of these SPC s. We generally hold a 50% participation, but we have ownership interests as low as 25% and as high as 82.5%. 

All of our workers' compensation products are distributed through a group of appointed independent agents. 

We utilize an individual account underwriting strategy for our workers' compensation business that is focused on selecting quality accounts. The goal of our workers&#8217; compensation underwriters is to select a diverse book of business with respect to risk classification, hazard level and geographic location. We target accounts with strong return to work and safety programs in low to middle hazard levels such as clerical office, light manufacturing, healthcare, auto dealers and service industries and maintain a strong risk management unit in order to better serve our customers' needs. 

We actively seek to reduce our workers' compensation loss costs by placing a concentrated focus on returning injured workers to work as quickly as possible. We emphasize early intervention and aggressive disability management, utilizing in-house and third-party specialists for case management, including medical cost management. Strategic vendor relationships have been established to reduce medical claim costs and include preferred provider, physical therapy, prescription drug, and catastrophic medical services. 

Lloyd's Syndicate Segment 

We are the majority ( 58% ) capital provider to Syndicate 1729 , which began writing business as of January 1, 2014. The remaining capital for Syndicate 1729 &#32;is provided by unrelated third parties, including private names and other corporate members. We have a total capital commitment to support Syndicate 1729 &#32;through 2019 of up to $200 million . For the 2016 &#32;underwriting year, we satisfied our capital commitment with investment securities deposited with Lloyd's which at December 31, 2015 &#32;had a fair value of approximately $95.8 million . Syndicate 1729 &#32;covers a range of property and casualty insurance and reinsurance lines, primarily for risks within the United States, and has a maximum underwriting capacity of &#163;90.0 million &#32;(approximately $132.6 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 ) for the 2016 &#32;underwriting year, of which &#163;51.8 million &#32;(approximately $76.3 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 ) is our allocated underwriting capacity as a corporate member. 

Corporate Segment 

We manage our investments at the corporate level and we apply a consistent management strategy to the entire portfolio. Accordingly, we report our investment results and net realized investment gains and losses within our corporate segment. Our corporate segment also includes non-premium revenues generated outside of our insurance entities, and corporate expenses, including interest expense and U.S. income taxes. Our overall investment strategy is to maximize current income from our investment portfolio while maintaining safety, liquidity, duration targets and portfolio diversification. The portfolio is generally managed by professional third party asset managers whose results we monitor and evaluate. The asset managers typically have the authority to make investment decisions within the asset classes they are responsible for managing, subject to our investment policy and oversight, including a requirement that securities in a loss position cannot be sold without specific authorization from us. See Note 4 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our investments. 

Competition 

The marketplace for all our lines of business is very competitive. Within the U.S. our competitors are primarily domestic and range from large national insurers whose financial strength and resources may be greater than ours to smaller insurance entities that concentrate on a single state and as a result have an extensive knowledge of the local markets. Additionally, there are many providers, domestic and international, of alternative risk management solutions. Syndicate 1729, which is based in the U.K. , faces significant competition from other Lloyd's syndicates as well as other international and domestic insurance firms operating in the country of the insured. Competitive distinctions include pricing, size, name recognition, service quality, market commitment, market conditions, breadth and flexibility of coverage, method of sale, financial stability, ratings assigned by rating agencies and regulatory conditions. 

The changing healthcare environment within the U.S. during the past few years is providing both increased competitive challenges and opportunities for our largest segment, the Specialty P&#38; C segment. Many physicians now practice as employees of larger healthcare entities. Further, healthcare services are increasingly being provided by professionals other than physicians and outside of a traditional hospital or clinic setting. Such trends are widely expected to continue. Larger healthcare entities have differing customer service and risk management needs than the traditional solo or small physician groups. Larger entities are more likely to combine risks such as workers' compensation and professional liability when purchasing insurance and are also more likely to manage all or a part of their risk through alternative insurance mechanisms. We have addressed these issues 

by enhancing our existing hospital/physician insurance programs, expanding our coverage of healthcare providers other than physician or hospitals, expanding our coverages to include workers' compensation and product liability, and by enhancing our customer service capabilities, particularly with regard to the needs of larger accounts. We have also increased our focus on offering unique, joint or cooperative insurance programs that are attractive to larger healthcare entities. 

The workers&#8217; compensation industry is highly competitive in the geographic markets in which we operate. Price competition, including the leveraging of workers&#8217; compensation business by multi-line insurers, has adversely impacted our renewal retention rate during 2015, and we expect the price competition to continue in 2016. We believe our product offerings allow us to provide flexibility in offering workers&#8217; compensation solutions to our customers at a competitive price. In addition, we believe that our claims handling and risk management services provide us with a competitive advantage that is attractive to our customers even when our pricing is higher than our competitors. 

We recognize the importance of providing our products at competitive rates, but we do not underwrite at rates that will not permit us to meet our profit targets. We base our rates on current loss projections, maintaining a long-term focus even when this approach reduces our top line growth. We believe that our size, reputation for effective claims management, unique customer service focus, multi-state presence, and broad spectrum of coverages offered provides us with competitive advantages, even as the needs of our insureds change. 

Rating Agencies 

Our claims paying ability is regularly evaluated and rated by three major rating agencies: A.M. Best, Fitch and Moody&#8217;s. In developing their claims paying ratings, these agencies make an independent evaluation of an insurer&#8217;s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. See "Risk Factors" for a table presenting the claims paying ratings of our principal insurance operations. 

Three &#32;rating agencies evaluate and rate our ability to service current debt and potential debt. These financial strength ratings reflect each agency&#8217;s independent evaluation of our ability to meet our obligation to holders of our debt, if any. While financial strength ratings may be of greater interest to investors than our claims paying ratings, these ratings are not evaluations of our equity securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell our equity securities. 

Insurance Regulatory Matters 

We are subject to regulation under the insurance and insurance holding company statutes of various jurisdictions, including the domiciliary states of our insurance subsidiaries and other states in which our insurance subsidiaries do business. Our insurance subsidiaries are primarily domiciled in the United States. Our states of domicile include Alabama, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Vermont. We have reinsurance operations based in the Cayman Islands, a territory of the U.K. , and, through our participation in Syndicate 1729, U.K. &#32;based insurance and reinsurance operations. 

United States 

Our insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual statements in their states of domicile and with the state insurance regulators in each of the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish agencies with broad authority to regulate, among other things, licenses to transact business, premium rates for certain types of coverage, trade practices, agent licensing, policy forms, underwriting and claims practices, reserve adequacy, transactions with affiliates, and insurer solvency. Such regulations may hamper our ability to meet operating or profitability goals, including preventing us from establishing premium rates for some classes of insureds that adequately reflects the level of risk assumed for those classes. Many states also regulate investment activities on the basis of quality, distribution and other quantitative criteria. States have also enacted legislation, typically based in whole or in part on NAIC model laws, which regulates insurance holding company systems, including acquisitions, the payment of dividends, the terms of affiliate transactions, enterprise risk and solvency management, and other related matters. 

Applicable state insurance laws, rather than federal bankruptcy laws, apply to the liquidation or reorganization of insurance companies. 

Insurance companies are also subject to state and federal legislative and regulatory measures and judicial decisions. These could include new or updated definitions of risk exposure and limitations on business practices. 

Insurance Regulation Concerning Change or Acquisition of Control 

The insurance regulatory codes in each of the domiciliary states of our operating subsidiaries contain provisions (subject to certain variations) to the effect that the acquisition of &#8220;control&#8221; of a domestic insurer or of any person that directly or indirectly controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the domiciliary insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of &#8220;control&#8221; arises from the direct or indirect ownership, control or possession with the power to vote or possession of proxies with respect to 10% (5% in Alabama) or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurer or of a person that controls a domestic insurer. Because of these regulatory requirements, any party seeking to acquire control of ProAssurance or any other domestic insurance company, whether directly or indirectly, would usually be required to obtain such approvals. 

In addition, certain state insurance laws contain provisions that require pre-acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control of a non-domestic insurance company admitted in that state. While such pre-acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease and desist order with respect to the non-domestic admitted insurers doing business in the state if certain conditions exist, such as undue market concentration. 

Statutory Accounting and Reporting 

Insurance companies are required to file detailed quarterly and annual reports with state insurance regulators in their state of domicile and each of the states in which they do business; and their business and accounts are subject to examination by such regulators at any time. The financial information in these reports is prepared in accordance with SAP . Insurance regulators periodically examine each insurer&#8217;s adherence to SAP , financial condition, and compliance with insurance department rules and regulations. 

Regulation of Dividends and Other Payments from Our Operating Subsidiaries 

Our operating subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions that limit the amount of dividends or distributions an insurance company may pay to its shareholders, including our insurance holding company, without prior regulatory approval. Generally, dividends may be paid only out of unassigned earned surplus. In every case, surplus subsequent to the payment of any dividends must be reasonable in relation to an insurance company&#8217;s outstanding liabilities and must be adequate to meet its financial needs. 

State insurance holding company regulations generally require domestic insurers to obtain prior approval of extraordinary dividends. Insurance holding company regulations that govern our principal operating subsidiaries deem a dividend as extraordinary if the combined dividends and distributions to the parent holding company in any twelve-month period exceed prescribed thresholds. Such thresholds are statutorily prescribed by the state of domicile and currently are based on either net income for the prior fiscal year (reduced by realized capital gains in certain domiciliary states) or a percentage of unassigned surplus at the end of the prior fiscal year, depending upon the wording of the statute. 

If insurance regulators determine that payment of a dividend or any other payments within a holding company group, (such as payments under a tax-sharing agreement or payments for employee or other services) would, because of the financial condition of the paying insurance company or otherwise, be a detriment to such insurance company&#8217;s policyholders, the regulators may prohibit such payments that would otherwise be permitted. 

Risk-Based Capital and Risk Assessment 

In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the NAIC &#32;specifies risk-based capital requirements for property and casualty insurance companies. At December 31, 2015 , all of ProAssurance&#8217;s insurance subsidiaries substantially exceeded the minimum required risk-based capital levels. 

In late 2010, the NAIC &#32;adopted the Model Holding Co. Law . The Model Holding Co. Law , as compared to previous NAIC &#32;guidance, increases regulatory oversight of and reporting by insurance holding companies, including reporting related to non-insurance entities, and requires reporting of risks affecting the holding company group. Additionally, in 2012 the NAIC &#32;adopted ORSA , which requires insurers to maintain a framework for identifying, assessing, monitoring, managing and reporting on the &#8220;material and relevant risks&#8221; associated with the insurer's (or insurance group's) current and future business plans. ORSA &#32;requires larger insurers, generally those with annual written premium volume greater than $1.0 billion as a group or $500 million as an individual insurer, to file an internal assessment of solvency with insurance regulators annually beginning in 2015. Although no specific capital adequacy standard is currently articulated in ORSA , it is possible that such standard will be developed over time. The Model Holding Co. Law &#32;and ORSA &#32;will be binding only if adopted by state legislatures and/or state insurance regulatory authorities and actual regulations adopted by any state may differ from that adopted by the NAIC. As of December 31, 2015, the Model Holding Co. Law &#32;and ORSA &#32;have been adopted by 34 &#32;states. ProAssurance did not meet ORSA &#32;filing criteria in 2015. 

Also, the NAIC &#32;subsequently revised the Model Holding Co. Law &#32;to include provisions which allow regulatory supervision of the holding company group through supervisory colleges and which require reporting of risk and solvency assessments for the group. Certain states in which the Company operates adopted these revisions early and the Company began filing its risk and solvency assessment in 2014. 

Investment Regulation 

Our operating subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of investment portfolios and that limit the amount of investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, would require divestiture of investments. We monitor the practices used by our operating subsidiaries for compliance with applicable state investment regulations and take corrective measures when deficiencies are identified. 

Guaranty Funds 

Admitted insurance companies are required to be members of guaranty associations which administer state guaranty funds. To fund the payment of claims (up to prescribed limits) against insurance companies that become insolvent, these associations levy assessments on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the covered lines of business in that state. Maximum assessments permitted by law in any one year generally vary between 1% &#32;and 2% &#32;of annual premiums written by a member in that state, although state regulations may permit larger assessments if insolvency losses reach specified levels. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through surcharges on policyholders or through full or partial premium tax offsets, while other states permit recovery of assessments through the rate filing process. In recent years, participation in guaranty funds has not had a material effect on our results of operations. 

Shared Markets 

State insurance regulations may force us to participate in mandatory property and casualty shared market mechanisms or pooling arrangements that provide certain insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverage in the commercial insurance marketplace. Our operating subsidiaries&#8217; participation in such shared markets or pooling mechanisms is not material to our business at this time. 

Federal Regulation 

Tort reform proposals are considered from time to time at the Federal level. Passage of a Federal tort reform package would likely be subject to judicial challenge and we cannot be certain that it would be upheld by the courts. 

The Dodd-Frank Act &#32;was enacted in July 2010 and established additional regulatory oversight of financial institutions. To-date, the Dodd-Frank Act &#32;has not materially affected our business. However, development of regulations is not complete, and there could yet be changes in the regulatory environment that affect the way we conduct our operations or the cost of compliance, or both. 

One of the federal government bodies created by the Dodd-Frank Act &#32;was the FIO &#32;which, in December 2013, released a proposal on insurance modernization and improvement of the system of insurance regulation in the United States. Although the FIO &#32;is prohibited from directly regulating the business of insurance, it has authority to represent the United States in international insurance matters and has limited power to preempt certain types of state insurance laws. The recent proposal advocates significantly greater federal involvement in insurance regulation and identifies necessary reforms by the states to preclude further consideration of direct federal regulation. While the proposal does not necessarily imply that the federal government will displace state regulation completely, it does recommend more of a hybrid approach to insurance regulation. In response to the FIO &#32;proposal, the NAIC &#32;and a number of state legislatures have considered or adopted legislative proposals that alter and, in many cases, increase the authority of state agencies to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. We cannot predict whether the proposals will be adopted or what impact, if any, subsequently enacted laws might have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Terrorism Risk Insurance Act 

TRIA , initially enacted in 2002 and reauthorized in 2007 and 2015, ensures the availability of insurance coverage for certain acts of terrorism, as defined in the legislation. The 2015 reauthorization extended the program through 2020. TRIA &#32;currently provides that during 2016 a loss event must exceed $120 million &#32;to trigger coverage and that Federal government will reimburse 84% &#32;of an insurer&#8217;s losses in excess of the insurer&#8217;s deductible, up to the maximum annual Federal liability of $100 billion . The event trigger will gradually increase to $200 million &#32;by 2020 and the reimbursement percentage will gradually decline to 80% &#32;by 2020. TRIA &#32;requires that we offer terrorism coverage to our commercial policyholders in our workers' 

compensation line of business, for which we may, when warranted, charge an additional premium. The policyholders may or may not accept such coverage. 

International 

Cayman Islands 

Our segregated portfolio cell business operates through our subsidiary, Eastern Re , which is organized and licensed as a Cayman Islands unrestricted Class B insurance company.

Lloyd's Syndicate 1729 

Syndicate 1729 is regulated in the U.K. &#32;by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. All Lloyd's syndicates must also comply with the bylaws and regulations established by the Council of Lloyd's including submission and approval of an annual business plan and maintenance of stipulated capital levels. Also, the Council of Lloyd's may call or assess a percentage of a member's underwriting capacity (currently a maximum of 3% ) as a contribution to Lloyd's Central Fund, which, similar to state guaranty funds in the United States, meets policyholder obligations if a Lloyd's member is otherwise unable to do so. 

The European Union's executive body, the European Commission, has implemented new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called Solvency II that applies to businesses within the European Union. Solvency II became effective January 1, 2016. Syndicate 1729 follows the Solvency II compliance guidelines set out by the Council of Lloyd's. 

Enterprise Risk Management 

As a large property and casualty insurance provider, we are exposed to many risks, stemming from both our insurance operations and the environments in which we operate. Since certain risks can be correlated with other risks, an event or a series of events can impact multiple areas of the Company simultaneously and have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. In response to these exposures we have implemented an ERM &#32;program. Our ERM &#32;program consists of numerous processes and controls that have been designed by our senior management, with oversight by our Board of Directors, and have been implemented across our organization. We utilize ERM &#32;to identify potential risks from all aspects of our operations and to evaluate these risks in a manner that is both prudent and balanced. Our primary objective is to develop a risk appetite that creates and preserves value for all of our stakeholders. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 938 &#32;employees, none of whom were represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relations to be good.
