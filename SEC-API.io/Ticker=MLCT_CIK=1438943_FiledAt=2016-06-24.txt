Company Overview 

&#65279; 

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 29, 2007 and commenced operations as a mineral exploration company. On October 10, 2011, we completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Stevia First Corp., whereby we changed our name from &#8220;Legend Mining Inc .&#8221; to &#8220;Stevia First Corp.&#8221; Also on October 10, 2011, we effected a seven for one forward stock split of authorized, issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital was increased from 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 525,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001, and issued and outstanding shares increased from 7,350,000 to 51,450,000. In February 2012, we substantially changed our management team, and began pursuing an agricultural biotechnology business plan . I n May 2016, &#160; we received shareholder and board approval for a name change to Vitality Biopharma, Inc., an exchang e of one (1) share of the Company&#8217;s c ommon s tock for each 10 shares of c ommon s tock outstanding or exercisable under any outstanding warrants or option agreements and an increase in the number of shares of authorized common stock from 525,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 . These corporate changes will become effective upon the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) 

&#65279; 

Business Overview 

&#65279; 

The Company, soon to be renamed Vitality Biopharma , Inc., is unlocking the power of cannabinoids for treatment and reversal of serious neurological and inflammatory disorders. 

&#65279; 

In 2014, sales of medical marijuana were estimated at $2.57 billion, and are estimated to grow to $10.2 billion in five years due to legalization and increasing recognition of its therapeutic utility , within the medical community . Pharmaceutical versions of cannabinoids have been marketed in the U.S. for more than a decade, which hold the same therapeutic potential, yet their sales have lagged behind, with sales of synthetic cannabinoids pharmaceuticals in the U.S. estimated at only $133 million in 2014 by IMS Health. C annabinoid pharmaceuticals that are currently approved or in development by other companies have well known limitations, such as poor oral bioavailability , which translates into erratic and potentially unsafe dosing as well as a short duration of action , &#160; which means that current treatments must be administered repeatedly throughout the day, and that there is no overnight relief. 

&#65279; 

The Company has developed a new class of cannabinoid prodrugs , known as cannabosides, to overcome these limitations, and to ultimately provide a compelling oral cannabinoid pharmaceutical that we expect physicians will be eager to prescribe, and that patients will prefer over use of medical marijuana. Cannabosides were discovered in 2015 through application of the company&#8217;s proprietary enzymatic taste modification technologies that were originally developed for stevia sweeteners. 

&#65279; 

Cannabosides are cannabinoid &#8220;p rodrugs ,&#8221; &#160; which means that they are medications or compounds that, after administration, are converted within the body into a pharmacologically active drug, and which &#160; often already have a long history of clinical investigation and use . A classic prodrug example is Asprin, acetylsalicylic acid, which was first made by Felix Hoffmann at Bayer in 1897 and is a synthetic prodrug of salicylic acid . Because there already exists independent verification of the active drug&#8217;s safety and efficacy, prodrugs may receive marketing approval more quickly than others, and in some cases may receive drug approvals through completion of small clinical studies evaluating bioequivalence or bioavailability. At the same time, a prodrug can have many commercial advantages, including that they can be proprietary and patentable compositions of matter, unlike cannabinoids themselves, or older pharmaceutical formulations where patent protection has already expired . 

&#65279; 

Cannabosides are more stable and soluble than cannabinoids, so there is less risk of non-psychotropic cannabidiol (&#8220;CBD&#8221;) being converted to psychotropic THC or otherwise degraded in the acidic stomach environment . &#160; This could improve product bioavailability, eliminate unwanted side effects in pediatric epilepsy patients, and be useful in any medical treatment where oral CBD is administered at high dose. Cannabosides enable the passage of cannabinoids through the digestive tract and their eventual release within the large intestine or colon, which enables targeted delivery of cannabinoids for treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. Because passage of cannabosides through the digestive tract is likely to occur over several hours or longer, there is a sustained or delayed release of cannabinoids, which can also provide patients with long-lasting or overnight relief, a desirable attribute that is unavailable with medical marijuana or with current cannabinoid pharmaceutical formulations. 

&#65279; 

We have produced more than 2 5 novel cannab oside s so far and have patent applications that include composition of matter claims for prodrugs of cannabinoids that have been studied extensively in clinical trials worldwide, including THC, CBD, and CBDV. The Company aims to develop and approve these proprietary molecules as pharmaceuticals using a low-risk regulatory strategy that is available for prodrugs, and to ultimately deliver to the market pharmaceuticals that are highly differentiated both from medical marijuana and from current cannabinoid drugs. 

&#65279; 

&#160;

A key part of our strateg y will be to take advantage of a more efficient FDA review and approval process that is available for prodrugs, which reduces the need for large and expensive clinical trials. This expedited regulatory process is available for our cannabosides because in the U.S. and internationally there have already been many independent clinical studies completed using the reference cannabinoid drugs we are studying. 

&#65279; 

We are initially developing our cannaboside pharmaceutical products for symptomatic relief of pain , cramping, and muscle spasticity that is the result of serious neurological and inflammatory conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. There is extensive clinical evidence supporting the potential efficacy of cannabinoids for treatment of each of these indications, including through clinical trials conducted by independent investigators. 

&#65279; 

We plan to complete preclinical studies necessary in order to launch multiple clinical trials in 2017 that evaluate the clinical pharmacokinetics of drug formulations containing cannabosides, as well as their potential for providing symptomatic relief of pain , cramping, and muscle spasticity . These trials may also obtain preliminary data about the regenerative potential of our drug formulations , both when administered alone and in combination with other medications, in healthy control populations, and also in patients that have inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis. 

&#65279; 

Our primary operations are based in Yuba City, California, where we originally developed our proprietary bioprocessing methods. The Company&#8217;s facilities include laboratories and a manufacturing suite for GMP production, which will be used for pharmaceutical -grade production of products to be tested in clinical trials, and which will be registered the U.S. FDA and DEA. 

&#65279; 

Our Operations 

&#160; 

As of the end of our March 31, 201 6 fiscal year, we had generated only $ 24 8,348 in revenue from our business operations and we do not expect to generate significant amounts of cash from our operations for the foreseeable future. We had net losses for the year ended March 31, 201 6 of $ 141,325 , used cash in operations of $1,685,841, and we had an accumulated deficit as of March 31, 201 6 of $12, 516,559 . As described further under the heading &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; below, we will need significant additional funding to support our operations and business plans and we have no commitments for future capital. The continuation of our business is dependent upon our ability to obtain loans or sell securities to new and existing investors or obtain capital from other alternative sources. In their report on our annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 201 6 , our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, which means there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business unless we obtain additional capital or generate sufficient cash from our operations. We will need to raise additional funds in order to continue operating our business and pursue and execute our planned research and development and commercial operations. We expect that we will seek such funding through equity and debt financings with our existing stockholders and other qualified investors. We do not have any commitments for any future financing and sources of additional funds may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms, or at all. See &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; below. 

&#65279; 

Over the 12 months following the date of this report, we aim to increase the scale of our pharmaceutical development efforts. As of June 22 , 2016, we had eight full-time employees. Total expenditures over the 12 months following March 31, 201 6 , are expected to be approximately $2,400,000. We expect to have sufficient funds to operate our business for at least 6 months. However, our estimate of total expenditures could increase if we encounter unanticipated difficulties. In addition, our estimates of the amount of cash necessary to fund our business may prove to be wrong, and we could spend our available financial resources much faster than we currently expect. If we cannot raise the money that we need in order to continue operating and/or advance our business, we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations. If any of these were to occur, there is a substantial risk that our business would fail. 

&#65279; 

The below descriptions of our planned operations include expected expenditures for various activities, some of which may depend on our ability to obtain additional funding, if available, and all of which are estimates based on current expectations and assumptions and could prove to be wrong. See &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; in Item 7 of this annual report. 

&#65279; 

Product Development Plans 

&#65279; 

For each of the pharmaceutical products in our pipeline , the active cannabinoid pharmaceutical agents have either been independently approved by regulatory bodies, or are now in late-stage clinical trials, and there is extensive clinical data already available related to drug safety and effectiveness. Because of this, the company will pursue abbreviated regulatory paths towards approval of its proprietary follow-on prodrugs for approval in similar clinical indications to those that have been approved in the U.S. and internationally. In some cases, in order to obtain marketing authorization for a product in certain countries , the Company may need to only demonstrate plasma bioavailability of the active pharmaceutical agent, rather than repeat clinical studies that have previously demonstrated safety and efficacy of the approved cannabinoid pharmaceutical. 

&#65279; 

&#160;

Cannabinoids are known to be effective anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agents, and as of 2015, more than 20 U.S. states have enacted medical marijuana laws to permit access to marijuana for treatment of a variety of conditions. The approved conditions include chronic pain, epilepsy, wasting disorders, multiple sclerosis and muscle spasticity disorders, glaucoma, cirrhosis, Alzheimer &#8217;s disease, nausea, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson &#8217;s disease, HIV/AIDS, Huntington &#8217;s disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and more . Cannabinoid pharmaceuticals are increasingly being approved as well , including primarily synthetic and botanical extracts of the two major constituents of Cannabis sativa , which are THC and CBD. Dronabinol is a synthetic THC drug that has been approved for treating nausea and for stimulating appetite. Nabiximols is a blend of two cannabinoids, THC and CBD, which has been approved in more than 20 countries for treatment of muscle spasticity in multiple sclerosis , and also for treatment of cancer pain in certain countries . 

&#65279; 

CBD is not psychoactive, has established antianxiety and antipsychotic effects, and beyond its inclusion in nabiximols, is also being investigated as a stand-alone agent for epilepsy, schizophrenia, substance abuse, inflammatory bowel disease, and a variety of other neurological and inflammatory conditions. We intend to obta in marketing authorizations for our cannaboside &#160; drug formulations in one or more of these disease indications. 

Short Term Development Targets 

&#65279; 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

Complete additional pharmacokinetic studies and additional preclinical efficacy trials to support clinical development of cannabosides 

&#183; 

Complete the manufacture of cannaboside formulations that will be used in initial clinical studies 

&#183; 

Obtain regulatory approval for first-in-man clinical studies to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of cannabosides, and to obtain preliminary data about their efficacy for providing symptomatic relief related to neurological and inflammatory disorders 

&#183; 

Obtain regulatory approval to begin manufacturing of pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoids, in order to support future clinical trials and for marketing authorizations both by the U.S. FDA 

&#65279; 

We believe that our long-term commercial success and profit potential depends in large part on our ability to develop and advance proprietary cannabinoid prodrugs that are strongly differentiated from both medical marijuana and existing cannabinoid drugs, and to do this more quickly, efficiently and effectively than our competitors. Another critical factor that will determine our success is our ability to obtain and enforce patents, maintain protection of trade secrets, and operate our business without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. As a result, we are dedicated to the continued development and protection of our intellectual property portfolio. See &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8221; in this report for a further discussion. 

Product Pipeline 

&#65279; 

Our pipeline includes cannabosides, which are cannabinoid glycoside prodrugs . Prodrugs are medications or compounds metabolized by the body into a pharmacologically active drug. We have patents pending for more than 25 of these novel pharmaceutical compositions including prodrugs of THC, CBD, and CBDV, which are cannabinoids that are either marketed and approved as pharmaceutical products today, or that are under investigation in independent clinical trials currently. Prodrugs can optimize the marketability of a drug because they can be patented and proprietary, and yet still be approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway. VITA-100 is a n oral cannabinoid formulation containing cannabosides that is being developed for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, epilepsy, schizophrenia, and other disorders. VITA-210 is a cannabinoid glycoside prodrug being developed primarily for treatment of pain and muscle spasticity in multiple sclerosis and in rare white matter disorders. 

&#65279; 

Through a process called glycosylation, the solubility and stability of a drug can be significantly improved. Cannabinoid glycoside prodrugs and their use in drug formulations that are currently under development at Vitality Biopharma are designed to enable significant benefits, including: 

&#65279; 

1. 

Administration of cannabinoids in a convenient oral form ulation ; 

2. 

Improved solubility, leading to oral formulations that are easy to manufacture and that improve the taste of products through reduction or removal of harsh organic solvents; 

3. 

Improved stability, preventing conversion of CBD to psychoactive THC in the acidic stomach environment, or other forms of degradation, and therefore enabling higher doses of CBD to be administered orally without undesirable side effects; 

4. 

Delayed release, enabling long-lasting relief of symptoms for patients, rather than having to administer treatment repeatedly throughout the day and requiring additional pharmaceuticals for overnight pain relief or as a sleep aid; and 

&#160;

5. 

Targeted delivery of compounds to specific tissues or organs, especially targeted delivery of cannabinoids to the colon or large intestine for treatment of gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease .

We also have licensed intellectual property that seeks to protect methods of use of certain FDA-approved drugs for treatment of multiple sclerosis and demyelinating disorders. These drugs are being tested in combination with our cannaboside drug formulations in order to establish treatment regimens that provide regenerative effects for patients with serious neurological and inflammatory conditions. 

Additional Operations 

&#65279; 

Our glycosylation technology in the past was applied primarily to production of better tasting varieties of stevia through enzyme bioprocessing , which was developed in concert with additional technologies designed to improve the taste and yield of stevia sweetener derived from the stevia plant. The company has an intellectual property portfolio related to stevia, as well as commercial operations related to the manufacture and sale of research products that commenced in 2014. We also previously entered into a distribution agreement and licensing agreement with Qualipride, a stevia supplier located in China, in order to license rights to certain stevia production technologies . The Company intends to sustain these operations and technologies in a manner that is cash-flow neutral or better, through a combination of restructuring of existing agreements and entering into new licensing arrangements or strategic partnerships . 

Glycodiversification Technology for Prodrug Development &#160; 

&#65279; 

The biosynthetic process of adding additional glucose molecules to compounds is called glycosylation, and we originally developed related production technologies in order to modify the taste and enable low-cost and reliable industrial production of steviol glycosides, which are sweet molecules better known as stevia, a zero-calorie, high-potency sweetener that is derived from the stevia plant, and that has been adopted widely within the food and beverage industry. It has recently become appreciated within the pharmaceutical industry that glycosylation can act to generate novel natural product libraries with improved drug properties. It is generally accepted that attaching a glyosidic moiety, a glucose or sugar molecule, to a compound that is typically found without one, known as an aglycone, will make the product more water-soluble. This increase in water solubility influences the pharmacokinetic parameters of the respective compounds, including modification of their bioavailability within certain tissues and body fluids. 

&#65279; 

The process for modifying natural products through glycosylation to provide libraries of new molecules that may have more desirable attributes is called glycorandomization, or glycodiversification. Reliable production of glycosylated natural products must be done in a directed way to enable production of purified individual compounds, after selection of those with the most desirable commercial attributes. Synthesis is typically performed either using chemical or enzymatic methods. Production of chemical intermediates known as cofactors, which enable the glycosylation reaction to occur, has historically been expensive and has made it challenging to produce diverse natural product libraries, or to enable their economical industrial production. We have developed multi-step enzymatic biosynthesis methods to recycle cofactors and to reduce the overall costs of glycoside production. These methods have most recently been applied to production of cannabinoid glycosides (&#8220;cannabosides&#8221;) , which are metabolized differently from cannabinoids and can enable their use as &#160; pharmaceutical prodrugs. &#160; 

&#65279; 

A prodrug is a medication or compound that, after administration, is metabolized (i.e., converted within the body) into a pharmacologically active drug. Prodrugs are often designed to improve bioavailability of a drug, or to improve how selectively the drug interacts with cells or tissues that are not its intended target. In general, prodrugs are often used to make a drug better tolerated by patients and to reduce any of its adverse or unintended effects. 

&#65279; 

Cannabinoids prodrugs are designed to overcome challenges that may be necessary in order to ensure cannabinoid pharmaceuticals can be effectively marketed and commercialized, including overcoming including problems with the taste and tolerability of formulations, improving their bioavailability, extending their duration of action, and also strengthening the intellectual property protection of follow-on pharmaceutical cannabinoid formulations. Many of the most commonly accepted barriers that prodrugs may overcome include: insufficient chemical stability, poor aqueous stability, offensive taste or odor, irritation or pain, low 

&#160;

oral absorption or systemic exposure, marked presystemic metabolism, a short duration of action, unfavorable distribution in the body, inadequate site specificity, drug toxicity, or drug patent life expiration . 

&#65279; 

Upon ingestion, delivery of bioactive compounds is known to occur naturally through liberation of aglycone compounds from poorly absorbed plant glycosides. Many of these glycosides pass through the stomach and upper intestine without appreciable loss due to absorption or degradation by stomach acids. Once a prodrug reaches the lower intestine, or colon, the polar sugar residue is released by the hydrolytic activity of glycosidase enzymes that are produced by gut bacteria, thus liberating the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the large intestine. In addition, some glycoside compounds have been found to undergo active carrier-mediated transport across membranes and into specific tissues, such as the brain. Such technology could also more broadly enable site-specific delivery of prodrugs through use of mechanisms that are typically used by the body to increase absorption of glucose as an energy source to various tissues. 

&#65279; 

Commonly known and ingested compounds that are glycosides include many flavonoids, or polyphenols, present in fruit and vegetables. Flavonols are the most ubiquitous flavonoids found in foods, and these compounds are typically present in glycosylated form. Fruit often contains 5 or 10 different flavonol glycosides. A single glass of orange juice may contain between 40 and 140 mg of flavanone glycosides. In leafy vegetables such as lettuce and cabbage, the glycoside concentration is more than 10 times higher in the green outer leaves as in the lighter, inner leaves. There are also FDA-approved drugs that are glycosylated, including sennosides, or Ex-Lax, an over-the-counter drug that has been sold in the United States since 1906. Sennosides are on the World Health Organization&#8217;s List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system, and exert their effects through targeted delivery of the active pharmaceutical ingredient to the colon over the course of six to 12 hours. 

&#65279; 

Pharmaceutical Use of Cannabinoids 

&#65279; 

The U.S. national legal marijuana market value is projected to be $2.57 billion in 2014 and to rise by more than 700 percent to $10.2 billion in 2019, according to Arcview Market Research. Marijuana is one of the most popular recreational drugs, where worldwide an estimated 178 million people used cannabis at least once in 2012. Cannabis was included as a controlled drug in the United Nations&#8217; Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, and it s use is illegal in most countries. 

&#65279; 

As of 2015, more than 20 U.S. states have enacted medical marijuana laws to permit access to marijuana for treatment of a variety of medical conditions, with the approved conditions in certain states including chronic pain, epilepsy, wasting disorders, multiple sclerosis and muscle spasticity disorders, glaucoma, cirrhosis, Alzheimer &#8217;s disease, nausea, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson &#8217;s disease, HIV/AIDS, Huntington &#8217;s disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and more. A concern with the increasing use of medical marijuana is that patients and physicians don&#8217;t know the precise chemical profile of these products, and that they desire a safe, well-tested pharmaceutical product that can be treated as any other medicine, which includes a list of ingredients, effects, and side effects. Regulatory approval of pharmaceutical cannabinoid products could dramatically increase the chance that health insurance companies would pay for them, and their use could be further legitimized through approval by governments, insurance companies, and physicians. 

&#65279; 

There are already several approved cannabinoid drugs internationally, including dronabinol, nabilone, and nabiximols. In 1985, the FDA approved both dronabinol and nabilone, which are synthetic forms of THC, and a THC analog, respectively, which are approved for management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and for wasting conditions related to AIDS and cancer. Sales of these drugs are currently relatively weak, with dronabinol capsules in 2014 estimated to be only $133 million in the United States, according to IMS Health. Data from more than 40 clinical trials of cannabinoids have been published, including evaluations of their use for treatment of chronic pain, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, and muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. As of March 2015, there were: 

&#65279; 

&#183; 

Six (6) trials that examined chronic pain including 325 patients; 

&#183; 

Six (6) trials that examined neuropathic pain including 396 patients; 

&#183; 

Twelve (12) trials that examined multiple sclerosis including 1,600 patients; and 

&#183; 

Multiple small clinical trials that examined use of CBD for treatment of rare forms of childhood epilepsy. 

Several of these trials had positive results indicating that the drugs could be effective. 

&#65279; 

The American Academy of Neurology published evidence-based guidelines that recommend oral cannabis extract as having the highest level of empirical support for reducing patient-reported symptoms of spasticity and pain associated with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the myelin and glial cells of the nervous system . As of 2014, nabiximols, which is the world&#8217;s first prescription medicine made from cannabis extracts, was approved for use in multiple sclerosis in more than 20 countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and Australia. The American Academy of Neurology 

&#160;

also published a systematic review suggesting that nabiximols, a spray that contains both THC and CBD, as probably effective in treating spasticity, central pain, and urinary dysfunction associated with multiple sclerosis. 

&#65279; 

The main non-psychotropic component of marijuana is cannabidiol (CBD), which has established antianxiety and antipsychotic effects, acting to mitigate the high from THC, as well as neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Cannabidiol has demonstrated therapeutic effects in clinical trials for serious neurological conditions including rare seizure disorders in children, and the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to an oral liquid formulation of plant-derived CBD for a clinical trial investigating its effectiveness in Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. An open-label trial found that CBD reduced seizure frequencies in doses up to 25 mg/kg in multiple drug-resistant forms of epilepsy and seizure disorders &#160; and independent results of a placebo-controlled trial were announced in 2016 that found cannabidiol was effective in treating a rare form of childhood epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. The average age of trial participants was 10 years old and the treatment group that included use of CBD achieved a median reduction in monthly convulsive seizures of nearly 40%, compared to 13% with a placebo, achieving a highly statistically significant effect that was sustain ed during the treatment period. CBD was generally well tolerated in the study, however, somnolence or drowsiness was reported, and historically is present in nearly 20% of these patients, which may be as a result of degradation or conversion of CBD to THC within the acidic stomach environment . 

The Role of Cannabidiol in Neuroprotection and Neural Repair 

&#65279; 

Cannabidiol is one of the key cannabinoid constituents of the Cannabis sativa plant and may often account for up to 40% of cannabis extracts. Contrary to THC, which has some therapeutic benefits but also important adverse effects, CBD is not psychoactive. It is well-tolerated and exhibits a broad spectrum of therapeutic properties, which have been studied at both the molecular and clinical level extensively. CBD is often used alone or in combination with other phytocannabinoids, and has noted anti-inflammatory effects, making it useful for neuroinflammatory disorders . Independent studies have already confirmed its effectiveness in treatment of multiple sclerosis in preclinical studies . Based on its anticonvulsant properties, CBD has also been proposed for treatment of epilepsy and sleep disorders. Moreover, CBD may also serve as an antipsychotic making it a promising compound for the treatment of schizophrenia, as well as for treatment of anxiety and depression. In addition, due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, CBD has an established neuroprotective role, and therefore may have broad spectrum utility in neurological disorders beyond multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, and schizophrenia , including indications such as neonatal ischemia or Huntington&#8217;s disease. 

&#65279; 

The therapeutic value of CBD, either given alone or in combination with THC, may be due to it providing neuroprotection through multiple mechanisms of action at the molecular level, making it a rare compound. Its combination of anti-glutamatergic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effects cover nearly all aspects of neurotoxicity that are present in neurodegenerative diseases, including inflammatory responses, excitotoxicity, and oxidative injury. The therapeutic properties of CBD do not appear to be exerted by the activation of key known molecular targets of the endocannabinoid systems such as the CB1 or CB2 receptors. CBD has negligible activity at these cannabinoid receptors, and so is likely to exert effects through other mechanisms. In almost all clinical studies performed, CBD has enhanced the effects of THC however, and so at least some of its biological and clinical activity is linked to enhancement of the endocannabinoid and related cellular signaling systems. 

&#65279; 

Cannabidiol may induce neuroprotection through oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), where it has been shown to promote survival through attenuation of cellular stress. CBD administration has also been shown to protect both neuronal and non-neural cells against several detrimental insults, including &#946;-amyloid, 6-hydroxydopamine, and glutamate, where related toxicity is thought to contribute to disorders such as Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s diseases. Additionally, synthetic cannabinoids have been shown to stimulate proliferation of OPCs, and the activation of cannabinoid receptors has been shown to be necessary for oligodendrocyte maturation. Therefore, cannabinoids may provide a unique means to stimulate neuroprotection and also neuroregeneration. The reported neuroprotective effects of CBD do not appear to be afforded by any other drugs that exist, suggesting a benefit for treatment of a wide variety of neurodegenerative disorders, especially upon consideration that CBD at commonly used doses has a near absence of side effects , including most notably a lack of psychotropic effects. 

Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, a Serious Neurological and Inflammatory Condition 

&#65279; 

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that afflicts more than two million people worldwide, approximately 450,000 in the United States, and involves degenerative changes characterized by inflammation and de myelination of the central nervous system (CNS). Most people with MS experience relapses and remissions of their symptoms, particularly early in the course of the disease, and symptoms are typically associated with areas of CNS inflammation. Typically over time, the disease will gradually worsen, independent of acute inflammatory attacks, and progressive or degenerative changes occur. People with MS have many debilitating symptoms that vary over time, including muscle spasticity, impaired mobility, mood and cognitive changes, pain and sensory problems, fatigue, visual disturbances, and therefore there is a significant impact on quality of life for patients and their families. MS typically makes it difficult to live an independent and autonomous life, and often young adults that are diagnosed are then faced with needing to adapt their life to an unpredictable disease that requires frequent healthcare visits, extensive laboratory testing, and costly 

&#160;

medications. Compared to patients with other chronic diseases, those diagnosed with MS experience limitations in social roles, and have diminished ratings in physical function, health, and vitality. 

&#65279; 

The myelin sheath insulates and supports axons, the fibers that transit signals between nerve cells. Recurring inflammatory attacks in MS patients degrade the myelin sheath. Stripped of this protective coating, the axons gradually cause numbness, muscle spasms, and muscle spasticity, which is a frequent symptom of the disease. The lifetime financial cost of MS, including both direct and indirect costs, has been estimated at $1.2 million, although today many MS drugs cost between $50,000 an $65,000 per year. In addition, studies that have analyzed large populations that were untreated with a disease-modifying therapy demonstrated a reduction in survival of 8-12 years. Copaxone, which was approved in 1996, is the best-selling therapy, with 2014 retail sales of $3.4 billion in the U.S. alone, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. According to consulting firm GlobalData, the market for multiple sclerosis therapeutics was $17.2 billion in 2014. As of 2014, there were 12 disease-modifying therapies approved in the U.S., which slow the inflammatory attack of MS, although they often have dangerous side effects, and none have been able to reverse disability or promote functional recovery. None of these medications is a cure, and none will prevent recurring symptoms, such as fatigue or numbness. 

&#65279; 

Muscle spasticity, or muscle stiffness, is one of the more common symptoms of multiple sclerosis and affects approximately 80 percent of patients. Spasticity is also present in many other disorders, such as rare demyelinating disorders, rare white matter disorders, spinal cord injury, stroke, and cerebral palsy. Spasticity may be as mild as feeling tightness in muscles, leading to lower back pain, or may be so severe as to produce painful and uncontrollable spasms of the legs and other extremities. Sales of muscle relaxants that have effects similar to spasticity medications were estimated at roughly $780 million annually from 2000-2007, and were part of the broader market for pain medications that had total annual sales of $17.8 billion annually during this period. If untreated, spasticity can lead to serious complications, such as frozen or immobilized joints known as contractures, and pressure sores. Treatment of spasticity and muscle tightness by medication and physical and occupational therapy is needed to prevent painful and disabling joint contractures, which often occurs in the knees, shoulders, elbows, ankles, and hips. According to the National MS Society, two medications are primarily used to treat muscle spasticity today, including baclofen, the most common medication, and tizanidine. Common side effects of these medications include drowsiness, muscle weakness, and a feeling of sedation. Dosing of baclofen is very patient-specific, due to a narrow therapeutic window between effectiveness and inability to maintain functional ability. Other less commonly-used medications include botulinum toxin, clonidine, phenol, dantrolene, and diazepam, or Valium&#174;, which is not a first choice drug due to sedating effects and its potential to create dependence, but its effects last longer than baclofen and physicians may prescribe doses at bedtime to relieve spasms that interfere with sleep.

Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Gastrointestinal Disorders 

&#65279; 

Inflammatory bowel disease (&#8220;IBD&#8221;) is a progressive inflammatory condition where parts of the digestive system bec o me sore and inflamed. The disease can lead to currently irreversible damage to the gastrointestinal tract and require surgical removal of the intestine and affected areas. Two major forms of the disease are Crohn&#8217;s disease, which can affect any part of the digestive system and also ulcerative colitis, which often affects the rectum and the colon, or large intestine. IBD is a chronic condition, meaning that it is ongoing and typically lasts throughout life in those that are afflicted. As with multiple sclerosis, the disease is often unpredictable, and there are periods of remission where there are few or no symptoms, which alternate with periods where symptoms are very active and debilitating. 

&#65279; 

Different classes of drugs are used to treat IBD, including anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids, biologics, and immunosuppressants, antibiotics that treat or help prevent bacterial infections that result from gastrointestinal disturbances, and also drugs that relieve the symptoms of disease such as diarrhea, constipation, and pain. A market research report by Visiongain predicts that in 2017 drug revenues for treatment of IBD will reach $9.6 billion. The ultimate goal of clinical treatment of IBD is to obtain complete disease control and to stop disease progression. This includes remission of disease without use of steroids, normalization of inflammatory markers in the blood, and also healing of the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract, which typically leads to better clinical outcomes, reduced healthcare costs, and an improved quality of life. 

&#65279; 

Spastic colon is another name for irritable bowel syndrome (&#8220;IBS&#8221;), a gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by abdominal cramping, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. The term of &#8220;spastic colon&#8221; refers to the contraction of muscles in the small and large intestines that are often associated with the disorder. IBD and IBS have similar symptoms, but the underlying disease process is quite different, where IBD is characterized by inflammatory attack and destruction of the gastrointestinal wall. IBS is typically a gastrointestinal disorder where no apparent cause can be found, and is very common, with up to 25% of the U.S. population reporting symptoms of IBS. 

&#65279; 

In gastroenterology, Cannabis extracts are known for their anti-vomiting, appetite-stimulating, and anti-diarrheal effects, which are thought to be useful for symptomatic relief of IBS and IBD. More than half of patients with IBD in the U.S. use or have used Cannabis (51.3%), and 16.4% of patients had used Cannabis to treat IBD-related symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. In a study of Cannabis use in 313 patients with IBD, there were reported improvements by 83.9% for abdominal pain, 76.8% for abdominal cramping, and 48.2% for joint pain. In a Canadian population in 2011, chronic abdominal pain was reported as the primary reason for self-medication with Cannabis, including in patients with a history of abdominal surgery. In a 

&#160;

2013 clinical trial of use of Cannabis in Crohn&#8217;s disease, complete remission was achieved in 5 out of 11 subjects (classified as Crohn&#8217;s Disease Activity Index &#60; 150). There were considerable clinical benefits including patients being weaned off steroid dependency, and reported improvements in sleep and appetite, with no significant side effects reported. 

&#65279; 

Studies have shown that activation of cannabinoid receptors can decrease inflammation, gastric acid secretion, and intestinal motility, and that cannabinoids may have therapeutic potential for reversing the disordered intestinal permeability associated with intestinal inflammation. This includes inflammation related to IBD, colorectal cancer, and also sepsis (which some call &#8220;blood poisoning&#8221;). Sepsis is a disorder where the gut is now hypothesized to play a central role, where a failure of the integrity of the gut mucosal lining leads to infections throughout the body and can lead to septic shock and multi-organ failure. Each year, sepsis affects more than 750,000 Americans and is responsible for more than 210,000 deaths. Up to 50% of all hospital deaths have been linked to sepsis. It is the most expensive reason for hospitalization in the U.S., where in 2011 the U.S. spent more than $55 million each day in direct healthcare costs treating it. Prevention methods are being developed, which include treatments that may help prevent sepsis altogether, or prevent patient deterioration from sepsis to severe sepsis, or from severe sepsis to septic shock. Independent preclinical studies have already found that a lack of cannabinoid receptors leads to increased incidence of multi-organ failure, and that treatment with cannabidiol can lead to a significant reduction of mortality. 

&#65279; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly active and dynamic, where many companies compete with a strong focus on advancing new technologies and developing proprietary products. We believe our product candidates, technology, scientific acumen, facilities, and additional capabilities provide us with a significant and sustainable competitive advantage, but competition exists today, and new competitors may arise from multiple sources, including especially from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, researchers at non-profit institutions, and government-sponsored researchers. Successfully commercialized products must compete not only with existing therapies, but also with new agents that are currently in development or that may become available in the future. 

&#65279; 

Cannabinoid pharmaceuticals are approved and marketed currently, with more in development, from companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals PLC (&#8220;GW Pharma&#8221;), Insys Therapeutics Inc. (&#8220;Insys&#8221;), Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. &#160; (&#8220;Zynerba&#8221;), and others. GW Pharma is developing botanical extracts including THC, CBD, CBDV, and blends of these compounds, including the current development and marketing of nabiximols, branded as Sativex&#174;, which is approved in more than 20 countries internationally. GW Pharma is also developing cannabidiol, branded as Epidiolex&#174;, for use primarily with epilepsy and rare seizure disorders, and that is being developed in a liquid spray formulation that must be administered multiple times daily. A similar synthetic CBD product is being developed by Insys. Zynerba is developing synthetic forms of THC and CBD, or related prodrugs, which are being developed for use within formulations to be used as a topical gel or transdermal patch, rather than by oral delivery. There is additional competition from companies that supply alternative synthetic cannabinoids, which may influence cannabinoid signaling, as well as from medical marijuana and botanical extracts that are increasingly available to physicians and patients. 

&#65279; 

The global market for multiple sclerosis drugs is currently estimated at $17.2 billion in 2014 according to GlobalData, with drugs marketed and in development from major pharmaceutical companies including Biogen, Teva Neuroscience, Genzyme, Novartis, Pfizer, Bayer Healthcare, as well as smaller development-stage pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Disease-modifying medications appear to slow down the accumulation of disability, and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses or clinical attacks, as well as reduce the accumulation of lesions, which is damage to the brain and spinal cord as seen on magnetic resonance imaging scans. None of these currently-marketed medications is a cure or will prevent recurring symptoms of the disease, although agents that effect functional repair of the nervous system are in development by various companies, including Biogen that is developing a first-in-class remyelinating drug that is a monoclonal antibody and is administered intravenously. Muscle spasticity is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis for which there is no cure either, but symptomatic relief can be obtained through use of medications such as baclofen, tizanidine, and through use of less common alternative such as diazepam (Valium&#174;), nerve blocking agents, and botulinum toxin (Botox&#174;). 

&#65279; 

The global market for drugs treating IBD is predicted by Visiongain to reach $9.6 billion in annual revenues in 2017. The main types of drugs used commonly in IBD include anti-inflammatory drugs, drugs that provide symptomatic relief, and also antibiotics. Drugs used in IBD come in different forms, and may be administered in different ways, including orally, through topical treatments, and also through injectables or infusions in order to obtain an immediate response to a severe inflammatory attack. Primary drugs used in treatment of IBD include aminosalicylic acids, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants such as methotrexate, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus, and newer biologics such as infliximab (Remicade&#174;) or adalimumab (Humira&#174;) that target TNF-alpha, a mediator of inflammation. There are a variety of drugs available for treatment of common symptoms such as pain, diarrhea, and constipation. Current drugs that reduce painful abdominal cramps or spasms by relaxing the intestinal muscles are medications such as mebeverine, hyoscine butylbromide, and alverine citrate, which are often recommended for symptomatic relief of IBS but may also be helpful for IBD. 

&#65279; 

Government Regulation 

&#160;

&#160; 

Due to our development of pharmaceutical products , we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (&#8220;FDC Act&#8221;) sets most requirements for the development and marketing of our products. Although most regulation described within this document focuses on the United States, the largest market in the world for pharmaceutical products, we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our products in other countries as well. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope, although there can be meaningful differences. 

The FDA is the main regulatory body that controls pharmaceutical and biologic drugs in the United States. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes. A failure to comply explicitly with any requirements during the product development, approval, or post-approval periods, may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the imposition by the FDA or an institutional review board, or IRB, of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, or even civil penalties or criminal prosecution. The FDA also inspects manufacturing facilities periodically in order to ensure adequate compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;GMP&#8221;), which may require substantial record keeping requirements and equipment maintenance. 

Drug Approval Process by the U.S. Food &#38; Drug Administration 

The steps required before a new drug may be marketed in the United States generally include: completion of preclinical studies of drug safety and efficacy, as well as chemistry, manufacturing, and controls studies to characterize the production of the drug; submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) to support human clinical testing in the United States; approval by an independent research panel before each clinical trial may be initiated; performance of well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed clinical use; submission of an New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) to the FDA; satisfaction of any periodic reviews or inspections; and FDA review and approval of the NDA. After regulatory approval of a drug is obtained, a company is required to comply with a number of post-approval requirements, which may include ongoing testing, additional clinical trials, and surveillance of the drug&#8217;s clinical use in order to continue assess tis overall safety and efficacy profile. In addition, companies with marketed drugs are required to report adverse reactions and manufacturing issues to the FDA, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products. 

The FDA and other federal agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities conducted online. A pharmaceutical product cannot be commercially marketed before it is approved by the FDA. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to its safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the product labeling approved in advance by the FDA. Physicians and other healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for "off-label" uses, which deviate from the specific use described on the product labeling, because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA regulations impose stringent restrictions on drug manufacturers regarding the ability to market or promote such off-label use. 

Beyond seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants may apply for an abbreviated new drug application (&#8220;ANDA&#8221;), and also through an abbreviated 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, same strengths and dosage form, as a listed drug and has been shown through PK testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. 505(b)(2) applications provide for marketing of a drug product that may have the same active ingredients as the listed drug and contains full safety and effectiveness data as an NDA, but at least some of this information comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant. Upon approval, depending on the type of drug approved, and the indication it was approved for, it may receive additional periods of marketing exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve any alternative versions of the drugs. In addition, the FDA may grant three years of marketing exclusivity for a 505(b)(2) application if the NDA includes reports of clinical studies beyond bioequivalence testing. 

Additional special programs are available through acts of the FDA, including use of patent term extensions, which can extend the life of a patent as compensation for lost time during the FDA review and approval process, as well as alternative regulatory paths. This includes the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 and the FDA Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, which for example provides for a Breakthrough Therapy Designation. Through obtaining a Breakthrough Therapy Designation, a Company may be able to obtain accelerated approval for one or more drugs if they meet the qualifying criteria, which includes treatment of a serious or life threatening disease or condition, and having preliminary clinical evidence that the treatment will provide a substantial improvement over existing therapies. 

Drug Coverage and Reimbursement by Third-Party Payers 

&#160;

Upon marketing approval, there still remains extensive uncertainty over the ability for any drug to obtain insurance coverage and reimbursement for use of any products from third-party payers within the healthcare system in the United States and internationally. Sales of any products depend upon their acceptance and use by physicians and other healthcare providers, but also their availability from wholesalers and agreement to provide reimbursement from third-party payers, including private health insurance firms, managed care providers, and government health administrative agencies. Any or all of these groups may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved drugs for a particular indication. In addition, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. 

Alternative pricing and drug reimbursement mechanisms exist in other countries. Some jurisdictions may not allow marketing of a drug until market prices have been established. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Countries of the European Union are permitted to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. 

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on providing cost-effective pharmaceutical treatments. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. 

Controlled Substance Regulations 

We are developing and performing research on compounds that have been classified as &#8220;controlled substances&#8221; within the Controlled Substances Act, and that are monitored in the United States by the Drug Enforcement Administration (&#8220;DEA&#8221;). The DEA actively monitors and helps establish procedures that are in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act, and this involves the company to register itself, and to adhere to certain reporting and security practices in order to prevent and mitigate any loss or mishandling of controlled substances used on the premises. The State of California has simila r requirements, and the Company must maintain registration with a panel with disclosure of planned studies and its practices in order to conduct its operations. 

The DEA regulates controlled substances using different schedules, where Schedule I substances by definition have high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Schedule I and Schedule II substances are considered to present the highest risk of abuse, and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. THC, CBD, and purified synthetic forms are listed by the DEA as Schedule I substances, although some FDA-approved pharmaceutical versions of these products are now listed as Schedule III substances. 

A quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. This includes manufacturing of pharmaceutical products. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much product may be produced in the United States based on the DEA&#8217;s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas. 

DEA registration is required for any facility that performs research, manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule. The DEA typically inspects facilities to review the premises in advance of issuing a formal registration, in order to assess the adequacy of their security and internal controls. Security measures differ based on the specific type of application and controlled substance, but generally include physical control of inventory, surveillance cameras, and ensuring there is no diversion or loss of material through record-keeping and inventory monitoring. Reports must be provided to the DEA on the use of materials, as well as immediate reports of theft, loss, or suspicious activity 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

During the fiscal years ended March 31, 201 6 and 201 5 , we incurred $ 613,119 and $ 1,131,327 in expenses that were allocated to research and development activities. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

In September and October 2015, the Company filed two U.S. patent applications, titled &#8220;Cannabinoid Glycoside Prodrugs and Methods of Synthesis&#8221;, including an initial filing and an expanded filing. These patent applications describe more than 30 cannabinoid glycoside prodrugs , &#160; or cannabosides , which are designed to overcome the deficiencies of existing cannabinoid 

&#160;

pharmaceuticals. The patent filings include, but are not limited to, prodrugs of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the primary psychoactive component of medical marijuana, as well as the non-psychotropic compounds cannabidiol and cannabidivarin. 

&#65279; 

In June 2015, the Company filed a U.S. patent application titled &#8220;Method for Production and Recycling of UDPG&#8221;, which describes methods for rec ycling and economical production of a key cofactor necessary for biotransformation of steviol and cannabinoids through glycosylation. &#160; We previously licensed rights to a U.S. pa tent application titled, &#8220;Compositions and methods for producing steviol and steviol glycosides&#8221;, which was related to microbial production of stevia, and terminated this license in May 2016 in favor of pursuing internally developed patent applications for production of stevia and cannabinoid glycosides. 

&#65279; 

In March 2016, the Company was assigned rights to a U.S. provisional patent application titled &#8220;Methods for Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis and Demyelinating Disorders&#8221; from the Myelin Repair Foundation, which covers methods for treating multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating diseases through use of FDA-approved drugs that can be repurposed for their utility in effecting remeylination, a form of nervous system repair or regeneration. Th ese drugs along with others including the Company&#8217;s cannabinoid glycoside prodrugs may be administered in oral or injectable forms. 

&#65279; 

The Company&#8217;s internally developed patents now include provisional and non-provisional patent applications filed in the United States in 2013, 2014, and 2015 covering novel compositions of matter for cannabinoid prodrugs, methods for biosynthesis and medical applications of cannabinoid prodrugs, biosynthesis methods for steviol glycosides, and methods for efficient biosynthesis through glycosylation. &#160; If successful in prosecuting patent claims, the Company would obtain patent protection through 2035 or beyond, and which may be extended through patent term adjustments . &#160; 

&#65279; 

Emp loyees 

&#160; 

As of June 22 , 201 6 , we had eight full-time employees , including six dedicated to research and development . We also utilize the services of a network of consultants that contribute on a part-time basis, which gives us access to additional scientists and engineers that focus on research and development activities. We expect to increase the number of our employees and contractors as we expand our operations, and the number of employees dedicated to marketing and sales support as we begin to commercialize additional products and intensify our sales efforts.
