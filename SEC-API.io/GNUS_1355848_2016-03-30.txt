Overview 

&#160; 

Genius Brands International, Inc. (&#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;GBI&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a global content and brand management company dedicated to providing entertaining and enriching &#8220;content and products with a purpose&#8221; for toddlers to tweens. Led by industry veterans Andrew Heyward (Chief Executive Officer) and Amy Moynihan Heyward (President), the Company produces original content and licenses the rights to that content to a variety of partners. Our licensees include (i) companies to which the audio-visual rights are licensed for exhibition in various formats such as Pay Television, Free or Broadcast Television, Video-on-Demand (&#8220;VOD&#8221;), subscription on demand (&#8220;SVOD&#8221;), DVDs/CDs and more and (ii) companies that develop and distribute products based on our content within different product categories such as toys, electronics, publishing, home goods, stationary, gifts, and more.

&#160;

The Company owns a portfolio of original children&#8217;s entertainment that is targeted at toddlers to teens including the award-winning Baby Genius, Warren Buffett's Secret Millionaires Club, Thomas Edison's Secret Lab and Stan Lee's Mighty 7 , the first project from Stan Lee Comics, LLC , a joint venture with legendary Stan Lee's POW! Entertainment.

&#160;

In addition to the Company&#8217;s wholly-owned brands, it also acts as licensing agent for certain brands, leveraging its existing licensing infrastructure to expand these brands into new product categories, new retailers, and new territories. These include the best-selling children&#8217;s book series, Llama Llama (for which the Company is also producing an original series); Psycho Bunny , a luxury apparel line; From Frank , a humor greeting card and product line; and Celessence Technologies , the world's leading microencapsulation company.

&#160;

On April 2, 2014, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its Articles of Incorporation to affect a reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock on a 1-for-100 basis. The reverse stock split was effected on April 7, 2014 (the &#8220;Reverse Split&#8221;). All share and per share amounts referenced in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are adjusted to give retrospective effect to the Reverse Split.

&#160;

Strategic Initiatives 

&#160; 

During 2014 and 2015, the Company began a series of strategic initiatives to restructure certain areas of business in an effort to operate more profitably in the long term. These included product sales, content distribution, production, and product development:

&#160;

&#160; 1) During the second quarter of 2014, the Company began phasing out the direct production and sale of physical products including DVDs and CDs and shifted to a licensing model whereby these functions were outsourced to industry experts and category leaders in their respective industries. On July 14, 2014, the Company employed Stone Newman in the newly created position of President &#8211; Global Consumer Products to manage all consumer products, licensing and merchandising sales for the Company&#8217;s brands. &#160;

&#160; 2) Prior to the third quarter of 2014, the Company utilized an agency to license its content to international television broadcasters, home video, and digital distribution outlets. To exert greater control over the distribution of its expanding portfolio of content, during the second quarter of 2014, the Company formed a new global distribution division and appointed Andrew Berman to the newly created position of Senior Vice President - International Sales to oversee the division and the appointment of regional agents to represent the Company locally in key regions. &#160;

&#160; 3) During the third and fourth quarter of 2014, the Company partnered with various pre-production, production, and animation companies to provide services to the Company for the production of Thomas Edison&#8217;s Secret Lab in exchange for a certain percentage of the series&#8217; forthcoming adjusted net revenues and the ability to distribute the series in certain languages in certain territories. This model helps to better manage the Company&#8217;s cash flows while enabling it to exploit territories that would otherwise be challenging to manage and monetize. The Company intends to replicate the model for future productions. &#160;

&#160; 4) The infrastructure the Company has put in place enables it to efficiently exploit a growing portfolio of brands. The Company is actively developing a number of new brands, like Space Pop, to add to its growing portfolio and consistently looks for existing brands to acquire or act as licensing agent, as with the best-selling line of books, Llama Llama which the Company recently signed. The Company remains focused on brands that lend themselves to interactive exploitation in multiple areas and are consistent with the Company&#8217;s primary point of differentiation: providing multi-media &#8220;content and products with a purpose&#8221; that entertain and enrich kids.

&#160;

&#160; 5) Consistent with the Company's strategy of securing widespread distribution for its content in a variety of formats and building awareness and engagement for its brands that in turn drives its consumer products business, the Company has expanded its successful relationship with Comcast beyond the already popular Baby Genius on-demand offering. The Company has announced it launched a new Kid Genius Channel in the fourth quarter of2015, offering 24-hours of video on-demand content that will be consistent with the Company's &#34;content and products with a purpose&#34; mission. The new video on-demand channel will include the Company's own content, in addition to other content the Company will curate, to offer a robust line-up for kids. The Company's Senior Vice President-International Sales, Andrew Berman, will oversee the channel.

In consideration for such rights, and subject to certain conditions, Sony has paid the Company an advance in the amount of $2.0 million, against future royalties. 

&#160;

Private Placement

On October 29, 2015, we conducted a private placement with certain accredited investors pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of 4,330,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 4,330,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $1.00 per share and a warrant, for gross proceeds to us of $4,330,000 (the &#8220;2015 Private Placement&#8221;).

Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreements, beginning on the closing date of the 2015 Private Placement and ending sixty (60) days after the Effective Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreements), the Company shall not issue any securities, subject to certain exceptions.

&#160;

Original Content 

&#160;

The Company owns and produces original content that is meant to entertain and enrich toddlers to tweens. It is generally a three-year cycle from the inception of an idea, through production of the content and development and distribution of a range of consumer products to retail, creating an inevitable lag time between the creation of the intellectual property to the realization of economic benefit of those assets. The goal is to maintain a robust and diverse portfolio of brands, appealing to various interests and ages, featuring evergreen topics with global appeal. The Company&#8217;s portfolio of intellectual property can be licensed, re-licensed, and exploited for years to come, with revenue derived from multiple sources and territories.

Distribution 

&#160;

Children today spend upwards of 35 hours/week consuming various forms of media, a 7% increase or an additional 2.2 hours since 2009 (Source: Nickelodeon, November 2013). With the increased demand for and impact of media on kids&#8217; lives, we are focused on serving an underrepresented segment of the industry, namely &#8220;content with a purpose&#8221; meaning content that is both entertaining and enriching in a variety of interactive formats. With this distinct and focused mission, the Company is focused on expanding content distribution across multi-media platforms, extending its domestic and international presence, building awareness for its brands and building an engaged audience which in turn drives demand for its consumer products.

&#160;

During 2014, we recruited and hired a number of key personnel to manage the distribution of our content across all platforms in all markets:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; The Company formed a new global distribution division and appointed Andrew Berman to the newly created position of Senior Vice President - International Sales to oversee the division and the appointment of regional agents to represent the Company locally in key regions and in all formats, including Pay Television, Free or Broadcast Television, Video-on-Demand (&#8220;VOD&#8221;), subscription on demand (&#8220;SVOD&#8221;), DVDs/CDs and more. &#160; &#183; The Company formed a new global consumer products division and appointed Stone Newman to the newly created position of President, Global Consumer Products to manage all consumer products, licensing and merchandising sales for the Company&#8217;s brands, including toys, electronics, publishing, home goods, stationary, gifts, and much more. &#160;

Additionally, during the first quarter of 2014, the Company entered into an exclusive three year agreement with Sony DADC, the optical disc manufacturing and fulfillment arm of Sony, to provide all CD, DVD and BD replication, packaging and distribution to Genius Brands International&#8217;s customers. Under the terms of the long-term, exclusive supply chain services agreement, the Company will order a minimum level of disc replication, packaging and distribution services for its content across all physical media, including DVD, CD, and Blu-ray from Sony DADC. As consideration for these minimum order levels, the Company received a total of $1,500,000, $750,000 during the first quarter of 2014 and $750,000 during the first quarter of 2015.

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160; 

The commercial success of every GBI property is reliant on its ability to attract an engaged audience that in turn drives demand for its products. As the Company&#8217;s properties are introduced into the marketplace, these efforts will intensify to ensure parents and kids are aware of the Company&#8217;s offerings.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; The Company formed a new Digital division and in January, 2015 appointed industry veteran Jason Brumbaugh to the newly created position of Vice President of Digital, responsible for the Company&#8217;s digital presence in addition to all forms of online marketing that will be critical to building engaged audiences online. Mr. Brumbaugh held producer and senior producer positions at Disney Interactive Media Group, the Hub Network, DIC Entertainment, and Knowledge Kid Network. &#160; &#183; The Company works with 360-Communications, a public relations agency that proactively solicits publicity for the Company&#8217;s content and products, both among the trade and consumers. &#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

GBI competes against creators of children&#8217;s content, including Disney, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, Sesame Street, and many others, small and large. In the crowded children&#8217;s entertainment space, the Company competes with other content creators for distribution and retail shelf space that is largely now dedicated to the large studios. To compete, the Company is focused on filling a void in the marketplace by offering something the big studios do not: &#8220;content and products with a purpose,&#8221; a positioning and important point of differentiation embraced by the industry, as well as parents and educators.

Customers and Licensees 

&#160;

During 2015, the Company was reliant on one or a few major customers. However, given the changes in its business model, it will be working with a larger network of customers and partners from around the world including broadcasters, consumer products licensees, and retailers. This broad cross section includes companies such as Comcast, Netflix, Sony, PBS, Leap Frog Enterprises, Enesco, Zak Designs, Penguin Publishing, Manhattan Toys, Amazon, Barnes &#38; Noble, Target, Bertelsmann Music Group, InGrooves, Discovery International, TF1 and many others both domestically and internationally.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The FCC requires broadcast networks to air a required number of hours of Educational and Informational content (E/I). The Company is also subject to online distribution regulations, namely the FTC&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) which regulates the collection of information of children younger than 13 years old.

&#160;

We are currently subject to regulations applicable to businesses generally, including numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing, enforcement and advertising of credit accounts, and limitations on the maximum amount of finance charges that may be charged by a credit provider. Although credit to some of our customers is provided by third parties without recourse to us based upon a customer&#8217;s failure to pay, any restrictive change in the regulation of credit, including the imposition of, or changes in, interest rate ceilings, could adversely affect the cost or availability of credit to our customers and, consequently, our results of operations or financial condition.

&#160;

Licensed toy products are subject to regulation under the Consumer Product Safety Act and regulations issued thereunder. These laws authorize the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the &#8220;CPSC&#8221;) to protect the public from products which present a substantial risk of injury. The CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall such products. The CPSC may also impose fines or penalties on manufacturers or retailers. Similar laws exist in some states and other countries in which we plan to market our products. Although we do not manufacture and may not directly distribute toy products, a recall of any of the products may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

&#160;

We also maintain websites which include our corporate website located at www.gnusbrands.com, as well as www.babygenius.com, www.smckids.com, www.slam7.com, and www.edisonsecretlab.com. These websites are subject to laws and regulations directly applicable to Internet communications and commerce, which is a currently developing area of the law. The United States has enacted Internet laws related to children&#8217;s privacy, copyrights and taxation. However, laws governing the Internet remain largely unsettled. The growth of the market for Internet commerce may result in more stringent consumer protection laws, both in the United States and abroad, that place additional burdens on companies conducting business over the Internet. We cannot predict with certainty what impact such laws will have on our business in the future. In order to comply with new or existing laws regulating Internet commerce, we may need to modify the manner in which we conduct our website business, which may result in additional expense.

&#160;

Because our products are manufactured by third parties and licensees, the Company is not significantly impacted by federal, state and local environmental laws and does not have significant costs associated with compliance with such laws and regulations.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 15 full-time equivalent employees and an additional five temporary or contracted full-time equivalents in certain functions, such as accounting, production management, and design.

Company Information 

&#160;

We were incorporated in California on January 3, 2006 and reincorporated in Nevada in October 2011. We commenced operations in January 2006, assuming all of the rights and obligations of our then Chief Executive Officer, under an Asset Purchase Agreement between the Company and Genius Products, Inc., in which the Company obtained all rights, copyrights, and trademarks to the brands &#8220;Baby Genius,&#8221; &#8220;Little Genius,&#8221; &#8220;Kid Genius,&#8221; &#8220;123 Favorite Music&#8221; and &#8220;Wee Worship,&#8221; and all then existing productions under those titles. In October 2011, we (i) changed our domicile to Nevada from California, and (ii) changed our name to Genius Brands International, Inc. from Pacific Entertainment Corporation (the &#8220;Reincorporation&#8221;). In connection with the Reincorporation, we changed our trading symbol from &#8220;PENT&#8221; to &#8220;GNUS.&#8221;

&#160;

On November 15, 2013, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) with A Squared Entertainment LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#8220;A Squared&#8221;), A Squared Holdings LLC, a California limited liability company and the sole member of A Squared (the &#8220;Parent Member&#8221;), and A2E Acquisition LLC, its newly formed, wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary (&#8220;Acquisition Sub&#8221;). Upon closing of the transactions contemplated under the Merger Agreement (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;), which occurred concurrently with entering into the Merger Agreement, the Acquisition Sub merged with and into A Squared, and A Squared, as the surviving entity, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the Merger, the Company acquired the business and operations of A Squared.
