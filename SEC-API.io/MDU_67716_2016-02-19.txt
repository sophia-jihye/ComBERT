 Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties 

General 

The Company is a diversified natural resource company, which was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1924. Its principal executive offices are at 1200 West Century Avenue, P.O. Box 5650, Bismarck, North Dakota 58506-5650, telephone (701) 530-1000. 

Montana-Dakota, through the electric and natural gas distribution segments, generates, transmits and distributes electricity and distributes natural gas in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. Cascade distributes natural gas in Oregon and Washington. Intermountain distributes natural gas in Idaho. Great Plains distributes natural gas in western Minnesota and southeastern North Dakota. These operations also supply related value-added services. 

The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Centennial, owns WBI Holdings, Knife River, MDU Construction Services, Centennial Resources and Centennial Capital. WBI Holdings is comprised of the pipeline and midstream segment; Dakota Prairie Refinery, which is reflected in the refining segment; and Fidelity, the Company's exploration and production business. For more information on Dakota Prairie Refinery, see Item 8 - Note 17 . Knife River is the construction materials and contracting segment, MDU Construction Services is the construction services segment, and Centennial Resources and Centennial Capital are both reflected in the Other category. 

In the second quarter of 2015, the Company announced its plan to market Fidelity and exit that line of business. In the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into purchase and sale agreements to sell the vast majority of Fidelity's assets. Therefore, Fidelity's results are reflected in discontinued operations, other than certain general and administrative costs and interest expense which are reflected in the Other category. For more information on the Company's business segments and discontinued operations, see Item 8 - Notes 2 &#32;and 13 . 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company had 8,689 employees with 149 employed at MDU Resources Group, Inc., 1,027 at Montana-Dakota, 34 at Great Plains, 317 at Cascade, 239 at Intermountain, 530 at WBI Holdings, 2,945 at Knife River and 3,448 at MDU Construction Services. The number of employees at certain Company operations fluctuates during the year depending upon the number and size of construction projects. The Company considers its relations with employees to be satisfactory. 

The following information regarding the number of employees represented by labor contracts is as of December 31, 2015 . 

At Montana-Dakota and WBI Energy Transmission, 354 and 76 employees, respectively, are represented by the IBEW. Labor contracts with such employees are in effect through April 30, 2018, and March 31, 2018, respectively.

&#160; 

At Cascade, 179 employees are represented by the ICWU. The labor contract with the field operations group is effective through April 1, 2018. 

At Intermountain, 126 employees are represented by the UA. Labor contracts with such employees are in effect through September 30, 2016. 

Knife River operates under 43 labor contracts that represent 455 of its construction materials employees. Knife River is in negotiations on four of its labor contracts. 

MDU Construction Services has 155 labor contracts representing the majority of its employees. 

The majority of the labor contracts contain provisions that prohibit work stoppages or strikes and provide for binding arbitration dispute resolution in the event of an extended disagreement. 

The Company's principal properties, which are of varying ages and are of different construction types, are generally in good condition, are well maintained and are generally suitable and adequate for the purposes for which they are used. 

The financial results and data applicable to each of the Company's business segments, as well as their financing requirements, are set forth in Item 7 - MD&#38;A and Item 8 - Note 13 &#32;and Supplementary Financial Information. 

The operations of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations providing for air, water and solid waste pollution control; state facility-siting regulations; zoning and planning regulations of certain state and local authorities; federal health and safety regulations and state hazard communication standards. The Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with these regulations, except as to what may be ultimately determined with regard to items discussed in Environmental matters in Item 8 - Note 17 . There are no pending CERCLA actions for any of the Company's properties, other than the Portland, Oregon, Harbor Superfund Site and the Bremerton Gasworks Superfund Site. 

The Company produces GHG emissions primarily from its fossil fuel electric generating facilities, as well as from natural gas pipeline and storage systems, operations of equipment and fleet vehicles, and refining activities. GHG emissions also result from customer use of natural gas for heating and other uses. As interest in reductions in GHG emissions has grown, the Company has developed renewable generation with lower or no GHG emissions. Governmental legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding environmental and energy policy are continuously evolving and could negatively impact the Company's operations and financial results. Until legislation and regulation are finalized, the impact of these measures cannot be accurately predicted. The Company will continue to monitor legislative and regulatory activity related to environmental and energy policy initiatives. Disclosure regarding specific environmental matters applicable to each of the Company's businesses is set forth under each business description later. In addition, for a discussion of the Company's risks related to environmental laws and regulations, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.

Electric 

General &#160; Montana-Dakota provides electric service at retail, serving more than 142,000 residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in 177 communities and adjacent rural areas as of December 31, 2015 . The principal properties owned by Montana-Dakota for use in its electric operations include interests in 13 electric generating facilities and three small portable diesel generators, as further described under System Supply, System Demand and Competition, approximately 3,100 and 5,000 miles of transmission and distribution lines, respectively, and 73 transmission and 318 distribution substations. Montana-Dakota has obtained and holds, or is in the process of renewing, valid and existing franchises authorizing it to conduct its electric operations in all of the municipalities it serves where such franchises are required. Montana-Dakota intends to protect its service area and seek renewal of all expiring franchises. At December 31, 2015 , Montana-Dakota's net electric plant investment was $1.3 billion. 

The percentage of Montana-Dakota's 2015 &#32;retail electric utility operating revenues by jurisdiction is as follows: North Dakota - 65 percent; Montana - 21 percent; Wyoming - 9 percent; and South Dakota - 5 percent. Retail electric rates, service, accounting and certain security issuances are subject to regulation by the NDPSC, MTPSC, SDPUC and WYPSC. The interstate transmission and wholesale electric power operations of Montana-Dakota also are subject to regulation by the FERC under provisions of the Federal Power Act, as are interconnections with other utilities and power generators, the issuance of securities, accounting and other matters.

&#160; 

Through MISO, Montana-Dakota has access to wholesale energy, ancillary services and capacity markets for its integrated system. MISO is a regional transmission organization responsible for operational control of the transmission systems of its members. MISO provides security center operations, tariff administration and operates day-ahead and real-time energy markets, ancillary services and capacity markets. As a member of MISO, Montana-Dakota's generation is sold into the MISO energy market and its energy needs are purchased from that market. 

System Supply, System Demand and Competition &#160; Through an interconnected electric system, Montana-Dakota serves markets in portions of western North Dakota, including Bismarck, Mandan, Dickinson, Williston and Watford City; eastern Montana, including Sidney, Glendive and Miles City; and northern South Dakota, including Mobridge. The maximum electric peak demand experienced to date attributable to Montana-Dakota's sales to retail customers on the interconnected system was 611,542 kW in August 2015. Montana-Dakota's latest forecast for its interconnected system indicates that its annual peak will continue to occur during the summer and the sales growth rate through 2020 &#32;will approximate three percent annually. The interconnected system consists of 12 electric generating facilities and three small portable diesel generators, which have an aggregate nameplate rating attributable to Montana-Dakota's interest of 704,143 kW and total net ZRCs of 513.2 &#32;in 2015 . ZRCs are a MW of demand equivalent measure and are allocated to individual generators to meet planning reserve margin requirements within MISO. For 2015 , Montana-Dakota's total ZRCs, including its firm purchase power contracts, were 547.3 . Montana-Dakota's planning reserve margin requirement within MISO was 547.3 &#32;for 2015 . Montana-Dakota's interconnected system electric generating capability includes four steam-turbine generating units using coal for fuel, three combustion turbine peaking stations, three wind electric generating facilities, a reciprocating internal combustion engine, a heat recovery electric generating facility and three small portable diesel generators. 

In December 2015, construction was completed on a wind farm consisting of 43 wind turbines totaling 107.5 MW of electric generation. On December 30, 2015, Montana-Dakota purchased the wind farm from Thunder Spirit Wind, LLC, at a total cost of approximately $214 million including purchase price, internal costs and AFUDC with approximately $55 million already funded in 2014. The project began commercial operation in the fourth quarter of 2015. The generation interconnects at Montana-Dakota's substation near Hettinger, North Dakota. Montana-Dakota completed construction and commissioning of an 18.7 MW reciprocating internal combustion engine electric generation project at the existing Lewis &#38; Clark generating facility in Sidney, Montana in December of 2015. Additional energy will be purchased as needed, or if more economical, from the MISO market. In 2015 , Montana-Dakota purchased approximately 47 percent of its net kWh needs for its interconnected system through the MISO market. 

Through the Sheridan System, Montana-Dakota serves Sheridan, Wyoming, and neighboring communities. The maximum peak demand experienced to date attributable to Montana-Dakota sales to retail customers on that system was approximately 61,501 kW in July 2012. Montana-Dakota has a power supply contract with Black Hills Power, Inc. to purchase up to 49,000 kW of capacity annually through December 31, 2016. Wygen III serves a portion of the needs of its Sheridan-area customers.

Virtually all of the current fuel requirements of the Coyote, Heskett and Lewis &#38; Clark stations are met with coal supplied by subsidiaries of Westmoreland Coal Company under contracts that expire in May 2016, December 2021 and December 2017, respectively. The Coyote Station coal supply agreement provides for the purchase of coal necessary to supply the coal requirements of the Coyote Station or 30,000 tons per week, whichever may be the greater quantity at contracted pricing. The Heskett and Lewis &#38; Clark coal supply agreements provide for the purchase of coal necessary to supply the coal requirements of these stations at contracted pricing. Montana-Dakota estimates the Heskett and Lewis &#38; Clark coal requirement to be in the range of 450,000 to 550,000 tons and 250,000 to 350,000 tons per contract year, respectively. 

The owners of Coyote Station, including Montana-Dakota, have a contract with Coyote Creek for coal supply to the Coyote Station beginning May 2016 until December 2040. Montana-Dakota estimates the Coyote Station coal supply agreement to be approximately 2.5 million tons per contract year. For more information, see Item 8 - Note 17 . 

The owners of Big Stone Station, including Montana-Dakota, have coal supply agreements, which meet a portion of the Big Stone Station's fuel requirements, for the purchase of 500,000 tons in 2016 from Peabody Coalsales, LLC and 750,000 in 2016 and 2017 from Alpha Coal Sales Co., LLC both at contracted pricing. The remainder of the Big Stone Station fuel requirements will be secured through separate future contracts. 

Montana-Dakota has a coal supply agreement with Wyodak Resources Development Corp., to supply the coal requirements of Wygen III at contracted pricing through June 1, 2060. Montana-Dakota estimates the maximum annual coal consumption of the facility to be 585,000 tons.

Montana-Dakota expects that it has secured adequate capacity available through existing baseload generating stations, renewable generation, turbine peaking stations, demand reduction programs and firm contracts to meet the peak customer demand requirements of its customers through mid-2017. Future capacity that is needed to replace contracts and meet system growth requirements is expected to be met by constructing new generation resources, or acquiring additional capacity through power purchase contracts or the MISO capacity auction. For more information regarding potential power generation projects, see Item 7 - MD&#38;A - Prospective Information - Electric and natural gas distribution. 

Montana-Dakota has major interconnections with its neighboring utilities and considers these interconnections adequate for coordinated planning, emergency assistance, exchange of capacity and energy and power supply reliability. 

Montana-Dakota is subject to competition in varying degrees, in certain areas, from rural electric cooperatives, on-site generators, co-generators and municipally owned systems. In addition, competition in varying degrees exists between electricity and alternative forms of energy such as natural gas. 

Regulatory Matters and Revenues Subject to Refund &#160; In North Dakota, Montana-Dakota reflects monthly increases or decreases in fuel and purchased power costs (including demand charges) and is deferring those electric fuel and purchased power costs that are greater or less than amounts presently being recovered through its existing rate schedules. In Montana, a monthly Fuel and Purchased Power Tracking Adjustment mechanism allows Montana-Dakota to reflect 90 percent of the increases or decreases in fuel and purchased power costs (including demand charges) and Montana-Dakota is deferring 90 percent of costs that are greater or less than amounts presently being recovered through its existing rate schedules. A fuel adjustment clause contained in South Dakota jurisdictional electric rate schedules allows Montana-Dakota to reflect monthly increases or decreases in fuel and purchased power costs (excluding demand charges). In Wyoming, an annual Electric Power Supply Cost Adjustment mechanism allows Montana-Dakota to reflect increases or decreases in purchased power costs (including demand charges but excluding increases or decreases from base coal price) related to power supply and Montana-Dakota is deferring costs that are greater or less than amounts presently being recovered through its existing rate schedules. Such orders generally provide that these amounts are recoverable or refundable through rate adjustments which are filed annually. For more information, see Item 8 - Note 4 . 

In North Dakota, Montana-Dakota recovers in rates the costs associated with environmental upgrades at Big Stone Station and Lewis &#38; Clark Station. Montana-Dakota will maintain a tracker account until all costs are recovered or until the associated costs are reflected in base rates as a part of a general rate case. 

In North Dakota, Montana-Dakota has the ability to recover the costs associated with new generation through a rider mechanism. Montana-Dakota will utilize this rider mechanism for new generation until such time as the costs and investment are included in base rates. For the Thunder Spirit Wind project, Montana-Dakota implemented a renewable resource cost adjustment rider. Montana-Dakota also has in place in North Dakota a transmission tracker to recover transmission costs from its regional transmission operator, MISO. The tracking mechanism has an annual true-up. 

For more information on regulatory matters, see Item 8 - Note 16 . 

Environmental Matters &#160; Montana-Dakota's electric operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations providing for air, water and solid waste pollution control; state facility-siting regulations; zoning and planning regulations of certain state and local authorities; federal health and safety regulations; and state hazard communication standards. Montana-Dakota believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations. 

Montana-Dakota's electric generating facilities have Title V Operating Permits, under the Clean Air Act, issued by the states in which they operate. Each of these permits has a five-year life. Near the expiration of these permits, renewal applications are submitted. Permits continue in force beyond the expiration date, provided the application for renewal is submitted by the required date, usually six months prior to expiration. The Title V Operating Permit renewal application for Big Stone Station was submitted timely to the South Dakota DENR in November 2013. Big Stone Station continues to operate under conditions of the Title V Operating Permit issued by the South Dakota DENR in June 2009. It is expected that a final renewed permit will be issued in 2016 with the completion of the BART air quality control system. Wygen III is allowed to operate under the facility's construction permit until the Title V Operating Permit is issued by the Wyoming

&#160; 

Department of Environmental Quality. The Title V Operating Permit application for Wygen III was submitted timely in January 2011, with the permit expected to be issued in 2016. The Title V Operating Permit renewal application for Lewis &#38; Clark Station was submitted timely in February 2014 to the Montana DEQ and the permit was issued July 2015. The Title V Operating Permit renewal application for Heskett Station was submitted timely in August 2014 to the North Dakota Department of Health and the permit was issued July 2015. The Title V Operating Permits for the Miles City and Glendive stations expire in August 2016, and the renewal applications are expected to be submitted to the Montana DEQ in early 2016. 

State water discharge permits issued under the requirements of the Clean Water Act are maintained for power production facilities on the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers. These permits also have five-year lives. Montana-Dakota renews these permits as necessary prior to expiration. Other permits held by these facilities may include an initial siting permit, which is typically a one-time, preconstruction permit issued by the state; state permits to dispose of combustion by-products; state authorizations to withdraw water for operations; and Army Corps permits to construct water intake structures. Montana-Dakota's Army Corps permits grant one-time permission to construct and do not require renewal. Other permit terms vary and the permits are renewed as necessary. 

Montana-Dakota's electric operations are conditionally exempt small-quantity hazardous waste generators and subject only to minimum regulation under the RCRA. Montana-Dakota routinely handles PCBs from its electric operations in accordance with federal requirements. PCB storage areas are registered with the EPA as required. 

Montana-Dakota incurred $46.0 million of environmental capital expenditures in 2015 , largely for the installation of a BART air quality control system at the Big Stone Station. Environmental capital expenditures are estimated to be $14.8 million, $4.1 million and $2.8 million in 2016 , 2017 &#32;and 2018 , respectively. Projects for 2016 &#32;through 2018 &#32;include sulfur-dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury and non-mercury metals emission control equipment installation and anticipated costs for coal ash disposal at electric generating stations. Montana-Dakota's capital and operational expenditures could also be affected in a variety of ways by future air emission regulations and coal ash management requirements, including the Clean Power Plan rule published by the EPA in October 2015. Montana-Dakota is evaluating the Clean Power Plan, which requires existing fossil fuel-fired electric generation facilities to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It is unknown at this time what each state will require for emissions limits or reductions from each of Montana-Dakota's owned and jointly owned fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. Compliance costs will become clearer as final state plans are completed and submitted to the EPA by September 2018. On February 9, 2016, the United States Supreme Court granted an application for a stay of the Clean Power Plan pending disposition of the applicants' petition for review in the D.C. Circuit Court and disposition of the applicants' petition for a writ of certiorari if such a writ is sought. Montana-Dakota has not included estimates for capital expenditures in 2016 through 2018 for the potential compliance requirements of the Clean Power Plan. 

Natural Gas Distribution 

General &#160; The Company's natural gas distribution operations consist of Montana-Dakota, Great Plains, Cascade and Intermountain, which sell natural gas at retail, serving over 906,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in 334 communities and adjacent rural areas across eight states as of December 31, 2015 , and provide natural gas transportation services to certain customers on the Company's systems. These services are provided through distribution systems aggregating approximately 19,100 miles. The natural gas distribution operations have obtained and hold, or are in the process of renewing, valid and existing franchises authorizing them to conduct their natural gas operations in all of the municipalities they serve where such franchises are required. These operations intend to protect their service areas and seek renewal of all expiring franchises. At December 31, 2015 , the natural gas distribution operations' net natural gas distribution plant investment was $1.3 billion. 

The percentage of the natural gas distribution operations' 2015 &#32;natural gas utility operating sales revenues by jurisdiction is as follows: Idaho - 32 percent; Washington - 26 percent; North Dakota - 15 percent; Montana - 8 percent; Oregon - 8 percent; South Dakota - 6 percent; Minnesota - 3 percent; and Wyoming - 2 percent. The natural gas distribution operations are subject to regulation by the IPUC, MNPUC, MTPSC, NDPSC, OPUC, SDPUC, WUTC and WYPSC regarding retail rates, service, accounting and certain security issuances. 

System Supply, System Demand and Competition &#32;The natural gas distribution operations serve retail natural gas markets, consisting principally of residential and firm commercial space and water heating users, in portions of Idaho, including Boise, Nampa, Twin Falls, Pocatello and Idaho Falls; western Minnesota, including Fergus Falls, Marshall and Crookston; eastern Montana, including Billings, Glendive and Miles City; North Dakota, including Bismarck, Mandan, Dickinson, Wahpeton, Williston, Watford City, Minot and Jamestown; central and eastern Oregon, including Bend, Pendleton, Ontario and Baker City; western and north-central South Dakota, including Rapid City, Pierre, Spearfish and Mobridge; western, southeastern and south-central Washington, including Bellingham, Bremerton, Longview, Aberdeen, Wenatchee/Moses Lake, Mount Vernon, Tri-Cities, Walla Walla and Yakima; and northern Wyoming, including Sheridan and Lovell. These markets are highly seasonal and sales volumes depend largely on the weather, the effects of which are mitigated in certain jurisdictions by a weather normalization mechanism discussed in Regulatory Matters. In addition to the residential and commercial sales, the utilities transport natural gas for larger commercial and industrial customers who purchase their own supply of natural gas. 

&#160; 

MDU Resources Group, Inc. &#32;Form 10-K 11 

Part I 

&#160; 

Competition in varying degrees exists between natural gas and other fuels and forms of energy. The natural gas distribution operations have established various natural gas transportation service rates for their distribution businesses to retain interruptible commercial and industrial loads. These services have enhanced the natural gas distribution operations' competitive posture with alternative fuels, although certain customers have bypassed the distribution systems by directly accessing transmission pipelines within close proximity. These bypasses did not have a material effect on results of operations. 

The natural gas distribution operations and various distribution transportation customers obtain their system requirements directly from producers, processors and marketers. The Company's purchased natural gas is supplied by a portfolio of contracts specifying market-based pricing and is transported under transportation agreements with WBI Energy Transmission, Northern Border Pipeline Company, Northwest Pipeline GP, Northern Natural Gas, Gas Transmission Northwest LLC, Northwestern Energy, Viking Gas Transmission Company, Westcoast Energy Inc., Ruby Pipeline LLC, Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd. and NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd. The natural gas distribution operations have contracts for storage services to provide gas supply during the winter heating season and to meet peak day demand with various storage providers, including WBI Energy Transmission, Questar Pipeline Company, Northwest Pipeline GP and Northern Natural Gas. In addition, certain of the operations have entered into natural gas supply management agreements with various parties. Demand for natural gas, which is a widely traded commodity, has historically been sensitive to seasonal heating and industrial load requirements as well as changes in market price. The natural gas distribution operations believe that, based on current and projected domestic and regional supplies of natural gas and the pipeline transmission network currently available through their suppliers and pipeline service providers, supplies are adequate to meet their system natural gas requirements for the next decade. 

Regulatory Matters The natural gas distribution operations' retail natural gas rate schedules contain clauses permitting adjustments in rates based upon changes in natural gas commodity, transportation and storage costs. Current tariffs allow for recovery or refunds of under- or over-recovered gas costs through rate adjustments which are filed annually. 

Montana-Dakota's North Dakota and South Dakota natural gas tariffs contain weather normalization mechanisms applicable to certain firm customers that adjust the distribution delivery charge revenues to reflect weather fluctuations during the November 1 through May 1 billing periods. 

On December 28, 2015, the OPUC approved an extension of Cascade's decoupling mechanism until January 1, 2020, with an agreement that Cascade would initiate a review of the mechanism by September 30, 2019. Cascade also has an earnings sharing mechanism with respect to its Oregon jurisdictional operations as required by the OPUC. 

For more information on regulatory matters, see Item 8 - Note 16 . 

Environmental Matters &#160; The natural gas distribution operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental, facility-siting, zoning and planning laws and regulations. The natural gas distribution operations believe they are in substantial compliance with those regulations. 

The Company's natural gas distribution operations are conditionally exempt small-quantity hazardous waste generators and subject only to minimum regulation under the RCRA. Certain locations of the natural gas distribution operations routinely handle PCBs from their natural gas operations in accordance with federal requirements. PCB storage areas are registered with the EPA as required. Capital and operational expenditures for natural gas distribution operations could be affected in a variety of ways by potential new GHG legislation or regulation. In particular, such legislation or regulation would likely increase capital expenditures for energy efficiency and conservation programs and operational costs associated with GHG emissions compliance. Natural gas distribution operations expect to recover the operational and capital expenditures for GHG regulatory compliance in rates consistent with the recovery of other reasonable costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations. 

The natural gas distribution operations did not incur any material environmental expenditures in 2015 . Except as to what may be ultimately determined with regard to the issues described later, the natural gas distribution operations do not expect to incur any material capital expenditures related to environmental compliance with current laws and regulations through 2018 . 

Montana-Dakota has had an economic interest in four historic manufactured gas plants and Great Plains has had an economic interest in one historic manufactured gas plant within their service territories. Montana-Dakota is investigating a former manufactured gas plant in Montana and is planning an investigation of a former manufactured gas plant in North Dakota. Montana-Dakota will seek recovery in its natural gas rates charged to customers for any remediation costs incurred for these sites. None of the remaining former manufactured gas plant sites of Montana-Dakota or Great Plains are being actively investigated. Cascade has had an economic interest in nine former manufactured gas plants within its service territory. Cascade has been involved in the investigation and remediation of three manufactured gas plants in Washington and Oregon. See Item 8 - Note 17 &#32;for a further discussion of these three manufactured gas plants. To the extent these claims are not covered by insurance, Cascade will seek recovery through the OPUC and WUTC of remediation costs in its natural gas rates charged to customers.

Pipeline and Midstream 

General &#160; WBI Energy owns and operates both regulated and nonregulated businesses. The regulated business of this segment, WBI Energy Transmission, owns and operates approximately 4,000 miles of transmission, gathering and storage lines in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. Three underground storage fields in Montana and Wyoming provide storage services to local distribution companies, producers, natural gas marketers and others, and serve to enhance system deliverability. Its system is strategically located near five natural gas producing basins, making natural gas supplies available to its transportation and storage customers. The system has 13 interconnecting points with other pipeline facilities allowing for the receipt and/or delivery of natural gas to and from other regions of the country and from Canada. Under the Natural Gas Act, as amended, WBI Energy Transmission is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC regarding certificate, rate, service and accounting matters, and at December 31, 2015 , its net plant investment was $363.4 million. 

The nonregulated business of this segment owns and operates gathering facilities in Montana and Wyoming. In 2015, the Company sold its gathering facilities in Colorado. It also owns a 50 percent undivided interest in the Pronghorn assets located in western North Dakota, which include a natural gas processing plant, both oil and gas gathering pipelines, an oil storage terminal and an oil pipeline. In total, facilities include approximately 800 miles of operated field gathering lines, some of which interconnect with WBI Energy's regulated pipeline system. The nonregulated business provides natural gas and oil gathering services, natural gas processing and a variety of other energy-related services, including cathodic protection, water hauling, contract compression operations, measurement services, and energy efficiency product sales and installation services to large end-users. 

A majority of its pipeline and midstream business is transacted in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States. 

For information regarding natural gas gathering operations litigation, see Item 8 - Note 17 . 

System Supply, System Demand and Competition Natural gas supplies emanate from traditional and nontraditional production activities in the region and from off-system supply sources. While certain traditional regional supply sources are in various stages of decline, incremental supply from nontraditional sources have been developed which has helped support WBI Energy Transmission's supply needs. This includes new natural gas supply associated with the continued development of the Bakken area in Montana and North Dakota. In addition, off-system supply sources are available through the Company's interconnections with other pipeline systems. WBI Energy Transmission expects to facilitate the movement of these supplies by making available its transportation and storage services. WBI Energy Transmission will continue to look for opportunities to increase transportation, gathering and storage services through system expansion and/or other pipeline interconnections or enhancements that could provide substantial future benefits. 

WBI Energy Transmission's underground natural gas storage facilities have a certificated storage capacity of approximately 353 Bcf, including 193 Bcf of working gas capacity, 85 Bcf of cushion gas and 75 Bcf of native gas. These storage facilities enable customers to purchase natural gas at more uniform daily volumes throughout the year and meet winter peak requirements. 

WBI Energy Transmission competes with several pipelines for its customers' transportation, storage and gathering business and at times may discount rates in an effort to retain market share. However, the strategic location of its system near five natural gas producing basins and the availability of underground storage and gathering services, along with interconnections with other pipelines, serve to enhance its competitive position. 

Although certain of WBI Energy Transmission's firm customers, including its largest firm customer Montana-Dakota, serve relatively secure residential and commercial end-users, they generally all have some price-sensitive end-users that could switch to alternate fuels. 

WBI Energy Transmission transports substantially all of Montana-Dakota's natural gas, primarily utilizing firm transportation agreements, which for 2015 &#32;represented 43 percent of WBI Energy Transmission's subscribed firm transportation contract demand. The majority of the firm transportation agreements with Montana-Dakota expire in June 2017. In addition, Montana-Dakota has contracts with WBI Energy Transmission to provide firm storage services to facilitate meeting Montana-Dakota's winter peak requirements expiring in July 2035. 

The nonregulated business competes with several midstream companies for existing customers, the expansion of its systems and the installation of new systems. Its strong position in the fields in which it operates, its focus on customer service and the variety of services it offers, along with its interconnection with various other pipelines, serve to enhance its competitive position. 

Environmental Matters &#160; The pipeline and midstream operations are generally subject to federal, state and local environmental, facility-siting, zoning and planning laws and regulations. The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with those regulations. 

Ongoing operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the RCRA and other state and federal regulations. Administration of many provisions of these laws has been delegated to the states where WBI Energy and its subsidiaries operate. Permit terms vary and all 

&#160; 

MDU Resources Group, Inc. &#32;Form 10-K 13 

Part I 

&#160; 

permits carry operational compliance conditions. Some permits require annual renewal, some have terms ranging from one to five years and others have no expiration date. Permits are renewed and modified, as necessary, based on defined permit expiration dates, operational demand and/or regulatory changes. 

Detailed environmental assessments and/or environmental impact statements as required by the National Environmental Policy Act are included in the FERC's environmental review process for both the construction and abandonment of WBI Energy Transmission's natural gas transmission pipelines, compressor stations and storage facilities. 

The pipeline and midstream operations did not incur any material environmental expenditures in 2015 &#32;and do not expect to incur any material capital expenditures related to environmental compliance with current laws and regulations through 2018 . 

Construction Materials and Contracting 

General &#160; Knife River operates construction materials and contracting businesses headquartered in Alaska, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Oregon, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. These operations mine, process and sell construction aggregates (crushed stone, sand and gravel); produce and sell asphalt mix and supply ready-mixed concrete for use in most types of construction, including roads, freeways and bridges, as well as homes, schools, shopping centers, office buildings and industrial parks. Although not common to all locations, other products include the sale of cement, liquid asphalt for various commercial and roadway applications, various finished concrete products and other building materials and related contracting services. 

For information regarding construction materials litigation, see Item 8 - Note 17 . 

The construction materials business had approximately $491 million in backlog at December 31, 2015 , compared to $438 million at December 31, 2014 . The Company anticipates that a significant amount of the current backlog will be completed during 2016 . 

Competition &#160; Knife River's construction materials products are marketed under highly competitive conditions. Price is the principal competitive force to which these products are subject, with service, quality, delivery time and proximity to the customer also being significant factors. The number and size of competitors varies in each of Knife River's principal market areas and product lines. 

The demand for construction materials products is significantly influenced by the cyclical nature of the construction industry in general. In addition, construction materials activity in certain locations may be seasonal in nature due to the effects of weather. The key economic factors affecting product demand are changes in the level of local, state and federal governmental spending, general economic conditions within the market area that influence both the commercial and residential sectors, and prevailing interest rates. 

Knife River is not dependent on any single customer or group of customers for sales of its products and services, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on its construction materials businesses. 

Reserve Information &#32;Aggregate reserve estimates are calculated based on the best available data. This data is collected from drill holes and other subsurface investigations, as well as investigations of surface features such as mine high walls and other exposures of the aggregate reserves. Mine plans, production history and geologic data also are utilized to estimate reserve quantities. Most acquisitions are made of mature businesses with established reserves, as distinguished from exploratory-type properties. 

Estimates are based on analyses of the data described above by experienced internal mining engineers, operating personnel and geologists. Property setbacks and other regulatory restrictions and limitations are identified to determine the total area available for mining. Data described previously are used to calculate the thickness of aggregate materials to be recovered. Topography associated with alluvial sand and gravel deposits is typically flat and volumes of these materials are calculated by applying the thickness of the resource over the areas available for mining. Volumes are then converted to tons by using an appropriate conversion factor. Typically, 1.5 tons per cubic yard in the ground is used for sand and gravel deposits. 

Topography associated with the hard rock reserves is typically much more diverse. Therefore, using available data, a final topography map is created and computer software is utilized to compute the volumes between the existing and final topographies. Volumes are then converted to tons by using an appropriate conversion factor. Typically, 2 tons per cubic yard in the ground is used for hard rock quarries. 

Estimated reserves are probable reserves as defined in Securities Act Industry Guide 7. Remaining reserves are based on estimates of volumes that can be economically extracted and sold to meet current market and product applications. The reserve estimates include only salable tonnage and thus exclude waste materials that are generated in the crushing and processing phases of the operation. Approximately 955 million tons of the 1.0 billion tons of aggregate reserves are permitted reserves. The remaining reserves are on properties that are expected to be permitted for mining under current regulatory requirements. The data used to calculate the remaining reserves may require revisions in the future to account for changes in customer requirements and unknown geological occurrences. The years remaining 

&#160; 

14 &#32;&#32;&#32;MDU Resources Group, Inc. &#32;Form 10-K 

Part I 

&#160; 

were calculated by dividing remaining reserves by the three-year average sales from 2013 &#32;through 2015 . Actual useful lives of these reserves will be subject to, among other things, fluctuations in customer demand, customer specifications, geological conditions and changes in mining plans. 

The following table sets forth details applicable to the Company's aggregate reserves under ownership or lease as of December 31, 2015 , and sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 :

The 1.0 billion tons of estimated aggregate reserves at December 31, 2015 , are comprised of 476 million tons that are owned and 547 million tons that are leased. Approximately 31 percent of the tons under lease have lease expiration dates of 20 years or more. The weighted average years remaining on all leases containing estimated probable aggregate reserves is approximately 22 years, including options for renewal that are at Knife River's discretion. Based on a three-year average of sales from 2013 &#32;through 2015 &#32;of leased reserves, the average time necessary to produce remaining aggregate reserves from such leases is approximately 61 years. Some sites have leases that expire prior to the exhaustion of the estimated reserves. The estimated reserve life assumes, based on Knife River's experience, that leases will be renewed to allow sufficient time to fully recover these reserves. 

The changes in Knife River's aggregate reserves for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

Environmental Matters &#160; Knife River's construction materials and contracting operations are subject to regulation customary for such operations, including federal, state and local environmental compliance and reclamation regulations. Except as to the issues described later, Knife River believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations. Individual permits applicable to Knife River's various operations are managed largely by local operations, particularly as they relate to application, modification, renewal, compliance and reporting procedures. 

Knife River's asphalt and ready-mixed concrete manufacturing plants and aggregate processing plants are subject to Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act requirements for controlling air emissions and water discharges. Some mining and construction activities also are subject to these 

&#160; 

MDU Resources Group, Inc. &#32;Form 10-K 15 

Part I 

&#160; 

laws. In most of the states where Knife River operates, these regulatory programs have been delegated to state and local regulatory authorities. Knife River's facilities also are subject to the RCRA as it applies to the management of hazardous wastes and underground storage tank systems. These programs also have generally been delegated to the state and local authorities in the states where Knife River operates. Knife River's facilities must comply with requirements for managing wastes and underground storage tank systems. 

Some Knife River activities are directly regulated by federal agencies. For example, certain in-water mining operations are subject to provisions of the Clean Water Act that are administered by the Army Corps. Knife River operates several such operations, including gravel bar skimming and dredging operations, and Knife River has the associated permits as required. The expiration dates of these permits vary, with five years generally being the longest term. 

Knife River's operations also are occasionally subject to the ESA. For example, land use regulations often require environmental studies, including wildlife studies, before a permit may be granted for a new or expanded mining facility or an asphalt or concrete plant. If endangered species or their habitats are identified, ESA requirements for protection, mitigation or avoidance apply. Endangered species protection requirements are usually included as part of land use permit conditions. Typical conditions include avoidance, setbacks, restrictions on operations during certain times of the breeding or rearing season, and construction or purchase of mitigation habitat. Knife River's operations also are subject to state and federal cultural resources protection laws when new areas are disturbed for mining operations or processing plants. Land use permit applications generally require that areas proposed for mining or other surface disturbances be surveyed for cultural resources. If any are identified, they must be protected or managed in accordance with regulatory agency requirements. 

The most comprehensive environmental permit requirements are usually associated with new mining operations, although requirements vary widely from state to state and even within states. In some areas, land use regulations and associated permitting requirements are minimal. However, some states and local jurisdictions have very demanding requirements for permitting new mines. Environmental impact reports are sometimes required before a mining permit application can even be considered for approval. These reports can take up to several years to complete. The report can include projected impacts of the proposed project on air and water quality, wildlife, noise levels, traffic, scenic vistas and other environmental factors. The reports generally include suggested actions to mitigate the projected adverse impacts. 

Provisions for public hearings and public comments are usually included in land use permit application review procedures in the counties where Knife River operates. After taking into account environmental, mine plan and reclamation information provided by the permittee as well as comments from the public and other regulatory agencies, the local authority approves or denies the permit application. Denial is rare, but land use permits often include conditions that must be addressed by the permittee. Conditions may include property line setbacks, reclamation requirements, environmental monitoring and reporting, operating hour restrictions, financial guarantees for reclamation, and other requirements intended to protect the environment or address concerns submitted by the public or other regulatory agencies. 

Knife River has been successful in obtaining mining and other land use permit approvals so sufficient permitted reserves are available to support its operations. For mining operations, this often requires considerable advanced planning to ensure sufficient time is available to complete the permitting process before the newly permitted aggregate reserve is needed to support Knife River's operations. 

Knife River's Gascoyne surface coal mine last produced coal in 1995 but continues to be subject to reclamation requirements of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, as well as the North Dakota Surface Mining Act. Portions of the Gascoyne Mine remain under reclamation bond until the 10-year revegetation liability period has expired. A portion of the original permit has been released from bond and additional areas are currently in the process of having the bond released. Knife River's intention is to request bond release as soon as it is deemed possible. 

Knife River did not incur any material environmental expenditures in 2015 &#32;and, except as to what may be ultimately determined with regard to the issues described later, Knife River does not expect to incur any material expenditures related to environmental compliance with current laws and regulations through 2018 . 

In December 2000, Knife River - Northwest was named by the EPA as a PRP in connection with the cleanup of a commercial property site, acquired by Knife River - Northwest in 1999, and part of the Portland, Oregon, Harbor Superfund Site. For more information, see Item 8 - Note 17 . 

In October 2015, the Oregon DEQ issued a Notice of Civil Penalty to LTM asserting violations of Oregon water quality statues and rules at a site in Coos County. For more information, see Item 8 - Note 17 . 

Mine Safety &#160; The Dodd-Frank Act requires disclosure of certain mine safety information. For more information, see Item 4 - Mine Safety Disclosures.

Construction Services 

General &#160; MDU Construction Services provides utility construction services specializing in constructing and maintaining electric and communication lines, gas pipelines, fire suppression systems, and external lighting and traffic signalization. This segment also provides utility excavation and inside electrical and mechanical services, and manufactures and distributes transmission line construction equipment and other supplies. These services are provided to utilities and large manufacturing, commercial, industrial, institutional and government customers. 

For information regarding construction services litigation, see Item 8 - Note 17 . 

Construction and maintenance crews are active year round. However, activity in certain locations may be seasonal in nature due to the effects of weather. 

MDU Construction Services operates a fleet of owned and leased trucks and trailers, support vehicles and specialty construction equipment, such as backhoes, excavators, trenchers, generators, boring machines and cranes. In addition, as of December 31, 2015 , MDU Construction Services owned or leased facilities in 17 states. This space is used for offices, equipment yards, warehousing, storage and vehicle shops. 

MDU Construction Services' backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job-specific contracts. The backlog at December 31, 2015 , was approximately $493 million compared to $305 million at December 31, 2014 . MDU Construction Services expects to complete a significant amount of this backlog during 2016 . Due to the nature of its contractual arrangements, in many instances MDU Construction Services' customers are not committed to the specific volumes of services to be purchased under a contract, but rather MDU Construction Services is committed to perform these services if and to the extent requested by the customer. Therefore, there can be no assurance as to the customers' requirements during a particular period or that such estimates at any point in time are predictive of future revenues. 

MDU Construction Services works with the National Electrical Contractors Association, the IBEW and other trade associations on hiring and recruiting a qualified workforce. 

Competition &#160; MDU Construction Services operates in a highly competitive business environment. Most of MDU Construction Services' work is obtained on the basis of competitive bids or by negotiation of either cost-plus or fixed-price contracts. The workforce and equipment are highly mobile, providing greater flexibility in the size and location of MDU Construction Services' market area. Competition is based primarily on price and reputation for quality, safety and reliability. The size and location of the services provided, as well as the state of the economy, will be factors in the number of competitors that MDU Construction Services will encounter on any particular project. MDU Construction Services believes that the diversification of the services it provides, the markets it serves throughout the United States and the management of its workforce will enable it to effectively operate in this competitive environment. 

Utilities and independent contractors represent the largest customer base for this segment. Accordingly, utility and subcontract work accounts for a significant portion of the work performed by MDU Construction Services and the amount of construction contracts is dependent to a certain extent on the level and timing of maintenance and construction programs undertaken by customers. MDU Construction Services relies on repeat customers and strives to maintain successful long-term relationships with these customers. 

Environmental Matters &#32;MDU Construction Services' operations are subject to regulation customary for the industry, including federal, state and local environmental compliance. MDU Construction Services believes it is in substantial compliance with these regulations. 

The nature of MDU Construction Services' operations is such that few, if any, environmental permits are required. Operational convenience supports the use of petroleum storage tanks in several locations, which are permitted under state programs authorized by the EPA. MDU Construction Services has no ongoing remediation related to releases from petroleum storage tanks. MDU Construction Services' operations are conditionally exempt small-quantity waste generators, subject to minimal regulation under the RCRA. Federal permits for specific construction and maintenance jobs that may require these permits are typically obtained by the hiring entity, and not by MDU Construction Services. 

MDU Construction Services did not incur any material environmental expenditures in 2015 &#32;and does not expect to incur any material capital expenditures related to environmental compliance with current laws and regulations through 2018 . 

Refining 

General &#160; WBI Energy, in conjunction with Calumet, formed Dakota Prairie Refining, to develop, build and operate Dakota Prairie Refinery. The refinery is designed as a 20,000-barrel-per-day facility located in the Bakken region in Stark County in western North Dakota. 

&#160; 

MDU Resources Group, Inc. &#32;Form 10-K 17 

Part I 

&#160; 

Construction of the refinery was completed in March 2015 and the refinery began commercial operations in May 2015. The refinery processes Bakken crude oil into diesel, naphtha, ATBs and other by-products. 

System Supply, System Demand and Competition &#32;Bakken crude oil is supplied to the refinery via a pipeline interconnect with the Belle Fourche Pipeline and a portion is trucked to the refinery from wells near the refinery. Crude oil contracts are generally secured on a month-to-month basis. Dakota Prairie Refining believes that adequate supplies of crude oil will continue to be available; however, more challenging to secure due to the slowdown in drilling activity in the Bakken region. 

The refinery sells diesel fuel at the refinery rack to diesel wholesalers. Naphtha is railed to Canada and sold to third parties primarily for use as a diluent for tar sands production. ATBs are railed and sold to other facilities for further processing. 

Dakota Prairie Refining's competitors include a number of large, integrated refiners with greater flexibility in responding to or absorbing market changes. Dakota Prairie Refining obtains all of its crude oil from third-party sources and competes with other purchasers in the local market area for these supplies. The availability and cost of crude oil, as well as the demand for and prices of the products the refining operations produce, are heavily influenced by global, as well as regional, supply and demand dynamics. Major competitors for the sale of Dakota Prairie Refining's refined products include other refineries both in the state and in the surrounding states that produce similar products. 

Environmental Matters &#32;Refinery operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. Permits are required under these laws for the operation of refineries, pipelines and related refining operations facilities, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations and permits will continue to have an impact on refining operations, results of operations, and capital requirements. Dakota Prairie Refining believes that its current operations are in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permits. 

Dakota Prairie Refining's operations and many of the products it manufactures are subject to certain requirements of the Clean Air Act as well as related state and local laws and regulations. The EPA has the authority under the Clean Air Act to modify the formulation of the refined transportation fuel products Dakota Prairie Refining manufactures in order to limit the emissions associated with their final use. In addition, in 2014, the EPA published a proposed rule that proposes amendments to refinery standards already in effect: the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from Petroleum. The proposed rule would also amend emission requirements under the existing Petroleum Refinery New Source Performance Standard. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 prescribe certain percentages of renewable fuels (e.g., ethanol and biofuels) that, where required by the Renewable Fuel Standard, must be blended into the refining operations' produced diesel or that requirement may be satisfied by purchasing RINs. For more information on RINs, see Item 8 - Note 6 . Dakota Prairie Refining's operations are also subject to the Clean Water Act, the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act and comparable state and local requirements. The Clean Water Act, the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act and analogous laws prohibit any discharge into surface waters, ground waters, injection wells and publicly owned treatment works except in conformance with legal authorization, such as pre-treatment permits and National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits, issued by federal, state and local governmental agencies. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits and analogous water discharge permits are valid for a maximum of five years and must be renewed. 

Compliance with current and future environmental regulations is not expected to require material capital expenditures through 2018 . 

Discontinued Operations 

General &#160; Discontinued operations includes the results of Fidelity other than certain general and administrative costs and interest expense. In the third and fourth quarters of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into purchase and sale agreements to sell the vast majority of Fidelity's assets, comprising greater than 93 percent of total production for 2014. The completion of the majority of these sales occurred in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the Company continues to market the remaining assets of Fidelity. For more information on discontinued operations, see Item 8 - Note 2 &#32;and Supplementary Financial Information. 

For information regarding litigation from discontinued operations, see Item 8 - Note 17 .
