Corporate History and Recent Developments 

&#160; 

We were incorporated pursuant to the laws of the State of Nevada on March 20, 2002 under the name Integrated Brand Solutions Inc., and on February 6, 2006, we changed our name to Upstream Biosciences Inc. From 2006 to December 2009, our company operated as a biotechnology company, and from 2010 until May 2013, our company had no operating business. 

&#160; 

On May 24, 2013, our then majority stockholders sold their interests in our company (consisting of 10,778,081 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 90% of the issued and outstanding voting security of our company) to RealSource Acquisition Group, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (&#8220;RSAG&#8221;), and Chesterfield Faring Ltd., a New York corporation in consideration of an aggregate of $175,000 in cash. RSAG is affiliated with The RealSource Group, a group of affiliated real estate brokerage and management companies based in Salt Lake City, Utah. On July 11, 2013, we changed our corporate name by merging with our newly formed, wholly owned subsidiary called RealSource Residential, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and we remained as the surviving corporation under the name &#8220;RealSource Residential, Inc.&#8221; The merger was effective on July 15, 2013 and was approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on August 5, 2013 

&#160; 

On July 9, 2013, the board of directors of our company approved a change in our fiscal year end from September 30 th to December 31 st . As a result of this change, we filed a Transition Report on Form 10-K for the three months ended December 31, 2013. Reference to any of our previous fiscal years means the fiscal years ended on September 30. 

&#160; 

Leveraging the experience of our management team and The RealSource Group, we planned to focus on acquiring, managing and holding primarily multi-family housing assets in anticipation of creating a real estate investment trust (a &#8220;REIT&#8221;). We began the process of acquiring interest in such multi-family housing assets during 2014. 

&#160; 

On December 9, 2013, we consummated the closing of a private placement offering (the &#8220;2013 Private Placement&#8221;) of 231 units (or &#8220;Units&#8221;) for $10,000 per Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of $2,310,000. Each Unit consisted of: (i) a $10,000 face value 12% Series A Senior Unsecured Convertible Promissory Note (collectively, the &#8220;Notes&#8221;), and (ii) one detachable Common Stock Purchase Warrant (collectively, the &#8220;Warrants&#8221;), each to purchase 10,000 shares (the &#8220;Warrant Shares&#8221;) of our common stock. The Notes accrued interest at 12% per year and had a maturity date of December 9, 2015. 

&#160; 

The Notes were convertible into shares of our common stock at $0.50 per share (subject to customary adjustments for stock splits and similar transactions), and would automatically convert into shares of our common stock at the then applicable conversion price in the event that the 90-day trading volume weighted average price per share of the common stock exceeds $1.50 per share at any time during the term of the Notes. 

&#160; 

Each Warrant included within each Unit granted to each investor the right, for a period of five (5) years from the closing of the 2013 Private Placement to subscribe for 10,000 shares of our common stock (i.e. 50% warrant coverage) at an exercise price equal to $2.00 per share. The exercise price of the Warrants is subject to adjust on the same terms as provided for in the Notes. As of the date of this Annual Report, an aggregate of 2,310,000 shares of common stock are available for issuance assuming full conversion of the Warrants. 

&#160; 

In connection with the closing of the 2013 Private Placement, we entered into definitive subscription agreements (the &#8220;Subscription Agreements&#8221;) with twenty-nine (29) accredited investors (the &#8220;Holders&#8221;). The Subscription Agreements contained customary representations, warranties and covenants. 

&#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Proceeds from the 2013 Private Placement were used to (i) acquire, on December 10, 2013 a $2.85 million face value subordinated mortgage note secured by the Cambridge Apartments in Gulfport, Mississippi (&#8220;Cambridge&#8221;) for approximately $1,073,000 (the &#8220;B Note&#8221;) and (ii) fund (in the amount of approximately $465,000) certain costs associated with a refinancing of the senior mortgage indebtedness encumbering Cambridge (which refinancing occurred concurrently with our acquisition of the B Note). Immediately upon the our acquisition of the B Note, we entered into a Right of First Refusal and Option Agreement with RS Cambridge Apartments, LLC (&#8220;RS Cambridge&#8221;), owners of Cambridge (the &#8220;Option Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which we converted the B Note into a right of first refusal and option (the &#8220;Option&#8221;) in the amount of approximately $1,538,000 (the &#8220;Option Payment&#8221;). The Option afforded us the right to acquire Cambridge within five (5) year after the closing of the 2013 Private Placement at the fair value of Cambridge as we negotiated with RS Cambridge. Under the Option, if RS Cambridge received an offer to purchase Cambridge during the option period, we would have had a right of first refusal to purchase Cambridge on the same terms as the offer. Had we elected not to match the offer, the Option Payment was required to be repaid upon the sale of Cambridge to the other buyer. In February 2016, RS Cambridge sold Cambridge. We elected not to exercise our right of first refusal and the cost of the Option plus accrued interest was paid to us. 

&#160; 

On June 10, 2014, we invested $375,000 to acquire an approximate 19% interest in RS Bakken One, LLC, a newly-formed affiliated entity, which in turn acquired two properties in North Dakota, one near Williston and one in Watford City and had a combined acquisition price of $5,700,000. Concurrently, we purchased an option for $25,000 that allows us to acquire 100% of these two properties after one year for a purchase price of not less than $7,000,000, or not more than $8,000,000. As of the date of this report, the option has not been exercised. The impact of the recent decline in oil prices is not yet known but could have an impact on the value of the property should oil prices remain depressed for an extended period of time. The property in Watford City is leased by two corporate tenants with longer term leases. The income from these leases is sufficient to cover the operating costs and debt service on the property. Under terms of the Amendment discussed below, the ownership in RS Bakken One will be transferred to RSRT Holdings, LLC, which is owned by the Holders. 

&#160; 

On October 24, 2014, we invested $100,000 to become an approximate 3.876% member in a newly formed entity called RS Heron Walk Apartments, LLC (&#8220;RSHWA&#8221;), an affiliated entity which acquired the Heron Walk Apartments in Jacksonville, Florida. Our acquisition in the Heron Walk apartments is a value-add opportunity, and our ownership in RSHWA carries an 8% cumulative preferred return under the terms of the RSHWA operating agreement, with projected higher expected average cash-on-cash and internal rates of return. Under terms of the Amendment discussed above, the ownership in RSHWA will be transferred to RSRT Holdings, LLC, which is owned by the Holders. 

&#160; 

On January 15, 2016, each of the Holders entered into a separate Amendment to Note and Warrant (the &#8220;Amendment&#8221;) to modify certain terms and provisions of the Notes and Warrants, such Amendment being effective as of December 9, 2015, the original maturity date of the Notes. The Amendment was entered into given the maturity of the Notes to memorialize the agreements of the Company and each Holder with respect to the Notes and the Warrants held by such Holder. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Amendment, the term of the Notes has been extended by six months to June 9, 2016 (the &#8220;Maturity Date&#8221;). The Amendment also provided for the mandatory conversion of a portion of the interest accrued under the Note as of December 9, 2015 into shares of Common Stock (the &#8220;Mandatory Conversion&#8221;). The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon the Mandatory Conversion to each Holder equaled each Holder&#8217;s pro rata portion of interest owed on such Holder&#8217;s Note converted at $0.10 per share. A total of 3,744,000 shares of Common Stock were issued in February 2016. 

&#160; 

On December 31, 2015, we held an asset consisting of a deposit (the &#8220;Cambridge Deposit&#8221;) on the Cambridge property. Cambridge was owned by RS Cambridge, an entity controlled and partially owned by the Chairman, President and CEO of the Company. The Amendment further provided that in the event that, prior to the Maturity Date, RS Cambridge sold Cambridge, thus generating a return of the Cambridge Deposit to the Company, we would, within thirty (30) days of such sale, prepay, without penalty, a portion of each Note equal to each Holder&#8217;s pro rata portion of the Cambridge Deposit. Cambridge was sold to a third party in February 2016 and the Cambridge Deposit plus accrued interest was paid to the Company. With the proceeds, the Company then redeemed the Notes plus accrued interest as required under the Amendment. 

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Amendment, the Company and each Holder also agreed that, by no later than February 15, 2016, the Company would establish a new limited liability company (&#8220;Newco 1&#8221;) and assign to Newco 1: (a) a $100,000 equity investment (the &#8220;Heron Equity&#8221;) previously made by the Company in the Heron Walk Apartments in Jacksonville, Florida and (b) a $400,000 equity investment (&#8220;Bakken Equity&#8221;) previously made by the Company in two properties in North Dakota. This investment consisted of a $375,000 investment in RS Bakken One Investors, LLC and a $25,000 option to acquire the two properties within a specific range of a purchase prices. The Amendment provides that each Holder will be given a pro rata portion (based on the aggregate principal of the Notes held by such Holder) of the equity in Newco 1, entitling each Holder to a pro rata portion of all cash flows, profits and losses generated by Newco 1&#8217;s holdings of the Bakken Equity and the Heron Equity. Each Holder similarly agreed that such Holder shall have no voting, management, consent or approval rights whatsoever over the business or operations of Newco 1 (save as required by law), and all such rights are vested in the Company or its affiliates as the sole managing member of Newco 1. The Holder agreed to enter into a customary limited liability company operating agreement relating to Newco1 to memorialize the foregoing. We formed Newco 1 on February 5, 2016 with the name RSRT Holdings, LLC and each Holder signed the operating agreement. We are currently in the process of getting lender approval to transfer the Bakken Equity and the Heron Equity into RSRT Holdings, LLC. 

&#160; 

Finally, the Amendment provides that the Warrants held by such Holder shall be amended to (i) reduce the exercise price of the Warrants from $2.00 to $0.50 per Warrant Share and (ii) to extend the expiration time of the Warrants from December 9, 2018 to December 9, 2020. 

&#160; 

We are not currently structured or operating as a REIT. We have consulted investment advisors who recommend that the target properties should be combined into a private portfolio, raise additional equity to expand the asset value of the portfolio and form a private REIT. Once the asset value has grown to approximately a billion dollars and market conditions are favorable for public REIT&#8217;s, we should then use our company as a public vehicle. 

&#160; 

Our Current Business 

&#160; 

Our initial business strategy was to build the Company into a public REIT by combining a portfolio of multi-family properties owned by RealSource Properties, LLC and its clients into one operating entity in a traditional UPREIT structure and leveraging the experience of our management team and The RealSource Group. Based on recommendations of our investment advisors we have determined that the target properties should be combined into a private portfolio, raise additional equity to expand the asset value of the portfolio and form a private REIT. Once the asset value has grown to approximately a billion dollars and market conditions are favorable for public REIT&#8217;s, we should then use our company as a public vehicle. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Once we are able to create a REIT, we will face significant competition from other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, partnerships and investment companies and REITs, to acquire and/ or develop apartment communities. As an owner and operator of apartment communities, we will also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. Although our management has competed against large sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents, real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents. We believe that our experience in the acquisition, management and disposition of housing units within the multifamily housing industry will allow us to compete with other real estate investors in identifying quality assets to acquire. We may need to pursue debt and equity financing to allow us to acquire properties that we identify. At this point we have not identified reliable sources of debt and equity to acquire new properties.

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently do not have any employees except for our officers and directors. We will hire additional employees when circumstances warrant. These employees currently take no salary. 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

We have no significant suppliers other than for services such as legal, accounting and filing requirements. As we purchase multi-family properties, we will have suppliers for goods and services related to the properties. We do not expect that any single supplier will have a material impact on our operations.
