Business 

General 

&#160; 

The Company is a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of New Jersey in January 2005 for the sole purpose of becoming the holding company of the Bank. The Company commenced operations on June 1, 2005, upon completion of the reorganization of the Bank into the holding company form of organization following approval of the reorganization by shareholders of the Bank at its 2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Company&#8217;s business and operations primarily consist of its ownership of the Bank. 

&#160; 

The Bank is a commercial bank, which commenced operations on January 28, 1999. The Bank is chartered by the New Jersey Department of Banking and insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). The Company and the Bank maintain their principal offices at 601 Delsea Drive, Washington Township, New Jersey. The Bank also conducts business through offices in Northfield, Galloway Township and Washington Township, New Jersey, and in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Bank is a full service bank, with an emphasis on providing personal and business financial services to individuals and small to mid-sized businesses in Gloucester, Atlantic and Cape May Counties in New Jersey and the Philadelphia area in Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2015 , the Company had assets of $885.1 million, loans net of unearned income of $758.5 million, deposits of $665.2 million and equity of $112.0 million. 

The Bank focuses its commercial loan originations on small and mid-sized businesses (generally up to $25 million in annual sales). Commercial loan products include residential and commercial real estate construction loans; working capital loans and lines of credit; demand, term and time loans; and equipment, inventory and accounts receivable financing. Residential construction loans in tract development are also included in the commercial loan category. The Bank also offers a range of deposit products to its commercial customers. Commercial customers also have the ability to use overnight depository, ACH, wire transfer services and merchant capture electronic check processing services. 

&#160; 

The Bank&#8217;s retail banking activities emphasize consumer deposit and checking accounts. An extensive range of these services is offered by the Bank to meet the varied needs of its customers in all age groups. In addition to traditional products and services, the Bank offers contemporary products and services, such as debit cards, Internet banking and online bill payment. Retail lending activities by the Bank include residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, fixed rate second mortgages, new and used auto loans and overdraft protection. 

&#160; 

Market Area 

&#160; 

Substantially all of the Bank&#8217;s business is with customers in its market areas of Southern New Jersey and the Philadelphia area of Pennsylvania. Most of the Bank&#8217;s customers are individuals and small and medium-sized businesses which are dependent upon the regional economy. Adverse changes in economic and business conditions in the Bank&#8217;s markets could adversely affect the Bank&#8217;s borrowers, their ability to repay their loans and to borrow additional funds, and consequently the Bank&#8217;s financial condition and performance. 

&#160; 

Additionally, most of the Bank&#8217;s loans are secured by real estate located in Southern New Jersey and the Philadelphia area. A decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the values of such real estate. Consequently, a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on the Bank&#8217;s earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The Bank faces significant competition, both in making loans and attracting deposits. The Bank&#8217;s competition in both areas comes principally from other commercial banks, thrift and savings institutions, including savings and loan associations and credit unions, and other types of financial institutions, including brokerage firms and credit card companies. The Bank faces additional competition for deposits from short-term money market mutual funds and other corporate and government securities funds. 

&#160; 

Most of the Bank&#8217;s competitors, whether traditional or nontraditional financial institutions, have a longer history and significantly greater financial and marketing resources than does the Bank. Among the advantages certain of these institutions have over the Bank are their ability to finance wide-ranging and effective advertising campaigns, to access international money markets and to allocate their investment resources to regions of highest yield and demand. Major banks operating in the primary market area offer certain services, such as international banking and trust services, which are not offered directly by the Bank. 

&#160; 

In commercial transactions, the Bank&#8217;s legal lending limit to a single borrower enables the Bank to compete effectively for the business of individuals and smaller enterprises. However, the Bank&#8217;s legal lending limit is considerably lower than that of various competing institutions, which have substantially greater capitalization. The Bank has a relatively smaller capital base than most other competing institutions which, although above regulatory minimums, may constrain the Bank&#8217;s effectiveness in competing for loans.

Commercial and Industrial Loans. &#32;The Bank originates secured loans for business purposes. Loans are made to provide working capital to businesses in the form of lines of credit, which may be secured by accounts receivable, inventory, equipment or other assets. The financial condition and cash flow of commercial borrowers are closely monitored by means of corporate financial statements, personal financial statements and income tax returns. The frequency of submissions of required financial information depends on the size and complexity of the credit and the collateral that secures the loan. The Bank&#8217;s general policy is to obtain personal guarantees from the principals of the commercial loan borrowers. Such loans are made to businesses located in the Bank&#8217;s market area. 

&#160; 

Commercial business loans generally involve a greater degree of risk than residential mortgage loans and carry larger loan balances. This increased credit risk is a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the mobility of collateral, the effects of general economic conditions and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income and which are secured by real property the value of which tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower&#8217;s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. 

Real Estate Development and Construction Loans. &#32;The Bank originates construction loans to individuals and real estate developers in its market area. The advantages of construction lending are that the market is typically less competitive than more standard mortgage products, the interest rate typically charged is a variable rate, which permits the Bank to protect against sudden changes in its costs of funds, and the fees or &#8220;points&#8221; charged by the Bank to its customers can be amortized over the shorter term of a construction loan, typically, one to two years, which permits the Bank to recognize income received over a shorter period of time. 

The Bank provides interim real estate acquisition development and construction loans to builders and developers. Real estate development and construction loans to provide interim financing on the property are based on acceptable percentages of the appraised value of the property securing the loan in each case. Real estate development and construction loan funds are disbursed periodically at pre-specified stages of completion. Interest rates on these loans are generally adjustable. The Bank carefully monitors these loans with on-site inspections and control of disbursements. These loans are generally made on properties located in the Bank&#8217;s market area. 

Development and construction loans are secured by the properties under development and personal guarantees are typically obtained. Further, to assure that reliance is not placed solely in the value of the underlying property, the Bank considers the financial condition and reputation of the borrower and any guarantors, the amount of the borrower&#8217;s equity in the project, independent appraisals, costs estimates and pre-construction sale information. 

&#160; 

Loans to residential builders are for the construction of residential homes for which a binding sales contract exists and the prospective buyers have been pre-qualified for permanent mortgage financing. Loans to residential developers are made only to developers with a proven sales record. Generally, these loans are extended only when the borrower provides evidence that the lots under development will be sold to potential buyers satisfactory to the Bank. 

&#160; 

The Bank also originates loans to individuals for construction of single family dwellings. These loans are for the construction of the individual&#8217;s primary residence. They are typically secured by the property under construction, occasionally include additional collateral (such as a second mortgage on the borrower&#8217;s present home), and commonly have maturities of six to twelve months. 

Construction financing is labor intensive for the Bank, requiring employees of the Bank to expend substantial time and resources in monitoring and servicing each construction loan to completion. Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk of loss than long-term financing on improved, occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan is dependent largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the property&#8217;s value at completion of construction and development, the accuracy of projections, such as the sales of homes or the future leasing of commercial space, and the accuracy of the estimated cost (including interest) of construction. Substantial deviations can occur in such projections. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed to permit completion of the development. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be confronted, at or prior to the maturity of the loan, with a project having a value which is insufficient to assure full repayment. Also, a construction loan that is in default can cause problems for the Bank such as designating replacement builders for a project, considering alternate uses for the project and site and handling any structural and environmental issues that might arise. 

Commercial Real Estate Mortgage Loans. &#32;The Bank originates mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate. Such loans are primarily secured by office buildings, retail buildings, warehouses and general purpose business space. Although terms may vary, the Bank&#8217;s commercial mortgages generally have maturities of twenty years, but re-price within five years. 

&#160; 

Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Of primary concern in commercial and multi-family real estate lending is the borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent than residential real estate loans to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. 

&#160; 

The Bank seeks to reduce the risks associated with commercial mortgage lending by generally lending in its primary market area and obtaining periodic financial statements and tax returns from borrowers. It is also the Bank&#8217;s general policy to obtain personal guarantees from the principals of the borrowers and assignments of all leases related to the collateral. 

Residential Real Estate Mortgage Loans. &#32;The Bank originates adjustable and fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. Such mortgage loans are generally originated under terms, conditions and documentation acceptable to the secondary mortgage market. Although the Bank has placed all of these loans into its portfolio, a substantial majority of such loans can be sold in the secondary market or pledged for potential borrowings. 

Consumer Loans. &#32;The Bank offers a variety of consumer loans. These loans are typically secured by residential real estate or personal property, including automobiles. Home equity loans (closed-end and lines of credit) are typically made up to 80% of the appraised or assessed value of the property securing the loan in each case, less the amount of any existing prior liens on the property, and generally have maximum terms of ten years, although the Bank does offer a 90% loan to value product if certain conditions related to the borrower and property are satisfied. The interest rates on second mortgages are generally fixed, while interest rates on home equity lines of credit are variable. 

Loans to One Borrower. &#32;Federal regulations limit loans to one borrower in an amount equal to 15% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank&#8217;s loan to one borrower limit was approximately $21.1 million and the Bank had no borrowers with loan balances in excess of this amount. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank&#8217;s largest loan to one borrower was a loan for commercial real estate, with a balance of $20.4 million that was secured by the real estate. &#160; At December 31, 2015 , this loan was current and performing in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. 

The size of loans which the Bank can offer to potential borrowers is less than the size of loans which many of the Bank&#8217;s competitors with larger capitalization are able to offer. The Bank may engage in loan participations with other banks for loans in excess of the Bank&#8217;s legal lending limits. However, no assurance can be given that such participations will be available at all or on terms which are favorable to the Bank and its customers. 

&#160; 

Non-Performing and Problem Assets 

&#160; 

Non-Performing Assets. &#32;Non-accrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status if, in the opinion of management, collection is doubtful, or when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more unless the collateral is considered sufficient to cover principal and interest and the loan is in the process of collection. Interest accrued, but not collected at the date a loan is placed on non-accrual status, is reversed and charged against interest income. Subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal or recorded as interest income, depending on management&#8217;s assessment of ultimate collectibility of principal and interest. Loans are returned to an accrual status when the borrower&#8217;s ability to make periodic principal and interest payments has returned to normal (i.e., brought current with respect to principal or interest or restructured) and the paying capacity of the borrower and/or the underlying collateral is deemed sufficient to cover principal and interest. 

&#160; 

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future discounted cash flows, the market price of the loan or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The recognition of interest income on impaired loans is the same as for non-accrual loans discussed above. Total impaired loans, which include non-accrual loans and performing TDRs, were $42.2 million, $61.5 million, $68.9 million, $87.6 million and $97.2 million at December 31 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Included in impaired loans at December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $32.2 million, $42.2 million, $51.0 million, $67.1 million and $66.9 million of loans classified as troubled debt restructurings as defined within accounting guidance and regulatory literature. 

The following table sets forth information regarding non-accrual loans at the dates indicated.

As of December 31, 2015 , there were $5.5 million in loans which were not on non-accrual status, a TDR or otherwise but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans as non-performing in the future. 

When a loan is more than 30 days delinquent, the borrower is contacted by mail or phone and payment is requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower. In certain instances, the Company may modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize their financial affairs. If the loan continues in a delinquent status for 90 days or more, the Company generally will initiate foreclosure proceedings. 

&#160; 

Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on non-accrual status is charged against interest income. Such interest, when ultimately collected, is applied either to the outstanding principal or recorded as interest income, depending on management&#8217;s assessment of ultimate collectibility of principal and interest. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had $13.6 million of loans that were on a non-accrual basis. &#160; Gross interest income of $2.4 million would have been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;if these loans had been performing in accordance with their terms. Interest income of $1.5 million was recognized on these loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

Classified Assets. &#32;Federal Regulations provide for a classification system for problem assets of insured institutions. Under this classification system, problem assets of insured institutions are classified as substandard, doubtful or loss. An asset is considered &#8220;substandard&#8221; if it involves more than an acceptable level of risk due to a deteriorating financial condition, unfavorable history of the borrower, inadequate payment capacity, insufficient security or other negative factors within the industry, market or management. Substandard loans have clearly defined weaknesses that can jeopardize the timely payments of the loan. 

&#160; 

Assets classified as &#8220;doubtful&#8221; exhibit all of the weaknesses defined under the Substandard Category but with enough risk to present a high probability of some principal loss on the loan, although not yet fully ascertainable in amount. Assets classified as &#8220;loss&#8221; are those considered un-collectable or of little value, even though a collection effort may continue after the classification and potential charge-off. 

&#160; 

The Bank also internally classifies certain assets as &#8220;other assets especially mentioned&#8221; (&#8220;OAEM&#8221;); such assets do not demonstrate a current potential for loss but are monitored in response to negative trends which, if not reversed, could lead to a substandard rating in the future. 

&#160; 

When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either &#8220;substandard&#8221; or &#8220;doubtful,&#8221; it may establish specific allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as &#8220;loss,&#8221; it is required either to establish an allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the assets so classified or to charge off such amount. All of the Bank&#8217;s loans rated &#8220;substandard&#8221; and worse are also on non-accrual and deemed impaired. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had assets classified as follows:

Foreclosed Real Estate. &#32;Real estate acquired by the Bank as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold. When real estate owned is acquired, it is recorded at or its fair value less disposal costs. Management also periodically performs valuations of real estate owned and establishes allowances to reduce book values of the properties to their net realizable values when necessary. Any write-down of real estate owned is charged to operations. Real estate owned at December 31, 2015 &#32;was $16.6 million. The real estate owned consisted of 16 properties, the largest being a condominium development located in Absecon, New Jersey at $6.4 million. 

Allowance for Losses on Loans. &#32;It is the policy of management to provide for possible losses on all loans in its portfolio, whether classified or not. A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management&#8217;s evaluation of the inherent losses estimated to have occurred in the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio. 

Management&#8217;s judgment as to the level of probable losses on existing loans is based on its internal review of the loan portfolio, including an analysis of the borrower's current financial position; the level and trends in delinquencies, non-accruals and impaired loans; the consideration of national and local economic conditions and trends; concentrations of credit; the impact of any changes in credit policy; the experience and depth of management and the lending staff; and any trends in loan volume and terms. 

In determining the collectability of certain loans, management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral. However, management&#8217;s determination of the appropriate allowance level, which is based upon the factors outlined above, which are believed to be reasonable, may or may not prove to be valid. Thus, there can be no assurance that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required. 

The following table sets forth information with respect to the Bank&#8217;s allowance for losses on loans at the dates and for the periods indicated.

Sources of Funds 

&#160; 

General. &#32;Deposits are the major external source of the Bank&#8217;s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bank derives funds from the amortization, prepayment or sale of loans, maturities of investment securities and operations. Scheduled loan principal repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and market conditions. 

&#160; 

Deposits. &#32;The Bank offers individuals and businesses a wide variety of accounts, including checking, savings, money market accounts, individual retirement accounts and certificates of deposit. Deposits are obtained primarily from communities that the Bank serves, however, the Bank held brokered deposits of $20.9 million and $20.3 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Brokered deposits are a more volatile source of funding than core deposits and do not increase the deposit franchise of the Bank. In a rising rate environment, the Bank may be unwilling or unable to pay a competitive rate. To the extent that such deposits do not remain with the Bank, they may need to be replaced with borrowings which could increase the Bank&#8217;s cost of funds and negatively impact its interest rate spread, financial condition and results of operation. To mitigate the potential negative impact associated with brokered deposits, the Bank joined Promontory Interfinancial Network during 2007 to secure an additional alternative funding source. Promontory provides the Bank an additional source of external funds through their weekly CDARS &#8482; &#32;settlement process. The rates are comparable to brokered deposits and can be obtained within a shorter period time than brokered deposits. The Bank&#8217;s CDARS &#8482; &#32;deposits included within the brokered deposit total amounted to $20.9 million, $20.3 million and $5.2 million at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Regulation 

&#160; 

Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws that relate to the regulation of the Bank and the Company. The description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. 

&#160; 

Holding Company Regulation 

&#160; 

General. &#32;The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), and is regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;). The Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over the Company and the Company&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries which also permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary bank. This regulation and oversight is intended primarily for the protection of the depositors of the Bank and not for shareholders of the Company. 

&#160; 

As a bank holding company, the Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and any additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require under the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve Board will also examine the Company and its subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

Subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the BHC Act on extensions of credit to the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries, on investments in the stock or other securities of the bank holding company or its subsidiaries, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Furthermore, under amendments to the BHC Act and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or provision of credit or providing any property or services. Generally, this provision provides that a bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any service to a customer on the condition that the customer provide additional credit or service to the bank, to the bank holding company, or to any other subsidiary of the bank holding company or on the condition that the customer not obtain other credit or service from a competitor of the bank, the bank holding company, or any subsidiary of the bank. 

&#160; 

Extensions of credit by the Bank to executive officers, directors, and principal shareholders of the Bank or any affiliate thereof, including the Company, are subject to Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, which among other things, generally prohibits loans to any such individual where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of a bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus, plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. 

&#160; 

Source of Strength Doctrine. A bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve regulations, or both. 

&#160; 

Non-Banking Activities. &#32;The business activities of the Company, as a bank holding company, are restricted by the BHC Act. Under the BHC Act and the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s bank holding company regulations, the Company may only engage in, or acquire or control voting securities or assets of a company engaged in, (1) banking or managing or controlling banks and other subsidiaries authorized under the BHC Act and (2) any BHC Act activity the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks to be a proper incident thereto. These include any incidental activities necessary to carry on those activities, as well as a lengthy list of activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking as to be a proper incident thereto. 

Financial Modernization. &#32;The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act permits greater affiliation among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other companies under a new type of financial services company known as a &#8220;financial holding company.&#8221; A financial holding company essentially is a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers. Financial holding companies are 

authorized by statute to engage in a number of financial activities previously impermissible for bank holding companies, including securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; and merchant banking activities. The Act also permits the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to authorize additional activities for financial holding companies if they are &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; or &#8220;incidental&#8221; to financial activities. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if it and each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized and well managed, and each of its subsidiary banks has at least a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating. A financial holding company must provide notice to the Federal Reserve within 30 days after commencing activities previously determined by statute or by the Federal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury to be permissible. The Company has not submitted notice to the Federal Reserve Board of its intent to be deemed a financial holding company. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Capital Requirements. &#32;The Federal Reserve has adopted capital adequacy guidelines pursuant to which it assesses the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and in analyzing applications to it under the BHC Act. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital adequacy guidelines are similar to those imposed on the Bank by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). See &#8220;Regulation of the Bank-Regulatory Capital Requirements&#8221; and &#8220;Recent Amendments to Regulatory Capital Requirements.&#8221; The Federal Reserve, however, has adopted a policy statement that exempts bank holding companies with less than $1.0 billion in consolidated assets that are not engaged in significant non-banking or off-balance sheet activities and that do not have a material amount of debt or equity securities registered with the SEC from its regulatory capital requirements. As long as their bank subsidiaries are well capitalized, such bank holding companies need only maintain a pro forma debt to equity ratio of less than 1.0 in order to pay dividends and repurchase stock and to be eligible for expedited treatment on applications. 

Federal Securities Law. &#32;The Company&#8217;s common stock is registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;1934 Act&#8221;), and the Company is subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of Section 12(b) of the 1934 Act, as amended. 

Regulation of the Bank 

&#160; 

The Bank operates in a highly regulated industry. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors and not shareholders of the Bank. 

&#160; 

Any change in applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, whether by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;), or the United States Congress could have a material adverse impact on the Bank, and its operations. The adoption of regulations or the enactment of laws that restrict the operations of the Bank or impose burdensome requirements upon it could reduce its profitability and could impair the value of the Bank&#8217;s franchise which could hurt the trading price of the Bank&#8217;s stock. 

&#160; 

As a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision, and control of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and control of the FDIC, an agency of the federal government. The regulations of the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance affect virtually all activities of the Bank, including the minimum level of capital the Bank must maintain, the ability of the Bank to pay dividends, the ability of the Bank to expand through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters. 

&#160; 

Federal Deposit Insurance. &#32;The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured to applicable limits by the FDIC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the maximum deposit insurance amount has been permanently increased from $100,000 to $250,000. 

&#160; 

The FDIC has adopted a risk-based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institution&#8217;s ranking in one of four risk categories based on their examination ratings and capital ratios. The assessment base is the institution&#8217;s average consolidated assets less average tangible equity. Insured banks with more than $1.0 billion in assets must calculate quarterly average assets based on daily balances while smaller banks and newly chartered banks may use weekly averages. In the case of a merger, the average assets of the surviving bank for the quarter must include the average assets of the merged institution for the period in the quarter prior to the merger. Average assets are reduced by goodwill and other intangibles. Average tangible equity equals Tier 1 capital. For institutions with more than $1.0 billion in assets, average tangible equity is calculated on a weekly basis while smaller institutions may use the quarter-end balance. The base assessment rate for insured institutions in Risk Category I ranges between 5 to 9 basis points and for institutions in Risk Categories II, III, and IV, the assessment rate is 14, 23 and 35 basis points, respectively. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate may be reduced based on the amount of its outstanding unsecured long-term debt and for institutions in Risk Categories II, III and IV may be increased based on their brokered deposits. Risk Categories are eliminated for institutions with more than $10 billion in assets which will be assessed at a rate between 5 and 35 basis points. 

The FDIC has proposed to amend its assessment regulations for established banks (generally, an institution that has been federally insured for at least five years as of the last day of any quarter for which it is being assessed) with less than $10 billion in assets to replace the current risk categories with updated financial ratios that are designed to better predict the risk of failure of insured institutions. The proposed rules would not become effective until the designated reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund reaches 1.15% and would remain in effect until the designated reserve ratio reaches 2.0%. The proposed regulations would 

set a maximum rate that banks rated CAMELS 1 or 2 could be charged and a minimum rate that CAMELS 3, 4 and 5 banks would be charged. Under the proposal, the FDIC would use a bank&#8217;s weighted average CAMELS component ratings and the following financial measures to determine assessments: Tier 1 leverage ratio; ratio of net income before taxes to total assets; ratio of non-performing loans to gross assets; and ratio of other real estate owned to gross assets. In addition, assessments would take into consideration core deposits to total assets, one-year asset growth and a loan mix index. The loan mix index would measure the extent to which a bank&#8217;s total assets include higher risk loans. To calculate the loan mix index, each category of loan in the bank&#8217;s portfolio (other than credit card loans) would be divided by the bank&#8217;s total assets to determine the percentage of assets represented by that loan category. Each percentage would then be multiplied by that loan category&#8217;s historical weighted average industry-wide charge-off rate. The sum of these numbers would determine the loan mix index value for that bank. The FDIC proposal is intended to be revenue neutral to the FDIC but to shift premium payments to higher risk institutions. Most institutions are expected to see lower premiums. A companion proposal would assess banks over $10 billion in assets at higher rates for two years in accordance with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

In addition, all FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;), an agency of the Federal government established to recapitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The FICO assessment rates, which are determined quarterly, averaged 0.60% of insured deposits on an annualized basis in 2015. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds mature in 2017. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FDIC has promulgated capital adequacy requirements for state-chartered banks that, like the Bank, are not members of the Federal Reserve System. Effective January 1, 2015, the capital adequacy requirements were substantially revised to conform them to the international regulatory standards agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in the accord often referred to as &#8220;Basel III&#8221;. The final rule applies to all depository institutions as well as to all top-tier bank and savings and loan holding companies that are not subject to the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement. 

Under the FDIC&#8217;s revised capital adequacy regulations, the Bank is required to meet four minimum capital standards: (1) &#8220;Tier 1&#8221; or &#8220;core&#8221; capital leverage ratio equal to at least 4% of total adjusted assets, (2) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, (3) a Tier 1 risk-based ratio equal to 6% of risk-weighted assets, and (4) a total capital ratio equal to 8% of total risk-weighted assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital is defined as common stock instruments, retained earnings, any common equity Tier 1 minority interest and, unless the bank has made an &#8220;opt-out&#8221; election, accumulated other comprehensive income, net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Tier 1 or core capital is defined as common equity Tier 1 capital plus certain qualifying subordinated interests and grandfathered capital instruments. Total capital consists of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 or supplementary capital items, which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, qualifying subordinated instruments and certain grandfathered capital instruments. An institution&#8217;s risk-based capital requirements are measured against risk-weighted assets, which equal the sum of each on-balance-sheet asset and the credit-equivalent amount of each off-balance-sheet item after being multiplied by an assigned risk weight. Risk weightings range from 0% for cash to 100% for property acquired through foreclosure, commercial loans, and certain other assets to 150% for exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. 

&#32;In addition to higher capital requirements, the new capital rules will require banks and covered financial institution holding companies to maintain a capital conservation buffer of at least 2.5% of risk-weighted assets over and above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. Institutions that do not maintain the required capital buffer will become subject to progressively more stringent limitations on the percentage of earnings that can be paid out in dividends or used for stock repurchases and on the payment of discretionary bonuses to senior executive management. The capital buffer requirement will be phased in over four years beginning January 1, 2016. The fully phased-in capital buffer requirement will effectively raise the minimum required risk-based capital ratios to 7% for Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital on a fully phased-in basis. 

In assessing an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary. 

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action . &#32;Under applicable federal statutes, the federal bank regulatory agencies are required to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to institutions that do not meet specified minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the FDIC&#8217;s prompt corrective action regulations, an institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% or better and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater. An institution is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.0% or greater, a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 4.5% or better and a Leverage Ratio of 4.0% or greater. An institution is &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a Leverage Ratio of less than 4.0%. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of less than 4.0%, a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a Leverage Ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0% 

The prompt corrective action regulations provide for the imposition of a variety of requirements and limitations on institutions that fail to meet the above capital requirements. In particular, the FDIC may require any non-member bank that is not &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; to take certain action to increase its capital ratios. If the non-member bank&#8217;s capital is significantly below the minimum required levels of capital or if it is unsuccessful in increasing its capital ratios, the bank&#8217;s activities may be restricted. 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank qualified as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under the prompt corrective action rules. 

Volcker Rule. On July 21, 2015, banking entities, which include insured depository institutions, their holding companies and affiliates of either, became subject to regulations implementing the so-called Volcker Rule of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits proprietary trading for the entity&#8217;s own account in certain financial instruments, including securities, derivatives, futures and options but excluding loans, physical commodities and foreign exchange and currency. Under the rules adopted by the federal financial regulatory agencies, the purchase or sale of a financial instrument that has been held for less than 60 days is presumed to be proprietary trading for the purpose of short-term resale or benefiting from short-term price movements or for another prohibited purpose unless the banking organization can demonstrate a contrary purpose. Purchases and sales of financial instruments pursuant to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements or securities lending agreements, however, are excluded from the definition of proprietary trading. Also excluded from the definition of proprietary trading are purchases and sales of financial instruments where the bank is acting solely as agent for a customer, as trustee for a pension or deferred compensation plan or in connection with the collection of debts previously contracted. Purchases and sales of highly liquid securities that are not reasonably expected to result in short-term trading gains and in an amount consistent with near-term funding needs are excluded from proprietary trading if conducted pursuant to a documented liquidity management plan. Certain proprietary trading activities are permitted if conducted in connection with underwriting or market-making activities or risk-mitigating hedging activities. Proprietary trading is also permitted in U.S. government, agency and government sponsored-enterprise securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions and the FDIC but not in derivatives of the foregoing. 

&#160; 

The Volcker Rule also prohibits banking entities from sponsoring or directly or indirectly acquiring as principal any ownership interest in a &#8220;covered fund&#8221; unless permitted by the rule. For purposes of this prohibition, a covered fund is any investment fund such as a hedge or private equity fund that would be required to register as an investment company under SEC rules but for the statutory exemptions for funds held by not more than 100 persons or owned solely by high net worth investors, any exempt or substantively similar non-exempt commodity pool and certain foreign investment funds. Excluded from the definition of covered fund are wholly owned subsidiaries of a banking entity or its affiliates, certain permissible joint ventures, insurance company separate accounts for which the banking entity is a beneficiary provided the banking entity does not control investment decisions on the underlying assets or participate in the profits for the separate account except in accordance with supervisory guidance regarding bank owned life insurance, certain vehicles for loan and other permissible securitizations, small business investment companies, public welfare companies permitted under the National Bank Act, business development companies, registered investment companies and investment funds exempt from SEC registration under other statutory provisions. Investments in pooled trust preferred securities are permitted if acquired before December 10, 2013 and the banking entity reasonably believes that the trust preferred securities in the pool were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets or by mutual holding companies. 

&#160; 

The Volcker Rule prohibits a banking entity from engaging in certain covered transactions, including loans and securities and asset purchases, with any covered fund for which it serves as investment manager, advisor or sponsor or that it organizes and offers. Any transactions with a covered fund must be on terms as favorable to the banking entity as transactions with non-affiliates. Finally, the Volcker Rule prohibits any otherwise permitted proprietary trading or covered fund activity that would involve a material conflict of interest between the banking entity and its customers, result in a material exposure of the banking entity to high risk assets or trading strategies or would pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or the financial stability of the United States.
