General 

&#160;

Applied Energetics, Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our executive office is located at 2480 W Ruthrauff Road, Suite 140 Q, Tucson, Arizona, 85705 and our telephone number is (520) 628-7415.

&#160; 

The company is a &#8220;shell company&#8221; as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As of October 3, 2014, the company suspended its previous business activities.

&#160;

The company is planning to reactivate its previous business activities pursuant to Teaming and Consulting Agreements with Applied Optical Sciences, Inc. (&#8220;AOS&#8221;) and Dr. Stephen W. McCahon, Ph.D., one of the company&#8217;s founders and owner of AOS who was primarily responsible for development of the Company&#8217;s existing Intellectual Property portfolio (collectively the &#8220;Consultants&#8221;). The company owns intellectual property that is integral and necessary for the development of Laser Guided Energy and Direct Discharge Electrical products for military and commercial uses (the &#8220;Products&#8221;) and the Consultants have the facilities and technical knowhow to utilize the company&#8217;s intellectual property in the development of the Products; and the Parties have agreed to cooperate in the proposal and fulfillment of research and development contracts for branches of the Department of Defense, agencies of the Federal Government and other Defense contractors and in other research and development activities relating to lasers. We intend to develop the next generation of Ultra-Short Pulse Lasers (&#8220;UPS&#8221;). We are preparing for the next stage of LGE development that involves the development of Advanced USP Laser Technologies. These lasers will allow for LGE weapon systems to be mounted on mobile platforms for multiple Anti-Terrorist missions including Counter Measures Against Drones and other Hostile Inbound Objects, Counter-Improvised Explosive Devices (&#8220;C-IED&#8221;), Vehicle Stopping, and many others. Importantly, the highly advanced USP Laser technologies required for successful LGE deployment leads to many new and unique laser opportunities in both commercial, medical, and military markets. Our goal is to increase the range and power and to decrease the size weight and cost of ultra-short pulse lasers. We expect to develop very high energy and power scaling ultra-short pulse lasers that have a very broad range of applicability for Department of Defense, commercial and medical applications. We are in discussions with and expect to team with a major Defense Contractor for co-development and manufacture of military products. We will also team with a leading commercial laser technology manufacturer for co-development of commercial products resulting from our research and development efforts.

&#160;

If the reactivation of our former business is successful we will no longer be a &#8220;shell Company&#8221; but will be classified as a Development Stage Company until we achieve significant revenues from our reactivated business.

&#160;

The U.S. Government has significantly reduced defense spending over the past few years and we have not received any meaningful additional Government funding in 2014 and 2015. We have completed all of our Government contracts and do not have any funded Government contracts for future work. There is no assurance that the Company and its Consultants will obtain meaningful Government Funding.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 29, 2016, we had no employees, and we retain a consultant who is paid on an hourly basis.
