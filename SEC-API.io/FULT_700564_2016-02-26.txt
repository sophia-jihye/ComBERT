 Item 1. Business 

General 

Fulton Financial Corporation (the Corporation) was incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania on February 8, 1982 and became a bank holding company through the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of Fulton Bank on June 30, 1982. In 2000, the Corporation became a financial holding company as defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act), which gave the Corporation the ability to expand its financial services activities under its holding company structure (See "Competition" and "Supervision and Regulation" below). The Corporation directly owns 100% of the common stock of six community banks and eight non-bank entities. As of December 31, 2015 , the Corporation had approximately 3,460 full-time equivalent employees. 

The common stock of Fulton Financial Corporation is listed for quotation on the Global Select Market of The NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol FULT. The Corporation&#8217;s Internet address is www.fult.com . Electronic copies of the Corporation&#8217;s 2015 &#32;Annual Report on Form 10-K are available free of charge by visiting "Investor Relations" at www.fult.com . Electronic copies of quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K are also available at this Internet address. These reports, as well as any amendments thereto, are posted on the Corporation's website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

Bank and Financial Services Subsidiaries 

The Corporation&#8217;s six subsidiary banks are located primarily in suburban or semi-rural geographical markets throughout a five-state region (Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia). Each of these banking subsidiaries delivers financial services in a highly personalized, community-oriented style that emphasizes relationship banking. Where appropriate, operations are centralized through common platforms and back-office functions. The Corporation has announced that it is developing plans to seek regulatory approval to begin the process of consolidating its six subsidiary banks in connection with a transition to a business model that will be less oriented on geographic boundaries and will instead focus more on alignment with the customer segments the Corporation serves. The Corporation also believes that consolidation will enhance its ability to manage risk more efficiently and effectively through a centralized risk management and compliance function. This multi-year process is expected to eventually result in the Corporation conducting its core banking business through a single subsidiary bank. Consolidation of the bank subsidiaries will result in a single subsidiary bank with greater than $10 billion of assets, subjecting it to more stringent regulation applicable to institutions that exceed that threshold. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - "Additional growth, particularly at the Corporation&#8217;s largest subsidiary, Fulton Bank, N.A., would subject it to additional regulation and increased supervision" under "Legal, Compliance and Reputational Risks." The timing of the commencement of this process will depend significantly on the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries making necessary progress in enhancing a largely centralized compliance program designed to comply with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and related anti-money laundering regulations, and establishing, to the satisfaction of the Corporation&#8217;s banking regulatory agencies, that those enhancements are sustainable to achieve compliance with the regulatory enforcement orders issued to the Corporation and its subsidiary banks by their respective banking regulatory agencies relating to identified deficiencies in that compliance program. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - "The Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are subject to regulatory enforcement orders requiring improvement in compliance functions and remedial actions" under "Legal, Compliance and Reputational Risks." 

The Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks are located in areas that are home to a wide range of manufacturing, distribution, health care and other service companies. The Corporation and its banks are not dependent upon one or a few customers or any one industry, and the loss of any single customer or a few customers would not have a material adverse impact on any of the subsidiary banks. However, a large portion of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio is comprised of commercial loans, commercial mortgage loans and construction loans. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - "Economic downturns and the composition of the Corporation&#8217;s loan portfolio subject the Corporation to credit risk" under "Economic and Credit Risks." 

Each of the subsidiary banks offers a full range of consumer and commercial banking products and services in its local market area. Personal banking services include various checking account and savings deposit products, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. The subsidiary banks offer a variety of consumer lending products to creditworthy customers in their market areas. Secured consumer loan products include home equity loans and lines of credit, which are underwritten based on loan-to-value limits specified in the Corporation's lending policy. Subsidiary banks also offer a variety of fixed and variable-rate products, including construction loans and jumbo loans. Residential mortgages are offered through Fulton Mortgage Company, which operates as a division of each subsidiary bank. Consumer loan products also include automobile loans, automobile and equipment leases, personal lines of credit and checking account overdraft protection. 

Commercial banking services are provided to small and medium sized businesses (generally with sales of less than $150 million) in the subsidiary banks&#8217; market areas. The Corporation's policies limit the maximum total lending commitment to a single borrower 

to $50.0 million as of December 31, 2015 , which is below the Corporation&#8217;s regulatory lending limit. In addition, the Corporation has established lower total lending limits for certain types of lending commitments, and also based on the Corporation's internal risk rating of the borrower. Commercial lending products include commercial, financial, agricultural and real estate loans. Floating, adjustable and fixed rate loans are provided, with floating and adjustable rate loans generally tied to an index such as the Prime Rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), as well as interest rate swaps. The commercial lending policy of the Corporation's subsidiary banks encourages relationship banking and provides strict guidelines related to customer creditworthiness and collateral requirements for secured loans. In addition, equipment leasing, letters of credit, cash management services and traditional deposit products are offered to commercial customers. 

Investment management, trust, brokerage, insurance and investment advisory services are offered to consumer and commercial banking customers in the market areas serviced by the Corporation's subsidiary banks by Fulton Financial Advisors, a division of the Corporation's Fulton Bank, N.A. subsidiary bank. 

The Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks deliver their products and services through traditional branch banking, with a network of full service branch offices. Electronic delivery channels include a network of automated teller machines, telephone banking, mobile banking and online banking. The variety of available delivery channels allows customers to access their account information and perform certain transactions, such as depositing checks, transferring funds and paying bills, at virtually any time of the day.

Non-Bank Subsidiaries 

The Corporation owns 100% of the common stock of five non-bank subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes: (i) Fulton Financial Realty Company, which holds title to or leases certain properties upon which Corporation branch offices and other facilities are located; (ii) Central Pennsylvania Financial Corp., which owns limited partnership interests in partnerships invested primarily in low and moderate income housing projects; (iii) FFC Management, Inc., which owns certain investment securities and other passive investments; (iv) FFC Penn Square, Inc., which owns trust preferred securities (TruPS) issued by a subsidiary of Fulton Bank, N.A; and (v) Fulton Insurance Services Group, Inc., which engages in the sale of various life insurance products. 

The Corporation owns 100% of the common stock of three non-bank subsidiaries which are not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The following table provides information for these non-bank subsidiaries, whose sole assets consist of junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures issued by the Corporation, as of December 31, 2015 :

Competition 

The banking and financial services industries are highly competitive. Within its geographic region, the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiaries face direct competition from other commercial banks, varying in size from local community banks to larger regional and national 

banks, credit unions and non-bank entities. As a result of the wide availability of electronic delivery channels, the subsidiary banks also face competition from financial institutions that do not have a physical presence in the Corporation&#8217;s geographic markets. 

The industry is also highly competitive due, in part, to the GLB Act. As a result of the GLB Act, there is a great deal of competition from many types of entities for customers that were traditionally served only by the banking industry. Under the GLB Act, banks, insurance companies and securities firms may affiliate under a financial holding company structure, allowing expansion into non-banking financial services activities that were previously restricted. These activities include a full range of banking, securities and insurance activities, including securities and insurance underwriting, issuing and selling annuities and merchant banking activities. While the Corporation does not currently engage in many of these activities, the ability to do so may enhance the ability of the Corporation to compete in the future. 

Market Share 

Deposit market share information is compiled as of June 30 &#32;of each year by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The Corporation&#8217;s banks maintain branch offices in 52 &#32;counties across five states. In 15 &#32;of these counties, the Corporation ranked in the top 5 in deposit market share (based on deposits as of June 30, 2015 ).

Supervision and Regulation 

The Corporation operates in an industry that is subject to laws and regulations that are enforced by a number of federal and state agencies. Changes in these laws and regulations, including interpretation and enforcement activities, could impact the cost of operating in the financial services industry, limit or expand permissible activities or affect competition among banks and other financial institutions. 

The Corporation is a registered financial holding company, and its subsidiary banks are depository institutions whose deposits are insured by the FDIC. The Corporation and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation and examination by regulatory authorities. The following table summarizes the charter types and primary regulators for each of the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks:

Federal statutes that apply to the Corporation and its subsidiaries include the GLB Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA), the Federal Reserve Act, the National Bank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, among others. In general, these statutes, regulations promulgated thereunder, and related interpretations establish the eligible business activities of the Corporation, certain acquisition and merger restrictions, limitations on intercompany transactions, such as loans and dividends, and capital adequacy requirements, among other things. 

The Corporation is subject to regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve Bank, and is required to file periodic reports and to provide additional information that the Federal Reserve may require. In addition, the Federal Reserve must approve certain proposed changes in organizational structure or other business activities before they occur. The BHCA imposes certain restrictions 

upon the Corporation regarding the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of, or direct or indirect ownership or control of, any bank for which it is not already the majority owner. 

Dodd-Frank Act &#32;- The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted in July 2010 and resulted in significant financial regulatory reform. The Dodd-Frank Act also changed the responsibilities of the current federal banking regulators. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, with oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has broad regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services. Effective July 21, 2011, the CFPB became responsible for administering and enforcing numerous federal consumer financial laws enumerated in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act also provided that, for banks with total assets of more than $10 billion, the CFPB would have exclusive or primary authority to examine those banks for, and enforce compliance with, the federal consumer financial laws. As of December 31, 2015, none of the Corporation's subsidiary banks had total assets of more than $10 billion; however, the Corporation's largest subsidiary bank, Fulton Bank, N. A., had $9.8 billion &#32;in assets. Although not subject to CFPB examination, the Corporation's subsidiary banks remain subject to the review and supervision of other applicable regulatory authorities, and such authorities may enforce compliance with regulations issued by the CFPB. In the event that Fulton Bank, N.A.'s total assets exceed $10 billion in the future, Fulton Bank, N.A. would become subject to supervision, examination and enforcement by the CFPB. 

Stress testing &#32;- In October 2012, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) issued final rules regarding company-run stress testing. In accordance with these rules, the Corporation is required to conduct an annual stress test in the manner specified, and using assumptions for baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios announced by the FRB. The stress test is designed to assess the potential impact of the various scenarios on the Corporation's earnings, capital levels and capital ratios over a nine-quarter time horizon. The Corporation's board of directors and its senior management are required to consider the results of the stress test in the normal course of business, including as part of the Corporation's capital planning process and the evaluation of the adequacy of its capital. Public disclosure of summary stress test results under the severely adverse scenario began in June 2015 for stress tests that commenced in the fall of 2014. The Corporation believes that both the quality and magnitude of its capital base are sufficient to support its current operations given its risk profile. The results of the annual stress testing process did not lead the Corporation to raise additional capital or alter the mix of its capital components. Pursuant to final rules published in October 2014 and December 2015, the FRB modified the start date of the stress test cycles so that, going forward, stress tests must be conducted using financial data as of December 31 of the prior year, the results of the stress test must be reported to the FRB on or before July 31 and a summary of the results of the stress test must be publicly disclosed between October 15 and October 31. Under similar rules adopted by the OCC, national banks with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion are also required to conduct annual stress tests. Although the total consolidated assets of Fulton Bank, N.A., the Corporation's largest subsidiary bank, are less than $10 billion, if Fulton Bank, N.A.&#8217;s assets exceed $10 billion in the future, it will become subject to the OCC&#8217;s stress test rules. 

Residential Lending Laws &#32;- As a residential mortgage lender, the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are subject to multiple federal consumer protection statutes and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Truth-In-Lending Act (TILA), the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Act and the Flood Disaster Protection Act. Failure to comply with these and similar statutes and regulations can result in the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries becoming subject to formal or informal enforcement actions, the imposition of civil money penalties and consumer litigation. 

Ability-to-pay rules and qualified mortgages &#32;- As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a series of final rules in January 2013 amending Regulation Z, implementing the TILA, which requires mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a residential mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. These final rules prohibit creditors, such as the Corporation's bank subsidiaries, from extending residential mortgage loans without regard for the consumer's ability to repay and add restrictions and requirements to residential mortgage origination and servicing practices. In addition, these rules restrict the imposition of prepayment penalties and compensation practices relating to residential mortgage loan origination. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers&#8217; ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate "qualified mortgages," which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a qualified mortgage is a residential mortgage loan that does not have certain high risk features, such as negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or a term exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount and the borrower&#8217;s total debt-to-income ratio must be no higher than 43% (subject to certain limited exceptions for loans eligible for purchase, guarantee or insurance by a government sponsored entity or a federal agency). 

Integrated disclosures under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Lending Act &#32;- As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued final rules in December 2013 revising and integrating previously separate disclosures required under 

the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and the TILA in connection with certain closed-end consumer mortgage loans. These final rules became effective August 1, 2015 and require lenders to provide a new Loan Estimate, combining content from the former Good Faith Estimate required under RESPA and the initial disclosures required under TILA, not later than the third business day after submission of a loan application, and a new Closing Disclosure, combining content of the former HUD-1 Settlement Statement required under RESPA and the final disclosures required under TILA, at least three days prior to the loan closing. 

Consumer Financial Protection Enforcement &#32;- The CFPB has exclusive examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws and regulations by institutions under its supervision and is authorized, individually or jointly with the federal bank regulatory agencies (the Agencies), to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is, or has, engaged in conduct that violates such laws or regulations. The CFPB may bring an administrative enforcement proceeding or civil action in Federal district court. In addition, in accordance with a memorandum of understanding entered into between the CFPB and the Department of Justice (DOJ), the two agencies have agreed to coordinate efforts related to enforcing the fair lending laws, which includes information sharing and conducting joint investigations. As an independent bureau within the FRB, the CFPB may impose requirements that are more severe than those of the other bank regulatory agencies. During 2015, the CFPB and the DOJ pursued a number of enforcement actions against depository institutions with respect to compliance with fair lending laws. 

Volcker Rule &#32;- As mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, in December 2013, the OCC, FRB, FDIC, SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued final rulings (the Final Rules) implementing certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and non-bank financial company supervised by the FRB to engage in proprietary trading and have certain ownership interests in, or relationships with, a "covered fund" (the so-called Volcker Rule). The Final Rules generally treat as a covered fund any entity that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act) but for the application of the exemptions from SEC registration set forth in Section 3(c)(1) (fewer than 100 beneficial owners) or Section 3(c)(7) (qualified purchasers) of the 1940 Act. The Final Rules also require regulated entities to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in proprietary trading and covered fund activities covered by the Volcker Rule. Although the Final Rules provide some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including the Corporation. In December 2014, the FRB extended, until July 21, 2016, the date by which banking entities must conform their covered fund activities and investments to the requirements of the Final Rules, and announced its intention to grant an additional one-year extension of the conformance period to July 21, 2017. The Corporation does not engage in proprietary trading or in any other activities prohibited by the Final Rules. Based on the Corporation's evaluation of its investments, none fall within the definition of a "covered fund" and would need to be disposed of by July 21, 2016 or any further extension of the conformance date that maybe granted by the FRB. Therefore, it does not currently expect that the Final Rules will have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 

Capital Requirements &#32;- There are a number of restrictions on financial and bank holding companies and FDIC-insured depository subsidiaries that are designed to minimize potential loss to depositors and the FDIC insurance funds. Also, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its depository institution subsidiaries and to commit resources to support such institutions in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy. Under the BHCA, the FRB has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or to relinquish control of a non-bank subsidiary upon the FRB&#8217;s determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of a depository institution subsidiary of the bank holding company. 

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel) is a committee of central banks and bank regulators from major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country&#8217;s regulators with the purpose of ensuring that financial institutions have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off-balance sheet financial instruments. In December 2010, Basel released frameworks for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulations, referred to as Basel III. 

In July 2013, the FRB approved final rules (the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations and implementing the BASEL's December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital standards. The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions. 

The new minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015, and will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. 

The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules require the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries to: 

&#8226; 

Meet a new minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.50% of risk-weighted assets and a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.00% of risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

Continue to require the current minimum Total capital ratio of 8.00% of risk-weighted assets and the minimum Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 4.00% of average assets; and 

&#8226; 

Comply with a revised definition of capital to improve the ability of regulatory capital instruments to absorb losses. Certain non-qualifying capital instruments, including cumulative preferred stock and TruPS, are being phased out as a component of Tier 1 capital for institutions of the Corporation's size. In July 2015, the previously outstanding trust preferred securities issued by Fulton Capital Trust I were redeemed. 

The U.S. Basel III Capital Rules use a standardized approach for risk weightings that expand the risk-weightings for assets and off balance sheet exposures from the previous 0%, 20%, 50% and 100% categories to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets and off-balance sheet exposures and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. 

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Corporation and its bank subsidiaries will also be required to maintain a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.50% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The required minimum capital conservation buffer began to be phased in incrementally, starting at 0.625%, on January 1, 2016, and will increase to 1.25% on January 1, 2017, 1.875% on January 1, 2018 and 2.50% on January 1, 2019. The rules provide that the failure to maintain the "capital conservation buffer" will result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers. As a result, under the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules, if any of the Corporation's bank subsidiaries fails to maintain the required minimum capital conservation buffer, the Corporation will be subject to limits, and possibly prohibitions, on its ability to obtain capital distributions from such subsidiaries. If the Corporation does not receive sufficient cash dividends from its bank subsidiaries, it may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends on its capital stock, service its debt obligations or repurchase its common stock. In addition, the restrictions on payments of discretionary cash bonuses to executive officers may make it more difficult for the Corporation to retain key personnel. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Corporation met the fully-phased in minimum capital requirements, including the new capital conservation buffer, as prescribed in the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules. 

The Basel III liquidity framework also includes new liquidity requirements that require financial institutions to maintain increased levels of liquid assets or alter their strategies for liquidity management. The Basel III liquidity framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific ratios. 

In September 2014, the FRB approved final rules (the U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule) implementing portions of the Basel III liquidity framework for large, internationally active banking organizations, generally those having $250 billion or more in total assets, and similar, but less stringent rules, applicable to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule requires banking organizations to maintain a Liquidity Coverage Ratio, or LCR, that is designed to ensure that sufficient high quality liquid resources are available for a one month period in case of a stress scenario. Impacted financial institutions are required to be compliant with the U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule by January 1, 2017. Because the Corporation&#8217;s total assets and the scope of its operations do not currently meet the thresholds set forth in the U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule, the Corporation is not currently required to maintain a minimum LCR. 

The Basel III liquidity framework also introduced a second ratio, referred to as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which is designed to promote funding resiliency over longer-term time horizons by creating additional incentives for banks to fund their activities with more stable sources of funding on an ongoing structural basis. This new liquidity standard is subject to further rulemaking. To date, U.S. banking regulators have not proposed any additional liquidity rules. Because of the Corporation's size, neither the U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule nor any additional proposed rules under the Basel III liquidity framework are applicable to it. 

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action &#32;- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. Under this system, the federal bank regulators are required to take certain, and authorized to take other, supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, based upon five categories of capitalization which FDICIA created: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," and "critically undercapitalized," the severity of which depends upon the institution&#8217;s degree of capitalization. Generally, a capital restoration plan must be filed with the institution&#8217;s primary federal regulator within 45 days of the date an institution receives notice that it is "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" or "critically undercapitalized," and the plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company. In addition, various mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to the institution, including restrictions on growth of assets and other forms of expansion. Prior to January 1, 2015, an insured depository institution was treated as well capitalized if its total risk-based capital ratio was 10.00% or greater, its Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 6.00% or greater and its Tier 1 leverage capital ratio was 5.00% or greater, and it was not subject to any order or directive by its primary federal regulator to meet a specific capital level. Effective January 1, 2015, an insured depository institution is treated as well capitalized if its total risk-based capital ratio is 10.00% or greater, its Tier 1 risk- 

based capital ratio is 8.00% or greater, its Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is 6.50% or greater and its Tier 1 leverage capital ratio is 5.00% or greater, and it is not subject to any order or directive to meet a specific capital level. As of December 31, 2015, each of the Corporation&#8217;s bank subsidiaries&#8217; capital ratios were above the minimum levels required to be considered "well capitalized" by its primary federal regulator. 

Loans and Dividends from Subsidiary Banks &#32;- There are various restrictions on the extent to which the Corporation's bank subsidiaries can make loans or extensions of credit to, or enter into certain transactions with, its affiliates, which would include the Corporation and its non-banking subsidiaries. In general, these restrictions require that such loans be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and are limited, as to any one of the Corporation or its non-bank subsidiaries, to 10% of the lending bank&#8217;s regulatory capital (20% in the aggregate to all such entities). The Dodd-Frank Act expanded these restrictions, effective in July 2012, to cover securities lending, repurchase agreement and derivatives activities that the Corporation&#8217;s bank subsidiaries may have with an affiliate. 

For safety and soundness reasons, banking regulations also limit the amount of cash that can be transferred from subsidiary banks to the Parent Company in the form of dividends. Dividend limitations vary, depending on the subsidiary bank&#8217;s charter and whether or not it is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Generally, subsidiaries are prohibited from paying dividends when doing so would cause them to fall below the regulatory minimum capital levels. Additionally, limits may exist on paying dividends in excess of net income for specified periods. See "Note 11 - Regulatory Matters," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information regarding regulatory capital and dividend and loan limitations. 

Federal Deposit Insurance &#32;- Substantially all of the deposits of the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks are insured up to the applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC, generally up to $250,000 per insured depositor. 

The subsidiary banks pay deposit insurance premiums based on assessment rates established by the FDIC. The FDIC has established a risk-based assessment system under which institutions are classified and pay premiums according to their perceived risk to the DIF. An institution&#8217;s base assessment rate is generally subject to following adjustments: (1) a decrease for the institution&#8217;s long-term unsecured debt, including most senior and subordinated debt, (2) an increase for brokered deposits above a threshold amount and (3) an increase for unsecured debt held that is issued by another insured depository institution. 

On April 1, 2011, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the deposit insurance assessment base changed from total domestic deposits to average total assets, minus average tangible equity. In addition, the FDIC also created a two scorecard system, one for large depository institutions that have $10 billion or more in assets and another for highly complex institutions that have $50 billion or more in assets. As of December 31, 2015, none of the Corporation&#8217;s individual subsidiary banks had assets of $10 billion or more and, therefore, did not meet the classification of large depository institutions. 

The FDIC annually establishes for the DIF a designated reserve ratio, or DRR, of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC has announced that the DRR for 2016 will remain at 2.00%, which is the same ratio that has been in effect since January 1, 2011. The FDIC is authorized to change deposit insurance assessment rates as necessary to maintain the DRR, without further notice-and-comment rulemaking, provided that: (1) no such adjustment can be greater than three basis points from one quarter to the next, (2) adjustments cannot result in rates more than three basis points above or below the base rates and (3) rates cannot be negative. 

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum DIF reserve ratio to 1.35% of insured deposits, which must be reached by September 30, 2020, and provides that, in setting the assessment rates necessary to meet the new requirement, the FDIC shall offset the effect of this provision on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, so that more of the cost of raising the reserve ratio will be borne by the institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a restoration plan to ensure that the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020. 

On October 22, 2015, the FDIC issued a proposal to increase the reserve ratio for the DIF to the minimum level of 1.35% as required by the Reform Act. The proposed rule would impose on insured depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets a quarterly surcharge equal to an annual rate of 4.5 basis points applied to the deposit insurance assessment base, after making certain adjustments. If the rule is adopted as proposed, the FDIC expects that these surcharges would commence in 2016 and continue for approximately eight quarters; however, if the reserve ratio for the DIF does not reach the required level by December 31, 2018, the FDIC would impose a shortfall assessment on March 31, 2019, which would be collected on June 30, 2019. To the extent that any of the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks&#8217; assets exceeds $10 billion in the future, such rulemaking could result in an increase in the deposit insurance assessments for such banks. 

USA Patriot Act &#32;- Anti-terrorism legislation enacted under the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) expanded the scope of anti-money laundering laws and regulations and imposed significant new compliance obligations for financial institutions, including the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks. These regulations include obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. 

Among other requirements, the Patriot Act and the related regulations impose the following requirements with respect to financial institutions: 

&#8226; 

Establishment of anti-money laundering programs; 

&#8226; 

Establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining identifying information from customers seeking to open new accounts, including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time; 

&#8226; 

&#32;Establishment of enhanced due diligence policies, procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering; and 

&#8226; 

Prohibition on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with recordkeeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks. 

Failure to comply with the Patriot Act&#8217;s requirements could have serious legal, financial, regulatory and reputational consequences. In addition, bank regulators will consider a holding company&#8217;s effectiveness in combating money laundering when ruling on BHCA and Bank Merger Act applications. The Corporation has adopted policies, procedures and controls to address compliance with the Patriot Act and will continue to revise and update its policies, procedures and controls to reflect required changes. The Corporation and its banking subsidiaries are currently subject to regulatory enforcement orders (the Consent Orders) issued by bank regulatory agencies relating to identified deficiencies in a largely centralized compliance program (the BSA/AML Compliance Program) designed to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, the Patriot Act and related anti-money laundering regulations (the BSA/AML Requirements). The Consent Orders require, among other things, that the Corporation and its banking subsidiaries review, assess and take actions to strengthen and enhance the BSA/AML Compliance Program, and, in some cases, conduct retrospective reviews of past account activity and transactions, as well as certain reports filed in accordance with the BSA/AML Requirements, to determine whether suspicious activity and certain transactions in currency were properly identified and reported in accordance with the BSA/AML Requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - "The Corporation and its bank subsidiaries are subject to regulatory enforcement orders requiring improvement in compliance functions and remedial actions" under "Legal, Compliance and Reputational Risks;" Item 3. Legal Proceedings; "Regulatory Enforcement Orders," under "Overview and Outlook" in Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and "Note 11 - Regulatory Matters," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 

Commercial Real Estate Guidance &#32;- In December 2015, the Agencies released a statement entitled "Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending" (the CRE Statement). In the CRE Statement, the Agencies express concerns with institutions which ease commercial real estate underwriting standards, direct financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and indicate that they will continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. The Agencies previously issued guidance in December 2006, entitled "Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices," which states that an institution is potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk, and should employ enhanced risk management practices, where (1) total commercial real estate loans represents 300% or more of its total capital and (2) the outstanding balance of such institution's commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months. 

Community Reinvestment &#32;- Under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), each of the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to ascertain and meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income areas. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires an institution&#8217;s primary federal regulator, in connection with its examination of the institution, to assess the institution's record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution. The assessment focuses on three tests: (1) a lending test, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s record of making loans, including community development loans, in its designated assessment areas; (2) an investment test, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and areas and small businesses; and (3) a service test, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s delivery of banking services throughout its CRA assessment area, including low and moderate income areas. The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. As of December 31, 2015, all of the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks are rated at least as "satisfactory." Regulations require that the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of CRA. None of the Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary banks are party to any such agreements at this time. 

Standards for Safety and Soundness &#32;- Pursuant to the requirements of FDICIA, as amended by the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The 

guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. An institution must submit a compliance plan to its regulator if it is notified that it is not satisfying any such safety and soundness standards. If the institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the regulator must issue an order directing corrective actions and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the "prompt corrective action" provisions of FDICIA. If the institution fails to comply with such an order, the regulator may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties. 

Privacy Protection &#32;- The Corporation&#8217;s bank subsidiaries are subject to regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLB Act. These regulations require each of the Corporation&#8217;s bank subsidiaries to disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares "nonpublic personal information," to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. The regulations also require the bank to provide its customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect its privacy policies and practices. In addition, to the extent its sharing of such information is not covered by an exception, the bank is required to provide its customers with the ability to "opt-out" of having the bank share their nonpublic personal information with unaffiliated third parties. 

The Corporation&#8217;s bank subsidiaries are subject to regulatory guidelines establishing standards for safeguarding customer information. These regulations implement certain provisions of the GLB Act. The guidelines describe the federal bank regulatory agencies&#8217; expectations for the creation, implementation and maintenance of an information security program, which would include administrative, technical and physical safeguards appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. The standards set forth in the guidelines are intended to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information, protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. 

Federal Reserve System &#32;- FRB regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and demand deposit accounts). A reserve of 3% is to be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts between $15.2 million and $110.2 million (subject to adjustment by the FRB) plus a reserve of 10% (subject to adjustment by the FRB between 8% and 14%) against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million. The first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustment by the FRB) is exempt from the reserve requirements. Each of the Corporation&#8217;s bank subsidiaries is in compliance with the foregoing requirements. 

Required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, an account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the FRB. Pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, the Federal Reserve Banks pay interest on depository institutions&#8217; required and excess reserve balances. The interest rate paid on required reserve balances is currently the average target federal funds rate over the reserve maintenance period. The rate on excess balances will be set equal to the lowest target federal funds rate in effect during the reserve maintenance period. 

Federal Securities Laws &#32;- The Corporation is subject to the periodic reporting, proxy solicitation, tender offer, insider trading, corporate governance and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, the federal securities laws require management to issue a report on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, the Corporation&#8217;s independent registered public accountants are required to issue an opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. These reports can be found in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Certifications of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer as required by Sarbanes-Oxley and the resulting SEC rules can be found in the "Signatures" and "Exhibits" sections.
