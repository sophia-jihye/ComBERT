INFORMATION ABOUT THE DRAGON MINE 

&#160; 

History of the Dragon Mine 

&#160; 

The Dragon Mine was first mined in the third quarter of the 19 th century. It was mined for iron oxide from the late nineteenth century until approximately 1931 and it was mined for halloysite clay from approximately 1931 to 1976. From 1949 to 1976, the halloysite was sold for use as a petroleum cracking catalyst. No mining took place from 1976 until 2001 at which point the Company leased the property with an option to buy it. The Company purchased the property in 2005. 

&#160; 

The Company acquired the Dragon Mine primarily to exploit the mine&#8217;s halloysite resources. Prior to a change in management in 2009, the Company did relatively little to explore the mineralization at the Dragon Mine or to identify and exploit markets for halloysite. 

&#160; 

At the time that the Dragon Mine was acquired, it was assumed that the iron oxide mineralization would be useful only for steel making. Given historical market conditions, sales for such use would often not be economic and at best would yield marginal profits. It was not until 2009 that the Company explored the iron oxide mineralization and realized its high quality and the commercial possibilities it possessed for applications currently utilizing synthetic iron oxides, which are higher in cost, as well as applications where synthetic iron oxides are not utilized due to it being cost prohibitive. We believe the iron oxide deposit at the Dragon Mine is a high-quality deposit due to its high Fe2O3 content, relative chemical purity, good dispersibility, good tinting strength and color saturation, low color variation, low content of heavy metals, and high surface area (25 m2/g &#8211; 125 m2/g and reactivity). 

&#160; &#160; 

Resource Study of the Dragon Mine&#8217;s Mineralization 

&#160; 

There are two areas of the Dragon Mine minesite at which mining is conducted and they are referred to the &#8220;Dragon Pit&#8221; are and the &#8220;Western Area.&#8221; In addition, there are five surface piles on the site, mineralization that was left by prior operators. 

&#160; 

The Company commissioned a study (and later an update) of the mine&#8217;s &#8220;resources&#8221; that was conducted using the standards of the JORC Code of the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. We will refer to the study and the update as the &#8220;study.&#8221; That study indicated the existence of JORC &#8220;resources&#8221; of halloysite clay and iron oxide. Under the JORC Code, resource tonnages are reported in situ and are not net of (i) diluting materials or (ii) losses due to the mining process. 

&#160; 

A JORC resource is defined is a &#8220;mineral deposit in such form, grade&#8230;and quantity that there are reasonable for prospects for eventual economic extraction.&#8221; There are three levels of resources, differentiated by the level of confidence and they are in ascending order of confidence: inferred, indicated, and measured. 

&#160; 

A JORC indicated resource is an economic mineral occurrence that has been sampled (from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits and boreholes) to a point where an estimate has been made, at a reasonable level of confidence, of its contained metal, grade, tonnage, shape, densities, and physical characteristics. 

&#160; 

A JORC measured resource is an indicated resource that has undergone enough further sampling to be an acceptable estimate, at a high degree of confidence, of the grade, tonnage, shape, densities, physical characteristics and mineral content of the mineral occurrence. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The results of the study are summarized below. The tonnages in the Dragon Pit, the Western Area, and in Surface Pile #1 are considered &#8220;measured&#8221; resources. The tonnages in Waste Piles #2 - #5 are considered &#8220;indicated&#8221; resources. 

&#160; 

The study was performed by Ian Wilson, Ph.D. as our consulting geologist. Dr. Wilson has supervised our drilling program. Dr. Wilson is a member of iom 3 (Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining of the UK). From 1974 to 2001 Mr. Wilson worked with English China Clays/Imerys mainly as a geologist and with management roles in Brazil, Spain, Sweden and China. Since his retirement in 2001, he has worked as an independent consultant dealing with many industrial minerals including halloysite. 

&#160; 

Dragon Pit 

&#160; 

The Dragon Pit area covers 4.95 acres and is mined underground. There are three separate types of mineralized material in the Dragon Pit area. 

&#160; 

The first type is comprised of clay with a relatively high concentration (approximately 94%) of halloysite. The Dragon Pit contains 625,650 tons of this type of mineralized material. 

&#160; 

The second type is comprised of a mix of kaolinite, illite-smectite, and halloysite clays. Clays constitute approximately 73.4% of this mineralization, of which halloysite constitutes approximately 42.6%, kaolinite constitutes 19.2% and illite-smectite constitutes 11.6%. The Dragon Pit contains 565,575 tons of this type of mineralized material. 

&#160; 

The third type of mineralized material found in the Dragon Pit is comprised of iron-bearing materials. This mineralization contains goethite and hematite. When dehydrated, goethite forms hematite. We will sometimes refer to either minerals or combinations of the minerals as &#8220;iron oxide.&#8221; The mineralization is approximately 94% iron oxide, of which goethite accounts for 69.7% and hematite 24.3%. There exist separate areas of goethite and hematite but the majority of the iron-bearing mineralization in the Dragon Pit exists as a goethite-hematite mix. The Dragon Pit contains 3,254,989 tons of this iron-bearing mineralization.

(1) 

The amount is the result of processing to &#60;45 microns, which eliminated 27% of the starting unprocessed material. The material would have to be wet processed so that the &#62;45 micron material can be removed. The Company does not presently have wet processing capability and would either have to invest in additional processing equipment or contract a third party toll processor to perform this function. The pure halloysite is used in our DRAGONITE products and mixed clays are not used in our DRAGONITE products.

LOI, or Loss on Ignition, is a test used in inorganic analytical chemistry, particularly in the analysis of minerals. It consists of strongly heating ("igniting") a sample of the material at a specified temperature, allowing volatile substances (such as water) to escape, until its mass ceases to change. LOI is generally described as the amount of moisture and trapped volatile oxides or carbonates present in the ore. 

&#160; 

Western Area 

&#160; 

The Western area covers 6.33 acres and is mined underground. There are two different types of mineralization in the Western Area. 

&#160; 

One type of mineralization in the Western Area is clay. It is comprised primarily of a mix of kaolinite, illite-smectite, and halloysite clays. The clay content of this mineralization is approximately 71.4%, of which kaolinite constitutes 47.2%, illite-smectite constitutes 17.5%, and halloysite constitutes 6.7%. The Western Area contains 862,903 tons of this type of mineralization. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The other type of mineralization is iron bearing. The Western Area contains goethite and hematite. The mineralization is approximately 96% iron oxide on a mineralogical basis, of which hematite accounts for 75.9% and goethite 20.1%. There exist separate areas of goethite and hematite but the majority of the iron-bearing mineralization in the Western Area exists as a goethite-hematite mix. The Western Area contains 797,717 tons of this iron-bearing mineralization.

Surface Piles 

&#160; 

There are five surface piles that were created during the mining of halloysite clay between 1949 and 1976 when the Dragon Mine&#8217;s halloysite resource for use as a petroleum cracking catalyst. Any clay that contained more than a minimal amount (~ 2%) of iron oxide was not usable for petroleum cracking and was discarded into one of five surface piles. 

&#160; 

The following sets forth information about the mineralized material by surface pile:

These clays are not used in our DRAGONITE products. 

&#160; 

In addition to the surface pile material described above, there is a surface pile of approximately 20,000 tons of mined iron oxide on the surface of the Dragon Mine property. 

&#160; 

Resource Development/Exploration Drilling Expenses 

&#160; 

In 2015 and 2014, the Company spent $4,245,478 and $4,626,139, respectively, on exploration and resource development. 

&#160; 

More Detailed Description of the Mineralization at the Dragon Mine 

&#160; 

Clays . Kaolinite and halloysite are clays and members of the kaolin group of clays. Both are aluminosilicate clays. Kaolinite and halloysite are essentially chemically identical, but have different morphologies (shapes). Kaolinite typically appears in plates or sheets. Halloysite, in contrast, typically appears in the shape of hollow tubes. On average, the halloysite tubes have a length in the range of 0.5 - 3.0 microns, an exterior diameter in the range of 50 - 70 nanometers and an internal diameter (lumen) in the range of 15 - 30 nanometers. Formation of halloysite occurs when kaolinite sheets roll into tubes due to the strain caused by a lattice mismatch between the adjacent silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide layers. Halloysite is non-toxic and natural, demonstrating high biocompatibility without posing any risk to the environment. 

&#160; 

Kaolinite is one of the world&#8217;s most common minerals. U.S. production in 2014 was approximately 6.3 million tons. 

&#160; 

Halloysite is, by comparison, a rarer mineral and we believe worldwide production is less than 25,000 tons. 

&#160; 

Illite refers to a group of clays that includes hydrous micas, phengite, brammalite, celadonite, and glauconite. Illite clays are common and large amounts are produced each year. 

&#160; 

Smectite refers to a group of clays that includes montmorillonite, bentonite, nontronite, hectorite, saponite and sauconite. Smectite clays are common clay and large amounts are produced each year. 

&#160; 

Iron Oxide . Hematite is the mineral form of iron oxide, which exists in a range of colors, including black to steel or silver-gray and brown to reddish brown, or red. 

&#160; 

Geothite is an iron hydroxide oxide mineral, which exists in a range of colors, including yellowish to reddish to dark brown. If goethite is sufficiently heated to eliminate its contained water, it is transformed into hematite. 

&#160; 

Mixtures of goethite and hematite are the color brown.

Procedures Used to Develop the Tonnage and Grade Results in Resource Study 

&#160; 

The following describes sample collection, sample preparation, and the analytical procedures used to develop analytical results set forth above for the Dragon Pit, the Western Area, and the Surface Piles. 

&#160; 

Surface surveying positioning of holes was carried out using sub-centimeter Trimble GPS Receivers (base station and Rover) with accuracy within 5mm. Underground surveying utilized a Topcon GTS3 Total Station, which measures angle to one second and measures distances to parts per million. A DSI (Deviation Survey Instrument) SRG (Surface Recording Gyro) was utilized to measure deviation of the hole. A Brunton compass is used to determine a reference line. Readings are taken every 50&#8217; during the survey and a final reference reading is used to calculate the hole&#8217;s overall drift. When run correctly, the instrument is accurate to within 1 foot per 1000&#8217; of depth. 

&#160; 

Core drilling was carried out and for all boreholes the driller placed the core into a box, which was carefully labeled with borehole number, depth reached and any voids noted. A LCF (Lithology Control File) was established for each area and it included all rock types identified. The borehole number, coordinates, elevation, inclination, azimuth, and depths drilled were entered into a log showing the LCF. 

&#160; 

Services on the clay extracted from the drill holes: Moisture Content; XRD identification; XRPD quantitative analysis; _XRPD Formamide test; SEM imaging; FTIR analysis; BET Surface Area / Porosity; Qualitative EDS; XRF; ICP&#8212;MS for trace elements; MINOLTA &#8211; Color and brightness measurements. For analysis of the iron oxide, XRD, ICP-MS, BET Surface Area, Color and Brightness measurements were carried out by James Hutton Institute. ALS Minerals Laboratory in Reno, Nevada carried out analytical procedures ME-XRF21u, Iron oxide by XRF Fusion &#8211; normalized (XRF Instrument), OA-CRAE05x, LOIS for XRF (WST-SEQ) AND Au-ICP21, Au 30g FA ICP-AES Finish (ICP-AES Instrument) 

&#160; 

Logging was carried out in line with the Lithology Control File. All of the data was then entered into a spreadsheet to show Borehole Number, coordinates, elevation and individual test results for each of the increments sampled and tested. 

&#160; 

The Company utilized the PC/Core software package to convert raw borehole data and assumptions by the Company into a mathematical model using block model interpolation. The program provides for the production of &#8220;Quality Array Reports,&#8221; each of which shows the correlation between one variable and all of the other variables in the model. 

&#160; 

STATUS OF THE COMPANY FOR SEC REPORTING PURPOSES 

&#160; 

The Company is classified as an &#8220;exploration stage&#8221; company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

&#160; 

Under Industry Guide 7, companies engaged in significant mining operations are classified into three categories, referred to as &#8220;stages&#8221; - exploration, development, and production. 

&#160; 

Exploration stage includes all companies engaged in the search for mineral deposits (that is, reserves), which are not in either the development or production stage. In order to be classified as a development or production stage company, the company must have already established reserves. Notwithstanding the nature and extent of development-type or production-type activities that have been undertaken or completed, a company cannot be classified as a development or production stage company unless it has established reserves. 

&#160; 

Under Industry Guide 7, a &#8220;reserve&#8221; is &#8220;that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.&#8221; Generally speaking, a company may not declare reserves, unless, among other requirements, a competent professional engineer conducts a detailed engineering and economic study and prepare a &#8220;bankable&#8221; or &#8220;final&#8221; feasibility study that &#8220;demonstrates that a mineral deposit can be mined profitably at a commercial rate.&#8221; 

&#160; 

The Company commissioned a study and an update of &#8220;resources&#8221; under the JORC Code of the Australasian Code for Reporting Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. That study indicated the existence of JORC &#8220;resources&#8221; of halloysite clay and iron oxide. A JORC resource is defined is a &#8220;mineral deposit in such form, grad and quantity that there are reasonable for prospects for eventual economic extraction,&#8221; a lower standard than that used for a final feasibility study. Among the differences between resources determined under the JORC Code and Industry Guide 7 is that under the JORC Code resources are measured in situ and are not net of diluting materials and mining losses, while under Industry Guide 7, the reserves are not measured in this fashion. 

&#160; &#160; 

Despite the fact that the Company has not established reserves for purposes of Industry Guide 7, the Company has mined, processed and sold, and intends to continue to mine, process, and sell halloysite clay and iron oxide from the Dragon Mine. 

&#160; 

A consequence of the absence of reserves under Industry Guide 7 is that the mining company, such as the Company, is deemed to lack an objective basis to assert that it has a deposit with mineralization that can be economically and legally extracted or produced and sold to produce revenue. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

PROCESSING FACILITIES AT THE DRAGON MINE 

&#160;

We have a mineral processing plant with a capacity of up to 45,000 tons per annum for certain applications. Currently, this facility is dedicated to processing our iron oxide resource. This facility involves a preliminary step of crushing the iron oxide in a crusher and a further step of pulverizing the iron oxide in our Hosokawa Alpine table roller mill. Depending on the customer&#8217;s specifications, if we need to only process the iron oxide through the preliminary step of crushing, our production capacity would be significantly greater than 45,000 tons per annum. Additionally, the Company has a second processing facility with a capacity of up to 10,000 tons per annum that is dedicated to its halloysite resource. We use a dry beneficiation method to process our halloysite products, which involves a preliminary step of crushing the halloysite clay in a crusher and a further step of micronizing the halloysite. The process may, in certain instances, utilize a low energy jet mill. None of our systems employ any chemicals. Wet processing is available through toll processors. 

&#160; 

If demand for halloysite increases beyond our current capacity, we may choose to outsource the processing of the mineral to a third party or invest in more processing capacity. 

&#160;

SALE OF PRODUCTS 

&#160; 

AMIRON 

&#160;

At the current time, we are selling AMIRON iron oxide to one customer on an ongoing basis. That customer uses the AMIRON as a catalyst to adsorb a gas. The agreement with that company calls for the sale of $5 million of AMIRON over a period of 18 months, which commenced in December, 2015. (The Company has agreed not to sell AMIRON to other customers for use in the same application for five years. The customer may elect to make another $5 million purchase at the end of five years and extend the exclusivity for this application for a total of ten years. 

&#160; 

In 2015, we sold 20 tons of AMIRON to two other customers for use in commercial sales (as opposed to testing); one of the customers used the AMIRON in a biogas application and the other used it in connection with stain dispersion. The Company received no adverse feedback from such customers. 

&#160; 

The Company is exploring whether AMIRON can be sold as an effective and cost-efficient substitute or partial substitute for barite as a weighting agent in certain drilling fluids used in the production of oil and gas. There is no certainty that the Company will be successful in penetrating this market. 

&#160; 

The path to commercialization begins with testing by the customer and ends with a customer&#8217;s decision to commercialize the product after pilot scale production trials and, in certain cases, commercial scale production trials. The Company is working with many potential customers and individual potential customers are at different stages of the commercialization process. There is no certainty that any potential customer who tests our products will actually become a customer on an ongoing basis. 

&#160; 

DRAGONITE 

&#160;

At the current time, the Company is selling halloysite on an ongoing basis to seven customers. One customer uses the halloysite to manufacture a specialty zeolite, which is used in an adsorption application. The initial purchase order of $228,000 was placed in 2015. The Company also sells to three ceramic companies that use the halloysite as a binder; to a large manufacturing company that uses the halloysite in structural acrylic adhesives; to a customer that uses the halloysite to strengthen epoxy resins; and to a large manufacturer that uses the halloysite for nucleation in extruded polymers. 

&#160;

There is no certainty that any potential customer who tests our products will actually become a customer on an ongoing basis . The Company currently is cautiously optimistic that additional customers could become ongoing customers with additional revenue in 2016 or early 2017.

&#160; 

APPLICATION MARKETS 

&#160; 

The following discusses the markets into which the Company is marketing its DRAGONITE and AMIRON products. It cannot be assured that we will be successful penetrating these markets. The discussion does not discuss certain problems of selling into these markets, which are discussed elsewhere in the Business section or in the Risk Factors section. 

&#160; 

DRAGONITE 

&#160; 

The following is a description of the application markets to which the Company is marketing its halloysite-based DRAGONITE products: 

&#160; 

Fla m e retardant additives for plastics . Flame retardants are widely used in flammable and flame resistant plastics and are found in electronics, building insulation, polyurethane foam, and wire and cable. There are three types of flame retardants used in plastics: 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Minerals, including halloysite, aluminum trihydrate (ATH), magnesium dihydrate (MDH), glass fiber, organoclays, and a number of other less important minerals; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Halogenated compounds (compounds containing bromine or chlorine). Halogenated flame retardants are used in conjunction with a synergist (something that enhances the effectiveness of an active agent) to enhance their efficiency. Antimony trioxide (ATO) is widely used as a synergist for halogenated fire retardants. Halogenated fire retardants have been associated with health concerns due to the potential toxicity of the decomposition products, namely dioxins and furans, as well as environmental and bioaccumulation concerns and there has been action, in the form of treaties and federal and state legislation, to restrict certain uses of halogenated fire retardants. 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Organophosphorus compounds. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Plastic manufacturers typically mix or load a small amount of flame retardant to plastic to lower the risk of flammability of their products. We believe that DRAGONITE can be used as a partial replacement for Alumina Trihydrate (ATH) and Magnesium Hydroxide (MDH) in certain applications and as a synergist to ATH and MDH in other applications. At typical loadings, ATH and MDH can adversely affect certain mechanical properties of plastics. We believe that DRAGONITE, in conjunction with ATH and MDH, exhibits a synergistic performance without degrading the mechanical properties of a polymer matrix. Our research and development indicates that DRAGONITE can be used to replace 50% - 75% of antimony trioxide (ATO) in plastic without affecting flame retardancy, retaining the same rating under UL 94, the Standard for Safety of Flammability of Plastic Materials for Parts in Devices and Appliances testing. The price of ATO is approximately $5,000 per ton. 

&#160; 

Generally speaking, we believe the use of DRAGONITE instead of other fire retardant products should allow a manufacturer to use less fire retardant. A further benefit of using DRAGONITE is that it may enable the manufacturer to reduce the weight of the manufactured part (&#8220;light-weighting&#8221;).. 

&#160; 

Other clays compete in the markets for partially replacing ATH, MDH, and ATO. 

&#160; 

The Company estimates the global demand for flame retardant additives to be approximately 2.2 million metric tons. It cannot be assured that we will be successful penetrating this market. 

&#160; 

Nucleation of Polymers . Plastics and polymers are composed of long molecular chains that form irregular, entangled coils in a melted resin, the phase in which a resin is liquid and its molecules can move about freely. 

&#160; 

Some plastics, namely amorphous types, retain such a disordered structure upon freezing, the state in which a liquid resin becomes solid and its molecules are frozen, or locked, in place and cannot move. In other plastics, such as semi-crystalline polymers, the chains rearrange upon freezing and form partly ordered regions. Examples of semi-crystalline polymers are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), Nylon 6 and Nylon 6-6. 

&#160; 

Crystallization of a polymer occurs as a result of nucleation, a process that starts with small, nanometer-sized domains upon which the polymer chains arrange in an orderly manner to develop larger crystals. The overall rate of crystallization of a polymer be can increased by a nucleating agent. 

&#160; 

In plastic molding processes, especially in injection molding, the plastic part must remain in the mold until freezing. To the extent that crystallization is accelerated, the time in the mold can be reduced, thereby resulting in productivity enhancement. 

&#160; 

We believe that DRAGONITE added to a resin at a loading of just 1% can significantly speed up the process of crystallization. 

&#160;

We believe DRAGONITE is one of only two products that can nucleate polyethylene. The other product, to the best of our knowledge, costs approximately $30,000 per ton. Currently a very small portion of the polyethylene market is nucleated. 

&#160; 

We believe DRAGONITE can also nucleate polypropylene. 

&#160; 

It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating this market. 

&#160; 

Reinforcement Fillers for Polymers. Many plastics are reinforced with a filler to meet the increasing performance requirements of advanced polymer applications. Plastics filled with some type of particulate or fibrous filler are classified as polymer composites. The primary purpose of reinforcement is to enhance the mechanical properties of a polymer. Reinforced plastics, in certain instances, can compete with stiffer materials like metal while also offering an opportunity to reduce the weight of a manufactured part (&#8220;light-weighting&#8221;). 

&#160; 

We believe that: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

the utilization of DRAGONITE as a reinforcing filler results in the improvement of one or more mechanical properties of a polymer such as modulus (the measure of how well a polymer resist breaking when pulled apart), strength (the measure of the stress needed to break a polymer), and impact resistance (the measure of a polymer&#8217;s resistance when impacted by a sharp and sudden stress): 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

DRAGONITE, at a 1% loading, creates the following effects on polyethylene: an increase in modulus of 20% - 25%; an increase in strength of up to 15%; and retention of impact resistance. DRAGONITE, at a 1% loading, creates the following effects on polypropylene: an increase in modulus of 20-25%; an increase in strength of up to 20%; and retention of impact resistance: and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

DRAGONITE, due to the improvements it imparts at such low loading rates, can offer a value proposition when compared to certain traditional fillers. 

&#160; 

We estimate the value of the high-performance filler market to be approximately $17.2 billion. It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating this market. 

&#160; 

Molecular Sieves and Catalysts. A molecular sieve is a material with very small holes of precise and uniform size. These holes are small enough to block large molecules while allowing small molecules to pass. Many molecular sieves are used as desiccants (substances that induce or sustain a state of dryness). Zeolites are a form of molecular sieve that are crystalline with a skeletal composed of aluminosilicates. We believe that DRAGONITE works very well with zeolites and helps entrap water and impurities both within the hollow tubular structure as well as the porous outer walls, enhancing the drying of natural gas and air, the separation of liquid from product streams, and the separation of impurities from a gas stream. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The global market for molecular sieves and other adsorbents is approximately $2.9 billion. 

&#160; 

Crude oil petroleum must be processed in order to make it into gasoline and other fuels. Part of that process includes cracking, whereby large hydrocarbons are broken into smaller ones. There are two general types of cracking, thermal and catalytic. Catalytic cracking involves the addition of a catalyst to speed up the cracking. The reactive nature of halloysite lends itself to be an effective catalyst especially for high sulfur oil. Halloysite can also be used as a support for catalysts, which are applied to the halloysite as a coating. 

&#160; 

Halloysite from the Dragon Mine was mined and processed as a catalyst for petroleum cracking from 1949 to 1976. 

&#160;

It cannot be assured that we will be successful penetrating these markets. 

&#160; 

Ceramics. &#160; A ceramic is any of various hard, brittle, heat-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials made by shaping and then firing a nonmetallic mineral, such as clay, at a high temperature. We market our halloysite to two ceramic markets: whiteware and technical ceramics. Whiteware is a broad class of ceramic products that are white to off-white in appearance and frequently contain a significant vitreous, or glassy, component. These include products such as fine china dinnerware, lavatory sinks and toilets, dental implants, and spark-plug insulators. Whitewares depend for their utility upon a relatively small set of properties: imperviousness to fluids, low conductivity of electricity, chemical inertness, and an ability to be formed into complex shapes. Examples of technical ceramics include ceramic disc brakes, missile nose cones, gas burner nozzles, and ballistic protection. 

&#160; 

It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating this market. &#160; 

&#160; 

Binders . DRAGONITE is an effective binder for traditional ceramic products. Binders are substances that improve the mechanical strength of green ceramic bodies so they can pass through production steps, before firing, without breakage. In many cases, binder additions to ceramic bodies are essential. Without them some production processes would be impossible. We believe that DRAGONITE, when used as a binder, also effectuates an improvement in the casting rate of the ceramic manufacturing process. This would equate to an increase in manufacturing efficiency. 

&#160; 

It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating this market. 

&#160; 

Cosmetics . Halloysite in DRAGONITE has a tubular shape that may be suited for an array of cosmetic applications. We believe the adsorptive nature of the halloysite found in DRAGONITE clay can serve as a hypoallergenic skin cleanser capable of removing unwanted toxins and oils from the skin without the need for harsh chemicals. We believe that DRAGONITE, due primarily to its presence of halloysite, is also capable of exfoliating the skin. DRAGONITE has been shown to be capable of functioning as a non-irritating carrier and release mechanism of cosmetic ingredients for a long lasting application. 

&#160; 

It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating this market. 

&#160; 

Cementing . The Company continues to market its DRAGONITE product to the cement admixture market as well as to consumers of high performance cement. Certain research demonstrates how DRAGONITE, when added to a cement formulation, results in significant improvements in tensile strength and compressive strength while also reducing in permeability. Cement and concrete mixtures, on their own, lack significant tensile strength and must often be reinforced with steel to achieve tensile strength required by many applications. One patent, published in April 2014 (US20140090842 A1), demonstrates how just a 1.5% loading of DRAGONITE to a cement mixture produces an increase in tensile strength of about 135%, a significant increase over a leading strength additive used in well cement. We believe the cementing market offers an attractive opportunity for DRAGONITE. The Company is pursuing a number of commercial trials with customers in the oil and gas and prefabricated-concrete industries. 

&#160; 

It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating this market. 

&#160; 

Controlled Release Carriers . We believe that the halloysite present in DRAGONITE clay can act as an effective carrier of active ingredients, enabling an agent to be released from the carrier over an extended time frame. We believe that this controlled release capability can be utilized in a wide array of applications including, but not limited to, anti-corrosive and anti-mold paint applications, agricultural applications, cosmetics, and certain pharmaceutical products, which would require the prevention of overdosing. In agriculture applications 

&#160; 

DRAGONITE can provide a delivery system for often-toxic agricultural agents. Utilizing the inner lumen of the clay as a natural reservoir, DRAGONITE is able to load, store, and control the release of a range of agents, which, in turn, allows for a lower loading of substances, such as pesticides or herbicides, without sacrificing efficacy. We believe that DRAGONITE release rates can be controlled to match the duration of a growth or reproductive cycle, resulting in a reduction of the frequency of applications of an agent. We believe that DRAGONITE can be used to control the release of the following agents: pesticides, fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, nutrients, and growth stimulants. 

&#160; 

According to BCC Research, the market for materials used as carriers for controlled release applications is approximately $1.0 billion. 

&#160;

It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating this market. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Environmental Remediation . We believe that DRAGONITE, due to its high selectivity of toxic compounds, high porosity, high surface area, fine particle size, fast adsorption rate and high absorption capacity, can act as a sorbent in environmental remediation and emissions capture. We believe that DRAGONITE can be utilized to facilitate the remediation of environments polluted with oil, PCB&#8217;s, toluene, phenols, methylene blue, chromium-6, ammonium, heavy and alkali metals, and uranium. 

&#160; 

It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating this market. 

&#160; &#160;

AMIRON 

&#160; 

The Company markets its AMIRON line of natural iron oxide-based products to the pigmentary and technical application markets. The iron oxide resource at the Dragon Mine has a high content of Fe2O3. We believe that the iron oxide is of high chemical purity, possesses high surface area, fine grains, dispersability, good tinting strength, enhanced color saturation, low color variation, and a low level of heavy metals content, high surface area (25 m2/g &#8211; 125 m2/g and reactivity. For these reasons, we refer to the Dragon Mine&#8217;s iron oxide resource as an &#8220;advanced&#8221; natural iron oxide. 

&#160; 

Pigments. We can produce natural iron oxide pigments. These compete with synthetic iron oxide pigments are produced from basic chemicals. The three major methods for the manufacture of synthetic iron oxides are thermal decomposition of iron salts or iron compounds, precipitation of iron salts usually accompanied by oxidation, and reduction of organic compounds by iron. Synthetic iron oxides account for approximately 80% of the market; natural iron oxides account for approximately 20%. Generally speaking, synthetic iron oxides cost much more to produce than natural iron oxides and sell for prices significantly in excess of natural iron oxides. Traditionally, natural iron oxides, due to their variance in quality, have not been able to compete with synthetic in the pigment market. We believe that the consistency of purity (high level of Fe2O3), desirable dispersibility, color consistency, and UV protection, as well as the lower price, of our iron oxide resource should enable us to compete to some extent with higher priced synthetic iron oxides. 

&#160; 

We currently market our AMIRON line of advanced natural iron oxide pigments for use as artistic paint, interior and semi-transparent and opaque exterior wood stain, semi-transparent cosmetics, food contact colorants, and pharmaceutical applications. We also market to the construction, wood coatings, paints and industrial coatings, plastic and rubber markets, semi-transparent cosmetics, food contact colorants, and pharmaceutical applications. 

&#160; 

Technical applications . Among the technical applications for our AMIRON are the following: adsorbents (iron oxide can be used to remove arsenic, copper, lead, chromium, cadmium from drinking water and to remove moisture from gases. Other applications include iron oxide for agricultural use, as an additive in pet food, and for steel casing in foundries. 

&#160;

We believe we have identified a market opportunity for our AMIRON to be used used as a weighting agent for oil and gas drilling fluids. Currently, barite and hematite are commonly used weighting agents. The estimated current annual U.S. consumption of barite for use as a weighting agent in oil and gas drilling fluids is approximately 3 million metric tons. The Company has had one of its AMIRON products, &#8220;OH50,&#8221; assessed as a weighting agent by a third-party lab focused on the testing of oilfield products. We believe the results from the testing demonstrate that AMIRON OH50 is a viable weighting agent alternative to existing solutions. A number of potential customers focused on the manufacturing and/or distribution of oilfield products are assessing AMIRON for use in this application. 

&#160; 

The Company encounters challenges in marketing DRAGONITE. In particular, the company must compete on price and quality in relation to competitive materials. 

&#160; 

It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating these markets . &#160; 

&#160; 

THE SALES PROCESS 

&#160; 

The Company sells its products using employees, agents, and distributors, selling on a global basis. 

&#160; 

DRAGONITE 

&#160; 

The Company markets its DRAGONITE into two general types of application markets. 

&#160; 

The first type is a market in which halloysite has not been previously used, or is to be used as an additive in substitution for another additive, to enhance certain functionality of an application. This type of market requires a number of steps before a sale can be consummated. Like any new material that will be incorporated into a commercial manufacturing process, a significant amount of testing must be performed before DRAGONITE can be incorporated into both a manufacturing process and a product. Sales, of this type require, working with the potential customers&#8217; existing formulations, which can vary from potential customer to potential customer. This could include identifying a solution, such as (i) surface coating or (ii) when to introduce DRAGONITE into the formulation or (iii) the conditions under which it should be introduced or (iv) changes, deletions, additions, or substitutions involving other elements of the customer&#8217;s formulation. Without customer collaboration, DRAGONITE could be unsuccessful in achieving the customer&#8217;s goals. This process can take an extended period of time (years in the case of discoloration of polymers as a result of the introduction of DRAGONITE) and, in some cases, there is no solution. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

During this process we frequently must work collaboratively with the potential customer to appropriately orient its manufacturing process to successfully incorporate our material. The length of the sales process is difficult to predict given the number of variables involved. In this type of market, price can be an important consideration and in some cases, we are not able to compete. 

&#160; 

The second type of market is one in which halloysite clay is currently being used in traditional application markets. Within these established markets, we believe our DRAGONITE products offer an enhanced value proposition with respect to purity and other properties sought by customers. The pricing of our products relative to those of our competitors, however, will always be a significant factor in determining our ability to penetrate these markets. 

&#160; 

AMIRON 

&#160; 

The Company encounters the same types of challenges marketing AMIRON, as it faces in marketing DRAGONITE. In particular, the company must compete on price and quality in relation to competitive materials. 

&#160; 

It cannot be assured that we will be successful in further penetrating these markets . 

&#160; 

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s research and development and testing efforts are focused on the continued creation of commercial applications for our halloysite-based products and our iron oxides. The Company conducts significant research and development efforts internally and occasionally through consultants. The Company also conducts product research and development collaboratively with customers and potential customers. 

&#160; 

In 2015 and 2014, the Company spent $181,821 and $403,212 for testing and research, respectively. 

&#160; 

TRADEMARKS and PATENTS 

&#160; 

We have trademarked the name DRAGONITE and AMIRON. We believe these trademarks are important to the successful marketing of our product offering. We filed a Provisional Application for Patent in October, 2010 related to the use of nucleating agents in polyethylene. As of December 31, 2015, we have been granted this patent in Great Britain, Denmark, France and China. A patent is pending approval in the United States, Canada and Thailand. 

&#160; 

REGULATION 

&#160; 

The Utah Department of Natural Resources sets the guidelines for exploration and other mineral related activities based on provisions of the Mined Land Reclamation Act, Title 40-8, Utah Code Annotated 1953, as amended, and the General Rules and Rules of Practice and Procedures, R647-1 through R647-5.We have received a large mine permit from the Department. The Company does not believe that such regulations, including environmental regulations, have or will adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business or have a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company. 

&#160; &#160; 

We carry a Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) license (#4202383) for the Dragon Mine and report as required to MSHA. The Company is subject to extensive regulation by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, which was created by the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The regulations generally are designed to assure the health and safety of miners and our mine is periodically inspected by MSHA. The Company does not believe that such regulations have or will adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business or have a material impact on capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The clays that the Company mines, including halloysite, may contain various levels of crystalline silica when mined. Crystalline silica is considered a hazardous substance under regulations promulgated by the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) and U.S. Mine Health and Safety Administration (MSHA) and as a result is subject to permissible exposure limits (PELs), both in the mine and at the workplaces of our customers. The Company is required to provide Safety Data Sheets (SDS) at the mine and accompanying sales of products to customers. The Company must also apply hazard warning to labels of containers of the product sold to customers. Kaolin and halloysite are also subject to PELs. 

&#160; 

On September 12, 2013, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) released a proposed standard on respirable crystalline silica. The proposed rule would lower to the PEL to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air (&#181;g/m3), which is 50% of the current PEL and consistent with the NIOSH PEL. The agency also proposed an action level of 25 &#181;g/m3. The Company cannot predict whether OSHA will adopt a rule and what, if any, adverse effect such rules may have on the Company&#8217;s business. 

&#160; 

The EPA has stated that it is developing a test rule under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to require manufacturers (which would include the Company) of certain nanoscale materials including kaolin, halloysite, and alumina (which is present in the clays mined by the company) to conduct testing for health effects, ecological effects, and environmental fate, as well as provide material characterization data. The impact of such a rule on the Company cannot be determined at this time. It seems clear, however, that if the results of the testing of particular nanomaterials indicate adverse health, ecological, or environmental effects, the EPA may seek to regulate those nanomaterials more extensively. Such regulation could include, among other things, limiting the uses of the nanoscale materials; requiring the use of personal protective equipment, such as impervious gloves and NIOSH approved respirators, and limiting environmental releases. The EPA is developing a SNUR for nanoscale materials under TSCA. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, Applied Minerals, Inc. and its subsidiary had 29 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, we have never experienced a work stoppage, and we consider our labor relations to be excellent. 

&#160; &#160;

OTHER PROPERTY 

&#160; 

On December 15, 2015, through an auction held in Coeur D&#8217;Alene, ID, the Company offered for sale four non-core real estate totaling approximately 1,017 acres located within the Silver Valley region of Idaho. Three of the four properties sold at the auction for a total of $172,948. Bids for the fourth property, approximately 705 acres located in Mullan, Idaho, did not meet the $1,500,000 reserve price. On March 23, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 705-acre Atlas Mine property for gross proceeds of $418,000. Net proceeds to the Company are expected to be $380,000, after adjusting for a 10% buyers premium paid to the auction firm, J.P. King. The Company, through its 53% ownership of Park Copper and Gold Mining Company Limited, a Idaho corporation and an administratively dissolved subsidiary of the Company, owns an interest in 100 acres of patented mining claims. The Company is pursuing the monetization of its indirect ownership of these mining claims.
