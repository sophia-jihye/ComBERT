 Item 1. Business. 

In this Annual Report on &#32; Form 10-K, &#8220;WESCO&#8221; refers to WESCO International, Inc., and its subsidiaries and its predecessors unless the context otherwise requires. References to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to WESCO and its subsidiaries. 

The Company 

WESCO International, Inc. (&#8220;WESCO International&#8221;), incorporated in 1993 and effectively formed in February 1994 upon acquiring a distribution business from Westinghouse Electric Corporation, is a leading North American based distributor of products and provider of advanced supply chain management and logistics services used primarily in industrial, construction, utility and commercial, institutional and government (&#8220;CIG&#8221;) markets. We are a leading provider of electrical, industrial, and communications maintenance, repair and operating (&#8220;MRO&#8221;) and original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEM&#8221;) products, construction materials, and advanced supply chain management and logistics services. Our primary product categories include general electrical and industrial supplies, wire, cable and conduit, data and broadband communications, power distribution equipment, lighting and lighting control systems, control and automation, motors, and safety. 

We serve over 80,000 &#32;active customers globally through approximately 500 &#32;full service branches primarily located in North America, with operations in 14 &#32;additional countries and nine distribution centers located in the United States and Canada. The Company employs approximately 9,300 &#32;employees worldwide. We distribute over 1,000,000 products, grouped into six categories, from more than 25,000 &#32;suppliers utilizing a highly automated, proprietary electronic procurement and inventory replenishment system. 

In addition, we offer a comprehensive portfolio of value-added capabilities, which includes supply chain management, logistics and transportation, procurement, warehousing and inventory management, as well as kitting, limited assembly of products and system installation. Our value-added capabilities, extensive geographic reach, experienced workforce and broad product and supply chain solutions have enabled us to grow our business and establish a leading position in North America. 

Industry Overview 

We operate in highly fragmented markets that include thousands of small regional and locally based, privately owned competitors. According to one industry publication, in 2014, the latest year for which market share data is available, the five largest North American electrical distributors, including WESCO, accounted for approximately 31% of an estimated $100 billion-plus in electrical sales in North America. Our global account, integrated supply and OEM programs provide customers with regional, national, North American and global supply chain consolidation opportunities. The demand for these programs has grown in recent years, driven primarily by the desire of companies to reduce operating expenses by outsourcing operational and administrative functions associated with the procurement, management and utilization of MRO supplies and OEM components. We believe that significant opportunities exist for further expansion of these programs. The total potential in the United States for purchases of MRO and OEM supplies and services across all industrial distribution market segments and channels is estimated to be greater than $500 billion per an industry study. 

According to a recent publication, despite weakness in commodity-driven end markets, electrical distribution industry sales grew approximately 4% this year following a similar rate last year. This expansion has been driven by the increased use of electrical products in businesses and industries, new products and technologies, the proliferation of enhanced building and safety codes, and use of the Internet. Wholesale distributors have also grown as a result of a long-term shift in procurement preferences that favor the use of distributors over direct relationships with manufacturers. It is estimated that approximately 75% of electrical products sold in the United States are delivered to the end user through the distribution channel. 

Markets and Customers 

We have a large base of over 80,000 &#32;active customers across a diverse set of end markets. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 11% of our sales in 2015 . No one customer accounted for more than 2% of our sales in 2015 . 

The following table outlines our sales breakdown by end market:

Industrial. &#32;Sales to industrial customers of MRO, OEM, and construction products and services accounted for approximately 39% &#32;of our sales in 2015 , compared to 42% &#32;in 2014 . Industrial sales product categories include a broad range of electrical equipment and supplies as well as lubricants, pipe, valves, fittings, fasteners, cutting tools, power transmission, and safety products. In addition, OEM customers require a reliable supply of assemblies and components to incorporate into their own products as well as value-added services such as supplier consolidation, design and technical support, just-in-time supply and electronic commerce, and supply chain management. 

Construction. &#32;Sales of electrical and communications products to contractors accounted for approximately 32% &#32;of our sales in 2015 , compared to 31% &#32;in 2014 . Customers include a wide array of contractors and engineering, procurement and construction firms for industrial, infrastructure, commercial and data and broadband communications projects. Specific applications include projects for refineries, railways, hospitals, wastewater treatment facilities, data centers, security installations, offices, and modular and mobile homes. In addition to a wide array of electrical products, we offer contractors communications products for projects related to IT/network modernization, physical security upgrades, broadband deployments, network security, and disaster recovery. 

Utility. &#32;Sales to utilities and utility contractors accounted for approximately 15% &#32;of our sales in 2015 , compared to 14% &#32;in 2014 . Customers include large investor-owned utilities, rural electric cooperatives, municipal power authorities and contractors that serve these customers. We provide our utility customers with products and services to support the construction and maintenance of their generation, transmission and distribution systems along with an extensive range of products that meet their power plant MRO and capital projects needs. Materials management and procurement outsourcing arrangements are also important in this market, as cost pressures and deregulation have caused utility customers to seek improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of their supply chains. 

Commercial, Institutional and Governmental. &#32;Sales to CIG customers accounted for approximately 14% &#32;of our sales in 2015 , compared to 13% &#32;in 2014 . Customers include schools, hospitals, property management firms, retailers and federal, state and local government agencies of all types, including federal contractors. 

Business Strategy 

Our goal is to grow organically at a rate greater than that of our industry while making accretive acquisitions. Our organic growth strategy focuses on enhancing our sales and customer service capabilities to acquire new customers and develop new end markets, broaden our product and service offerings and expand our geographic footprint. We utilize LEAN continuous improvement initiatives on a company-wide basis to deliver operational excellence and improve productivity. We also extend our LEAN initiatives to customers to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and supply chains. In addition, we seek to generate a distinct competitive advantage through talent management and employee development processes and programs. 

We have identified certain growth engines that we believe provide substantial opportunities for above-market growth, and have developed strategies to address each of these areas of opportunity. These growth engines are a combination of business models, selected end markets and product categories, as discussed below. 

Grow Our Global Account Customer Relationships and Base. &#32;Our typical global account customer is a large, multi-location industrial or commercial company, a large utility, a major contractor, or a governmental or institutional customer. Our global account program is designed to provide customers with supply chain management services and cost reductions by coordinating and standardizing activity for MRO materials and OEM direct materials across their multiple locations, utilizing our broad geographic footprint and our largely integrated information technology platform. Comprehensive account plans are developed and managed at the local, national and international levels to prioritize activities, identify key performance 

measures, and track progress against objectives. We involve our preferred suppliers early in the implementation process to contribute expertise and product knowledge to accelerate program implementation and delivery of cost savings and process improvements. 

We plan to continue to expand our product and service offerings to existing global account customers, and increase our reach to serve additional customer locations. We plan on expanding our customer base by capitalizing on our industry expertise and supply chain optimization capabilities. 

Extend Our Position in Integrated Supply Programs. &#32;Our integrated supply programs focus on optimizing the supply chain and replacing the traditional multi-vendor, resource-intensive procurement process with a single, outsourced, automated process. Each integrated supply program employs our product and distribution expertise to reduce the number of suppliers, total procurement costs, and administrative expenses, while meeting the customers&#8217; service needs and improving their operating controls. We believe that large customers will seek to utilize such services to consolidate and simplify their MRO and OEM supply chains. 

We are expanding our position in North America as an integrated supply service provider by building upon established relationships within our large customer base and premier supplier network, and extending our services to additional customers and locations around the world. Our services are offered across all four of our end markets (industrial, construction, utility and CIG). 

Expand Our Relationships with Construction Contractors. &#32;We support new construction, renovation and retrofit projects across a wide variety of vertical markets, including manufacturing, healthcare, education, enterprise data communications, telecommunications, energy and government infrastructure. We believe that significant cross selling opportunities exist for our electrical and communications products and expertise, and we plan to use our global account and integrated supply programs, LEAN initiatives and project management expertise to capitalize on new non-residential construction opportunities. 

Expand Products and Services for Utilities. &#32;Our investor-owned, public power and utility contractor customers continue to focus on improving grid reliability and operating efficiency, while reducing costs. As a result, we anticipate an increase in distribution grid improvement and transmission expansion projects as well as the adoption of integrated supply programs. Accordingly, we are focused on expanding our logistical and project services and supply chain management programs to increase our scope of supply on distribution grid, generation and other energy projects, including alternative energy projects. 

Investing in Industrial MRO and Safety. &#32;Our sales of industrial maintenance, repair, and operating supply (MRO) materials include a broad range of electrical and non-electrical products used in the ongoing maintenance and repair of equipment used in production processes. These products are also used for facility upkeep in manufacturing, commercial, institutional, and other operations. In addition, through two acquisitions, we have expanded our safety products, personal protection safety equipment, first aid supplies, and OSHA compliance categories to complement the industrial MRO product lines. 

Expand International Operations. &#32;We seek to capitalize on existing and emerging international market opportunities through the expansion of our global product and service platforms. We follow large existing global customers into international markets, extending our procurement outsourcing, integrated supply programs and supplier relationships. Once established, we also seek to develop new business opportunities in these markets. We believe this strategy of working with well-developed customer and supplier relationships significantly reduces risk and provides the opportunity to establish profitable business. Our priorities are focused on global vertical markets including energy, mining and metals, manufacturing, and infrastructure, as well as key product categories such as communications and security. 

Grow Our Communications Products Position. &#32;Over the last several years, there has been a convergence of electrical and data communications contractors. Our ability to provide both electrical and communications products and services lines as well as automation, electromechanical, non-electrical MRO, physical security and utility products has presented cross selling opportunities across WESCO. Communications products are in continual demand due to network upgrades, low voltage security investments, data center upgrades and increasing broadband and telecommunications usage. 

Grow Lighting System and Sustainability Sales. &#32;Lighting applications are undergoing significant innovation, driven by energy efficiency and sustainability trends. We have expanded our sales team and marketing initiatives and increased our presence and customer base with the acquisition of Needham Electric Supply. We expect to continue to add product and service offerings to provide lighting and energy-saving solutions. 

Pursue Strategic Acquisitions . In 2015, we acquired two businesses: Hill Country Electric Supply and Needham Electric Supply. Since 2010, we have made thirteen acquisitions that have helped us to extend our product and services portfolio into adjacencies such as safety equipment and lighting. Over the years, these acquisitions have also increased our customer base and have been an important source of talent. 

We believe that the highly fragmented nature of the electrical and industrial distribution industry will continue to provide acquisition opportunities. 

Drive Operational Excellence . LEAN continuous improvement is a set of company-wide strategic initiatives to increase efficiency and effectiveness across the entire business enterprise, including sales, operations and administrative processes. The basic principles behind LEAN are to systematically identify and implement improvements through simplification, elimination of waste and reduction in errors. We apply LEAN in our distribution environment, and develop and deploy numerous initiatives through the Kaizen approach targeting improvements in sales, margin, warehouse operations, transportation, purchasing, working capital management and administrative processes. Our objective is to continue to implement LEAN initiatives across our business enterprise and to extend LEAN services to our customers and suppliers. 

Talent Management. &#32;We seek to develop a distinct competitive advantage through talent management and employee engagement and development. We believe our ability to attract, develop and retain diverse human capital is imperative to ongoing business success. We improve workforce capability through various programs and processes that identify, recruit, develop and promote our talent base. Significant enhancements in these programs have been made over the last several years, and we expect to continue to refine and enhance these programs in the future.

We purchase products from a diverse group of more than 25,000 &#32;suppliers. In 2015 , our ten largest suppliers accounted for approximately 32% &#32;of our purchases. Our largest supplier in 2015 &#32;was Eaton Corporation, accounting for approximately 11% &#32;of our purchases. No other supplier accounted for more than 5% of our total purchases. 

Our supplier relationships are important to us, providing access to a wide range of products, technical training, and sales and marketing support. We have approximately 300 preferred supplier arrangements with more than 200 firms and purchase nearly 60% of our products pursuant to these arrangements. Consistent with industry practice, most of our agreements with suppliers, including both distribution agreements and preferred supplier agreements, are terminable by either party on 60 days notice or less. 

Services 

As part of our overall offering, we provide customers a comprehensive portfolio of value added services which includes more than 50 value add solutions in 10 categories including construction, e-commerce, energy and sustainability, engineering services, production support, safety and security, supply chain optimization, training, and working capital. These solutions are designed to address our customers' business needs through: 

&#8226; 

Technical support for operational and transactional process improvements; 

&#8226; 

Inventory optimization programs, including just-in-time delivery and vendor managed inventory; 

&#8226; 

Collaborative, cross-functional, cost savings teams; 

&#8226; 

Dedicated on-site support personnel; 

&#8226; 

Consultation on energy-efficient product upgrades; and 

&#8226; 

Safety and product training for customer employees. 

Competitive Strengths 

We compete directly with global, national, regional and local distributors of electrical and other industrial supplies, along with buying groups formed by smaller distributors. Competition is primarily focused on the local service area, and is generally based on product line breadth, product availability, service capabilities and price. Although certain Internet-based procurement service companies, auction businesses and trade exchanges remain in the marketplace, the impact on our business from these competitors has not been significant. We believe that our market leadership, broad product offering and value-added services, extensive distribution network and low-cost operator status provide distinct competitive advantages. 

Market Leadership. &#32;Our ability to manage complex global supply chains, multi-site facility maintenance programs and construction projects, requiring special sourcing, technical advice, logistical support and locally based service, has enabled us to establish a strong presence in the competitively-fragmented North American electrical distribution market. 

Broad Product Offering and Value-added Services. &#32;We provide a wide range of products, services and procurement solutions, which draw on our product knowledge, supply and logistics expertise, system capabilities and supplier relationships to enable our customers to maximize productivity, minimize waste, improve efficiencies, reduce costs and enhance safety. Our broad product offering and stable source of supply enables us to consistently meet customers&#8217; wide-ranging capital project, product, MRO and OEM requirements. 

Extensive Distribution Network. &#32;We operate approximately 500 &#32;geographically dispersed branch locations and nine distribution centers ( five &#32;in the United States and four &#32;in Canada). Our distribution centers add value for our customers, suppliers, and branches through the combination of a broad and deep selection of inventory, online ordering and next-day shipment capabilities, and central order handling and fulfillment. Our distribution center network reduces the lead time and cost of supply chain activities through its automated replenishment and warehouse management system, and provides economies of scale in purchasing, inventory management, administration and transportation. This extensive network, which would be difficult and expensive to replicate, allows us to: 

&#8226; 

Enhance localized customer service, technical support and sales coverage; 

&#8226; 

Tailor individual branch products and services to local customer needs; and 

&#8226; 

Offer multi-site distribution capabilities to large customers and global accounts. 

Low-Cost Operator. &#32;Our competitiveness has been enhanced by our consistent favorable operating cost position, which is based on the use of LEAN, strategically-located distribution centers, and purchasing economies of scale. As a result of these and other factors, our operating cost as a percentage of sales is one of the lowest in our industry. Our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for 2015 &#32;were 14.0% . 

Geography 

Our network of branches and distribution centers are located primarily in North America. We attribute revenues from external customers to individual countries on the basis of the point of sale. The following table sets forth information about us by geographic area:

We have branches in Singapore and Thailand to support our sales to Asia and a branch near Shanghai to serve customers in China along with operations in eight additional countries. Many of our international locations have been established to serve our growing list of customers with global operations. 

Intellectual Property 

We currently have trademarks, patents and service marks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and Canadian Intellectual Property Office. The trademarks and service marks registered in the U.S. include: &#8220;WESCO &#174; &#8221;, our corporate logo and the running man logo. The Company's "EECOL" trademark is registered in Canada. In addition, trademarks, patents, and service mark applications have been filed in various foreign jurisdictions, including Canada, Mexico, Chile, the United Kingdom, Singapore, China, Hong Kong, Thailand and the European Community. 

Environmental Matters 

Our facilities and operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. Some of these laws and regulations may impose strict, joint and several liabilities on certain persons for the cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated properties. These persons may include former, current or future owners or operators of properties and persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Our owned and leased real property may give rise to such investigation, remediation and monitoring liabilities under environmental laws. In addition, anyone disposing of certain products we distribute, such as ballasts, fluorescent lighting and batteries, must comply with environmental laws that regulate certain materials in these products. 

We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws. As a result, we do not anticipate making significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current year or in the near future. 

Seasonality 

Our operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal factors. Sales during the first quarter are affected by a reduced level of activity. Sales during the second, third and fourth quarters are generally 5 - 7% higher than the first quarter. Sales typically increase beginning in March, with slight fluctuations per month through October. During periods of economic expansion or contraction our sales by quarter have varied significantly from this seasonal pattern.
