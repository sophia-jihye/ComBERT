 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

Sitestar Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, &#8220;Sitestar&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, and &#8220;our&#8221;, unless the context indicates otherwise) is a Nevada corporation, incorporated December 17, 1992, having its headquarters in Lynchburg, Virginia and carrying out its business strategy in two segments: Internet Operations and Real Estate Operations. Prior to 2010, the Company primarily focused on providing services through its internet segment. This focus involved the purchase of customers from other Internet Service Providers located throughout parts of the United States and Canada. The services offered to these acquired customers were primarily dial-up and DSL internet access, Web hosting, and other ancillary services. From 2002 to 2010 the Company acquired various internet access-related companies and customers. Ultimately, this acquisition strategy proved not to be viable.

&#160;

In 2008 the Company&#8217;s management implemented a program to purchase real estate with the Company&#8217;s surplus cash flows. The first acquisition occurred in 2010. The strategy involved purchasing residential properties, often from foreclosure, at prices that prior management deemed to be attractive. Efforts were then made to repair and upgrade the properties to make them ready for rental or sale. Despite the fact that the internet segment generated the vast majority of revenue during this time period, prior management&#8217;s primary focus from 2010 until the dismissal of the prior CEO on December 14, 2015 was on the real estate segment.

&#160;

When new management was appointed on December 14, 2015, we determined that it was unlikely that an acceptable return could be made by continuing to pursue the real estate acquisition strategy. Accordingly, we intend to pursue efforts in this segment to an orderly liquidation of our real estate assets. It is likely that this liquidation will take several years to fully complete.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Board of Directors and management are focused on maximizing the free cash flow generated by the internet segment and maximizing the net sale price of the real estate properties currently owned. Going forward, we are likely to reinvest the proceeds from these two segments into alternatives unrelated to the historical activities of the company. Subsequent to the 2015 year end, we have made investments in both marketable securities and, as previously reported in our Current Report of Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 14, 2016, in an acquisition vehicle focused on the HVAC industry.

&#160;

Background on the New Board of Directors and Management 

&#160;

In December 2014, Jeffrey Moore, Steven Kiel, and Jeremy Gold (collectively The Moore Shareholder Group) filed a preliminary proxy statement in order to force the Company to hold a special shareholder meeting to elect Directors. There had been no record of prior management holding a shareholder meeting since the Company had been public. Prior management reacted to the filing of the proxy statement by filing suit against The Moore Shareholder Group. In February 2015 the Company agreed to drop its lawsuit, increase the number of Directors to six, appoint Mr. Kiel and Mr. Gold as Directors, and appoint Roger Malouf as a management chosen Director. Mr. Moore had previously been appointed as a director in 2013. The Company and The Moore Shareholder Group also agreed to a &#8220;standstill agreement&#8221; for a one-year period to end in February 2016.

&#160;

As previously reported in our Current Report of Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 15, 2015 and December 29, 2015, the Company&#8217;s former CEO, Frank Erhartic, was terminated by the Board of Directors on December 14, 2015 after the Company&#8217;s former auditor notified the Directors about several related party transactions that the former auditor deemed to be problematic. Mr. Ehartic resigned as a Director at the request of the Board. Mr. Erhartic was replaced as CEO by Mr. Kiel, first on an interim basis on December 14, 2015, and then on a permanent basis effective March 1, 2016. Mr. Kiel manages an investment partnership that has held an investment in the Company since 2012. Mr. Kiel has been a Director since 2015. Mr. Kiel is also a Judge Advocate in the Army Reserves. He is a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom and currently holds the rank of Major.

&#160;

Steps Taken by New Board of Directors and Management Since the Termination of the Former CEO 

&#160;

Immediately after being appointed, new management engaged outside legal counsel to lead an investigation into the allegations by the Company&#8217;s former auditor. Legal counsel engaged an accounting firm to carry out an analysis of a range of transactions over the previous five years. A final report was delivered to management in February 2016. This report served as the basis for a lawsuit filed by the Company against Mr. Erhartic in April 2016. This lawsuit is described more fully in Item 3.

&#160;

At the Board of Directors meeting on December 14, 2015 the Company&#8217;s former CFO, Dan Judd, was placed on probation in light of the circumstances that had led to the termination of the former CEO. New management engaged an outside financial consultant to review the Company&#8217;s accounting practices and to assist Mr. Judd in carrying out his duties. As previously reported in our Current Report of Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 7, 2016, Mr. Judd subsequently was terminated on March 3, 2016. The Board has requested that he resign as a Director, but Mr. Judd has not responded favorably to that request and has not participated in Board meetings since his dismissal as CFO.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Also at the Board of Directors meeting on December 14, 2015, the Company formed an Audit Committee. Jeff Moore and Jeremy Gold were appointed to serve on the Audit Committee. Mr. Gold was elected to be the Chairman of the Audit Committee at the December 14, 2015 meeting. A charter was adopted on January 5, 2016.

&#160;

As previously reported in our Current Report of Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2016, effective February 2, 2016 Mr. Malouf resigned as a Director and was replaced by Chris Payne. Mr. Payne is considered an Audit Committee Financial Expert and was appointed to serve on the Audit Committee.

&#160;

As previously reported in our Current Report of Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 18, 2016, on February 11, 2016, the Company&#8217;s former auditor resigned. This resignation followed communications between the former auditor and the Company in which the Company informed the former auditor, among other things, that (i) the former auditor had not been selected as the Company&#8217;s independent auditor for 2016; and (ii) following receipt of the former auditor&#8217;s letter of December 21, 2015 stating that the Company should take action to prevent reliance on the previously issued financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 as contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company had retained an external accountant to conduct an investigation based on certain agreed upon procedures.

&#160;

On February 17, 2016, Mr. Moore was selected to serve as the Chairman of the Board.

&#160;

As previously reported in our Current Report of Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 7, 2016, on March 3, 2016, Cherry Bekaert LLP was selected as the Company&#8217;s new independent auditor for the year ended December 31, 2015. It was determined that Cherry Bekaert LLP should carry out an audit for 2014 in addition to 2015.

&#160;

On April 21, 2016, Mr. Kiel and representatives from Cherry Bekaert LLP and the Company&#8217;s outside legal counsel met with the Enforcement Division of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) at the SEC&#8217;s request. We detailed the steps taken to confront the accounting, internal control, and other issues created by the Company&#8217;s former management. We have proactively complied with all requests by the SEC. We are committed to fully cooperating with the SEC on all matters, and will assist them if they decide to pursue a formal investigation or enforcement action against the Company or any currently or previously associated person.

&#160;

New management has aggressively moved to implement policies that will prevent risks associated with related party transactions. We immediately abandoned a storage facility owned by the former CEO. Within a month of the management change, we moved out of the former headquarters office claimed to be owned by the former CEO. We have engaged several outside service providers to supplement the staff members already in place. The new management and Board of Directors are focused on aggressively defending the interests of the Company and its shareholders.

Products and Services 

&#160; 

Internet Operations 

&#160;

Sitestar is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that offers consumer and business-grade internet access, wholesale managed modem services for downstream ISPs, Web hosting, and various ancillary services. We provide services to customers in the United States and Canada.

&#160;

This segment markets and sells narrow-band (dial-up and ISDN) and broadband services (DSL, fiber-optic and wireless). Additionally, we market and sell web hosting and related services to consumers and businesses. We also offer broadband services within our regional and national footprint.

&#160;

In addition to our operations, we also own the domain, First.com. We are currently marketing First.com for sale.

&#160;

Our primary competitors include regional and national cable and telecommunications companies that have substantially greater market presence, brand-name recognition, and financial resources compared to Sitestar. Secondary competitors include local and regional ISPs.

&#160;

The residential broadband internet access market is dominated by cable and telecommunications companies. These companies offer internet connectivity through the use of cable modems, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) programs, and fiber. These competitors have extensive scale and significantly more resources than Sitestar. Competitors are often offered incentives for customers to purchase internet access by offering discounts for bundled service offerings (i.e., phone, television, Internet). While we are a reseller of broadband services including DSL and fiber services, our profit margin is heavily influenced by these competitive forces.

&#160;

There are currently laws and regulations directly applicable to access or commerce on the internet, covering issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, characteristics and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights, information security and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with Internet communications. We may be positively or negatively affected by the repeal, modification, or adoption of various laws and regulations. These changes may occur at the international, federal, state, and local levels, and may cover a wide range of issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, characteristics and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights, and information security.

&#160;

Real Estate Operations 

&#160;

Sitestar owns a real estate investment portfolio that includes residential properties, vacant land, and one commercial property. Our real estate portfolio is primarily focused in the Roanoke and Lynchburg areas of Virginia.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the approval of the Board of Directors subsequent to December 31, 2015, we are pursuing an orderly liquidation of our real estate portfolio. We do not have an estimate for how long it will take to complete this liquidation, if ever.

&#160;

Beginning immediately after the change in management in 2015, we engaged several real estate agents to assess the marketability of the properties we were not holding as rentals. We have examined each property on an individual basis to determine a strategy to maximize the net sale price. Where appropriate, we have and will reinvest resources into a property to increase its marketability and sale price. We have listed and, subsequent to December 31, 2015, sold, properties both directly and through real estate agents. In 2016, we engaged a property manager to manage the rental properties that we own in Roanoke, Virginia.

&#160;

State and municipal laws and regulations govern the real estate industry and do not vary significantly from one community to another. State laws, including the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, in addition to local ordinances govern rental properties and also do not vary significantly throughout our real estate holding areas.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of July 18, 2016, we employed four full-time individuals and one part-time individual. We also utilize outside contractors as necessary to assist with bookkeeping, financial reporting, technical support, and customer service. Our employees are not unionized and we consider relations with employees to be favorable.

&#160;
