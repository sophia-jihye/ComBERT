 Items 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

Overview and Corporate Structure

Silver Bull Resources, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 8, 1993 as the Cadgie Company for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties. The Cadgie Company was a spin-off from its predecessor, Precious Metal Mines, Inc. On June 28, 1996, our name was changed to Metalline Mining Company ("Metalline"). On April 21, 2011, we changed our name to Silver Bull Resources, Inc. We have not realized any revenues from our planned operations and we are considered an exploration stage company. We have not established any reserves with respect to our exploration projects and may never enter into the development stage with respect to any of our projects.

We engage in the business of mineral exploration. We currently own or have the option to acquire a number of property concessions in Mexico within a mining district known as the Sierra Mojada District, located in the west-central part of the state of Coahuila, Mexico. We conduct our operations in Mexico through our wholly-owned subsidiary corporations, Minera Metalin S.A. de C.V. ("Minera Metalin") and Contratistas de Sierra Mojada S.A. de C.V. ("Contratistas"), and through Minera Metalin's wholly-owned subsidiary Minas de Coahuila SBR S.A. de C.V ("Minas").

In April 2010, Metalline Mining Delaware, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, was merged with and into Dome Ventures Corporation ("Dome"). As a result, Dome became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Silver Bull. Dome has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Dome Asia Inc. ("Dome Asia"), which is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Dome Asia has a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Gabon, African Resources SARL Gabon, as well as a 99.99%-owned subsidiary, Dome Minerals Nigeria Limited, incorporated in Nigeria. In January 2015 we completed the sale of our subsidiary Dome International Global Inc. ("Dome International"), including Dome International's wholly-owned subsidiary Dome Ventures SARL Gabon ("Dome Gabon"), which held the Ndjole Prospect in Gabon.

On June 5, 2015, we announced our decision to voluntarily delist our shares of common stock from the NYSE MKT due to costs associated with the continued listing and NYSE MKT exchange rules regarding maintenance of a minimum share price. On June 29, 2015, our shares began trading on the OTCQB marketplace operated by OTC Markets Group (the "OTCQB Designation"). Our shares of common stock continue to trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX").

Our efforts and expenditures have been concentrated in the exploration of properties, principally in the Sierra Mojada property located in Coahuila, Mexico (the "Sierra Mojada Property"). We have not determined whether the exploration properties contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investment in exploration properties is dependent upon the success of future property sales, the existence of economically recoverable reserves, our ability to obtain financing or make other arrangements for exploration, development and future profitable production activities. The ultimate realization of our investment in exploration properties cannot be determined at this time.

Sierra Mojada Project

Location, Access and Infrastructure

The Sierra Mojada project (the "Sierra Mojada Project") is located within a mining district known as the Sierra Mojada District. The Sierra Mojada District is located in the west central part of the state of Coahuila, Mexico, near the Coahuila-Chihuahua state border approximately 200 kilometers south of the Big Bend of the Rio Grande River. The principal mining area extends for approximately five kilometers in an east-west direction along the base of the precipitous, 1,000 meter high, Sierra Mojada Range.

The Sierra Mojada Project site is situated to the south of the village of Esmeralda, on the northern side of a major escarpment that forms the northern margin of the Sierra Mojada range. In general, the site is approximately 1,500 meters above sea level. The project is accessible by paved road from the city of Torreon, Coahuila, which lies approximately 250 kilometers to the south. Esmerelda is served by a rail spur of the Coahuila Durango railroad. There is an airstrip east of Esmeralda, although its availability is limited, and another airstrip at the nearby Penoles plant, which we can use occasionally. The Sierra Mojada District has high voltage electric power supplied by the national power company, Comision Federal de Electricidad, C.F.E., and is supplied water by the municipality of Sierra Mojada. Although power levels are sufficient for current operations and exploration, future development of the project, if any, may require additional power supplies to be sourced.

&#160;

Our facilities in Mexico include offices, residences, shops, warehouse buildings and exploration equipment located at Calle Mina #1, La Esmeralda, Coahuila, Mexico.

Property History

Silver and lead were first discovered by a foraging party in 1879, and mining to 1886 consisted of native silver, silver chloride, and lead carbonate ores. After 1886, silver-lead-zinc-copper sulphate ores within limestone and sandstone units were produced. No accurate production history has been found for historical mining during this period.

Approximately 90 years ago, zinc silicate and zinc carbonate minerals ("Zinc Manto Zone") were discovered underlying the silver-lead mineralized horizon. The Zinc Manto Zone is predominantly zinc dominated, but with subordinate lead&#8211;rich manto and is principally situated in the footwall rocks of the Sierra Mojada Fault System. Since discovery and up to 1990, zinc, silver, and lead ores were mined from various mines along the strike of the deposit including from the Sierra Mojada Property. Ores mined from within these areas were hand-sorted, and the concentrate shipped mostly to smelters in the United States.

Activity during the period of 1956 to 1990 consisted of operations by the Mineros Norte&#241;os Cooperativa and operations by individual owners and operators of pre-existing mines. The Mineros Norte&#241;os operated the San Salvador, Encantada, Fronteriza, Esmeralda, and Parrena mines, and shipped oxide zinc ore to Zinc National's smelter in Monterrey, while copper and silver ore were shipped to smelters in Mexico and the United States.

We estimate that over 45 mines have produced ore from underground workings throughout the approximately five kilometers by two kilometer area that comprises the Sierra Mojada District. We estimate that since its discovery in 1879, the Sierra Mojada District has produced approximately 10 million tons of silver, zinc, lead and copper ore. The District does not have a mill to concentrate ore and all mining conducted thus far has been limited to selectively mined ore of sufficient grade to direct ship to smelters. We believe that mill-grade mineralization that was not mined remains available for extraction. No mining operations are currently active within the area of the Sierra Mojada District, except for a dolomite quarry by Pe&#241;oles near Esmeralda.

In the 1990s, Kennecott Copper Corporation ("Kennecott") had a joint venture agreement involving USMX, Inc.'s Sierra Mojada concessions. Kennecott terminated the joint venture in approximately 1995. We entered into a Joint Exploration and Development Agreement with USMX, Inc. in July 1996 involving USMX, Inc.'s Sierra Mojada concessions. In 1998, we purchased the Sierra Mojada and the USMX, Inc. concessions and the joint exploration and development agreement was terminated. We also purchased certain other concessions during this time and conducted exploration for copper and silver mineralization from 1997 through 1999.

&#160;

&#160;

Title and Ownership Rights

The Sierra Mojada Project is comprised of 31 concessions consisting of 20,946 hectares (about 51,758 acres). We periodically obtain additional concessions in the Sierra Mojada Project area and whether we will continue to hold these additional concessions will depend on future exploration work and exploration results and our ability to obtain financing. As we have done in prior years, we continually assess our concession ownership and we may terminate our rights to certain concessions holdings not in the core area of the Sierra Mojada Project.

Two of the concessions in the Sierra Mojada Project are subject to options to purchase from existing third party concession owners. We have previously renegotiated the terms of the concession option purchase agreement described below and expect to approach the third party concession owner to attempt to renegotiate the terms during 2016. Pursuant to the option purchase agreement, we are required to make certain payments over the terms of this contract to obtain full ownership of these concessions as set forth in the table below:

Nuevo Dulces Nombres (Centenario) and Yolanda III (Two concessions)

&#160; &#160; Payment Date

Payment Amount (1) 

Monthly payment beginning August 2016 and ending July 2018

$20,000 per month

(1) &#160; Until July 2018, we have the option of acquiring Nuevo Dulces Nombres (100% interest) for $4 million and Yolanda III (100% interest) for $2 million plus a lump sum payment equal to any remaining monthly payments. If a change of control of Silver Bull occurs prior to May 30, 2016, we are required to make a payment of $200,000 within 20 days of the change of control. 

Each mining concession enables us to explore the underlying concession in consideration for the payment of a semi-annual fee to the Mexican government and completion of certain annual assessment work. Annual assessment work in excess of statutory annual requirements can be carried forward and applied to future periods. 

&#160; &#160; 

Ownership of a concession provides the owner with exclusive exploration and exploitation rights to all minerals located on the concessions, but does not include the surface rights to the real property. Therefore, we will need to negotiate any necessary agreements with the appropriate surface landowners if we determine that a mining operation is feasible for the concessions. We own surface rights to five lots in the Sierra Mojada Property (Sierra Mojada lot #1, #3, #4, #6 and #7) but anticipate that we will be required to obtain additional surface rights if we determine that a mining operation is feasible.

Geology and Mineralization

The Sierra Mojada concessions contain a mineral system which can be separated into two distinct zones: The "Silver Zone" and the "Zinc Zone." These two zones lie along the Sierra Mojada Fault which trends east-west along the base of the Sierra Mojada range. The majority of the mineralization identified to date is seen as oxide, which has been derived from primary "sulphide" bodies that have been oxidized and remained in situ or remobilized into porous and fractured rock along the Sierra Mojada Fault. The formation of a silver rich zone (the Silver Zone) and a zinc rich zone (the Zinc Zone) is a reflection of the mobility's of the metals in the ground water conditions at Sierra Mojada.

The geology of the District is composed of a Cretaceous limestone and dolomite sequence sitting on top of the Jurassic "San Marcos" red sediments. This sedimentary sequence has then later been intruded by Tertiary volcanics, which are considered to be responsible for the mineralization seen at Sierra Mojada. Historical mines are dry and the rocks are competent for the most part. We believe that the thickness and attitude of the mineralized material could potentially be amenable to high volume mechanized mining methods and low cost production.

&#160;

June 2015 Technical Report

On June 30, 2015, Tuun Consulting Inc. and AKF Mining Services Inc. delivered an amended technical report (the "Report") on the silver and zinc mineralization at the Sierra Mojada Project in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101"). The Report includes an update on the silver and zinc mineralization which was estimated from 1,363 diamond drill holes, 24 reverse circulation drill holes, 9,027 channel samples and 2,346 underground long holes. Using a net smelter return economic cut-off, the Report indicates mineralized material in the Lerchs-Grossman optimized pit of 56.8 million tonnes at an average silver grade of 50 grams/tonne silver, an average zinc percentage of 3.4%, an average copper percentage of 0.04% and an average lead percentage of 0.3%. In addition using the net smelter return economic cut-off, the Report indicates underground mineralized material outside the Lerchs-Grossman optimized pit of 1.9 million tonnes at an average zinc percentage of 9.4%, an average copper percentage of 0.02% and an average lead percentage of 0.4%. Mineralized material estimates do not include any amounts categorized as inferred resources.

"Mineralized material" as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, although permissible under the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC's") Industry Guide 7, does not indicate "reserves" by SEC standards. We cannot be certain that any part of the Sierra Mojada Project will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant "reserves." Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can be economically or legally extracted.

Sampling, Analysis, Quality Control and Security

Our activities conform to mining industry standard practices and follow the Best Practices Guidelines of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM). Sampling is directed and supervised by trained and experienced geologists. Drill core and other samples are processed and logged using industry standard methods. Standard samples, duplicates and blanks are periodically entered into the stream of samples submitted for assays, and campaigns of re-sampling and duplicate analyses and round-robin inter-laboratory validations are conducted periodically. We use ALS Chemex - Vancouver ("ALS Chemex") laboratory as our independent primary laboratory. ALS Chemex is ISO 9001:2000 certified. All analytical results that are used in resource models are exclusively from the independent primary laboratory.

&#160;

Our consultants perform technical audits of our operations, including our formal quality assurance/quality control ("QA/QC") program, and recommend improvements as needed. A systematic program of duplicate sampling and assaying of representative samples from previous exploration activities was completed in 2010 under the direction and control of our consultants. Results of this study acceptably confirm the values in the project database used for resource modeling.

&#160;

We formerly operated a sample preparation and an analytical laboratory at the project that prepared samples for shipment, performed QA/QC analyses to ensure against cross contamination of samples during preparation and removed most low-value samples from the flow to the primary laboratory. For both cost and perception reasons, the internal laboratory has been shut down, and all drill samples are submitted directly to ALS Chemex for sample preparation and analyses.

Prior Exploration Activities

We have focused our exploration efforts on two primary locations: the Silver Zone and the Zinc Zone. As further described below, we have conducted various exploration activities at the Sierra Mojada Project, however, to date, we have not established any reserves, and the project remains in the exploration stage and may never enter the development stage.

&#160;

Prior to 2008, exploration efforts largely focused on the Zinc Zone with surface and underground drilling. In fiscal year 2009, we scaled back our exploration activities and administrative costs to conserve capital while we tried to secure additional sources of capital. 

&#160;

After closing the transaction with Dome in April 2010, we focused our exploration activities at Sierra Mojada primarily on the Silver Zone which lies largely at surface. By the end of calendar 2014, approximately 100,000 meters of diamond drilling from surface and 10,000 meters of underground drilling had been completed.

&#160;

The silver contained within the Silver Zone is seen primarily as silver halide minerals. The zinc contained within the Zinc Zone is contained mostly in the mineral hemimorphite and, to a lesser amount, in the mineral smithsonite.

&#160;

&#160;

2015 Exploration Activities

Our focus for the 2015 calendar year was the Report described previously, continuing to progress in securing additional surface rights, maintaining our property concessions, internally modeling the potential for a standalone zinc project and internally studying a small silver open pit.

During 2015, we progressed in internally investigating the potential for a high grade underground zinc oxide mine. We also progressed on an internal examination on the potential for a small silver open pit targeting the "at-surface" silver mineralization with a small project with a low strip ratio. We also continued to progress our metallurgical program, as described below.

2016 Exploration Program

As discussed in the "Material Changes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources" section below we have approved a calendar year 2016 budget of $0.4 million for the Sierra Mojada Property. The focus of the 2016 calendar year program is continuing to progress in securing additional surface rights, maintaining of our property concessions and continuing to internally investigate the potential for a high grade underground zinc oxide mine and a small silver open-pit.

During 2016 we intend to continue to internally investigate the potential for a high grade underground zinc oxide mine. In addition, we also intend to continue an internal examination on the potential for a small silver open pit targeting the "at-surface" silver mineralization with a small project with a low strip ratio.

Metallurgical Studies

During May 2015 we selected and shipped samples of high grade zinc material to a lab in Denver, Colorado for "fine bubble" flotation test work and a group in Australia to assess their proprietary hydrometallurgy process. Previous test work completed by Silver Bull using mechanical floatation has shown an 87% recovery of zinc from the white zinc zone to produce a rough concentrate of 43% zinc, and a 72.5% recovery of zinc from the red zinc zone to produce a rough concentrate of 30% zinc. It is expected the fine bubble flotation will improve recovery and initial rough concentrate grade. The "fine bubble" flotation test work that was performed did not improve recovery but based on analysis of the results it was determined that the "fine bubble" flotation test process may be able to be adjusted to improve recovery. Due to market conditions further testing is not planned at this time.

Test work completed by Hazen Research Inc. in 2012 focused on roasting high grade zinc in a rotary kiln to fume off the zinc and collect it as a zinc oxide concentrate. Recoveries of up to 98% of the zinc were recorded. The roasting of the zinc samples aims to simulate a "Waelz Kiln," a kiln that is used extensively to recycle zinc from steel dust and which regularly achieves recoveries in excess of 90%. In considering this process, the zinc mineralization at Sierra Mojada has a number of possible advantages, including the fact that it lies in the state of Coahuila, which is the largest coal producing state in Mexico, and it has an existing gas pipeline nearby that may be able to be extended to the project. Either option could provide the fuel to run the kiln. The project also has a functioning railway right to site to potentially allow for transport of coal to the site and of the zinc concentrate from the site. Due to market conditions no further test work on kilning is currently planned.

In addition we previously conducted a metallurgical program to test the recovery of the silver mineralization using the agitation cyanide leach method and recovery of the zinc mineralization using the SART process (sulfidization, acidification, recycling, and thickening). The test work on the silver zone focused on cyanide leach recovery of the silver using "Bottle Roll" tests to simulate an agitation leach system and to determine the recovery of low-grade zinc that occurs in the silver zone and high-grade zinc from the zinc zone that had been blended with mineralization from the silver zone to the leach solution. The silver was recovered from the cyanide leach solution using the Merrill Crowe technique, and the zinc was recovered from the leach solution using the SART process. The SART process is a metallurgical process that regenerates and recycles the cyanide used in the leaching process of the silver and zinc and allows for the recovery of zinc that has been leached by the cyanide solution. The results showed an overall average silver recovery of 73.2% with peak values of 89.0% and an overall average zinc recovery of 44% in the silver zone.

Gabon, Africa Licenses and Interests

On January 23, 2015, we closed the sale of 100% of the issued and outstanding securities of our former subsidiary Dome International, which held, indirectly, a 100% interest in the Ndjole concession to BHK Mining Corp. (formerly BHK Resources, Inc.). Under the terms of the share purchase agreement, we received cash consideration of $1,500,000 and the reimbursement of our expenses of $75,000 in cash. In addition, we have returned the Mitzic exploration license in Gabon to the Gabonese government.

&#160;

Competition and Mineral Prices

Mineral Prices

&#160;

Silver and zinc are commodities, and their prices are volatile. From January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 the price of silver ranged from a low of $13.71 per troy ounce to a high of $18.23 per troy ounce, and from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 the price of zinc ranged from a low of $1,528 per tonne to a high of $2,281 per tonne. Silver and zinc prices are affected by many factors beyond our control, including prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency values, governmental decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. The competitive nature of the business and the risks with which we are therefore faced are discussed further in the item entitled "Risk Factors," below.

&#160;

&#160;

The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, on the London Metal Exchange, high and low silver and zinc prices in U.S. dollars per troy ounce and per tonne, respectively. On October 31, 2015, the closing price of silver was $15.63 per troy ounce. On October 31, 2015, the closing price of zinc was $1,724 per tonne.

Competition

Our industry is highly competitive. We compete with other mining and exploration companies in connection with the acquisition and exploration of mineral properties. There is competition for a limited number of mineral property acquisition opportunities, some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than we do. As a result, we may have difficulty acquiring attractive exploration properties, staking claims related to our properties and exploring properties. Our competitive position depends upon our ability to successfully and economically acquire and explore new and existing mineral properties.

Government Regulation

&#160;

Mineral exploration activities are subject to various national, state/provincial, and local laws and regulations, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. Similarly, if any of our properties are developed and/or mined, those activities are also subject to significant governmental regulation and oversight. We will obtain the licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration program. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations applicable to the mineral interests we now hold in Mexico.

&#160;

Environment Regulations

&#160;

Our activities are subject to various national and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. We intend to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

&#160;

Changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in Mexico could, in the future, require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.

&#160;

During fiscal year 2015, we had no material environmental incidents or non-compliance with any applicable environmental regulations.

&#160;

&#160;

Employees

We have three employees, all of whom are full time. Contratistas, our wholly-owned operating subsidiary in Mexico currently has four employees who are all full time. Minera, our mineral holding company in Mexico, does not have any employees. 

Corporate Offices

Our corporate offices are located at 925 West Georgia Street, Suite 1908, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 3L2. Our telephone number is (604) 687-5800, and our fax number is (604) 563-6004.
