 Item 1. Business. 

Overview

We are a commercial stage company that develops and markets products based on a novel technology platform to facilitate the routine use of complex molecular profiling. Our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms automate sample processing and can quickly, robustly and simultaneously profile hundreds or thousands of molecular targets from samples a fraction of the size required by most current technologies. Our objective is to establish the HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms as the standards in molecular profiling and make this capability accessible to all molecular labs from research to the clinic. We believe that our target customers 

&#160;

desire high quality molecular profiling information in a multiplexed panel format from increasingly smaller and less invasive samples, with the ability to collect such information locally to minimize turnaround time and cost. The HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms were designed to meet these needs and empower pathologists, translational researchers and, in the future, clinical molecular labs to directly control the molecular profiling of patient samples. Our platform&#8217;s capabilities are also enabling biopharmaceutical companies to better leverage the power of molecular profiling in their preclinical and clinical research and biomarker development applications. 

Molecular profiling is the analysis of multiple DNA, RNA and/or protein targets in biological samples, such as tissue, cells, blood or other biofluids, to identify expression patterns or genomic changes. Molecular profiling is enabling a paradigm shift from the traditional approach of looking at one molecule at a time to the simultaneous analysis of hundreds or thousands of molecules. There are numerous applications of molecular profiling, such as whole genome sequencing for the discovery of novel genetic variants and the assessment of patient samples to identify biomarkers or molecular markers of disease that can aid in diagnosis, gauge patient prognosis or predict response to an available therapy. Significant discoveries of new molecular targets, such as in the field of immuno-oncology, are creating substantial growth in targeted tumor profiling for molecular diagnostic testing, biomarker development and translational research in oncology and other diseases. Based on published industry reports, the cancer profiling market is estimated to be $17.8 billion today and is expected to grow to $35.0 billion by 2018.

Our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms consist of instrumentation, consumables and software analytics that automate the molecular profiling of genes and gene activity using our proprietary nuclease protection chemistry to deliver extraction-free, multiplexed results on a wide variety of biological samples. We believe that our platforms provide significant workflow and performance advantages in molecular profiling applications including tumor profiling, biomarker development and, prospectively, molecular diagnostic testing. In 2014 we launched our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry that, together with our HTG Edge or HTG EdgeSeq instrumentation and software, automates and adapts our nuclease protection chemistry to enable analysis using next generation sequencing, or NGS, instrumentation. The HTG EdgeSeq system utilizes substantially the same sample preparation reagents as our original chemistry, but allows for read out on an NGS instrument. We believe that the HTG EdgeSeq chemistry is disruptive as it substantially simplifies current sample and library preparation methods, greatly reduces the complexity of data analytics, and provides customers additional value by expanding the utilization of their NGS instruments. By combining the power of the HTG EdgeSeq chemistry with the capabilities of NGS, we are able to analyze a wide variety of genomic profiles and sample types with high sensitivity and broad dynamic range. These technologies offer the potential to develop additional profiling panels and grow our market opportunities, and we expect to include RNA gene fusions and rearrangements, DNA mutations, detection of copy number variations, or CNV&#8217;s, and analysis of cell-free circulating DNA from liquid biopsies to our HTG EdgeSeq product portfolio. 

&#160;

The following features of our platforms are designed to enable the rapid delivery of a comprehensive molecular profile from extremely small samples: 

Optimization of Sample Preparation 

Improved Detection and Quantitation 

&#160;

Simplified Data Reporting 

An area of dissatisfaction for customers performing NGS tests is the difficulty of analyzing the data. HTG&#8217;s platforms are designed to greatly reduce the complexity of the data analysis tasks via the HTG Parser software. The FASTQ files are downloaded from the sequencer into the HTG Parser software where standard reports are available for our research customers and, in the future, custom clinical reports will be generated for physicians and molecular lab management. 

Our innovative platforms and menu of molecular profiling panels are being utilized by a wide range of customers including biopharmaceutical companies, academic institutions and molecular labs to simultaneously analyze a comprehensive set of molecular information from valuable clinical samples and substantially improve their workflow efficiency. We currently market several proprietary molecular profiling panels that address the needs of customers in high impact areas of translational research and biopharmaceutical biomarker and companion diagnostics. 

Our platforms&#8217; proprietary chemistry allows for extraction-free analysis of solid and liquid tumors including difficult clinical samples such as formalin-fixed paraffin embedded, or FFPE, tissue with as little as a single five micron section of tissue, a fraction of the amount of sample required by other technologies. The ability to provide robust data from minute samples is critically important in areas such as cancer where biopsies are becoming less invasive and smaller while the number of tests competing for the sample is growing. Our platform was designed to fit seamlessly into current surgical pathology workflows, minimize technician labor and set a new standard for ease of use.

We have a focused development pipeline of new profiling products that includes planned panels for translational research, drug development, and molecular diagnostics. Our product strategy is to build complete profiling panels of established and emerging molecular targets for broader and disease-specific approaches. For our molecular diagnostic customers where the reimbursement path is critical we expect that our planned panels will conform to approved reimbursement codes for genomic sequence procedures. We believe this will facilitate clinical customer adoption and avoid the high costs and time required to prove medical utility and seek unique reimbursement codes.

Our HTG Edge system is capable of running both our original, plate-based chemistry, which quantifies RNA using our plate reader included with the system, and our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry, which is detected using NGS instrumentation provided by the end user. We also have the flexibility to provide the HTG Edge instrument without our plate reader or, since December 2015, our dedicated HTG EdgeSeq system for those customers whose focus is NGS readout of our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry. We plan to launch a new version of our HTG EdgeSeq system in 2017 that will target the lower sample throughput clinical lab market. This program, which we refer to as &#8220;Project JANUS&#8221;, is expected to increase our addressable market by enabling efficient molecular profiling of smaller quantity batches of samples. 

&#160;

We continue to expand and evolve our assay and panel offerings, primarily focusing on our HTG EdgeSeq platform. During 2015, we launched several new HTG EdgeSeq research-use-only product offerings, including our HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel, HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay, HTG EdgeSeq Lymphoma Panel and HTG EdgeSeq Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Cell of Origin Assay. 

We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and we have never been profitable. We incurred net losses of $21.4 million and $14.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $89.6 million and we had available cash and cash equivalents totaling approximately $3.3 million and investments in short-term corporate and government debt securities totaling $28.2 million. 

Our Strategy

Our objective is to establish the HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms as the standards in molecular profiling, and to make their benefits accessible to all molecular labs from research to the clinic. The key components of our strategy are:

&#160;

&#183; 

Grow our installed base and promote our consumables-based business model. We plan to promote global adoption of our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms, including our growing menu of consumables, in molecular labs, biopharmaceutical companies and major translational research centers by demonstrating the key differentiating aspects of our platforms, such as small sample utilization, multiplexing and multi-parameter testing. These advantages result in cost, time and ease of use benefits for our global customers. We plan to expand our direct sales and support team in the United States and Europe, continue to transition from a contract sales team to our own direct sales and support team in Europe and expand our global distributor network. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Establish our systems&#8217; workflow as the best solution for clinical sequencing . We intend to continue to establish our technology as the best sample and library preparation method for clinical applications of next generation sequencers. We believe our differentiated HTG EdgeSeq chemistry will accelerate adoption of our platforms by leveraging the large existing and growing installed base of next generation sequencers. We are engaged with industry and corporate partners to position our HTG EdgeSeq products as the benchmark for workflow in targeted sequencing applications. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Develop new molecular diagnostic panels with high medical utility . The HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq systems were developed with features that we believe will enhance the capabilities of local molecular labs to routinely test large panels of proven-utility RNA expression, RNA fusions and rearrangements, DNA mutations and protein expression, all from extremely small samples, such as a single five micron section of tissue. We plan to add disease-specific panels such as lung cancer and broader profiling panels that allow our customers to use existing reimbursement codes. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase and strengthen companion diagnostics collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies . We believe collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies with late-stage drug development programs will lead to us generating companion diagnostic consumables revenue. We are currently working with 30 active development programs across 14 leading biopharmaceutical companies who are incorporating companion diagnostics in their drug development programs, where they are purchasing our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq consumable panels, including immuno-oncology, oncology biomarker and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, or DLBCL, panels. We plan to continue to expand our number of collaborations. In addition, we intend to opportunistically perform sample processing services for our collaboration customers, as we believe this will further strengthen our position as the technology of choice for certain of these companion diagnostic programs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expand the addressable market of HTG technology through new applications . We have demonstrated feasibility to add new applications in RNA-based gene fusions, expressed DNA mutations, CNVs and protein immunoassays. These new applications will allow us to develop multiple panels for use in translational, research, companion diagnostics and molecular diagnostics. We believe these applications and panels can be developed efficiently with reasonable capital investment.

Development of Molecular Profiling

Molecular profiling is the analysis of multiple DNA, RNA and protein targets in biological samples, such as tissue, cells, blood and other biofluids, to identify expression patterns or genomic changes. New molecular approaches are making it possible to perform these characterizations in unprecedented ways, resulting in a shift from the traditional approach of looking at one target at a time to the simultaneous analysis of hundreds or thousands of targets. There are numerous applications of molecular profiling such as whole genome sequencing for the discovery of novel genetic variants or the assessment of patient samples to identify biomarkers or molecular markers of disease that can aid in diagnosis, gauge patient prognosis or predict response to an available therapy. The 

&#160;

fundamental shift towards personalized medicine, or the use of an individual&#8217;s molecular profile to guide treatment, has led to significant growth in molecular profiling technologies and applications. We estimate that the global molecular profiling market is approximately $27.0 billion today. Based on published industry reports, cancer profiling makes up the largest segment of this market at an estimated $17.8 billion, the substantial majority of which we believe currently consists of research-use-only products, and is expected to grow to $35.0 billion by 2018. Research-use-only products are used in a wide variety of applications, including large-scale clinical trials of targeted therapies that are under development as well as basic medical research to understand and characterize tumors and tumor biology. We also estimate that genomic research makes up approximately $7.7 billion of the global molecular profiling market. Currently we are limited to marketing our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq systems and proprietary profiling panels for research use only, which means that we cannot make any diagnostic or clinical claims. We intend to seek regulatory clearances and/or approvals in the United States and other jurisdictions to market certain panels for diagnostic purposes. 

For decades, the treatment of disease was dominated by one-size-fits-all drug regimens. Over the last 10 years numerous molecular markers and profiling techniques have transitioned from discovery and research to inclusion in clinical guidelines. Today, there are many drugs in clinical development with a companion biomarker strategy, including many oncology drugs. Among the first of these personalized treatments were hormone therapies for breast cancer patients whose tumors expressed the estrogen receptor protein. This was followed by the use of trastuzumab for treating patients with HER2-positive breast cancers. The evolution of molecular profiling has also taken shape over the last decade in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC patients were first molecularly profiled for EGFR mutations to select patients most likely to respond to the drug, erlotinib, which was followed by ALK rearrangement testing for potential response to crizotinib. Now, additional mutations and rearrangements such as ROS1, RET, HER2, BRAF and MET, have been integrated into the NCCN guidelines for the treatment of lung cancer.

The NCCN Guidelines acknowledge that broad molecular profiling is key in improving the care of lung cancer patients. Similar trends are unfolding in other diseases such as thyroid cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma. These trends are fueling rapid growth of new molecular profiling offerings, technologies and industry business models to support the demand. The fastest growing segment of the estimated $10.6 billion molecular diagnostics market, a subset of the estimated $27.0 billion global molecular profiling market, is clinical testing in oncology. As oncologists rapidly integrate this new level of molecular profiling information into patient management strategies, a growing number of highly specialized central laboratories now offer tests that address specific clinical questions. The trend towards highly multiplexed profiling is not limited to oncology; other examples of expanding demand include prenatal, neonatal, inherited disease, and organ transplant and rejection profiling.

In addition, biopharmaceutical companies utilize molecular profiling in numerous applications. Preclinical applications include screening of compound libraries for target identification and preclinical testing for safety and fit for human use. For example, the FDA and European Medicines Agency require drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic, or DMPK, profiling studies to be performed as part of the drug development process. Metabolic gene expression response to the drug in human liver cells is assessed for each candidate drug, and it is common for biopharmaceutical companies to test the expression of three to 10 genes per drug candidate. Among the various DMPK testing technologies, such as RT-qPCR, branched DNA and microarrays, the most common is RT-qPCR. In DMPK studies, liver cells from several different human donors are challenged with the drug at various concentrations to predict how the drug will be metabolized. A large number of drug candidates are screened at this phase of development, creating significant demand for DMPK molecular profiling.

More recently, molecular profiling has moved into clinical applications. These include molecular profiling to develop clinical biomarker strategies, patient stratification for clinical trials, and companion diagnostics. The primary objective of these efforts is to improve response rates by understanding, at the molecular level, why a drug does or does not work in a patient population. Response rates for oncology therapeutics, at 25%, are among the lowest of all disease states. Combined with third-party payor pressures to lower patient treatment costs, most biopharmaceutical companies develop biomarker strategies to increase the rate of patient response to new drugs in development. Typically, they will look at a variety of biological profiling markers that include RNA expression, RNA fusions and rearrangements, DNA mutations and protein expression. Currently, it is estimated that there are over 2,000 clinical trials underway in oncology, and the vast majority of drug developers believe personalized and targeted therapy development is important to the future success of drug development.

When a molecular biomarker panel is used for selection of patients in a Phase 3 clinical trial to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a new drug, the drug and biomarker test are often submitted to the applicable regulatory agency for approval together. Upon FDA approval of the molecular biomarker panel, or companion diagnostic, the patient must be tested with the companion diagnostic prior to treatment with the drug. Companion diagnostic tests have a clear clinical utility which generally supports favorable reimbursement. We believe there are over 900 active oncology drug development programs, most of which have molecular biomarker strategies, creating a significant opportunity for molecular diagnostic companies with the right molecular profiling solutions. We estimate this molecular profiling market for companion diagnostics to be $2.5 billion and growing to $5.6 billion by 2019.

&#160;

Complexities and Challenges of Molecular Profiling Today 

Currently, molecular profiling is conducted using a variety of profiling techniques across multiple laboratory departments, and, in many situations, sent to distant labs. These techniques include immunohistochemistry, or IHC, fluorescent in situ hybridization, or FISH, polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, gene expression arrays, or GEA, and NGS. This distributed profiling approach has accelerated the use of molecular profiling and increased the need to make the process more accessible and routine. However, molecular profiling is also highly specialized because current technologies are complex, require multiple capital-intensive workflows, and are not economically scalable to the case volume of the local laboratory. The fragmentation of methods, sample logistics, and information flows has created significant challenges for labs, physicians, and patients as discussed below.

Insufficient Sample Availability

The proliferation of new molecular profiles and technologies has led to the need for more biopsy material. However, the trend is toward less invasive procedures that produce smaller biopsies and as a result, in many situations there simply is not enough collected sample to meet all the profiling requirements. For example, the standard method of collecting tumor samples for testing in oncology is via a surgical procedure where the tumor is resected or biopsied and then stabilized, or fixed, in a formaldehyde-based fixative known as formalin. From 24 to 72 hours after the tissue is harvested, it is permanently stabilized in a hard block of paraffin where it can be stored at room temperature for decades. This preservation technique was developed over 100 years ago, well in advance of the discovery of nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. While techniques to recover nucleic acids from these FFPE tissue samples have been developed, formalin fixation presents several technical challenges in analyzing DNA and RNA sequences. Because of the convenience of this preservation method, though, FFPE samples are the starting material for almost all tumor-profiling testing in oncology today. Very thin slices of tissue from these FFPE blocks, typically five microns in thickness, are affixed to glass slides for testing.

Most commonly, a histological stain called an H&#38;E, for the combination of hematoxylin and eosin that comprise it, is used to differentially mark cellular structures, making it simple for a pathologist to examine the patterns of the normal and diseased tissue under a microscope. IHC stains are also performed to aid diagnosis, prognosis or help guide therapy selection, with each IHC stain consuming two slides, one for the stain, and the other for a negative control. Historically, five to ten slides in total were consumed in the complete diagnostic workup for each tumor. With the advent of new molecular techniques there are additional demands for tissue, and the molecular tests on the market today require much more than a single slide. In many of these situations there simply is not enough collected tissue to meet all the profiling requirements. The growing number of specialized tumor-profiling tests, and their appetite for FFPE tissue or other sample material, is in direct conflict with the trend towards smaller, less-invasive testing approaches.

Slow Turnaround Times

In many cases, turnaround times for comprehensive profiling are several weeks due to the logistical time to route samples to various laboratory departments and to distant specialized labs. A number of technologies for sample characterization have been introduced that determine the status of various molecular characteristics for a sample. These include RNA expression, RNA fusions and rearrangements, DNA mutations and protein expression. For example, a single tumor specimen from a cancer patient is often profiled for multiple molecular characteristics where each characteristic is measured using a different platform. These platforms are utilized in separate laboratory departments or institutions with different technicians and clinicians, requiring that the sample and data be split into multiple workflows.

The time it takes to deliver the final report so that informed treatment decisions may be made is dependent on the turnaround time of the slowest test. A single laboratory with well-choreographed routing of tissues and information may be able to complete profiling within a week, but if part of the sample needs to be sent for additional profiling at a specialty lab, the total turnaround time may be lengthened by one or two weeks due to shipping, accessioning by the receiving laboratory, and integration of the testing results into the final report.

&#160;

Implications of Workflow Inefficiencies on Data Quality and Integration 

In addition to the challenges of splitting a single sample into multiple testing workflows, the individual workflow for molecular profiling of biological samples, including FFPE tissues, is complicated. Many of the steps from sample to result require manual intervention by a molecular technician. While these technicians are trained to standard operating procedures and proficiency tested, the levels of proficiency and precision vary among technicians. Variability introduced by technicians performing manual steps can translate to variability of results, with a test sample frequently at risk of experiencing losses of fidelity through the series of separation and transformation steps.

Sample to RNA Seq profiling of FFPE tissues

&#160;

Further, the increase in number of technologies for sample characterization and fragmentation of the testing workflows can also create challenges in putting all of the results together in a timely, complete profiling report. This level of data integration is critical for the treating physicians to assure they have the complete molecular assessment prior to the patient consult. Without a complete molecular assessment, there is limited ability to discuss the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options. Overall, we believe the critical relationship between the local pathologist and treating physician has been fractured as many tests results are now sent directly to the treating physician from these specialized and centralized CLIA labs. We believe the pathologist is critical to aggregating the diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information in a single patient molecular profile that can be utilized by the treating physician for therapeutic decisions.

Case Study of the Current Limitations in Molecular Profiling: Immuno-Oncology

A rapidly developing area of oncology drug development is the broad grouping of approaches referred to as immuno-oncology therapies. These immuno-oncology therapeutics include checkpoint inhibitors such as Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for melanoma and NSCLC, cancer vaccines such as chimeric antigen receptors in development by various companies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Ibruvica (ibrutinib) for B-cell malignancies, and immunomodulatory therapies such as interferon-alpha.

Recently, single-marker IHC tests have been approved as companion or complimentary diagnostics for anti-PD-1 checkpoint-inhibiting therapies. A proliferation of checkpoint inhibitors targeting additional ligands and receptors for CTLA4, OX40, LAG3, Tim-3 and others, coupled with combination approaches, is challenging the one-marker / one-drug diagnostic paradigm that previously advanced IHC-based companion diagnostics (e.g. HER2, ALK, c-KIT, etc). Understanding the complex biological framework of the tumor microenvironment is becoming increasingly important in interpreting the host immune response to tumors and developing the best single or combination therapy approach. The need for multiplexed gene expression assessment is illustrated in the graphic below where two histologically similar DLBCL tumors elicit very different host immune responses. Both cases have similar tumor 

&#160;

composition and populations of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In case 1, however, the immune system is responding primarily with natural killer lymphocytes whereas in case 2 the immune system has deployed CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes. Based on this information and other clinical parameters, very different immunotherapeutic strategies may be deployed to combat the tumor. We believe that current molecular profiling techniques, like IHC or FISH or RT-qPCR, are ill-suited for comprehensive assessment of the tumor microenvironment. 

&#160;

&#160;

Case Study of the Current Limitations in Molecular Profiling: NSCLC

The complexities and potential inefficiencies present in current molecular profiling techniques can be seen in non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. Several clinical parameters are typically assessed using multiple testing methodologies. Personalized therapy and entry into clinical trials for NSCLC are heavily dependent on accurate histological classification, most often performed by IHC. Tumor samples are also typically tested for gene mutations, and gene rearrangements, with each of these tests performed on a different platform and separate workflow. About 70% of initial lung cancer diagnoses now have to be made based on small biopsies or cytological specimens. It is common for each of these platforms to be in separate laboratory departments with different technicians and clinicians, requiring that the already small sample be split into multiple workflows. The results from the individual testing workflows are typically aggregated into a single report, signed off by the pathologist and transmitted to the oncologist. As outlined in the diagram below, the multiple steps involved in the process may substantially slow turnaround times and result in an incomplete molecular profile not suitable to inform clinical decision making.

Example of Typical NSCLC Testing Workflow

&#160;

Our Solution 

We have developed a novel technology platform that allows for precise, efficient molecular profiling of samples for clinical and research purposes. Our proprietary HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms have the flexibility to work with many different biological sample types, are able to generate robust results from very small samples, and employ simple, proprietary chemistries that obviate the need for many of the steps associated with traditional molecular profiling techniques. Our platforms and chemistries enable the simultaneous detection and quantitation of hundreds or thousands of molecular targets and are capable, now or in the future, of profiling multiple parameters such as RNA expression, RNA fusions and rearrangements, DNA mutations and protein expression in a single testing workflow that can use NGS detection for quantitative measurement.

Our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms, comprising instrumentation, software analytics and proprietary consumables designed exclusively for use with each respective platform. We manufacture the consumables utilized with our platforms specifically for our platforms and these consumables cannot be obtained from other sources. At the core of our solution is our proprietary chemistry called quantitative nuclease protection, or qNPA. Nuclease protection is an extremely efficient method for analyzing DNA and RNA as it eliminates the need for DNA or RNA extraction or reverse transcription. We have enhanced this method by combining it with our patented HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq chemistries. We designed and developed our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq automation platforms to optimize the capabilities of our chemistries, provide fast turnaround time and enable ease of use to molecular labs. Our chemistries and automation platforms are highly adaptable, so when molecular profiling needs change or emerge, we expect to be able to efficiently add new applications to address these needs.

As the following diagram shows, the HTG Edge processor, software and consumables now support two methods for quantifying results, the HTG Edge reader for lower multiplexed panels and the recently launched HTG EdgeSeq chemistry for quantitation of high-plexed panels for utilizing NGS. In addition, we now offer an HTG EdgeSeq system that is dedicated to performing our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry with NSG detection. 

&#160;

&#160;

The HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms provide data in a simple easy to use format. The entire workflow for both platforms from sample preparation to a molecular profiling report can be accomplished in 24-36 hours.

&#160;

We believe the majority of customers in our target markets would prefer to maintain control of their samples and perform the profiling internally but are challenged by limitations in available technologies. We believe we are well positioned to democratize molecular profiling with the following key benefits: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Optimize sample utilization . The HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq systems can analyze at least 2,500 genes from extremely small sample volumes such as a single five micron section of tissue or 12.5 microliters of plasma or serum. Our technology allows customers to do more with less, which meets the needs of clinical laboratories where today there is often not enough patient sample to do all the testing available. We believe providing customers the ability to work with extremely small sample volumes will be a significant driver of adoption of our platform. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Compatibility with multiple sample types . Our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms allow customers to profile and unlock genomic information from a wide variety of biological samples such as FFPE tissue, cells, blood serum and plasma. We have successfully demonstrated the ability to profile all of these and other sample types, and believe we ultimately can profile most clinically relevant sample types, including cell-free circulating nucleic acids from tumors, a rapidly developing area of investigation which is referred to as a liquid biopsy. We believe that the capabilities of our platform will allow us to efficiently expand applications, regardless of sample type. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Flexible and adaptable chemistry allows for use on multiple platforms . We believe our proprietary chemistry provides the ability to measure multiple molecular targets in all the necessary applications, including RNA expression, RNA fusions and rearrangements, DNA mutations and protein expression and offers the ability to quantify on the HTG Edge Reader as well as a variety of NGS platforms. This flexibility provides customers the ability to optimize their use of HTG Edge and/or HTG EdgeSeq technologies based on their specific throughput, workflow and application needs. Our proprietary chemistry is simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. For example, compared to RT-qPCR, our chemistry does not require extraction or cDNA synthesis. Compared to RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, ligation, adenylation, or size selection. We believe that the elimination of these steps helps prevent biases associated with these steps, sample degradation and increased opportunities for technician error. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Robust data . Molecular profiling produces large amounts of information that is used, among other things, to make important decisions, such as identifying potential drug targets or selecting a patient for a therapeutic treatment. This information is valuable only to the extent it accurately represents the true biology of the test sample and the same answer can be produced under many different conditions. Our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq chemistries are highly specific and sensitive, meaning they can detect the right target even when very little is present in the sample. Our platform produces consistent results on a replicate-to-replicate, day-to-day and instrument-to-instrument basis. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Automation provides superior workflow and ease of use . Our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq technologies are designed with fewer workflow steps in part due to the elimination of the need for complex biochemical processes such as extraction, cDNA synthesis, labeling, selection, depletion and shearing. This enables customers to limit hands-on time and the need for specialized skills, resulting in turnaround times of approximately 24-36 hours. Additionally, our HTG EdgeSeq application now further integrates sample preparation for targeted sequencing and greatly simplifies the bioinformatics back-end, so customers looking to leverage their NGS instrument can seamlessly add this capability to their current workflows. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Simplified bioinformatics . Our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq software provides data in a simple and easy to use format through a simple graphical user interface, or GUI, that is flexible enough for researchers yet structured enough for clinical laboratories. The software is modular so that new applications can be downloaded without any changes to hardware. For applications that pair our HTG Edge processor and reader results are accessible in multiple formats through the GUI on the host computer. For HTG EdgeSeq applications, the HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq parser software processes the data from the NGS platform. We believe the simplicity of our bioinformatics solution will help drive the adoption of our platform. 

Current Commercial Panels Offered on the HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq Platforms

We currently market proprietary molecular profiling panels targeting late stage drug development programs with potential breakthrough therapies, such as immuno-oncology. We market these panels to biopharmaceutical companies, with which we collaborate in biomarker development programs. We believe these programs could facilitate our commercialization of companion diagnostic tests. In addition, our panels are used in pre-clinical and clinical research areas. Our currently marketed panels are:

&#160;

&#183; 

HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay . One of the most promising areas of cancer therapy is immunotherapy or immuno-oncology, where new classes of oncology drugs are thought to enable or boost the host immune response towards tumors. Multiple drugs targeting the genes CTLA4, PD-1 and PDL-1 are moving into late-stage trials. Profiling samples for the genes targeted by these therapies may be predictive of drug response and aid in the stratification of patients into 

&#160;

&#160;

responsive and non-responsive groups. The HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay measures the expression of 549 of these immuno-oncology-associated genes. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

HTG EdgeSeq Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Cell of Origin Assay . DLBCL tumors are frequently classified into either the activated B-cell like, or ABC, or germinal center B-cell like, or GCB, sub-types by measuring the molecular profile of the tumor. These two subtypes display different clinical pathologies, as patients with the GCB subtype of DLBCL tend to respond differently than those of the ABC sub-type. With many of the large number of new DLBCL-targeting drugs appearing to have greater efficacy in one of the sub-types, a need for a reliable, FFPE-based cell of origin classification assay has emerged. The HTG EdgeSeq Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Cell of Origin Assay is our most frequently purchased panel and is being utilized in numerous late-stage drug programs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel . We recently completed development and are now marketing our HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel. This RNA expression panel measures the expression of up to 2,560 genes implicated in cancer for profiling tumor tissues, analyzing cancer pathways and identifying new biomarkers across both solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms (or Heme). We worked with leading key opinion leaders to identify these genes, which we believe are a comprehensive list of genes targeting known signaling pathways and receptor gene families implicated in cancer such as the EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4, PD-1 and FGFR genes. When paired with our existing miRNA Whole-transcriptome assay, we provide customers with a comprehensive solution for profiling their large sample archives for novel expression signatures. 

&#160;

&#183; 

HTG EdgeSeq Lymphoma Panel . Measures the expression of 93 genes frequently assessed in lymphomas, including 22 common non-Hodgkins B-Cell lymphoma markers from just 1.5mm 2 of a 5 micron thick FFPE section. This is designed to enable detailed molecular profiles of lymphomas using a single FFPE slide. 

&#160;

&#183; 

HTG EdgeSeq microRNA Whole-transcriptome Assay . Human microRNAs are short non-coding strands of RNA that are used by the cell for gene regulation. The HTG EdgeSeq microRNA Whole-transcriptome assay enables the simultaneous profiling of 2,255 microRNAs, allowing new, potentially clinically relevant miRNA profiles to be discovered. This is our first marketed product on the NGS-integrated HTG EdgeSeq chemistry. Our ability to profile small FFPE samples is a significant differentiator in the rapidly growing microRNA market. 

&#160;

&#183; 

HTG Edge DMPK Assays . Biopharmaceutical companies often perform DMPK profiling studies as part of the drug development process to adhere to regulatory guidance. A set of genes known as the cytochrome P450 family is known to predict both the toxicity and stability of drugs in the human body. The HTG Edge DMPK Core CYP assay enables DMPK scientists to measure six cytochrome P450 genes recommended for in vitro pharmacokinetic studies. We are also marketing an expanded 45-gene panel that measures the expression of additional transporter genes to allow for in-depth profiling of the drug candidate. The DMPK area is a high-volume profiling market segment and creates synergies with down-stream clinical drug development programs. 

We utilize several alternative arrangements to sell our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq systems and profiling panels. Our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq systems can be purchased directly by our customers, who also then purchase profiling panels and other consumables from us on an as-needed basis. In some instances we provide our equipment free of charge on a limited basis to facilitate customer evaluation. We also install systems for our customers at no cost, in exchange for an agreement to purchase profiling panels and other consumables from us at a stated price over the term of the agreement. As of December 31, 2015, we had an installed base of 49 HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq instruments (consisting of 22 systems sold, five covered under reagent rental agreements, 19 evaluation units and three systems with key opinion leaders). &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Product and Technology Pipeline Plan 

&#160;

Our objective is to establish the HTG EdgeSeq platform as a standard in molecular profiling, making this capability broadly accessible. We are leveraging our flexible and adaptable platform to develop comprehensive molecular profiling panels across an increasing set of molecular applications. We believe it is important to include applications that cover a broad set of genomic variation as well as expression-based clinical biomarkers in order to continually increase the value of the HTG Edge platform and provide a more complete profiling solution for our customers. The diagram below depicts our planned expansion of systems, applications and profiling panels which are being adding in a phased approach.

&#160;

Opportunities for Comprehensive Molecular Profiling in Diagnostics

We are planning to develop a portfolio of molecular diagnostic products using our proprietary technology to provide a single, efficient testing platform for sample profiling that integrates seamlessly into a customer&#8217;s NGS testing workflow. 

We are initially focused on areas where the diagnostic testing paradigm has significant inefficiencies. For example, many leading medical institutions are shifting from a single-drug / single-test approach to a broader tumor profiling strategy for their oncology practices. Rather than testing for single mutational analyses, such as KRAS for colorectal cancer, these institutions use their NGS platforms to assess the mutational status of 50 or more genes. In addition, the information a physician needs to make clinical decisions often comes from tests conducted using various testing modalities such as IHC, FISH and NGS. These complexities lead to a growing and unmet demand in clinical diagnostics for more comprehensive molecular profiles that can include RNA expression, RNA fusions and rearrangements, DNA mutations and protein expression.

We are developing solutions to address the detection and measurement of gene rearrangements such as gene fusions and insertions. A fusion gene is a hybrid gene formed from two previously separate genes. A well-established example is the EML4-ALK fusion gene found in a subset of malignant lung cancers. Our research team previously demonstrated feasibility to simultaneously detect and measure key gene fusions in lung cancer such as ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 from multiple small sample types including FFPE, cell lines and purified RNA. An insertion is the addition of one or more nucleotides into a genomic sequence; a small percentage of NSCLC exhibit HER2 exon 20 insertions. 

We intend to develop our ALK Plus assay as our initial clinical diagnostic test. Our ALK Plus assay is a comprehensive fusion panel that includes rearrangements with the following genes: ALK, ROS1, RET and NTRK1 as well as insertions in HER2 . This test panel is in formal development with plans to submit a modular PMA to the FDA and to seek CE/IVD marketing authorization for this panel in Europe in 2016. We have completed the initial pre-submission meeting with the FDA and expect to commence clinical trials in the second quarter of 2016. We intend to seek pre-market approval as a companion diagnostic for crizotinib therapy for ALK positive NSCLC cases. The ROS1, RET , NTRK1 and HER2 genes are expected to have RUO status, but we believe they could also be labeled as investigational use only (IUO) for certain late-stage drug development trials. 

&#160;

We are also developing enhancements to our chemistry, which we refer to as V2, that will enable a single testing workflow that provides, in parallel, reactions from a single unstained slide, histological classification of the tumor and DNA mutation status of key genes previously shown to be associated with NSCLC, such as EGFR, KRAS, BRAF and HER2 , in combination with the ALK Plus panel. We refer to this as the HTG total lung solution. We intend to extend this capability to all solid tumor sample types. 

We will need to develop, refine and implement new panel protocols and make changes or adjustments to our chemistry and software in order to optimize these planned applications and panels for use with our HTG EdgeSeq system. This will require substantial effort from our research scientists and the use of various laboratory equipment, supplies and materials, which combined represent the most significant costs that we expect to incur in connection with the development of these applications and profiling panels. &#160;

HTG is uniquely positioned to replace FISH testing for Heme 

Another area we believe the HTG EdgeSeq platform can provide significant value to clinicians is in the diagnosis of hematolymphoid neoplasms such as leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas, and myelodysplastic syndromes. This is a large market opportunity with over 170,000 new cases reported in 2014. &#160; Across the spectrum of these diseases there is a large number of gene rearrangements and CNVs, typically performed by FISH, which physicians evaluate in a patient&#8217;s sample to make clinical decisions. The diagnoses of leukemias and lymphomas are complex and initial FISH panels are often followed with additional FISH panels, resulting in a possible delay of diagnosis and treatment. 

We are in early stage development of highly multiplexed, NGS-based panels to assess most known gene rearrangements and CNVs in hematolymphoid neoplasms in a single NGS workflow. We believe improved turnaround time coupled with changing dynamics of reimbursement are causing laboratories to consider molecular options to replace FISH-based testing. The HTG EdgeSeq Heme Fusion and HTG EdgeSeq CNV / Karyotyping product concepts, with expected sample-to-answer time of 36 hours, should meet the turnaround time requirement while providing the comprehensive tumor profiling information for accurate diagnosis of hematolymphoid neoplasms.

The HTG EdgeSeq system can augment or, in some cases, replace IHC testing

IHC tests are integral to the diagnostic workup for most tumor types, providing qualitative protein expression data within the morphological context of the tissue tested. While there are over 400 different biomarkers tested by IHC in clinical practice today, we believe it is rare to test more than ten; this is due in part to tissue availability, especially for minimally invasive core needle biopsies, and limitations on the number of tests reimbursed per case. The HTG EdgeSeq IHC surrogate product concept is intended to enable the assessment of the RNA analogues for all clinical IHC biomarkers in a single NGS-based test. We believe this single-test concept will provide pathologists a standard by which to measure all tumors, augmenting or in some cases replacing their IHC testing with a quantitative assessment of the tumor biology.

Serving the decentralized markets with Project JANUS

In addition to continued menu expansion for clinical diagnostics we are now in development of our next generation instrument targeting the lower throughput clinical market segment. We believe this segment will potentially increase our addressable market for instrument sales from 100&#8217;s of labs to 1000&#8217;s of labs. The solid tumor testing market is served by a mix of centralized reference laboratories, comprehensive cancer centers, and decentralized regional hospital laboratories. Volumes of particular case types and downstream testing needs for solid tumors are somewhat unpredictable; we believe Project JANUS is well suited for managing low, medium, and surge testing volumes. Testing panels for Project JANUS include mutations, fusions, CNVs, expression classifiers, and a molecular surrogate for IHC. Our approach is to serve centralized markets with the HTG EdgeSeq system and expand to the decentralized market with Project JANUS. We believe our current HTG EdgeSeq instrument has the throughput capabilities that match the needs of the centralized market. Project JANUS is our development effort to expand our addressable market to the lower sample throughput labs and further decentralize the market.

&#160;

Project JANUS began with the selection of our engineering partner. Project JANUS demonstrates the continuing innovation of HTG&#8217;s instrumentation platform and workflow benefits.

Our Technology 

HTG Chemistries

Our core chemistry, known as qNPA, is a biochemical process capable of measuring messenger RNA, or mRNA, and microRNA gene expression levels from very small amounts of difficult to handle samples without the need for conducting RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, RNA amplification or RNA-labeling steps. Our proprietary chemistry is well suited to measure RNA due to its simple, yet robust biochemistry designed to handle highly multiplexed assays. Two primary elements of our chemistry process are DNA to RNA hybridization and S1 nuclease digestion. Both of these elements have been widely researched for decades and are well understood.

&#160;

&#160;

HTG Edge Chemistry

DNA nuclease protection probes, 50 bases in length, are added to the sample and hybridized to targeted RNAs, which can be both soluble and cross-linked in the biological matrix. S1 nuclease is added to remove excess, unhybridized DNA probes and RNA; the only remaining DNA protection probes are those hybridized to targeted RNA. This produces a virtual 1:1 ratio of DNA protection probes to the RNA initially targeted in the sample. Alkaline hydrolysis of the RNA releases the protection probes from the DNA:RNA duplexes. The released DNA protection probes are ready for quantitation. One of 47 unique anchor spots arrayed on the bottom of each well of a multi-well plate captures a programming linker that in turn captures a DNA protection probe. A detection scaffold consisting of a detection linker and a biotinylated detection probe is captured when a protection probe is present. After treatment with an avidin-HRP enzyme and a chemiluminescent substrate, the well is imaged and quantitated in the HTG Edge Reader. The HTG Edge system host software reports data from the reader.

HTG EdgeSeq Chemistry

DNA nuclease protection probes, which include a target-specific region flanked by universal wing sequences are hybridized to targeted RNAs, which can be both soluble and cross-linked in the biological matrix. Universal DNA wingmen probes are hybridized to the wings to prevent S1 nuclease digestion. S1 nuclease is added to remove excess, unhybridized DNA probes and RNA; the only remaining DNA protection probes are those hybridized to targeted RNA and wingmen probes. This produces a virtual 1:1 ratio of DNA detection probes to the RNA initially targeted in the sample. Alkaline hydrolysis of the RNA releases the protection probes from the DNA and RNA duplexes. The released DNA protection probes are ready for quantitation. DNA protection probes are labeled with sequencing adaptors and tags in a thermocycler. The labeled DNA protection probes are concentrated, pooled, and ready for sequencing using standard NGS protocols. Data from the NGS instrument is processed and reported by the HTG EdgeSeq Parser software.

&#160;

Key Advantages of HTG Chemistries 

&#160;

&#183; 

Multiplexing hundreds or thousands of targets. Measuring multiple genes in a single reaction can be challenging with competitive technologies due to the complex interactions of the assay sub-components. Our proprietary HTG Edge chemistry allows for 47 independent genes to be profiled in a sample. While we are currently marketing a panel with our HTG EdgeSeq chemistry that can profile up to 2,500 genes in a sample, we believe we can develop applications using our chemistry for multiplexing more than 2,500 genes if there is a customer need. The high level of gene multiplexing allows for significantly lower amounts of tissue to be used per sample than in competitive low-plex profiling technologies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

No RNA extraction. Competitive technologies for assessing RNA require RNA that is isolated and purified from other components found in the sample. These time-consuming and bias-inducing steps lead to some target loss. In FFPE tissues, a fraction of the RNA is lost in the purification process because it cannot be separated from insoluble tissue components and the fixation and embedding process or long storage times for FFPE tissue may damage the RNA and break it into smaller, more difficult to analyze fragments. This makes working with small FFPE tissues extremely challenging and can result in testing failures and loss of precious samples due to insufficient RNA recovery. These biases introduced by RNA extraction cannot be overcome and may be magnified throughout the subsequent analysis. Our proprietary chemistry does not require RNA extraction for most sample types, improves utilization of precious samples, improving workflow and reducing costs by eliminating a step known to cause bias in the data. 

&#160;

&#183; 

No cDNA synthesis. Many competitive technologies, most prominently qRT-PCR and RNA sequencing, require conversion of RNA into DNA for analysis. This process requires a viral enzyme to move along the extracted RNA to create a DNA copy of the molecule. When damaged and fragmented RNA is used, these small RNA strands become increasingly difficult to convert into DNA in an accurate and reproducible manner. Our proprietary chemistry does not require conversion of the RNA to DNA, removing a major source of bias experienced with competitive technologies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Short protection probes. Many samples contain RNA degraded by various combinations of heat, age, poor processing, and fixation. In these samples, the RNA is damaged and fragmented into smaller strands. Utilizing short protection probes of 50 bases or less, our proprietary chemistry is more efficient than competitive technologies that require longer strands of RNA for quantitation. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Simplicity. Our proprietary chemistry is simple, with fewer steps than competing technologies. Compared to RT-qPCR, our chemistry does not require extraction or cDNA synthesis. Compared to RNA sequencing, our chemistry does not require extraction, cDNA synthesis, shearing, rRNA depletion, ligation, adenylation, or size selection. We believe that the accumulation of these steps required by other technologies results in amplification of biases, sample degradation and increased opportunities for technician error. 

HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq Platforms

Our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms were developed and are manufactured under ISO 13485:2003 guidelines using our proprietary chemistry to simplify multiplexed nucleic acid testing in research and clinical laboratories. The entire HTG Edge or HTG EdgeSeq workflow from sample preparation to a molecular profiling report can be accomplished in 24-36 hours for 96 samples. With the speed, flexibility, sensitivity, and accuracy of our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms, combined with the system&#8217;s ability to work effectively with small sample volumes, researchers can profile hundreds or thousands of different genes per sample.

&#160;

&#160;

The HTG Edge platform consists of processor and reader instruments, a host computer, and software. The HTG Edge processor is a fully automated instrument that prepares biological samples for quantitation using proprietary, electronically barcoded, single-use consumables. Both the processor and the reader have barcode scanners units to process the two-dimensional, or 2D, barcodes printed on the consumables loaded in each instrument. The barcoded consumables are single-use in order to reduce operator errors and provide chain of custody traceability for the samples. The robotic systems within each instrument are engineered for reliable performance and low maintenance. The walking path of each robot is programmed to minimize any chance of contamination of the reagents or samples.

&#160;

Quantitation of results from the HTG Edge platform may be performed on either the proprietary HTG Edge Reader or an NGS platform. If the reader is utilized for quantitation, proprietary consumables are used in a chemiluminescent detection reaction, and the reader captures and processes these images in less than an hour to produce a quantitative result. The software reports the result on the host computer. One host computer supports up to five processors and one reader. This allows laboratories to easily expand their capacity by adding processors without purchasing an additional reader instrument. 

HTG EdgeSeq applications combine either the HTG Edge processor or a dedicated HTG EdgeSeq processor with an NGS platform to enable the quantitative analysis of hundreds or thousands of targeted RNAs in a single assay. The sample is prepared for quantitation on the HTG Edge or HTG EdgeSeq processor, then labeled with molecular sequencing adaptors and tags. The labeled samples are concentrated, pooled, and sequenced on an NGS platform using standard protocols. Data from the NGS instrument are processed and reported by the HTG EdgeSeq Parser software. The HTG EdgeSeq applications currently process samples in sample volumes ranging from eight to 96.

HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq Platform Workflow

Our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms deliver complex molecular profiling information in a simple four step workflow. A technician spends minimal time preparing samples which are easily loaded into the applicable processor. Once the sample is loaded, the processor performs our proprietary chemistry protocol with no technician intervention, which is commonly referred to as walk away automation. Once the sample is processed, a technician prepares the sample for quantitation on either the HTG Edge reader, for HTG Edge systems, or an existing NGS instrument. This flexibility in quantifying molecular information provides customers the ability to optimize their use of the HTG Edge or HTG EdgeSeq platform based on their specific throughput, workflow and application requirements. Having both quantitation options allows HTG to offer a broader set of molecular profiling panels and leverage the growing NGS installed base. In comparison to RNA sequencing, there are many fewer steps required for molecular profiling using HTG EdgeSeq applications as shown in the diagrams below.

&#160;

&#160;

HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq Platform Performance

The HTG Edge and/or HTG EdgeSeq platforms enable our customers to quantitatively profile from one to thousands of genes in a single reaction using very small samples. Our chemistry works with many biological sample types including FFPE, frozen tissue, plasma, serum, whole blood preserved in PAXgene, and cultured cells. We plan to enable our customers to use a single profiling workflow for the analysis of multiple parameters such as RNA expression, RNA fusions and rearrangements, DNA mutations and protein expression. As part of our development process for new products we perform several analytical studies to demonstrate performance of the applicable platform, and we believe that our approach to multi-parameter molecular profiling is highly repeatable and reproducible.

&#160;

Equivalent quantitative expression results from large as well as very small samples 

HTG EdgeSeq assays are validated with sample inputs ranging from as much as 25 mm 2 down to 1.5 mm 2 tumor surface area from a single 5 &#181;m section, enabling comprehensive molecular profiling on a large surgical resection or very small needle core biopsy. Needle core biopsies are often the only tissue available for profiling. A representation of the difference in the amount of tissue available in a surgical resection versus a core needle biopsy is shown in the graphic below. In an internal study of resections versus core needle biopsies from the same non-small cell lung cancers, Pearson correlations (log2 transformed counts) greater than 0.96 were observed.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe obtaining molecular profiles from very small samples is of critical importance to researchers. We have demonstrated reproducible, quantitative results from a fraction of the more than 100 ng of input RNA typically required for competitive technologies. In the study shown below, the HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel was used to measure mRNA expression levels in a dilution series from 12.5 ng to 1.56 ng of Universal Human RNA. In the figure titled Input Titration Correlations below, correlations between each dilution were measured by Pearson&#8217;s r and are displayed in each comparison field. A Pearson correlation between two perfectly identical molecular profiles will produce an r-value of 1.0. The r-values obtained in the study shown below, of greater than 0.99, indicate nearly identical molecular profiles were obtained. In the figure titled Assay Linearity below, the raw number of sequencing reads for each of the samples in the dilution series are shown, with the statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line, R-squared, of 0.98481. These plots demonstrate the capability of the HTG EdgeSeq applications on the HTG Edge or HTG EdgeSeq platform to deliver equivalent molecular profiles over a range of sample inputs. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Leveraging the dynamic range and sensitivity of NGS 

The end product of the HTG EdgeSeq chemistry process is a library of genomic fragments which, once sequenced, are compared to a reference genome consisting of one sequence per probe in the assay. NGS platforms individually sequence each genomic fragment that binds to its detection media, obtaining highly specific information about each of one of the genomic fragments analyzed in a single sequencing run. Each fragment sequence is stored as a single read. With the potential capacity of a single sequencing run numbering in the millions of reads, NGS assays are highly sensitive, detecting low abundance or rare sequences, while having a wide dynamic range, accurately counting the relative number of abundant sequences. In the development and validation of gene expression classifiers, we believe it is important that the assay system reliably measure differential gene expression for both high and low abundance genes. As an example of how the HTG EdgeSeq assays leverage the sensitivity of NGS, the graphic below shows the relative expression of the low-abundance immunotherapy targeted genes PD-1 and PD-L1 across a wide range of sample inputs using the HTG EdgeSeq Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Cell of Origin Assay.

&#160;

&#160;

High fidelity between processing conditions

One of the greatest challenges faced in molecular profiling of formalin fixed samples is the poor fidelity routinely seen when comparing the results across various processing conditions. One example in particular is the fidelity seen between formalin fixed samples such as FFPE to non-fixed tissue. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the fixation process can lead to different molecular profiles in otherwise identical samples. We believe researchers often obtain sub-optimal molecular profiling results solely due to the formalin fixation process. We further believe that our chemistry overcomes the losses in fidelity between non-fixed and FFPE tissues, enabling users to obtain an accurate assessment of tumor biology from FFPE tissues. 

&#160;

To demonstrate fidelity between non-fixed and FFPE tissues that may be achieved using the HTG EdgeSeq system, a resection from a breast cancer tumor was prospectively harvested and split, with half of the specimen immediately frozen and the other formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE). RNA from the non-fixed, fresh frozen specimen was extracted and added to the HTG lysis buffer (we recommend extracting the RNA from fresh tissue samples). The matched FFPE tissue was directly lysed in the HTG lysis buffer without extraction. Both specimens were then profiled using the HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay. The scatterplot below shows the correlation between the non-fixed, fresh frozen tissue and the FFPE tissue, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of r = 0.95, indicating that the fixation process did not materially alter the molecular profile of the sample when our proprietary chemistry was used. We believe our platform enables researchers and clinicians to access their large collections of archived FFPE tissues to deliver reproducible, biologically relevant molecular profiles. 

&#160;

&#160;

Compatibility with multiple sample types

Compatibility of our proprietary chemistry with ovarian FFPE, extracted RNA, and fresh or fixed cultured cells is shown above. Below are technical replicates of heart FFPE, plasma and whole blood preserved in PAXgene profile using the HTG EdgeSeq microRNA whole transcriptome panel. We believe our proprietary chemistry is robust across many biological sample types.

&#160;

&#160;

Detection of gene fusions

HTG EdgeSeq chemistry has demonstrated the ability to accurately detect gene rearrangements in patient-derived FFPE tissues. The example below demonstrates detection in a patient sample with a characterized gene fusion involving the KIF5B and RETS genes. Using multiple DNA protection probes, the HTG EdgeSeq platform can detect gene rearrangements and fusions. Rearrangements and fusions are detected in two ways. First is the direct measurement and detection of the unique RNA sequence created at the gene fusion site. This is indicated by the strong signal obtained from the KIF5B-RET v1 probe. The second approach involves calculating the ratio of signals obtained from probes targeting both the 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; end of the RET gene. Samples which do not contain a RET gene fusion will have similar RET 5&#8217; and RET 3&#8217; expression. In the sample above, however, which contains a RET 

&#160;

gene fusion, we see significantly higher signal from the RET 3&#8217; probe implying the two parts of the RET gene are no longer connected, indicating a gene rearrangement has occurred. 

&#160;

&#160;

A cell line with a known ALK fusion and normal ROS1 was tested using the same 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; probe ratio methodology described for the RET fusion above. As expected with a fused ALK gene, the expression of the 3&#8217; portion of the transcript is much higher than the 5&#8217; portion, indicating a fusion event has occurred. An example of a known non-fusion gene, ROS1, is also shown in the example where the 5&#8217; and 3&#8217; ends of the ROS1 are expressed at a 1:1 ratio, indicating this gene is intact.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Discriminating between closely related sequences 

The specificity of our proprietary chemistry is demonstrated in the data chart below. Closely related synthetic miRNA pools supplied by Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities were split between pools. All possible probes were used to profile individual pools. From 3-11% of NPP probes bound to off-target sequences with a 1-base difference (Figure 1A) while only 0.1-0.3% of NPP probes bound to off-target sequences with a 2-base difference (Figure 1B). In both examples, the on-target hybridization signal is at least 8X greater than off-target hybridization. Data was generated using the Illumina MiSeq v2 1x50 reagent kit. We believe that our proprietary chemistry is highly specific and will enable our customers to discriminate between closely related sequences.

&#160;

&#160;

Repeatability

An important consideration in adoption of a molecular profiling platform is the degree to which the same molecular profile can be obtained from a sample tested on multiple replicates and multiple occasions. Obtaining highly similar profiles indicates that the assay is stable, and that the data generated is reliable and repeatable. The XY scatterplots below shows the correlation between the same sample on technical replicates using the HTG EdgeSeq Immuno-Oncology Assay. Extremely similar results were obtained, as demonstrated by the Pearson correlation coefficient r-values of 0.96 and 0.97 for fresh frozen and FFPE samples, respectively. We believe the HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms and HTG EdgeSeq chemistry enables our customers to produce stable and repeatable molecular profiles. As demonstrated by the measurement of 549 mRNAs in the sample, HTG EdgeSeq chemistry has the ability to reliably detect large numbers of genes in a complex background.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Reproducibility

Another important consideration in adoption of a molecular profiling platform is the degree to which the same molecular profile can be obtained from a single sample tested multiple times over on the same and different instruments. Obtaining highly similar profiles indicates that the chemistry and instrument platform is stable, and that the data generated is reliable and reproducible. The XY scatterplots below shows the correlation between the same sample profiles on three separate instruments across three days using the HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel. The scale of the vertical and horizontal axes represent log 2 transformed, filtered probe counts. Extremely similar results were obtained, as demonstrated by the Pearson r-values above 0.96 for all comparisons. We believe the HTG Edge platform and chemistry enables our customers to produce stable and reproducible molecular profiles.

&#160;

&#160;

Research and Development

We have committed, and expect to commit, significant resources to developing new technologies and products, improving product performance and reliability and reducing costs. We have assembled an experienced research and development team with the scientific, engineering, software and process talent that we believe is required to successfully grow our business. As of December 31, 2015, our research and development team consisted of 22 employees across the disciplines of research and development scientist, platform development and bioinformatics.

We are currently focused on expansion of our profiling applications and test panel menu and on the development of our next generation Project JANUS instrument program. We incurred research and development expenses of $4.6 million and $3.1 million for 

&#160;

the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had a Small Business Innovation Research grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute within the National Institute of Health which was completed in June 2015. 

We continuously seek to innovate and improve our technology to add valuable features for our customers and expand addressable market segments. Our technology advancement efforts are targeted at:

&#160;

&#183; 

Expansion of new sequencing applications to detect and measure RNA based rearrangements, DNA mutations, protein immunoassays, CVFs and circulating cell free DNA 

&#160;

&#183; 

Development of IVD products 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continued improvements to our workflow automation instrumentation, including the development of Project JANUS, a low sample volume version of the HTG EdgeSeq system. The low volume version of HTG EdgeSeq system will target sample throughput in the one to eight sample range, and is intended to be applicable to a broader set of molecular labs. This low volume version is targeted for launch no earlier than 2017. 

Our new products are developed under our ISO 13485 certified quality system and we expect to submit our first assay to FDA by the end of 2016. Our HTG Edge system is currently CE marked and we also expect to submit for CE/IVD status for the HTG EdgeSeq system by the end of 2016. We are dedicated to ongoing innovation to the HTG Edge platform technology and expanding our pipeline of product candidates. Our goal is for HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq systems to become the standards for rapid profiling of samples and critical clinical specimens such as tissue tumor biopsies.

Sales and Marketing

We distribute our instruments and consumables via direct sales in the U.S. and Europe and also through distributors or sales agents in parts of Europe and other countries. As of December 31, 2015, our U.S. sales and marketing organization consisted of 35 employees including 16 in direct sales or sales management, 12 in sales support and six in marketing. In addition to our direct sales team in the U.S., as of December 31, 2015, we have one direct sales employee in Europe, a contracted sales team in Europe through an agreement with Novoptim and an exclusive distribution agreement for India, Pakistan, Sri-Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal with Innovative Life Discoveries Pvt. Ltd.

Our sales and marketing efforts are targeted at biopharmaceutical companies, clinical research centers and clinical diagnostic labs focused on sample profiling for translational research, biomarker/companion assay development and lab-developed diagnostic testing. We intend to promote adoption of our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq systems, sample profiling panels and future molecular diagnostic assays, upon marketing clearance or approval by FDA, by expanding our existing U.S. sales force, building a greater direct sales presence in Europe, expanding international distribution, and continuing to collaborate with key opinion leaders to validate our platform and influence utilization of our products.

The top two customers accounted for 38% and 7% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 12% and 7% for the year ended December 31, 2014. We derived 8% and 31% of our total revenue from grants and contracts primarily from one organization during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

Manufacturing and Suppliers

We utilize third-party contract manufacturers to produce components for our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq instruments and raw materials for our consumables. We complete HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq instruments and reagent kits at our Tucson, Arizona facility, which has been certified to ISO 13485:2003 standards. We completed a capital buildout in the first quarter of 2016 which created 5,000 square feet of dedicated manufacturing and operations space. Features include a walk-in freezer for storage of material at -20C, seven individual controlled lab areas providing climate, particulate and atmospheric pressure control that minimizes contamination of product and test processes and dedicated space for cellular manufacturing of our instruments. We believe that our existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our needs at least for the next several years. 

Instruments

We assemble our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq instruments at our Tucson, Arizona facility. We have qualified an alternative third-party manufacturer and we believe additional alternatives would be available if necessary. Instrument component vendors are qualified and reviewed regularly to ensure that manufacturing standards are met and maintained. We award contracts for estimated annual quantities of components and, considering the replenishment lead times of our vendors, take delivery of batches covering approximately one month of demand at a time. 

&#160;

Consumables 

We assemble our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq reagents and consumables at our Tucson, Arizona facility. Reagent vendors are selected using precise standards, and are reviewed regularly for compliance with our specific quality requirements. We purchase reagent stock in quantities that often exceed projected annual demand. We complete batches of finished goods approximating quarterly demand and supervise inventory on a Minimum/Maximum basis to ensure that we are replenishing our finished goods and raw material ahead of demand. 

Competition

We have categorized known competition into:

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain intellectual property rights relating to key aspects of the technology employed in our HTG Edge and HTG EdgeSeq platforms and chemistries, maintain any strategic licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely upon certain patents, registered and common law trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, invention and patent assignment agreements and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We intend to aggressively protect, defend and extend the intellectual property rights in our technology.

Patents and Patent Applications

Our patent portfolio includes 13 patent families that, collectively, consist of eight issued U.S. patents, 28 granted foreign patents (variously in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom), and 33 patent applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, including two patent applications now allowed in Europe and one patent application now allowed in Canada. This portfolio is directed to our nuclease-protection-based technologies as well as to lung cancer and melanoma biomarker panels and a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, cell-of-origin classifier discovered using our nuclease-protection-based technology, which will help us maintain an exclusive position in key areas of our business, including targeted nuclease-protection based sequencing, and, if we should so elect, may provide opportunities for out-licensing melanoma-DLBCL- or lung-cancer-related content. There are five pending or allowed applications and three granted patents, including one U.S. patent, directed to our novel HTG EdgeSeq methods, which patents will expire in April 2032. Worldwide, we have 26 patents in the two patent families directed to our HTG Edge plate-based methods; these patents will begin to expire at the end of December 2017 with the last ones expiring in June 2022.

Agreements with Third Parties

Asset Purchase Agreement with NuvoGen Research, LLC

We acquired some of our intellectual property, including one of our patent families, entitled &#8220;High Throughput Assay System&#8221; or similar, or Acquired Technology, from Neogen, LLC, now known as NuvoGen Research, LLC, or NuvoGen, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated January 9, 2001, as amended in November 2003, September 2004, November 2012 and February 2014. The Acquired Technology generally relates to our array-based nuclease protection assays. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, in exchange for the Acquired Technology, we initially paid NuvoGen 5,587 shares of our common stock, fixed payments of $740,000 over the first two years of the agreement and agreed to pay NuvoGen 6% our yearly revenue, which would be applied to any fixed payments, until the total aggregate cash compensation paid to NuvoGen under the agreement equals $15,000,000. Pursuant to the latest amendment to the agreement, through 2017, we are only required to pay a yearly fixed fee, in quarterly installments, to NuvoGen in the range of $543,750 to $800,000, and may defer any accrued revenue-based payments. Beginning in 2018, we are obligated to pay the greater of $400,000 or 6% of sales, plus amounts, if any, deferred in the 2016 and 2017 periods by which 6% of revenue exceeds the applicable fixed fee plus 5% interest on such deferred amounts until the obligation is repaid in full. We paid our fixed fees for 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 in advance, and our next payment is due in April 2016.

In a transaction related to the foregoing acquisition, NuvoGen also received a non-exclusive, royalty free license under the Acquired Technology pursuant to an agreement dated September 15, 2004. The license is limited to NuvoGen&#8217;s own internal service-oriented efforts and activities to accelerate the development of targeted drugs and other pharmaceutical compounds and agents as part of NuvoGen&#8217;s grant funded or other basic research and development of drugs intended for the treatment of cancer. Pursuant to the agreement, in the event that NuvoGen produces revenue through the sale of cancer drugs developed through use of the license for entities other than for-profit and other commercial drug-research and development service ventures, NuvoGen will pay us a royalty in the mid-single digit range percentage of such revenue for the quarter. This agreement may be terminated by either party in case of a breach by the other party, and we may terminate the agreement by giving written notice if NuvoGen files for bankruptcy or performs other similar actions.

License Agreement with Merck

In connection with the investment by Merck Capital Ventures LLC in the Company, we granted to Merck Sharpe &#38; Dohme, or Merck, pursuant to an agreement dated February 15, 2011, a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicenseable (except to Affiliates of Merck) license to certain of our quantitative nuclease protection, or qNPA, patent rights solely for Merck&#8217;s internal research and development purposes. We may terminate the agreement upon a breach of any material provision of the agreement by Merck, if Merck has not cured such breach within 60 days after receiving written notice from us.

&#160;

Loan and Security Agreement with Oxford Finance, LLC and Silicon Valley Bank 

On August 22, 2014, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement, or the loan agreement, with Oxford Finance LLC, or Oxford, as collateral agent, or in such capacity, Agent, and a lender and Silicon Valley Bank, as a lender, or SVB, and together with Oxford, the Lenders, providing for term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 million.

Borrowings under the Loan Agreement may consist of up to two separate term loans. We borrowed the initial term loan in the principal amount of $11.0 million, or the Term A Loan, on August 22, 2014. The Term A Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 8.50% per annum. On or prior to June 30, 2015, the Loan Agreement allowed us to borrow one additional term loan, or the Term B Loan, and together with the Term A Loan, the Term Loans, for up to $5.0 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain borrowing conditions. We received the proceeds, net of a $320,000 original issue discount, with a requirement to pay a final payment of 3.75% of the total amount borrowed.

In August 2015, the Company and its lenders amended the Loan Agreement to extend the availability of the Term B Loan until March 31, 2016. Pursuant to the August 2015 amendment to the Loan Agreement, we will have monthly interest-only payment obligations until April 1, 2016. Following the interest-only payment period, equal monthly payments consisting of principal and interest amortized over the remaining term of the loan through the September 1, 2018 maturity date will be due. The amendment also increased the final fee payment percentage to 4.75%. In February 2016, the Company notified its lenders, pursuant to the requirements of the amendment to the Loan Agreement, of its intention to draw the remaining $5.0 million available under the Term B Loan on or before March 31, 2016. This additional principal will be repaid evenly over the course of 30 months beginning April 1, 2016. 

We may prepay all, but not less than all, of the loaned amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon through the prepayment date with 15 days&#8217; advance notice to Oxford. In accordance with the August 2015 amendment, we will be obligated to pay a prepayment fee equal to (i) 3% of the principal amount prepaid if the loan is prepaid on or before the first anniversary of the August 2015 amendment, (ii) 2% of the principal amount repaid if the loan is prepaid after the first anniversary but on or prior to the second anniversary of the August 2015 amendment and (iii) 1% of the principal amount repaid if the loan is repaid after the second anniversary of the August 2015 amendment and prior to maturity. We are not entitled to reborrow any amounts of principal once such principal has been repaid.

While any amounts are outstanding under the credit facility, we are subject to a number of affirmative and restrictive covenants, including covenants regarding delivery of financial statements, maintenance of inventory, payment of taxes, maintenance of insurance, dispositions of property, business combinations or acquisitions, incurrence of additional indebtedness and transactions with affiliates, among other customary covenants. We are also restricted from paying cash dividends or making other distributions or payments on our capital stock except for repurchases of stock pursuant to employee stock purchase plans, employee restricted stock agreements, stockholder rights plans, director or consultant stock option plans, or similar plans, provided such repurchases do not exceed $100,000 in the aggregate per fiscal year.

We granted the Agent a security interest in our personal property to secure our obligations under the loan agreement. The security interest does not extend to patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights (except for rights to payment related to the sale, licensing or disposition of such intellectual property rights) or certain other specified property.

Upon the occurrence of certain events, including but not limited to the failure by us to satisfy our payment obligations under the loan agreement, the breach of certain of our other covenants under the loan agreement, and the occurrence of a material adverse change, the Agent will have the right, among other remedies, to declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable, and will have the right to receive the final payment fee and, if the payment of principal and interest is due prior to maturity, a prepayment fee. The Agent also will have the right, among other remedies, to foreclose upon and/or sell or otherwise liquidate our personal property upon the occurrence of certain events.

As further consideration for access to the loan, we granted each of the Lenders warrants to purchase 1,256,281 shares of the Company&#8217;s Series E Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $0.2189 per share, or the Warrants. The Warrants are exercisable until August 22, 2024 and were automatically converted to warrants for common stock upon completion of our IPO in May 2015.

Development and Component Supply Agreement with Illumina, Inc.

In October 2014, we entered into a development and component supply agreement with Illumina for the development and worldwide commercialization by us of up to two complete diagnostic gene expression profiling tests for use with Illumina&#8217;s diagnostic instruments, using components supplied by Illumina. We refer to these diagnostic gene expression profiling tests as IVD test kits. The IVD test kits may be used in two discrete testing fields chosen by us, one or both of which may relate to oncology for breast, lung, lymphoma or melanoma tumors, and up to one of which may relate to transplant, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or 

&#160;

immunology/autoimmunity. We provided notice to Illumina of our first testing selection during the quarter ended March 31, 2015. We must provide notice to Illumina of our second selected field, if any, by October 2016. 

Following our selection of the testing field for each IVD test kit, we and Illumina have agreed to negotiate a development plan for the development and regulatory approval of the applicable IVD test kit, under which development and regulatory support will be provided by Illumina. Upon mutual agreement of the first development plan in the fourth quarter of 2015, we paid Illumina a $100,000 fee. We are also required to pay Illumina up to $1.0 million in the aggregate upon achievement of specified regulatory milestones relating to the IVD test kits. In addition, we have agreed to pay Illumina a single digit percentage royalty on net sales of any IVD test kits that we commercialize pursuant to the agreement.

Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to obtain our requirements for certain components to be used in the development and/or commercialization of IVD test kits from Illumina. We and Illumina have also agreed to negotiate in good faith to enter into a supplemental supply agreement for the continued purchase and supply of the foregoing components.

Absent earlier termination, the agreement will expire in October 2019 or on the date which the last to expire development plan under the agreement is completed, whichever is earlier. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon 90 days&#8217; written notice and may terminate any development plan under the agreement upon 30 days&#8217; prior written notice. Illumina may terminate the agreement upon 30 days&#8217; prior written notice if we undergo certain changes of control or immediately if we fail to select a testing field for an IVD test kit within 24 months following the date of the agreement. Either party may terminate the agreement upon the other party&#8217;s material breach of the agreement that remains uncured for 30 days, or upon the other party&#8217;s bankruptcy.

Authorization, Supply and Regulatory Authorization Agreement with Life Technologies Corporation

In March 2016, we entered into an Authorization, Supply and Regulation Authorization Agreement with Life Technologies Corporation (&#8220;LTC&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., for the development and worldwide commercialization by us of up to five RNA-based next generation sequencing panels (&#8220;HTG Assays&#8221;) for use with LTC&#8217;s sequencing instruments and components supplied to end&#8209;users by LTC. 

Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to obtain our requirements for certain components to be used in the development of HTG Assays from LTC. LTC has agreed to provide support in our efforts to obtain regulatory approval of the HTG Assays. We are required to pay LTC a milestone payment in the mid-six figure dollar range upon certain regulatory achievements for each HTG Assay. In addition, we have agreed to pay LTC a single digit percentage royalty on net sales of HTG Assays that we commercialize pursuant to the agreement.

&#160;

Absent early termination, the initial term of the agreement will expire in March 2021 and thereafter will automatically renew for additional two year periods for as long as we continue to develop or sell HTG Assays, provided that neither party provides written notice of its election to terminate the agreement at least 60 days prior to expiration of the then-current term. Either party may terminate the agreement (a) upon the other party&#8217;s material breach that remains uncured for 30 days, (b) upon the other party&#8217;s bankruptcy or (c) upon written notice in the event the party providing notice reasonably determines that continued performance under the agreement may violate any regulatory law, or any other applicable law or regulation or U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidance.

Trade Secrets

We also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. We cannot provide any assurance, however, that we have entered into such agreements with all relevant parties, or that these parties will abide by the terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy or commercially exploit aspects of our technology or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.

&#160;

Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement 

Clinical laboratories will acquire our instrumentation through a capital purchase, capital lease or reagent purchasing agreement. These laboratories will offer their customers a menu of testing services using our IVD test kits or their LDTs, which they may develop using components they purchase from us, or a combination of both. Our customers will generate revenue for these testing services by collecting payments from third-party payors, including public and private payors, as well as patient co-payments.

United States

In the United States, our customers will utilize the existing reimbursement framework for testing services:

Tier 1 and Tier 2 Molecular Pathology Procedures

Prior to January 1, 2013, molecular pathology procedures were reimbursed using the 83890-83912 code series, commonly known as &#8220;stacking codes&#8221;, which were based on the various technical steps performed to produce a test result. The American Medical Association (AMA) created the Tier 1 codes (81200-81383) and Tier 2 codes (81400-81408) to specifically identify the test being performed and as a replacement to stacking codes. The stacking codes were deleted from the clinical laboratory fee schedule used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for payment determination in 2013. Private payors, for the most part, have transitioned away from the stacking codes to the Tier 1 and CMS Tier 2 codes. Single analyte tests for mutations and gene rearrangements are described by these Tier 1 and Tier 2 codes; specific examples include 81235 for epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, mutation analysis and 81401 for EML4/ALK rearrangement analysis. Single analyte tests not specifically called out in Tier 1 or Tier 2 codes can be submitted for reimbursement consideration using the miscellaneous code 81479.

Genomic Sequencing Procedures.

The AMA created codes for Genomic Sequencing Procedures (GSPs) and other Molecular Multianalyte Assays as part of its calendar year 2015 update to the clinical laboratory fee schedule. After our submitted request, AMA has modified the GSP codes to clarify the definition to include DNA and RNA. These new codes will be used by our customers to seek reimbursement for multi-analyte test offerings:

&#160;

&#183; 

Gene expression classifiers for hematolymphoid neoplasms, such as the determination of activated B-cell like (ABC) or germinal center B-cell like (GCB) subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas 

&#160;

&#183; 

Gene rearrangements in solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms 

&#160;

&#183; 

Copy number variations in solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms 

&#160;

&#183; 

Mutations in solid tumors and hematolymphoid neoplasms 

Our customers will seek payment for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Molecular Pathology Procedures and GSPs from public and private payors. Claims for Medicare coverage are processed by private Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, such as Novitas and Cahaba, and coverage for specific test codes are specified in Local Coverage Determinations, or LCDs, issued by individual MACs or National Coverage Determinations, or NCDs, which apply to all MACs. Private payors issue their own coverage determinations that are largely reflective of the CMS LCDs and NCDs. HTG closely monitors trends in coverage through interactions with customers, industry associations such as the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the Association for Molecular Pathology, or AMP, and industry consultants; these trends are key considerations in our product development plans.

Our customers will use our products to offer testing services that provide an analysis of 5-50 genes as well as 51 or more genes. In October 2014, CMS released its preliminary determinations regarding the method for determining 2015 payment rates for new codes under the clinical laboratory fee schedule. CMS recommended that payment rates for GSPs be determined through a process known as gapfill rather than by crosswalking to allow CMS and its contractors to gather information about the manner in which the tests are performed and the resources necessary to provide them, so that ultimately CMS can set an appropriate payment rate for these tests. In the gapfill process, the local MACs determine the appropriate fee schedule amounts in the first year, and CMS calculates a national payment rate based on the median of these local fee schedule amounts in the second year. On September 27, 2015, gapfill pricing for CPTs 81445 and 81450 for the assessment of 5-50 genes in solid and liquid tumors, respectively, were set at $597 and $647 for 2015. CPT 81455 for the assessment of 51 or more genes in solid and liquid tumors has not yet been priced. 

We believe that establishment of the aforementioned reimbursement codes specific to genomic sequencing procedures such as our clinical diagnostic tests currently in development is an important factor in expanding access to our products. In addition, coverage and reimbursement of our clinical diagnostic tests by government and private payors is essential to our commercial success. Accordingly, our strategy includes efforts to encourage third-party payors to establish coverage, coding and payment that will 

&#160;

facilitate access to our tests as we seek FDA approval for these tests and expand our commercialization efforts in the United States. Our success in these efforts depends in part on the extent to which governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate reimbursement levels for tests using our technology. Failure by our customers who use our tests to obtain sufficient coverage and reimbursement from healthcare payors or adverse changes in government and private third-party payors&#8217; policies would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. 

In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments made under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, with amounts assigned to the procedure billing codes used to report the specific laboratory services. The CLFS sets the maximum amount payable under Medicare for each billing code. Payment under the CLFS has been limited from year-to-year by Congressional action such as imposition of national limitation amounts and freezes on the otherwise applicable annual consumer price index updates. In February 2012, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 was signed into law which, in part, reduced the potential future cost-based increases to the CLFS by 2%. The payment amounts under the CLFS are important not only for Medicare reimbursement, but also because although there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement amongst third-party payors, other third-party payors are often guided by the Medicare CLFS in establishing reimbursement rates. For example, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients. As a result, in light of the anticipated reduction in the CLFS payment amounts, certain third party payors may also reduce reimbursement amounts.

Beginning January 1, 2016, there will also be major changes to the payment formula under the CLFS. Under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which was signed to law in April 2014, clinical laboratories must report laboratory test payment data for each Medicare-covered clinical diagnostic lab test that it furnishes during a time period to be defined by future regulations. The reported data must include the payment rate (reflecting all discounts, rebates, coupons and other price concessions) and the volume of each test that was paid by each private payor (including health insurance issuers, group health plans, Medicare Advantage plans and Medicaid managed care organizations). Beginning in 2017, the Medicare payment rate for each clinical diagnostic lab test will be equal to the weighted median amount for the test from the most recent data collection period. The payment rate will apply to laboratory tests furnished by a hospital laboratory if the test is separately paid under the hospital outpatient prospective payment system.

Outside the United States

Our target markets outside of the United States are Europe and Asia/Pacific.

In Europe, coverage for molecular diagnostic testing is varied. Countries with statutory health insurance (e.g., Germany, France, The Netherlands) tend to be more progressive in technology adoption with favorable reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing. In countries such as the United Kingdom with tax-based insurance, adoption and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing is not uniform and is influenced by local budgets.

In Asia/Pacific, our commercial strategy is to opportunistically partner with distributors in countries with sufficient demand for our products to justify the investment by both parties. Currently we have a distribution agreement with iLife Discoveries in India, where the vast majority of molecular diagnostic testing is paid for out-of-pocket by the patient.

Our diagnostic product menu plans for Europe and Asia/Pacific consist primarily of NGS-based test kits that will satisfy existing or emerging testing demand, and we will be competing on the basis of testing efficiency, quality and price.

Government Regulation &#8211; Medical Device Regulations

United States

Our products and operations are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and other federal, state, local and foreign authorities. Currently we are limited to marketing our products for research use only, which means that we cannot make any diagnostic or clinical claims. However, we intend to seek regulatory clearances or approvals in the United States and other jurisdictions to market certain assays for diagnostic purposes. The clinical diagnostics under development by HTG are classified as &#8220;medical devices&#8221; under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion and marketing, distribution, post approval monitoring and reporting and import and export of medical devices in the United States to assure the safety and effectiveness of such products for their intended use.

&#160;

Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA application. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees, unless an exemption is available. 

Device Classification

Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes &#8211; Class I, Class II or Class III &#8211; depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.

Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of regulations, referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices, also called Class I reserved devices, also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.

Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and postmarket surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is &#8220;substantially equivalent,&#8221; as defined in the statute, to either:

&#160;

&#183; 

a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or 

&#160;

&#183; 

another commercially available, similar device that was cleared through the 510(k) process. 

To be &#8220;substantially equivalent,&#8221; the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.

After a 510(k) notice is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application for any modifications to a previously cleared product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain this clearance or approval. In addition, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite PMA application(s). In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements.

The PMA Approval Process

If the FDA determines that the device is not &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; to a predicate device, or if the device is classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. A manufacturer can also submit a petition for direct de novo review if 

&#160;

the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk. 

Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.

In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an IDE application. Some types of studies deemed to present &#8220;non-significant risk&#8221; are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and IRB approval is obtained. If the device presents a &#8220;significant risk&#8221; to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA&#8217;s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product&#8217;s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.

Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA, by statute and by regulation, has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant&#8217;s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. The FDA considers a PMA or PMA supplement to have been voluntarily withdrawn if an applicant fails to respond to an FDA request for information (e.g. major deficiency letter) within a total of 360 days. Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee&#8217;s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct a bioresearch monitoring inspection of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, and a QSR inspection of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:

&#160;

&#183; 

the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data. 

If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.

New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modification to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require 

&#160;

submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change. 

In approving a PMA application, the FDA may also require some form of postmarket studies or postmarket surveillance, whereby the applicant follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. FDA may also require postmarket surveillance for certain devices cleared under a 510(k) notification, such as implants or life-supporting or life-sustaining devices used outside a device user facility. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use.

Post-Approval Requirements

After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include, but are not limited to:

&#160;

&#183; 

the registration and listing regulation, which requires manufacturers to register all manufacturing facilities and list all medical devices placed into commercial distribution; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow elaborate design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; 

&#160;

&#183; 

labeling regulations and unique device identification requirements; 

&#160;

&#183; 

advertising and promotion requirements; 

&#160;

&#183; 

restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device; 

&#160;

&#183; 

PMA annual reporting requirements; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the FDA&#8217;s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to reoccur; 

&#160;

&#183; 

medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 

&#160;

&#183; 

recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; 

&#160;

&#183; 

an order of repair, replacement or refund; 

&#160;

&#183; 

device tracking requirements; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

postapproval study and postmarket surveillance requirements. 

Our facilities, records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with the applicable United States medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, unanticipated expenditures, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, operating restrictions, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA&#8217;s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries, the FDA&#8217;s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product clearances or approvals and criminal prosecution.

Research Use Only

A research use only, or RUO, product is one that is not intended for use in a clinical investigation or for clinical diagnostic use outside an investigation and must be labeled &#8220;For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.&#8221; Products that are intended for research use only and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA requirements discussed above, including the approval or clearance and QSR requirements. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may 

&#160;

be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDC Act and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use. 

European Union

The European Union (EU) also has adopted requirements that affect our products. These requirements include establishing standards that address creating a certified quality system as well as a number of directives that address specific product areas. The most significant of these directives is the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Directive (&#8220;IVDD&#8221;), which includes:

&#160;

&#183; 

Essential Requirements . The IVDD specifies &#8220;essential requirements&#8221; that all medical devices must meet. The requirements are similar to those adopted by the FDA relating to quality systems and product labeling. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Conformity Assessment . Unlike United States regulations, which require virtually all devices to undergo some level of premarket review by the FDA, the IVDD currently allows manufacturers to bring many devices to market using a process in which the manufacturer certifies that the device conforms to the essential requirements for that device. A small number of products must go through a more formal pre-market review process. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be marketed throughout the EU and European Economic Area. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Vigilance . The IVDD also specifies requirements for post market reporting similar to those adopted by the FDA. 

Other International

A number of other countries, including Australia, Canada, China and Japan, have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for medical devices sold in those countries. Many of these standards are loosely patterned after those adopted by the European Union, but with elements unique to each country. Although there is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards, regulations in each country may vary substantially, which can affect timelines of introduction. We routinely monitor these developments and address compliance with the various country requirements as new standards are adopted.

Government Regulation &#8211; Fraud and Abuse and Other Healthcare Regulation

We may be subject to various federal and state healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback laws. Penalties for violations of these healthcare laws include, but are not limited to, criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations.

Anti-Kickback Statute

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending, any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; expressly includes kickbacks, bribes, or rebates and also has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value.

There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. These statutory exceptions and safe harbors set forth provisions that, if all their applicable requirements are met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they may not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more applicable statutory exceptions or safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy all requirements of an applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to 

&#160;

have committed a violation. The ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act which is discussed below. 

Federal Civil False Claims Act

The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from or approval by, the federal government. Suits filed under the federal civil False Claims Act, known as &#8220;qui tam&#8221; actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. These individuals, sometimes known as &#8220;relators&#8221; or, more commonly, as &#8220;whistleblowers&#8221;, may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The number of filings of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more healthcare companies to have to defend a case brought under the federal civil False Claim Act. If an entity is determined to have violated the federal civil False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. Many comparable state laws are broader in scope and apply to all payors, and therefore, are not limited to only those claims submitted to the federal government.

Federal Physician Self-Referral Prohibition

We are also subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits, among other things, physicians who have a financial relationship, including an investment, ownership or compensation relationship with an entity, from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to the entity for designated health services, which include clinical laboratory services, unless an exception applies. Similarly, entities may not bill Medicare, Medicaid or any other party for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all third-party payors, not just Medicare and Medicaid.

Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute

The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person or entity who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, created several additional federal crimes, including healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations established uniform standards for certain covered entities, which are certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, as well as their business associates, governing the conduct of specified electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. Among other things, HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys&#8217; fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.

The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act

The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to report annually to CMS, information related to &#8220;payments or other transfers of value&#8221; provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians, as defined above, and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately and completely the required information for all payments, transfers of value and ownership or investment interests may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for &#8220;knowing failures.&#8221; 

&#160;

State Law Equivalents 

Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, as well as laws that restrict our marketing activities with health care professionals and entities, and require us to track and report payments and other transfers of value, including consulting fees, provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Some states mandate implementation of compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws. We also are subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws, which vary by country. We may be subject to certain s tate and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Healthcare Reform

In March 2010, President Obama enacted the ACA, which is substantially changing healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and is significantly impacting the medical device industry. The ACA&#8217;s provisions of importance to our business include, but are not limited to, a deductible 2.3% excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S., with limited exceptions, which became effective January 1, 2013. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, signed into law in December 2015, includes a two year moratorium on the medical device excise tax that applies between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2017. Absent further legislative action, the tax will be automatically reinstated for medical device sales beginning January 1, 2018. Since its enactment in 2010, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect additional challenges and amendments in the future. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation&#8217;s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013, and , following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

The full impact of the ACA, as well as other laws and reform measures that may be proposed and adopted in the future, remains uncertain, but may continue the downward pressure on medical device pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had 87 employees, of which 10 are employed in administration, 15 in manufacturing and operations, 22 in research and development, five in regulatory and quality affairs, and 35 in s ales and marketing. We had 1 employee in Europe as of December 31, 2015, all others were in the United States. We believe that our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We have never experienced a work stoppage due to labor difficulties and believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our U.S. employees are represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining is established by law in France and we and our European employee, who resides in France, have agreed to the terms of a National Collective Agreement applicable to our industry.
