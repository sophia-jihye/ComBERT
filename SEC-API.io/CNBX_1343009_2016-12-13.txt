History 

&#160;

Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. was incorporated on September 15, 2004, under the laws of the State of Nevada, as Thrust Energy Corp., for the purpose of acquiring undivided working interests in small oil and gas exploration properties and non-operating interests in both producing and exploration projects throughout the United States and Canada.

&#160;

On September 30, 2010, we increased our authorized capital to 900 million shares of common stock (par value $0.0001) and 100 million shares of preferred stock (par value $0.0001), and effected a 20-for-1 reverse split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result of the reverse split, our issued and outstanding common stock was reduced from 13,604,000 shares to 680,202 shares and 5,000,000 preferred shares.

&#160;

Due to our inability to earn any meaningful revenue from oil and gas exploration, our management determined in April 2011 that we should change our business plan to include toll milling and refining.

&#160;

On May 5th, 2011, we effected a change of name to American Mining Corp. by completing a short form merger with a wholly-owned subsidiary.

&#160;

On April 25th, 2014, Cannabics Inc., a Delaware Corporation, purchased 20,500,000 shares of restricted stock of the Company, thus acquiring control of the company.

&#160;

On April 29th, 2014, Mr. Andrew Grundman resigned his official position as Director of the Corporation. On April 29th, 2014, the shareholders of the Corporation voted Dr. Zohar Koren, Dr. Eyal Ballan and Itamar Borochov as the new Directors of the Company.

Dr. Zohar Koren resigned his official position as director of the corporation on January 2015.

&#160;

On June 3rd, 2014, the Company's Board of Directors declared a two-to-one forward stock split of all outstanding shares of common stock. The stock split was approved by FINRA on June 19th, 2014. The effect of the stock split increased the number of shares of common stock outstanding from 40,880,203 to 81,760,406. All common share and per common share data in these financial statements and related notes hereto have been retroactively adjusted to account for the effect of the stock split for all periods presented prior to June 3rd, 2014. The total number of authorized common shares and the par value thereof was not changed by the split.

&#160;

On June 19th, 2014, FINRA granted final approval of Change of Name &#38; Ticker Symbol of the Corporation from American Mining Corporation to CANNABICS PHARMACEUTICALS INC., with the new Ticker Symbol of &#8220;CNBX&#8221;. Said approval was predicated upon Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc.&#8217;s filing of Articles of Merger with American Mining Corporation with the Nevada Secretary of State on May 21st, 2014. Under the laws of the State of Nevada, Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. was merged with and into the Registrant, with the Registrant being the surviving entity. The Merger was completed under Section 92A.180 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, Chapter 92A, as amended, and as such, does not require the approval of the stockholders of either the Registrant or Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Company Overview &#8211;

&#160;

CANNABICS PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. is based in Bethesda, Maryland, and is dedicated to the development and licensing of advanced and sophisticated cannabinoid-based treatments and therapies. The Company&#8217;s main focus is development and marketing of various new and innovative therapies and biotechnological tools aimed at providing relief from diverse ailments that respond to active ingredients sourced from the cannabis plant. These advanced tools include innovative delivery systems for cannabinoids, personalized medicine therapies and procedures based on cannabis originated compounds and bioinformatics tools.

&#160;

The parent Company Cannabics Inc was founded by a group of Israeli researchers from the fields of cancer research, pharmacology and molecular biology. Its current flagship Intellectual Property is named &#8220;CANNABICS SR&#8221;, a proprietary formulation to create a long acting medical cannabis capsule that was shown in observational studies in Israel to provide 10-12 hours of beneficial therapeutic effects and indicated initially as a palliative care therapy for cancer patients. This proprietary delivery method enables a convenient once per day dosing regimen of medical cannabis to patients.

&#160;

The Company has a dedicated team of scientists that are working constantly on creating new technologies of medical cannabis care for patients in diverse indications. The company&#8217;s Research is located in Israel which has allowed for the use of medical cannabis since the 1990s, and has a favorable regulatory attitude towards the conducting of Cannabis based clinical studies in Israeli hospitals &#8211; in contrast to the legal situation in the United States where clinical research on medical cannabis is still illegal. This structure is an extraordinary corporate advantage, and markedly separates the company from similarly minded companies.

&#160;

The number of people licensed to receive medical cannabis treatment in Israel numbers around 20,000 - in comparison to over 1,000,000 in the whole of the United States. Therefore, while the Israeli market potential is regarded as limited, the ability to perform clinical studies and use the Israeli market as an &#8220;advanced medical Cannabis R&#38;D lab&#8221; is proving to be highly advantageous.

&#160;

Most importantly, while the U.S. FDA has yet to approve even basic private research relating to cannabis, the regulatory environment is quite different in Israel. Within the Israeli Ministry of Health, there is a stand-alone agency, the Israeli Medical Cannabis Agency, (IMCA), which on October 26th, 2014, granted Cannabics Pharmaceuticals an exclusive government License to launch their advanced scientific R&#38;D program.

&#160;

Through the large body of research that is conducted by its scientists and affiliated partners, the Company has been able to gain in-depth knowledge of the various therapeutic effects of diverse cannabis strains and identify patterns of cannabinoid ratios that are useful in treating various indications. The Company is currently in the midst of several collaborative programs with several leading academic research and medical centers in Israel in order to further establish the beneficial therapeutic effects of its proprietary Intellectual Property, and to refine its development of novel treatments for debilitating ailments.

&#160;

CANNABICS SR technology 

&#160;

While the medicinal effects of certain cannabinoids are well known to physicians, it is common knowledge that smoking is hazardous to health, due to the formation of inhaled carcinogenic compounds in the combustion process and deposit of tar and other damaging residues in the lung tissue. Many physicians are perfectly aware of the beneficial therapeutic properties of medical cannabis, however they refrain from recommending or prescribing it to patients knowing that smoking the raw flowers is still the most common and available administration route. Suggesting smoking for a grandmother going through cancer treatment makes little sense. Hence the availability of an oral, standardized, reliable and clinically tested administration route of medical cannabis &#8211; no different from the administration route of most medications consumed by patients today - would dramatically improve the availability of medical cannabis therapy to patients in need.

&#160; 

Standardization and reproducibility 

Most practicing physicians are aware of the increasing market availability of cannabis edible products such as cannabis cookies, chocolates and chewing gums. However, these products have so far totally failed in gaining credibility in the eyes of the medical community due to a severe lack in standardization and reproducibility. Laboratory tests of cannabinoid concentrations in currently available edible products have demonstrated severe variability in the potency of those products, due to non-uniformity of manufacturing procedures in the kitchens that produce them. In addition, the bioavailability levels (the amount of active ingredients that ultimately reach the blood stream after ingestion) of these products is also highly variable due to the lack of a standardized and efficient formulation. As a result, it is very common to either over-dose or under-dose when using such cannabis edibles as a therapeutic means, a fact which rightly prevents most physicians from recommending these medically un-tested products. Therefore, a substantial unmet need of the medical cannabis market is a standardized and reproducible product, which is based on a sophisticated and advanced formulation that provides a high and predictable bioavailability level of the cannabis active ingredients to patients.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Long lasting and stable effect profile 

An additional substantial drawback of most currently available administration routes of medical cannabis is the short lasting effect profile that they offer, with a typical 3-4 hour effect for smoking, vaporizing and sublingual administration, and a typical 6-7 hour effect for unformulated edible products. As a result, the patient has to re-dose several times throughout the day, and suffers from inconsistent and rapidly variable levels of therapeutic effects. Many patients and physicians report that this is one of the main limitations to the efficacy of currently available medical cannabis therapies, and a major cause for a sub-optimal treatment. Therefore, a substantial unmet need in the medical cannabis field is a long acting product that will provide a steady state level of therapeutic effects for at least 10 hours, and can thus allow a whole day of beneficial response within the therapeutic window upon a once-per-day dosing regimen.

&#160;

Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. has developed its proprietary &#8220;CANNABICS SR&#8221; long acting formulation in order to address these specific unmet needs of medical cannabis needs described above. This sophisticated and advanced formulation is the core technology embedded in CANNABICS SR. Our technology allows for standardized and long acting medical cannabis dosage, designed for specific and various indications. The proprietary formulation ensures the patient experiences a constant, steady state level of beneficial effects within the therapeutic window for up to a 10 &#8211; 12 hour span. The unique long acting formulation allows for once-per-day dosing regimen that provides the desired therapeutic effects of medical cannabis throughout the day. Thus, our technology enables a safe, effective and reproducible administration method and fulfils the unmet needs of both patients and physicians.

&#160;

The Cannabics SR technology perfectly solves one of the major concerns of medical cannabis patients, which is the initial high peak of active cannabinoids concentration in the plasma soon after administration. This high peak is a common feature of immediate release cannabis administration methods, and can cause undesirable side effects such as disorientation and dizziness. The unique pharmacokinetic profile of our technology helps to avoid this undesired result. The CANNABICS technology assumes only natural pure extracts of active cannabinoids from specifically selected strains of medical cannabis, that are carefully chosen to serve the unique needs of patients suffering from specific indications. There are no synthetic compounds involved. The CANNABICS technology is pre-designed to fit the currently existing medical cannabis regulations in Israel, Europe and certain US States which are licensed as a &#8220;Medical Marijuana Infused Products Manufacturer&#8221; (&#167;12-43.3-404 CRS). The ingredients used in the proprietary CANNABICS SR formulation are all certified food grade ingredients (recognized by the FDA as &#8220;G.R.A.S.&#8221; &#8211; Generally Regarded as Safe) and the formulation is free of any artificial additives or chemical substances. Thus the CANNABICS SR technology is fully compliant with the current cannabis infused edible product regulatory definition, which is in fact very similar to a regular food supplement regulatory definition.

&#160;

As a result, CANNABICS technology is exempt from long and arduous pharmaceutical development processes and does not require additional regulatory approval beyond the standard &#8220;Medical Marijuana Infused Products Manufacturer&#8221; license from a licensee (the &#8220;manufacturer&#8221;) in order to reach the market. This unique position distinguishes CANNABICS SR technology from other options currently available in the market. On the one hand, the technology proffers a fully standardized and reproducible product that has compliance for GMP manufacturing standards just as one would expect from any pharmaceutical product; and on the other hand it is pre-designed to allow for use of this technology without long, arduous and extremely expensive regulation processes that are typical in the pharmaceutical industry.

&#160;

In order to establish the goal of true standardization and reproducibility and to indeed rank as one of the leading medical cannabis technologies in the market, Cannabics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has achieved Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) capabilities. GMP regulations are designed to ensure that products are produced and controlled according to the highest industry quality standards. Adhering to these practices ranks Cannabics among a very limited number of medical cannabis technologies available in the market that are capable of being manufactured according to GMP standards. An additional goal of the company is to be one of the first and few companies in the world to commercialize its clinically tested cannabis-based technology. In furtherance of this goal, Cannabics Inc. has now undertaken a series of clinical studies in renowned medical centers in Israel where the R&#38;D division is strategically located. Achievement of GMP manufacturing capabilities is an important pre-requisite for the initiation of these clinical studies. The efficacy and safety data collected in these formal clinical studies, together with the superior pharmacokinetic profile of the Cannabics SR formulation, will be the key advantage of Cannabics in the medical cannabis arena.

&#160;

Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. has now initiated its technology through a strategic partner in the state of Colorado and EU markets under existing medical cannabis regulatory pathways, while simultaneously preparing to launch a series of formal clinical studies in order to establish the unique medical benefits of its technologies for patients suffering from various indications.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The company&#8217;s business model is solely based on technology development and IP out-licensing to licensed and certified producers for marketing. The Company&#8217;s technologies are licensed to a strategic partner in compliance with each country&#8217;s and/or US state&#8217;s statutory regulations and exclusively to licensed and authorized medical cannabis local licensees that have adequate production and marketing capabilities. Within the US, Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. itself does not manufacture, distribute, dispense or possess any controlled substances, including cannabis or cannabis based preparations, it merely licenses its IP. Within Israel, Europe and other territories outside the US, Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. may employ a different business model through gaining adequate licenses under the appropriate regulations in each territory, all in full compliance with local rules and regulations in each country. Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. is purely a Bio-Technology Pharmaceutical company which licenses use of its Intellectual Property, it does not itself produce or provide any product in any location.

&#160;

&#160; 

Competitive Factors 

&#160;

The Pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and we will be competing with many other and better financed companies.

&#160;

We are an early stage pharmaceutical company, with deminimis positive cash flow. We compete with other early stage bio-tech and pharmaceutical companies for financing from a limited number of investors that are prepared to make investments in early stage development companies. The presence of competing early stage pharmaceutical companies may impact on our ability to raise additional capital in order to fund our research and development if investors are of the view that investments in competitors are more attractive based on their subjective analysis of our company, the general market conditions and the price of the investment offered to investors.

&#160;

Regulations 

&#160;

Cannabics Pharmaceuticals Inc. is purely a Bio-Technology Pharmaceutical company which licenses use of its Intellectual Property, it does not produce, manufacture or provide any product in any location. We are duly licensed by the Israeli Health Ministry for our research in Israel. Beyond the Israeli Health Ministry (by whom we are licensed), we are not under the aegis of any Federal or State regulatory scheme as we have no manufacturing activity. Any licensee whom we engage must be duly licensed and certified according to all pertinent local government regulations.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

It is imperative for the reader of this report to recognize that the company itself does not manufacture, distribute, or dispense any controlled substances, including cannabis, rather it develops proprietary technologies that are then licensed for use by certified and governmentally approved manufacturers. However, as is well known, US Federal regulations continue to consider Cannabis a schedule 1 drug, meaning that it has no currently accepted medical use in treatment, and thus illegal under Federal US laws. As such, the company could be deemed to be at variance with the Federal Controlled Substances Act.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of August 31, 2016, the Company had 2 employees, one of which was our Director Eyal Ballan, who, along with our administrative assistant were given monthly salaries. We do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future.
