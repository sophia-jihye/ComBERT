 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

Introduction 

Cedar Fair, L.P. (together with its affiliated companies, the "Partnership") is a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed in 1987 and managed by Cedar Fair Management, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "General Partner"), whose shares are held by an Ohio trust. The Partnership is one of the largest regional amusement park operators in the world and owns eleven amusement parks, three outdoor water parks, one indoor water park and five hotels. 

In 2015, the Partnership entertained more than 24 million visitors. All of the Partnership's parks are family-oriented, with recreational facilities for people of all ages, and provide clean and attractive environments with exciting rides and entertainment. The amusement parks include: Cedar Point, located on Lake Erie between Cleveland and Toledo in Sandusky, Ohio; Kings Island near Cincinnati, Ohio; Canada's Wonderland near Toronto, Canada; Dorney Park &#38; Wildwater Kingdom (&#8220;Dorney Park&#8221;), located near Allentown in South Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania; Valleyfair, located near Minneapolis/St. Paul in Shakopee, Minnesota; Michigan's Adventure located near Muskegon, Michigan; Kings Dominion located near Richmond, Virginia; Carowinds in Charlotte, North Carolina; Worlds of Fun located in Kansas City, Missouri; Knott's Berry Farm, located near Los Angeles in Buena Park, California; and California's Great America (&#8220;Great America&#8221;) located in Santa Clara, California. Additionally, the Partnership has a contract to manage and operate Gilroy Gardens Family Theme Park in Gilroy, California. 

The Partnership also owns and operates the Castaway Bay Indoor Waterpark Resort in Sandusky, Ohio, and three separately gated outdoor water parks. Two of the outdoor water parks are located adjacent to Cedar Point and Knott's Berry Farm, and the third is Wildwater Kingdom located near Cleveland in Aurora, Ohio. With limited exceptions, all rides and attractions at the amusement and water parks are owned and operated by the Partnership. 

The Partnership's seasonal amusement parks are generally open during weekends beginning in April or May, and then daily from Memorial Day until Labor Day, after which they are open during weekends in September and, in most cases, October. The three outdoor water parks also operate seasonally, generally from Memorial Day to Labor Day, plus some additional weekends before and after this period. As a result, virtually all of the operating revenues of these parks are generated during an approximately 130- to 140-day operating season. Knott's Berry Farm is open daily on a year-round basis. Castaway Bay is generally open daily from Memorial Day to Labor Day, plus a limited daily schedule for the balance of the year. Each park charges a basic daily admission price, which allows unlimited use of most rides and attractions. 

The demographic groups that are most important to the parks are young people ages 12 through 24 and families. Families are believed to be attracted by a combination of rides, live entertainment and the clean, wholesome atmosphere. Young people are believed to be attracted by the action-packed rides. During their operating season, the parks conduct active television, radio, newspaper and internet advertising campaigns in their major market areas geared toward these two groups.

&#32;5 

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL 

The Partnership believes that annual park attendance is influenced by the investment in new attractions from year to year. Capital expenditures are planned on a seasonal basis with the majority of such capital expenditures made in the period from October through May, prior to the beginning of the peak operating season. Capital expenditures made in a calendar year may differ materially from amounts identified with a particular operating season because of timing considerations such as weather conditions, site preparation requirements and availability of ride components, which may result in accelerated or delayed expenditures around calendar year-end. 

During the operating season, the Partnership carries significant receivables and inventories of food and merchandise, as well as payables and payroll-related accruals. Amounts are substantially reduced in non-operating periods. Seasonal working capital needs are funded with revolving credit facilities, which are established at levels sufficient to accommodate the Partnership's peak borrowing requirements in April and May as the seasonal parks complete preparations for opening. Revolving credit borrowings are reduced daily with the Partnership's positive cash flow during the seasonal operating period. 

COMPETITION 

In general, the Partnership competes for discretionary spending with all aspects of the recreation industry within its primary market areas, including several destination and regional amusement parks. The Partnership also competes with other forms of entertainment and recreational activities, including movies, sports events, restaurants and vacation travel. 

The principal competitive factors in the amusement park industry include the uniqueness and perceived quality of the rides and attractions in a particular park, its proximity to metropolitan areas, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the park, and the quality and variety of the food and entertainment available. The Partnership believes that its amusement parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, restaurants, gift shops and family atmosphere to make them highly competitive with other parks and forms of entertainment. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

The Partnership's properties and operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Currently, the Partnership believes it is in substantial compliance with applicable requirements under these laws and regulations. However, such requirements have generally become more strict over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to its properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future. 

All rides are operated and inspected daily by both the Partnership's maintenance and ride operations personnel before being put into operation. The parks are also periodically inspected by the Partnership's insurance carrier and, at all parks except Michigan&#8217;s Adventure, Valleyfair, Worlds of Fun, and Carowinds' South Carolina rides, by state or county ride-safety inspectors. Valleyfair, Worlds of Fun and Carowinds each contract with a third party to inspect its rides pursuant to Minnesota, Missouri, and South Carolina law, respectively, and submit the third-party report to the respective state agency. Michigan&#8217;s Adventure also contracts an outside third party to inspect their rides even though there is no Michigan law requirement. Additionally, all parks have added ride maintenance and operation inspections done by third party qualified inspectors to make sure our standards are being maintained. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES 

The Partnership has approximately 1,900 full-time employees. During the operating season, the Partnership employs in aggregate approximately 37,800 seasonal and part-time employees, many of whom are high school and college students. Approximately 6,400 of Cedar Point's seasonal employees, 400 of Valleyfair's seasonal employees, and 300 of Kings Dominion's seasonal employees live in dormitories owned by the Partnership. The Partnership maintains training programs for all new employees and believes that its relations with its employees are good.
