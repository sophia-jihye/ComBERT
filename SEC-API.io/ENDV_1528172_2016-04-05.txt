PART I 

Overview 

Endonovo Therapeutics, Inc., formerly called &#147;Hanover Portfolio Acquisitions, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;ENDV&#148; &#147;we&#148; &#147;us&#148; &#147;our&#148;) was comprised of two business segments: (1) a debt portfolio management company and (2) an intellectual property management and commercialization company. In 2013 we discontinued our efforts in debt portfolio management and initially concentrated in intellectual property development. Based on our assessment of the viability of our acquired technologies we transitioned to be a biotechnology company, particularly in the medical device and regenerative medicine industries. Our present primary focus is the development, patenting and regulatory approval of our biomedical proprietary technology.

Our former debt portfolio management segment purchased defaulted, unsecured, consumer receivables in the secondary market and generated revenue through collections utilizing an outsourced collection network and through the strategic resale of portfolios. This segment acquired credit-card receivable portfolios at significant discounts to the total amounts owed by the debtors. Defaulted consumer receivable portfolios that include charged-off credit card receivables are accounts that have been written-off by the originators. We purchased defaulted consumer receivable portfolios from creditors and others through privately negotiated direct sales. Our results depended upon our ability to purchase and collect a sufficient volume of our consumer receivables to generate revenue that exceeds our costs.

Our intellectual property management and commercialization segment was operated through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IP Resources International, Inc. (&#147;IPR&#148;). IPR focused primarily on licensing various commercially desirable technologies and patents from companies that need operating capital or that need help commercializing their technology and sublicense such technology in designated territories. This segment acquires exclusive licenses for marketable technology normally without the payment of any upfront license fee to the licensor and thereafter, to sub-license the technology in the designated markets, including Asia, Europe, and Brazil. Our results depend upon our ability to locate available, licensable, and readily marketable technology, to negotiate favorable licenses for such technology, and to sub-license the technology in the designated markets at a sufficient level of volume in an effort to generate maximum revenues. Due to the history of our acquisitions, as set forth below, and management&#146;s assessment of what has been the most promising of our technologies, we have determine to focus ourselves as a developer of biotechnology, particularly in regenerative medicine. We are in the development of a device utilizing a proprietary TVEMF technology which is presently our primary focus.

Our subsidiary, IPR, established a portfolio of companies. Currently it has licensing and marketing agreements with two companies:

a) CPaiR, Inc., a California corporation (&#147;CPaiR&#148;), which has a technology that facilitates the safe and effective performance of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.

b) American CryoStem Corp., a Nevada corporation (&#147;ACS&#148;), which has technology that permits the harvesting and storage of adult stem cells for later medical usage by the individual from whom the stem cells are harvested.

However, these technologies, while promising to varying degrees are not our present primary focus. 

Corporate History 

Our predecessor company, Hanover Asset Management, Inc. was incorporated in November 2008 in California. For the purpose of reincorporating in Delaware, we merged with a newly incorporated successor company, Hanover Portfolio Acquisitions, Inc., in July 2011 under which we continue to operate as a debt portfolio management company.

IP Resources International, Inc. began operations on September 1, 2011 and was formally incorporated on October 17, 2011.

Reverse Acquisition 

On March 14, 2012, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (&#147;Agreement&#148;) with IPR and certain of its shareholders. Under the Agreement, each participating IPR shareholder exchanged all of their issued and outstanding IPR common shares totaling 33,234,294, free and clear of all liens, and $155,000 for Company common shares equal to 1.2342 times the number of IPR shares being transferred to the Company for a total of 410,177 of our shares. The $155,000 was not paid at closing. The Company recorded the $155,000 as acquisition payable. IPR agreed to make payments of up to 25% of the proceeds from any private placement or gross profits earned by IPR until the obligation is satisfied. The percentage of the proceeds to be paid is at the sole discretion of IPR&#146;s Chief Executive Officer and the ex-Chief Executive Officer of the Company based on the liquidity of the Company.

As a result of the Agreement, the former shareholders of IPR, immediately post acquisition owned approximately 89% of the Company and its officers and directors constituted the majority of the officers and directors of the Company. Since the shareholders, offices and directors of IPR have control of the Company, the acquisitions constitutes a reverse acquisition, so IPR was the accounting acquirer and we were the accounting acquiree. For accounting purposes, IPR became the parent and we became a wholly owned subsidiary. For legal purposes, we are the legal parent and IPR is the legal subsidiary.

Acquisition of Aviva Companies Corporation 

On April 2, 2013, the Company entered into an Acquisition Agreement (the &#147;Acquisition Agreement&#148;) with (i) The Aviva Companies Corporation (&#147;Aviva&#148;) and (ii) all of the shareholders of Aviva (the &#147;Shareholders&#148;) pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Aviva in exchange for the issuance of 60,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share to the Shareholders (the &#147;Share Exchange&#148;). As a result of the Share Exchange, Aviva became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Other than in respect to the transaction, there is no material relationship among Aviva&#146;s stockholders and any of the Company&#146;s affiliates, directors or officers. We are not currently actively pursuing the development of the Aviva Companies Corporation.

Acquisition of WeHealAnimals, Inc. 

On November 16, 2013, the Company entered into an Acquisition Agreement (the &#147;Acquisition Agreement&#148;) with (i) WeHealAnimals ,Inc. (&#147;WHA&#148;) and (ii) the sole shareholder of WHA (the &#147;Shareholder&#148;) pursuant to which the 

Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of WHA in exchange for the issuance of 3,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share and $96,000 to the Shareholder (the &#147;Share Exchange&#148;). As a result of the Share Exchange, WHA became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and all of the equity of WHA including its and its sole shareholder&#146;s intellectual property became the property of the Company. This obligation was fully paid on December 15, 2015 through the issuance of 350,000 shares of stock to Mr. Rudd. WHA is a Nevada corporation with intellectual property in the fields of bio-technology including its biologics and time-varying electromagnetic frequencies with potential applications on people and animals that management believes can be developed to the benefit of the Company and its shareholders. WHA&#146;s sole shareholder was formerly Chairman and Chief Scientist of Regenetech, Inc. Regenetech was acquired by a company that wanted its technology, biomolecules grown in microgravity, for use in cosmetics. WHA&#146;s sole shareholder left Regenetech with exclusive rights to this TVEMF technology and stem cell technologies, including the patents and patent applications relating thereto. 

Other than in respect to the transaction, there is no material relationship between WHA&#146;s sole stockholder and any of the Company&#146;s affiliates, directors or officers.

Present Development Plans 

We now are a biotechnology company developing bioelectronic devices and cell therapies for regenerative medicine. We are currently developing two platforms that utilize our core technologies, Time-Varying Electromagnetic Fields (TVEMF). Our Immunotronics platform is a non-implantable, non-invasive bioelectronic device that we are developing to target inflammatory conditions in vital organs. Our initial concentration is developing our Immunotronics platform for the treatment of inflammatory conditions in the liver, such as acute liver injury. Our second platform is Cytotronics, which uses our Time-Varying Electromagnetic Field (TVEMF) technology for the creation of cell-based therapies. Our initial concentration is on the development of a cell-based treatment for Graft-Versus-Host Disease.

Immunotronics Platform: 

Our Immunotronics platform uses Time-Varying Electromagnetic Field (TVEMF) technology to create a non-implantable, non-invasive bioelectronic device. These bioelectronics devices are also commonly referred to as "electroceuticals." 

These products are part of an emerging field termed "Bioelectronic Medicine," that seeks to harness electrical signals in nerves and cells to alter the course of diseases and conditions. Whereas our competitors are primarily using implantable electrical stimulators, we are developing devices that are not implantable and use electromagnetic pulses to deliver electrical stimulation to cells and nerves.

We are developing these bioelectronic devices for the treatment of inflammatory conditions in vital organs, such as the human liver. The Company is currently in the process of commencing its pre-clinical studies to assess the effectiveness of its technology in treating acute inflammation in the liver using a rodent model. 

Cytotronics Platform : 

Our Cytotronics platform uses our Time-Varying Electromagnetic Field (TVEMF) technology to expand and enhance the biological properties of stem cells for the creation of cell based therapies. Our platform builds upon the original work conducted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) using TVEMF technology for the expansion of stem cells and expands this work to the development of cell based therapies. Our initial concentration is on the development of our proprietary cell therapy that is created using the co-culture of stem cells from the human umbilical cord with adipose-derived stem cells to create a cell mixture that displays neither class I nor class II cell-surface major histocompatibility markers (MHC -/-) and can be administered without a tissue match. We are initially seeking to develop this cell therapy for the treatment of Graft-Versus-Host Disease.

Graft-Versus-Host Disease: 

Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) is a complication that can occur following a stem cell, bone marrow or tissue transplant. In GVHD, the newly transplanted donor cells attack the transplant recipient's body. GVHD does not occur when a patient receives his/her own cells during a transplant. Therefore, GVHD is associated with allogeneic transplants, requiring that tissue and cells from possible donors be checked to see how closely they match the person 

having the transplant. GVHD is less likely to occur, or the symptoms milder, when the tissue match is closer. GVHD is a very rare condition that affects fewer than 20,000 persons in the US per year. 

Intellectual Property: 

We will continue to strengthen our portfolio of intellectual property by filing additional patents around uses of our core technologies, such as Time-Varying Electromagnetic Fields (TVEMF). We will continue to develop applications of our technologies that we may license out to our competitors in the drug/pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. To date, we have filed four patent applications covering our Time-Varying Electromagnetic Field (TVEMF) technology, the production of biomolecules, the creation of an allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell product and a method of expanding cord blood stem cells. 

Our business strategy is aimed at building value by positioning each of our technologies and therapies to treat specific diseases that lack effective treatment or whose current standard of treatment involves invasive procedures and/or potentially harmful side effects. We anticipate updating and refining the business strategy as new medical and/or clinical advancements are made as a result of extensive research and development. In general, the component functions of the business model are to:

&#183;

Internationally license stem cell expansion technologies;

&#183;

License technologies for the production of biomolecules;

&#183;

Develop medical indications for our Immunotronics device;

&#183;

Develop other non-invasive, medical technologies;

&#183;

Develop cell-based therapies for distribution and use;

&#183;

Conduct pre-clinical and clinical human studies for FDA Approval of our medical devices and cell therapies;

&#183;

Acquire subsidiaries under the parent company, Endonovo Therapeutics, to assist in the development and distribution of medical technologies; 

&#183;

Incrementally invest, market, and refine acquired and developed medical technologies and therapies.

Biotechnology Licensing 

We will seek revenue by licensing certain technologies developed by WHA for the expansion of stem cells, which we believe will allow both researchers and for-profit companies to grow difficult to expand stem cells, including hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, we will seek to license certain technologies for the production of biomolecules for research purposes and for the development of biologics. Licensing is a particularly attractive opportunity for the Company because of the few costs associated with signing licensing agreements. By licensing WHA's technologies, a net profit margin of 80% to 90% maybe achievable. However, we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to enter any profitable licenses and the entry into any license may require that we first receive FDA approval for our products.

Industry Overview 

Regenerative Medicine 

The regenerative medicine/tissue engineering industry is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field involving the life, physical and engineering sciences and seeking to develop clinical therapies for the repair, maintenance, replacement and/or enhancement of biological function. Regenerative medicine has a wide area of applications, such as musculoskeletal diseases, cardiovascular, neurology, orthopedic, and other disorders. The regenerative medicine industry is now regarded as having begun with the advent of cell culture in the very early part of the twentieth century, and continues to advance as technological advancements have been made.

The regenerative medicine industry is driven by several technological advancements in stem cell therapy and tissue engineering therapy. The regenerative medicine market is expected to grow to a value of US$6.5 billion by 2019 from a value of US$2.6 billion in 2012, according to Transparency Market Research.

The global stem cell market, which is a segment of the regenerative medicine market is forecast to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 39.5% from 2015-2020, to reach a value of US$330 million by 2020, according to MarketsandMarkets. North America is expected to hold the largest share of this market due to extensive government funding and increased fast-track approvals for stem cell therapeutics by the FDA.

Competition 

The biotech and regenerative therapy industry is capital intensive and highly competitive and many of our competitors have far greater assets than we have presently and will have even if all of the funding possibly available to us under the EPA is realized. We will seek to compete by establishing the uniqueness, efficacy and other advantages of the TVEMF device and the therapies based upon it.

Our competitors in the cell therapy market segment have years of research into their products including human clinical data, access to government sponsored research and grants and have more capital at their disposal.

Furthermore, our treatment for Graft-Versus-Host Disease may be limited by the FDA Approval of a competing cell therapy under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, which grants 7-year market exclusivity to a product approved for an rare disease. This would require us to demonstrate that our cell therapy is therapeutically superior, when compared to the present drug indicated for the rare disease of interest. Therefore, the FDA approval of a competing drug and/or cell therapy for the treatment of Graft-Versus-Host Disease would greatly limit the Company's ability to pursue this indication. There are currently many competitors seeking to develop drugs or cell therapies for the treatment of GVHD at various stages of development from pre-clinical to Phase III clinical trials.

Employees 

We do not have any employees. However, we have retained approximately 10 individuals as independent contractors that are involved in business development and administrative functions.
