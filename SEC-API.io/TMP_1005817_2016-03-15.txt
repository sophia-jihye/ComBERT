The Company is a locally oriented, community-based financial services organization that offers a full array of products and services, including commercial and consumer banking, leasing, trust and investment management, financial planning and wealth management, and insurance. At December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries included: four wholly-owned banking subsidiaries, Tompkins Trust Company (the &#8220;Trust Company&#8221;), The Bank of Castile (DBA Tompkins Bank of Castile), Mahopac Bank (formerly known as Mahopac National Bank, DBA Tompkins Mahopac Bank), VIST Bank (DBA Tompkins VIST Bank); and a wholly-owned insurance agency subsidiary, Tompkins Insurance Agencies, Inc. (&#8220;Tompkins Insurance&#8221;). The Trust Company provides a full array of trust and investment services under the Tompkins Financial Advisors brand, including investment management, trust and estate, financial and tax planning as well as life, disability and long-term care insurance services. The Company&#8217;s principal offices are located at The Commons, Ithaca, New York, 14851, and its telephone number is (888) 503-5753.

&#160;

Tompkins was organized in 1995, under the laws of the State of New York, as a bank holding company for the Trust Company, a commercial bank that has operated in Ithaca, New York and surrounding communities since 1836. Information relating to revenues, profit and loss, and total assets for the Company&#8217;s three business segments - banking, insurance, and wealth management - is incorporated herein by reference to Part II, Item 8. of this Report.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s strategic initiatives include diversification within its markets, growth of its fee-based businesses, and growth internally and through acquisitions of financial institutions, branches, and financial services businesses. As such, the Company from time to time considers acquiring banks, thrift institutions, branch offices of banks or thrift institutions, or other businesses within markets currently served by the Company or in other locations that would complement the Company&#8217;s business or its geographic reach. The Company generally targets merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale and expanded services. The Company has pursued acquisition opportunities in the past, and continues to review new opportunities. The Company&#39;s most recent material acquisition was its 2012 acquisition of VIST Financial, a financial holding company headquartered in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, and parent to VIST Bank, VIST Insurance, LLC (&#34;VIST Insurance&#34;), and VIST Capital Management, LLC (&#34;VIST Capital Management&#34;).

&#160;

Although Tompkins is a corporate entity, legally separate and distinct from its affiliates, bank holding companies such as Tompkins are generally required to act as a source of financial strength for their banking subsidiaries. Tompkins&#8217; principal source of income is dividends from its subsidiaries. There are certain regulatory restrictions on the extent to which these subsidiaries can pay dividends or otherwise supply funds to Tompkins. See the section &#8220;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; for further details.

&#160;

Narrative Description of Business 

&#160;

Information about the Company&#8217;s business segments are included in &#8220;Note 22 Segment and Related Information&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Report. The Company has identified three business segments, consisting of banking, insurance and wealth management.

&#160;

Banking services consist primarily of attracting deposits from the areas served by the Company&#8217;s four banking subsidiaries&#8217; 63 banking offices (44 offices in New York and 19 offices in Pennsylvania), and using those deposits to originate a variety of commercial loans, agricultural loans, consumer loans, real estate loans, and leases in those same areas. The Company&#8217;s lending function is managed within the guidelines of a comprehensive Board-approved lending policy. Policies and procedures are reviewed on a regular basis. Reporting systems are in place to provide management with ongoing information related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans. The Company has an independent third party loan review process that reviews and validates the risk identification and assessment made by the lenders and credit personnel. The results of these reviews are presented to the Board of Directors of each of the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries, and the Company&#8217;s Audit Committee.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s principal expenses are interest on deposits, interest on borrowings, and operating and general administrative expenses, as well as provisions for loan and lease losses. Funding sources, other than deposits, include borrowings, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and cash flow from lending and investing activities. The Company&#8217;s principal sources of income include interest income on loans and securities.

&#160;

The Company maintains a portfolio of securities such as obligations of U.S. government agencies and U.S. government sponsored entities, obligations of states and political subdivisions thereof, and equity securities. Management typically invests in securities with short to intermediate average lives in order to better match the interest rate sensitivities of its assets and liabilities. Investment decisions are made within policy guidelines established by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors. The investment policy is based on the asset/liability management goals of the Company, and is monitored by the Company&#8217;s Asset/Liability Management Committee. The intent of the policy is to establish a portfolio of high quality diversified securities, which optimizes net interest income within safety and liquidity limits deemed acceptable by the Asset/Liability Management Committee.

&#160;

Tompkins Insurance Agencies Inc. was formed in 2001, resulting from an acquisition.

Over the years, Tompkins Insurance has acquired smaller insurance agencies in the market areas serviced by the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries and successfully consolidated them into Tompkins Insurance. The VIST Financial acquisition in 2012, which included VIST Insurance, nearly doubled the Company&#8217;s annual insurance revenues. Tompkins Insurance offers services to customers of the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries by sharing offices with The Bank of Castile, Trust Company, and VIST Bank. In addition to these shared offices, Tompkins Insurance has five stand-alone offices in Western New York, two stand-alone offices in Tompkins County, New York and one stand-alone office in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Competition for commercial banking and other financial services is strong in the Company&#8217;s market areas. In one or more aspects of its business, the Company&#8217;s subsidiaries compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, Internet-based financial services companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries. Some of these competitors have substantially greater resources and lending capabilities and may offer services that the Company does not currently provide. In addition, many of the Company&#8217;s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive Federal regulations that govern financial holding companies and Federally-insured banks.

&#160;

Competition among financial institutions is based upon interest rates offered on deposit accounts, interest rates charged on loans and other credit and service charges, the quality and scope of the services rendered the convenience of facilities and, in the case of loans to commercial borrowers, relative lending limits. Management believes that a community based financial organization is better positioned to establish personalized financial relationships with both commercial customers and individual households. The Company&#8217;s community commitment and involvement in its primary market areas, as well as its commitment to quality and personalized financial services, are factors that contribute to the Company&#8217;s competitiveness. Management believes that each of the Company&#8217;s subsidiary banks can compete successfully in its primary market areas by making prudent lending decisions quickly and more efficiently than its competitors, without compromising asset quality or profitability, although no assurances can be given that such factors will assure success.

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

Regulatory Agencies 

As a registered financial holding company, the Company is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 as amended (&#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), and is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve Board (&#8220;FRB&#8221;). The Company is also subject to the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and is subject to disclosure and regulatory requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Securities Act&#8221;), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). The Company&#8217;s common stock is traded on the NYSE MKT LLC under the Symbol &#8220;TMP&#8221; and is subject to the rules of the NYSE MKT LLC for listed companies.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by various regulatory authorities, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), the New York State Department of Financial Services (&#8220;NYSDFS&#8221;), and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (&#8220;PDBS&#8221;). Each of these agencies issues regulations and requires the filing of reports describing the activities and financial condition of the entities under its jurisdiction. Likewise, such agencies conduct examinations on a recurring basis to evaluate the safety and soundness of the institutions, and to test compliance with various regulatory requirements, including: consumer protection, privacy, fair lending, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, sales of non-deposit investments, electronic data processing, and trust department activities.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s wealth management subsidiary is subject to examination and regulation by various regulatory agencies, including the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;). The trust division of Tompkins Trust Company is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the FDIC and NYSDFS.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s insurance subsidiary is subject to examination and regulation by the NYSDFS and the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.

&#160;

Federal Home Loan Bank System 

The Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are also members of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;), which provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions for home mortgage and neighborhood lending. The Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are subject to the rules and requirements of the FHLB, including the requirement to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to the sum of 0.35% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year, up to a maximum of $25.0 million. The Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries were in compliance with FHLB rules and requirements as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Regulatory Reform 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), which was enacted in July 2010, has significantly changed the financial regulatory landscape in the United States. Many of the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s provisions are subject to final rulemaking by the U.S. financial regulatory agencies. While many of the regulations that directly affect the Company&#8217;s businesses have been adopted, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act will depend to a large extent on how such rules are phased-in and implemented by the primary U.S. financial regulatory agencies. The Company continues to analyze the impact of rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company&#8217;s businesses. However, the full impact will not be known until the rules, and other regulatory initiatives that overlap with the rules are finalized and their combined impacts can be understood. Because the Company has total consolidated assets of less than $50 billion, the Company will be exempt from certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which pertain only to larger institutions.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessment, as discussed in greater detail below. The legislation also contained provisions impacting publicly-traded companies generally, such as requirements that companies give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments, and include numerous additional compensation-related disclosures in their proxy materials. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB and other federal banking regulators promulgated rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. The Dodd-Frank Act established a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. The Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with the rules of the CFPB, however these rules are enforced by our primary regulators, the FRB and the FDIC, not the CFPB.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act requires that any interchange transaction fee charged for a debit transaction be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction. FRB regulations mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act limit interchange fees on debit cards to a maximum of 21 cents per transaction plus 5 basis points of the transaction amount. Issuers that, together with their affiliates, have less than $10 billion of assets, such as the Company, are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards. However, FRB regulations prohibit all issuers, including the Company and its banking subsidiaries, from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to less than two unaffiliated networks.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act also required the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The statutory provision is commonly called the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; Compliance with the Volker Rule is generally required by July 21, 2017. The Volker Rule is not expected to have a material effect on the Company.

&#160;

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the FRB in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve Board), without prior approval of the FRB. Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. The Company is registered as a financial holding company.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

To maintain financial holding company status, a financial holding company and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed.&#8221; A depository institution subsidiary is considered to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it satisfies the requirements for this status discussed in the section captioned &#8220;Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action,&#8221; included elsewhere in this item. A depository institution subsidiary is considered &#8220;well managed&#8221; if it received a composite rating and management rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination. A financial holding company&#8217;s status will also depend upon it maintaining its status as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8217; under applicable FRB regulations. If a financial holding company ceases to meet these capital and management requirements, the FRB&#8217;s regulations provide that the financial holding company must enter into an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements. Until the financial holding company returns to compliance, the FRB may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of its activities, and the company may not commence any of the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or acquire a company engaged in such financial activities without prior approval of the FRB. If the company does not return to compliance within 180 days, the FRB may require divestiture of the holding company&#8217;s depository institutions. Bank holding companies and banks must also be both well capitalized and well managed in order to acquire banks located outside their home state.

&#160;

In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHC Act or to acquire a company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHC Act, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;). See the section captioned &#8220;Community Reinvestment Act&#8221; included elsewhere in this item.

&#160;

The FRB has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the FRB has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

&#160;

Share Repurchases and Dividends 

Under FRB regulations, the Company may not, without providing prior notice to the FRB, purchase or redeem its own common stock if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to ten percent or more of the Company&#8217;s consolidated net worth.

&#160;

FRB regulations provide that dividends shall not be paid except out of current earnings and unless the prospective rate of earnings retention by the Company appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Tompkins&#8217; primary source of funds to pay dividends on its common stock is dividends from its subsidiary banks. The subsidiary banks are subject to regulations that restrict the dividends that they may pay to Tompkins.

&#160;

Transactions with Affiliates and Other Related Parties 

There are Federal laws and regulations that govern transactions between the Company&#8217;s non-bank subsidiaries and its banking subsidiaries including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and related regulations. These laws establish certain quantitative limits and other prudent requirements for loans, purchases of assets, and certain other transactions between a member bank and its affiliates. In general, transactions between the banking subsidiaries and its non-bank subsidiaries must be on terms and conditions, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the banking subsidiaries as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions involving non-affiliated companies. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded the coverage and scope of the limitations on affiliate transactions within a banking organization.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O as promulgated by the FRB. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank&#8217;s capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank&#8217;s board of directors.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Mergers and Acquisitions 

The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for the direct or indirect acquisition by a bank holding company of more than 5.0% of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FRB or other appropriate bank regulatory authority is required for a member bank to merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant&#8217;s performance record under the CRA (see the section captioned &#8220;Community Reinvestment Act&#8221; included elsewhere in this item) and fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities.

&#160;

Support of Subsidiary Banks 

The Dodd-Frank Act codified the FRB&#8217;s longstanding policy of requiring bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks, as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, Tompkins is expected to commit resources to support its banking subsidiaries, including at times when it may not be advantageous for Tompkins to do so. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinated in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.

&#160;

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions 

FDIC-insured depository institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an FDIC-insured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company, or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to an FDIC-insured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company that is in danger of default. &#8220;Default&#8221; means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. &#8220;In danger of default&#8221; means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.

&#160;

Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action &#160;

In July 2013, the FRB approved and published the final Basel III Capital Rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 framework known as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions, including Tompkins, compared to the existing U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in banking institutions&#8217; regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach, which was derived from the Basel I capital accords of the Basel Committee, with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach in the Basel Committee&#8217;s 2004 &#8220;Basel II&#8221; capital accords. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies&#8217; rules. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for Tompkins on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period).

&#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules, among other things, (i) introduce a new capital measure called &#8220;Common Equity Tier 1&#8221; (&#8220;CET1&#8221;), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and &#8220;Additional Tier 1 capital&#8221; instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments as compared to existing regulations.

&#160;

Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the initial minimum capital ratios as of January 1, 2015 are as follows:

&#160;

&#183; 4.0% Tier 1 capital ratio to average consolidated assets (known as the &#8220;leverage ratio&#8221;) &#183; 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets; &#183; 6.0% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets; &#183; 8.0% Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets; and &#160;

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require Tompkins to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which when fully phased in, effectively results in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7%), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which when fully phased in, effectively results in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which when fully phased in, effectively results in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer&#8221; that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and is not expected to have any current applicability to Tompkins.

&#160;

The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.

&#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules impose stricter regulatory capital deductions from and adjustments to capital, with most deductions and adjustments taken against CET1 capital. These include, for example, the requirement that (i) mortgage servicing assets, net of associated deferred tax liabilities; (ii) deferred tax assets, which cannot be realized through net operating loss carrybacks, net of any relative valuation allowances and net of deferred tax liabilities; and (iii) significant investments (i.e. 10% or more ownership) in unconsolidated financial institutions be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% to CET1. Under the Basel III Capital Rule, the effect of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded, which could result in significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Company&#8217;s securities portfolio. Contained within the rule was a one-time option to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income in the capital calculation based upon asset size. Tompkins decided to opt out of this requirement in January 2015.

&#160;

The Basel III Capital Rules also require the phase-out of certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, as Tier 1 capital of bank holding companies in equal installments between 2013 and 2016. Trust preferred securities no longer included in Tier 1 capital may nonetheless be included as a component of Tier 2 capital. However, because the trust preferred securities of Tompkins were issued prior to May 19, 2010, and because Tompkins&#8217; total consolidated assets were less than $15.0 billion as of December 31, 2009, our trust preferred securities are permanently grandfathered under the final rule and may continue to be included as Tier 1 capital.

&#160;

Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and will be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).

&#160;

In addition, the Basel III Capital Rules provide more advantageous risk weights for derivatives and repurchase-style transactions cleared through a qualifying central counterparty and increase the scope of eligible guarantors and eligible collateral for purposes of credit risk mitigation.

&#160;

The Standardized Approach Proposal expands the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I-derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories, including many residential mortgages and certain commercial real estate. Specifics include, among other things:

&#160;

&#160; - &#160; Applying a 150% risk weight instead of a 100% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans. &#160;

&#160; - &#160; For residential mortgage exposures, the current approach of a 50% risk weight for high-quality seasoned mortgages and a 100% risk-weight for all other mortgages is replaced with a risk weight of between 35% and 200% depending upon the mortgage&#8217;s loan-to-value ratio and whether the mortgage is a &#8220;category 1&#8221; or &#8220;category 2&#8221; residential mortgage exposure (based on eight criteria that include the term, use of negative amortization, balloon payments and certain rate increases). &#160;

&#160; - &#160; Assigning a 150% risk weight to exposures (other than residential mortgage exposures) that are 90 days past due. &#160;

&#160; - &#160; Providing for a 20% credit conversion factor for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable (currently set at 0%). &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; - &#160; Providing for a risk weight, generally not less than 20% with certain exceptions, for securities lending transactions based on the risk weight category of the underlying collateral securing the transaction. &#160;

&#160; - &#160; Providing for a 100% risk weight for claims on securities firms. &#160;

&#160; - &#160; Eliminating the current 50% cap on the risk weight for OTC derivatives. &#160;

With respect to the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries, the Basel III Capital Rules revised the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; (&#8220;PCA&#8221;) regulations adopted pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA, by: (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each PCA category (other than critically undercapitalized), with the required CET1 ratio being 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category, with the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status being 8% (as compared to 6%); and (iii) eliminating the provision that permitted a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 and a 3% leverage ratio to be considered adequately capitalized. The Capital Rules did not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any PCA category.

&#160;

Management believes that the Company is in compliance, and will continue to be in compliance, with the targeted capital ratios as such requirements are phased in.

&#160;

For further information concerning the regulatory capital requirements, actual capital amounts and the ratios of Tompkins and its bank subsidiaries, see the discussion in &#8220;Note 20 - Regulations and Supervision&#8221; in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. of this Report.

&#160;

Deposit Insurance 

Substantially all of the deposits of the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per deposit category, per depositor, per institution retroactive to January 1, 2008.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries pay deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC based on assessment rates established by the FDIC. The assessment rates are based upon the risk the institution poses to the Deposit Insurance Fund, or DIF. Under this assessment system, risk is defined and measured using an institution&#8217;s supervisory ratings with other risk measures, including financial ratios. The current total base assessment rates on an annualized basis range from 2.5 basis points for certain &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;well-managed&#8221; banks, with the highest ratings, to 45 basis points for institutions posing the most risk to the DIF. The FDIC may raise or lower these assessment rates on a quarterly basis based on various factors to achieve a reserve ratio, which the Dodd-Frank Act has mandated to be no less than 1.35 percent of insured deposits. In 2011, the FDIC redefined the deposit insurance assessment base to equal average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity as required by the Dodd-Frank Act.

&#160;

FDIC insurance expense totaled $3.0 million, $2.9 million and $3.2 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. FDIC insurance expense includes deposit insurance assessments, assessments related to participation in the Temporary Liquidity Guaranty Program (&#8220;TLGP&#8221;) program, and Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) assessments related to outstanding FICO bonds. FICO is a mixed-ownership government corporation established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct Federal Savings &#38; Loan Insurance Corporation. The Company paid FICO assessments of $288,000 in 2015, $282,000 in 2014, and $286,000 in 2013.

&#160;

Depositor Preference 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the &#8220;liquidation or other resolution&#8221; of an insured depository, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC, as subrogee of the insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institutions.

&#160;

Community Reinvestment Act 

The Company&#8217;s subsidiary banks are subject to the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) and to certain fair lending and reporting requirements that relate to home mortgage lending. The CRA requires the federal banking regulators to assess the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of the local communities, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank. The federal agencies consider an institution&#8217;s performance under the CRA in evaluating applications for mergers and acquisitions, and new offices. The ratings assigned by the federal agencies are publicly disclosed. As of December 31, 2015 the Company&#8217;s subsidiary banks all had ratings of satisfactory or better.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of corporate governance, accounting and reporting requirements for companies that have securities registered under the Exchange Act. These requirements include: (1) requirements for audit committees, including independence and financial expertise; (2) certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the reporting company; (3) standards for auditors and regulation of audits; (4) disclosure and reporting requirements for the reporting company and directors and executive officers; and (5) a range of civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of securities laws.

&#160;

The USA Patriot Act 

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (&#8220;USA Patriot Act&#8221;) imposes obligations on financial institutions, including banks and broker-dealer subsidiaries to implement policies, procedures and controls which are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.

&#160;

Financial Privacy 

In accordance with the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to non-affiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a non-affiliated third party. These provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.

&#160;

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are known as the &#8220;OFAC&#8221; rules based on their administration by the US Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;). The OFAC-administered sanctions take many forms. Generally, however, they include restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country and a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest.

&#160;

Consumer Protection Laws 

In connection with their lending and leasing activities, the Company&#8217;s banking subsidiaries are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transaction Act of 2003, the Truth in Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and similar laws at the State level.

&#160;

On January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule implementing the ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage (QM) provisions of the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;QM Rule&#8221;). The QM Rule provides that a lender making a special type of loan, known as a Qualified Mortgage, is entitled to presume that the loan complies with the ATR safe harbor requirements. The QM Rule establishes different types of Qualified Mortgages that are generally identified as loans with restriction on loan features, limits or fees being changed and underwriting requirements. The QM Rule is effective for loan applications taken on or after January 1, 2014.

&#160;

Cybersecurity 

In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution&#8217;s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution&#8217;s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In the ordinary course of business, Tompkins relies on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. Tompkins employs an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. Tompkins employs a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to date, Tompkins has not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of risks related to cybersecurity.

&#160;

Incentive Compensation 

The Dodd-Frank Act required the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, such as the Company, having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in 2011, but the regulations have not been finalized. Officials from the FRB have recently indicated that the U.S. banking regulators are in the process of preparing for public comment a new rule on incentive compensation. If these or other regulations are adopted in a form similar to that initially proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which the Company may structure compensation for its executives. Given the uncertainty at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted, management cannot determine the potential impact on the Company.

&#160;

In 2010, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization&#8217;s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization&#8217;s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization&#8217;s board of directors. Management believes the current and past compensation practices of the Company do not encourage excessive risk taking or undermine the safety and soundness of the organization.

&#160;

The FRB will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as the Company, that are not &#8220;large, complex banking organizations.&#8221; These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization&#8217;s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization&#8217;s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

&#160;

Other Legislative Initiatives 

From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory authorities. These initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to change the financial institution regulatory environment. Such legislation could change banking laws and the operating environment of Tompkins in substantial, but unpredictable ways. We cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations would have on our financial condition or results of operations. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Company had 1,038 employees, approximately 117 of whom were part-time. No employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and the Company believes its employee relations are excellent.

&#160;
