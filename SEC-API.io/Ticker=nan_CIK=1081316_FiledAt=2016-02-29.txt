PACIFICORP &#32; 

General 

PacifiCorp, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, is a United States regulated electric utility company headquartered in Oregon that serves 1.8 million &#32;retail electric customers in portions of Utah, Oregon, Wyoming, Washington, Idaho and California. PacifiCorp is principally engaged in the business of generating, transmitting, distributing and selling electricity. PacifiCorp's combined service territory covers approximately 143,000 square miles and includes diverse regional economies across six states. No single segment of the economy dominates the service territory, which helps mitigate PacifiCorp's exposure to economic fluctuations. In the eastern portion of the service territory, consisting of Utah, Wyoming and southeastern Idaho, the principal industries are manufacturing, mining or extraction of natural resources, agriculture, technology, recreation and government. In the western portion of the service territory, consisting of Oregon, southern Washington and northern California, the principal industries are agriculture, manufacturing, forest products, food processing, technology, government and primary metals. In addition to retail sales, PacifiCorp buys and sells electricity on the wholesale market with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants to balance and optimize the economic benefits of electricity generation, retail customer loads and existing wholesale transactions. PacifiCorp's subsidiaries support its electric utility operations by providing coal mining services. 

PacifiCorp's operations are conducted under numerous franchise agreements, certificates, permits and licenses obtained from federal, state and local authorities. The average term of the franchise agreements is approximately 27 years, although their terms range from five years to indefinite. Several of these franchise agreements allow the municipality the right to seek amendment to the franchise agreement at a specified time during the term. PacifiCorp generally has an exclusive right to serve electric customers within its service territories and, in turn, has an obligation to provide electric service to those customers. In return, the state utility commissions have established rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow PacifiCorp an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its investments. 

PacifiCorp's principal executive offices are located at 825 N.E. Multnomah Street, Portland, Oregon 97232, and its telephone number is (503) 813 - 5645. PacifiCorp was initially incorporated in 1910 under the laws of the state of Maine under the name Pacific Power &#38; Light Company. In 1984, Pacific Power &#38; Light Company changed its name to PacifiCorp. In 1989, it merged with Utah Power and Light Company, a Utah corporation, in a transaction wherein both corporations merged into a newly formed Oregon corporation. The resulting Oregon corporation was re-named PacifiCorp, which is the operating entity today. PacifiCorp delivers electricity to customers in Utah, Wyoming and Idaho under the trade name Rocky Mountain Power and to customers in Oregon, Washington and California under the trade name Pacific Power. 

BHE controls substantially all of PacifiCorp's voting securities, which include both common and preferred stock.

Changes in economic and weather conditions, as well as various conservation, energy efficiency and customer self-generation measures and programs, impact PacifiCorp's customer usage. 

The annual hourly peak customer demand, which represents the highest demand on a given day and at a given hour, is typically highest in the summer across PacifiCorp's service territory when air conditioning and irrigation systems are heavily used. The service territory also has a winter peak, which is primarily due to heating requirements in the western portion of PacifiCorp's service territory. During 2015 , PacifiCorp's peak demand was 10,621 MW in the summer and 8,550 MW in the winter.

All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with generation from these generating facilities and purchases may be: (a) used in future years to comply with RPS or other regulatory requirements, (b) sold to third parties in the form of RECs or other environmental commodities, or (c) excluded from energy purchased. 

PacifiCorp is required to have resources available to continuously meet its customer needs. The percentage of PacifiCorp's energy supplied by energy source varies from year to year and is subject to numerous operational and economic factors such as planned and unplanned outages, fuel commodity prices, fuel transportation costs, weather, environmental considerations, transmission constraints, and wholesale market prices of electricity. PacifiCorp evaluates these factors continuously in order to facilitate economical dispatch of its generating facilities. When factors for one energy source are less favorable, PacifiCorp must place more reliance on other energy sources. For example, PacifiCorp can generate more electricity using its low cost hydroelectric and wind-powered generating facilities when factors associated with these facilities are favorable. When factors associated with hydroelectric and wind resources are less favorable, PacifiCorp increases its reliance on coal- and natural gas-fueled generation or purchased electricity. In addition to meeting its customers' energy needs, PacifiCorp is required to maintain operating reserves on its system to mitigate the impacts of unplanned outages or other disruption in supply, and to meet intra-hour changes in load and resource balance. This operating reserve requirement is dispersed across PacifiCorp's generation portfolio on a least-cost basis based on the operating characteristics of the portfolio. Operating reserves may be held on hydroelectric, coal-fueled or natural gas-fueled resources. PacifiCorp manages certain risks relating to its supply of electricity and fuel requirements by entering into various contracts, which may be accounted for as derivatives and may include forwards, options, swaps and other agreements. Refer to "General Regulation" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of energy cost recovery by jurisdiction and to PacifiCorp's Item 7A in this Form 10-K for a discussion of commodity price risk and derivative contracts. 

Coal 

PacifiCorp has interests in coal mines that support its coal-fueled generating facilities and operates the Bridger surface and Bridger underground coal mines. In 2015, PacifiCorp idled the Deer Creek underground coal mine that historically served the Huntington, Hunter and Carbon generating facilities and commenced reclamation activities. These mines supplied 18%, 27% and 31% of PacifiCorp's total coal requirements during the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The remaining coal requirements are acquired through long- and short-term third-party contracts. PacifiCorp also operates the Wyodak Coal Crushing Facility. PacifiCorp sold the Cottonwood Preparatory Plant and the Fossil Rock coal reserves to a third party in June 2015. Refer to "Regulatory Matters" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these transactions and the Deer Creek mine closure. 

&#32;5 

Most of PacifiCorp's coal reserves are held pursuant to leases through the federal Bureau of Land Management and from certain states and private parties. The leases generally have multi-year terms that may be renewed or extended only with the consent of the lessor and require payment of rents and royalties. In addition, federal and state regulations require that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of mining operations and upon completion of mining activities. 

Coal reserve estimates are subject to adjustment as a result of the development of additional engineering and geological data, new mining technology and changes in regulation and economic factors affecting the utilization of such reserves. PacifiCorp's recoverable coal reserves of operating mines as of December 31, 2015 , based on recent engineering studies, were as follows (in millions):

(1) 

These coal reserves are leased and mined by Bridger Coal Company, a joint venture between Pacific Minerals, Inc. and a subsidiary of Idaho Power Company. Pacific Minerals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of PacifiCorp, has a two-thirds interest in the joint venture. The amounts included above represent only PacifiCorp's two-thirds interest in the coal reserves. 

(2) 

These coal reserves are leased and mined by Trapper Mining Inc., a cooperative in which PacifiCorp has an ownership interest of 21%. The amount included above represents only PacifiCorp's 21% interest in the coal reserves. PacifiCorp does not operate the Trapper mine. 

Recoverability by surface mining methods typically ranges from 90% to 95%. Recoverability by underground mining techniques ranges from 50% to 70%. To meet applicable standards, PacifiCorp blends coal mined at its owned mines with contracted coal and utilizes emissions reduction technologies for controlling sulfur dioxide and other emissions. For fuel needs at PacifiCorp's coal-fueled generating facilities in excess of coal reserves available, PacifiCorp believes it will be able to purchase coal under both long- and short-term contracts to supply its generating facilities over their currently expected remaining useful lives. 

Natural Gas 

PacifiCorp uses natural gas as fuel for its combined- and simple-cycle natural gas-fueled generating facilities and for the Gadsby Steam generating facility. Oil and natural gas are also used for igniter fuel and standby purposes. These sources are presently in adequate supply and available to meet PacifiCorp's needs. 

PacifiCorp enters into forward natural gas purchases at fixed or indexed market prices. PacifiCorp purchases natural gas in the spot market with both fixed and indexed market prices for physical delivery to fulfill any fuel requirements not already satisfied through forward purchases of natural gas and sells natural gas in the spot market for the disposition of any excess supply if the forecasted requirements of its natural gas-fueled generating facilities decrease. PacifiCorp also utilizes financial swap contracts to mitigate price risk associated with its forecasted fuel requirements. 

Hydroelectric 

The amount of electricity PacifiCorp is able to generate from its hydroelectric facilities depends on a number of factors, including snowpack in the mountains upstream of its hydroelectric facilities, reservoir storage, precipitation in its watersheds, generating unit availability and restrictions imposed by oversight bodies due to competing water management objectives. 

PacifiCorp operates the majority of its hydroelectric generating portfolio under long-term licenses. The FERC &#32;regulates 99% of the net capacity of this portfolio through 15 individual licenses, which have terms of 30 to 50 years. The licenses for major hydroelectric generating facilities expire at various dates from December 2018 through May 2058. A portion of this portfolio is licensed under the Oregon Hydroelectric Act. For further discussion of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric relicensing activities, including updated information regarding the Klamath River hydroelectric system, refer to Note 16 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

&#32;6 

Wind and Other Renewable Resources 

PacifiCorp has pursued renewable resources as a viable, economical and environmentally prudent means of supplying electricity and complying with laws and regulations. Renewable resources have low to no emissions and require little or no fossil fuel. PacifiCorp's wind-powered generating facilities are eligible for federal renewable electricity production tax credits for 10 years from the date the facilities are placed in-service. Production tax credits for PacifiCorp's currently eligible wind-powered generating facilities will begin expiring in 2016, with final expiration in 2020. 

Wholesale Activities 

PacifiCorp purchases and sells electricity in the wholesale markets as needed to balance its generation and purchase commitments with its retail load and wholesale sales obligations. PacifiCorp may also purchase electricity in the wholesale markets when it is more economical than generating electricity from its own facilities and may sell surplus electricity in the wholesale markets when it can do so economically. When prudent, PacifiCorp enters into financial swap contracts and forward electricity sales and purchases for physical delivery at fixed prices to reduce its exposure to electricity price volatility. 

Transmission and Distribution 

PacifiCorp operates one balancing authority area in the western portion of its service territory and one balancing authority area in the eastern portion of its service territory. A balancing authority area is a geographic area with transmission systems that control generation to maintain schedules with other balancing authority areas and ensure reliable operations. In operating the balancing authority areas, PacifiCorp is responsible for continuously balancing electricity supply and demand by dispatching generating resources and interchange transactions so that generation internal to the balancing authority area, plus net imported power, matches customer loads. Deliveries of energy over PacifiCorp's transmission system are managed and scheduled in accordance with FERC &#32;requirements. 

PacifiCorp's transmission system is part of the Western Interconnection, which includes the interconnected transmission systems of 14 western states, two Canadian provinces and parts of Mexico. PacifiCorp's transmission system, together with contractual rights on other transmission systems, enables PacifiCorp to integrate and access generation resources to meet its customer load requirements. PacifiCorp's transmission and distribution systems included approximately 16,500 miles of transmission lines, 64,000 &#32;miles of distribution lines and 900 substations as of December 31, 2015 . 

PacifiCorp's transmission and distribution system is managed on a coordinated basis to obtain maximum load-carrying capability and efficiency. Portions of PacifiCorp's transmission and distribution systems are located: 

&#8226; 

On property owned or leased by PacifiCorp; 

&#8226; 

Under or over streets, alleys, highways and other public places, the public domain and national forests and state lands under franchises, easements or other rights that are generally subject to termination; 

&#8226; 

Under or over private property as a result of easements obtained primarily from the title holder of record; or 

&#8226; 

Under or over Native American reservations under grant of easement by the United States Secretary of Interior or lease by Native American tribes. 

It is possible that some of the easements and the property over which the easements were granted may have title defects or may be subject to mortgages or liens existing at the time the easements were acquired. 

&#32;7 

PacifiCorp and the California ISO &#32;implemented an EIM &#32;in November 2014. The EIM &#32;expands the real-time component of the California ISO &#32;to optimize and balance electricity supply and demand every five minutes across the entire PacifiCorp and California ISO &#32;EIM footprint. The EIM &#32;is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the Western United States. EIM &#32;market participants submit bids to the California ISO &#32;market operator before each hour for each generating resource they choose to be dispatched by the market. Each bid is comprised of a dispatchable operating range, ramp rate and prices across the operating range. The California ISO &#32;market operator uses sophisticated technology to select the least-cost resources to meet demand and send simultaneous dispatch signals to every participating generator across the EIM &#32;footprint every five minutes. In addition to generation resource bids, the California ISO &#32;market operator also receives continuous real-time updates of the transmission grid network, meteorological and load forecast information that it uses to optimize dispatch instructions. Outside the EIM &#32;footprint, utilities in the Western United States do not utilize comparable technology and are largely limited to transactions within the borders of their balancing authority area to balance supply and demand intra-hour using a combination of manual and automated dispatch. The EIM &#32;delivers customer benefits by leveraging automation and resource diversity to result in more efficient dispatch, more effective integration of renewables and improved situational awareness. Benefits to customers are expected to increase with renewable resource expansion and as more entities join the EIM &#32;bringing incremental diversity. 

In April 2015, PacifiCorp and the California ISO &#32;entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding to explore the feasibility, costs and benefits of PacifiCorp joining a regional ISO as a participating transmission owner if the California ISO &#32;becomes a regional ISO by modifying its governance structure and expanding its balancing authority area. A comprehensive benefits study was completed and results were publicly announced in October 2015, along with an extension of the non-binding memorandum of understanding. The benefits study demonstrated gross benefits for customers exist, warranting further exploration and analysis of integration. PacifiCorp and the California ISO &#32;have initiated a stakeholder input and review process. If PacifiCorp decides to become a participating transmission owner in the regional ISO, it will seek necessary regulatory approvals, including from its state regulatory commissions and the FERC . Joining the regional ISO would extend PacifiCorp's current participation in the real-time market through the EIM &#32;to participation in the day-ahead energy market operated by the California ISO , in addition to unified planning and operation of PacifiCorp's transmission network. 

PacifiCorp's Energy Gateway Transmission Expansion Program represents plans to build approximately 2,000 miles of new high-voltage transmission lines, with an estimated cost exceeding $6 billion, primarily in Wyoming, Utah, Idaho and Oregon. The $6 billion estimated cost includes: (a) the 345-kV Populus to Terminal transmission line placed in-service in 2010; (b) the 100-mile high-voltage transmission line between the Mona substation in central Utah and the Oquirrh substation in the Salt Lake Valley placed in-service in 2013; (c) the 345-kV transmission line between the Sigurd Substation in central Utah and the Red Butte Substation in southwest Utah placed in-service in May 2015; and (d) other segments that are expected to be placed in-service in future years, depending on load growth, siting, permitting and construction schedules. The transmission line segments are intended to: (a) address customer load growth; (b) improve system reliability; (c) reduce transmission system constraints; (d) provide access to diverse generation resources, including renewable resources; and (e) improve the flow of electricity throughout PacifiCorp's six-state service area. Proposed transmission line segments are evaluated to ensure optimal benefits and timing before committing to move forward with permitting and construction. Through December 31, 2015 , $1.8 billion had been spent and $1.6 billion, including AFUDC , had been placed in-service. 

Future Generation, Conservation and Energy Efficiency 

Integrated Resource Plan 

As required by certain state regulations, PacifiCorp uses an IRP to develop a long-term resource plan to ensure that PacifiCorp can continue to provide reliable and cost-effective electric service to its customers while maintaining compliance with existing and evolving environmental laws and regulations. The IRP process identifies the amount and timing of PacifiCorp's expected future resource needs, accounting for planning uncertainty, risks, reliability, state energy policies and other factors. The IRP is prepared following a public process, which provides an opportunity for stakeholders to participate in PacifiCorp's resource planning process. PacifiCorp files its IRP on a biennial basis with the state commissions in each of the six states where PacifiCorp operates. Five states indicate whether the IRP meets the state commission's IRP standards and guidelines, a process referred to as "acknowledgment" in some states. PacifiCorp filed its 2015 IRP with the state commissions in March 2015. To date, the WPSC accepted the 2015 IRP into its files and the UPSC, IPUC and WUTC acknowledged the 2015 IRP. PacifiCorp is awaiting acknowledgment of the 2015 IRP from the OPUC. 

&#32;8 

Requests for Proposals 

PacifiCorp issues individual Requests for Proposals ("RFPs"), each of which typically focuses on a specific category of generation resources consistent with the IRP or other customer-driven demands. The IRP and the RFPs provide for the identification and staged procurement of resources in future years to achieve a balance of load requirements and resources. As required by applicable laws and regulations, PacifiCorp files draft RFPs with the UPSC, the OPUC and the WUTC, as applicable, prior to issuance to the market. Approval by the UPSC, the OPUC or the WUTC may be required depending on the nature of the RFPs. 

Utah Subscriber Solar Program 

In October 2015, the UPSC approved the Utah Subscriber Solar Program that allows Utah customers to meet a portion or all of their energy requirements from Utah-based solar photovoltaic resources. The program is an alternative for customers who are unable or do not want to install solar. Residential and small commercial participants will be able to subscribe in 200 kilowatt-hour blocks up to their total annual usage. Large commercial and industrial participants will be able to subscribe in 1 kilowatt blocks up to their total annual usage. As part of the program, PacifiCorp issued a 2015 Solar RFP to seek solar photovoltaic resources up to 20 MW sited in Utah. The contract for the solar resource was executed in January 2016 and the project is expected to be operational in December 2016. PacifiCorp is targeting the summer of 2016 for open enrollment in the program to begin. 

Demand-side Management 

PacifiCorp has provided a comprehensive set of DSM &#32;programs to its customers since the 1970s. The programs are designed to reduce energy consumption and more effectively manage when energy is used, including management of seasonal peak loads. PacifiCorp offers services to customers such as energy engineering audits and information on how to improve the efficiency of their homes and businesses. To assist customers in investing in energy efficiency, PacifiCorp offers rebates or incentives encouraging the purchase and installation of high-efficiency equipment such as lighting, heating and cooling equipment, weatherization, motors, process equipment and systems, as well as incentives for energy project management, efficient building operations and efficient construction. Incentives are also paid to solicit participation in load management programs by residential, business and agricultural customers through programs such as PacifiCorp's residential and small commercial air conditioner load control program and irrigation equipment load control programs. Although subject to prudence reviews, state regulations allow for contemporaneous recovery of costs incurred for the DSM &#32;programs through state-specific energy efficiency surcharges to retail customers or for recovery of costs through rates. During 2015 , PacifiCorp spent $134 million on these DSM &#32;programs, resulting in an estimated 641,486 MWh of first-year energy savings and an estimated 269 MW of peak load management. In addition to these DSM &#32;programs, PacifiCorp has load curtailment contracts with a number of large industrial customers that deliver up to 305 MW of load reduction when needed, depending on the customers' actual loads. Recovery of the costs associated with the large industrial load management program are captured in the retail rate agreements with those customers approved by their respective state commissions or through PacifiCorp's general rate case process. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , PacifiCorp had approximately 5,700 employees, of which approximately 3,300 were covered by union contracts, principally with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Utility Workers Union of America and the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers.

In addition to the variations in weather from year to year, fluctuations in economic conditions within MidAmerican Energy's service territory and elsewhere can impact customer usage, particularly for industrial and wholesale customers. Wholesale sales are impacted by market prices for energy relative to the incremental cost to generate power. 

There are seasonal variations in MidAmerican Energy's electricity sales that are principally related to weather and the related use of electricity for air conditioning. Additionally, electricity sales are priced higher in the summer months compared to the remaining months of the year. As a result, approximately 40% of MidAmerican Energy's regulated electric revenue is reported in the months of June, July, August and September. 

The annual hourly peak demand on MidAmerican Energy's electric system usually occurs as a result of air conditioning use during the cooling season. Peak demand represents the highest demand on a given day and at a given hour. On July 17, 2015, retail customer usage of electricity caused an hourly peak demand of 4,624 MW on MidAmerican Energy's electric distribution system, which is 128 MW less than the record hourly peak demand of 4,752 MW set July 19, 2011.

All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with generation from these generating facilities and purchases may be: (a) used in future years to comply with RPS or other regulatory requirements, (b) sold to third parties in the form of renewable energy credits or other environmental commodities, or (c) excluded from energy purchased. 

MidAmerican Energy is required to have resources available to continuously meet its customer needs. The percentage of MidAmerican Energy's energy supplied by energy source varies from year to year and is subject to numerous operational and economic factors such as planned and unplanned outages, fuel commodity prices, fuel transportation costs, weather, environmental considerations, transmission constraints, and wholesale market prices of electricity. When factors for one energy source are less favorable, MidAmerican Energy must place more reliance on other energy sources. For example, MidAmerican Energy can generate more electricity using its low cost wind-powered generating facilities when factors associated with these facilities are favorable. When factors associated with wind resources are less favorable, MidAmerican Energy must increase its reliance on more expensive generation or purchased electricity. MidAmerican Energy manages certain risks relating to its supply of electricity and fuel requirements by entering into various contracts, which may be accounted for as derivatives, which may include forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements. Refer to "General Regulation" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of energy cost recovery by jurisdiction and to MidAmerican Energy's Item 7A in this Form 10-K for a discussion of commodity price risk and derivative contracts. 

All of the coal-fueled generating facilities operated by MidAmerican Energy are fueled by low-sulfur, western coal from the Powder River Basin in northeast Wyoming. MidAmerican Energy's coal supply portfolio includes multiple suppliers and mines under short-term and multi-year agreements of varying terms and quantities through 2019. MidAmerican Energy believes supplies from these sources are presently adequate and available to meet MidAmerican Energy's needs. MidAmerican Energy's coal supply portfolio has substantially all of its expected 2016 requirements under fixed-price contracts. MidAmerican Energy regularly monitors the western coal market for opportunities to enhance its coal supply portfolio. 

MidAmerican Energy has a multi-year long-haul coal transportation agreement with BNSF Railway Company ("BNSF"), an affiliate company, for the delivery of coal to all of the MidAmerican Energy-operated coal-fueled generating facilities other than the George Neal Energy Center. Under this agreement, BNSF delivers coal directly to MidAmerican Energy's Walter Scott, Jr. Energy Center and to an interchange point with Canadian Pacific Railway Company for short-haul delivery to the Louisa Energy Center. MidAmerican Energy has a multi-year long-haul coal transportation agreement with Union Pacific Railroad Company for the delivery of coal to the George Neal Energy Center. 

&#32;14 

MidAmerican Energy is a 25% joint owner of Quad Cities Generating Station Units 1 and 2 ("Quad Cities Station"), a nuclear power plant. Exelon Generation Company, LLC, a subsidiary of Exelon Corporation ("Exelon Generation"), is the 75% joint owner and the operator of Quad Cities Station. Approximately one-third of the nuclear fuel assemblies in each reactor core at Quad Cities Station is replaced every 24 months. MidAmerican Energy has been advised by Exelon Generation that the following requirements for Quad Cities Station can be met under existing supplies or commitments: uranium requirements through 2020 and partial requirements through 2022; uranium conversion requirements through 2022 and partial requirements through 2025; enrichment requirements through 2019 and partial requirements through 2025; and fuel fabrication requirements through 2022. MidAmerican Energy has been advised by Exelon Generation that it does not anticipate it will have difficulty in contracting for uranium, uranium conversion, enrichment or fabrication of nuclear fuel needed to operate Quad Cities Station during these time periods. 

MidAmerican Energy uses natural gas and oil as fuel for intermediate and peak demand electric generation, igniter fuel, transmission support and standby purposes. These sources are presently in adequate supply and available to meet MidAmerican Energy's needs. 

MidAmerican Energy owns more wind-powered generating capacity than any other United States rate-regulated electric utility and believes wind-powered generation offers a viable, economical and environmentally prudent means of supplying electricity and complying with laws and regulations. Pursuant to ratemaking principles approved by the IUB, all of MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating facilities in-service at December 31, 2015 are authorized to earn a fixed rate of return on equity over their useful lives ranging from 11.35% to 12.2% in any future Iowa rate proceeding. MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating facilities are eligible for federal renewable electricity production tax credits for 10 years from the date the facilities are placed in-service. Production tax credits for MidAmerican Energy's wind-powered generating facilities currently in-service, began expiring in 2014, with final expiration in 2025. 

MidAmerican Energy sells and purchases electricity and ancillary services related to its generation and load in wholesale markets pursuant to the tariffs in those markets. MidAmerican Energy participates predominantly in the MISO energy and ancillary service markets, which provide MidAmerican Energy with wholesale opportunities over a large market area. MidAmerican Energy can enter into wholesale bilateral transactions in addition to market activity related to its assets. MidAmerican Energy is authorized to participate in the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. and PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. ("PJM") markets and can contract with several other major transmission-owning utilities in the region. MidAmerican Energy can utilize both financial swaps and physical fixed-price electricity sales and purchases contracts to reduce its exposure to electricity price volatility. 

MidAmerican Energy's total net generating capability accredited by the MISO for the summer of 2015 &#32;was 5,406 MW compared to a 2015 summer peak demand of 4,624 &#32;MW. Accredited net generating capability represents the amount of generation available to meet the requirements of MidAmerican Energy's retail customers and consists of MidAmerican Energy-owned generation, certain customer "behind the meter" generators and the net amount of capacity purchases and sales. Accredited capacity may vary from the nominal, or design, capacity ratings, particularly for wind turbines whose output is dependent upon wind levels at any given time. Additionally, the actual amount of generating capacity available at any time may be less than the accredited capacity due to regulatory restrictions, transmission constraints, fuel restrictions and generating units being temporarily out of service for inspection, maintenance, refueling, modifications or other reasons. MidAmerican Energy's accredited capability currently exceeds the MISO's minimum requirements. 

Transmission and Distribution 

MidAmerican Energy's transmission and distribution systems included 3,800 miles of transmission lines, 37,000 &#32;miles of distribution lines and 380 substations as of December 31, 2015 . Electricity from MidAmerican Energy's generating facilities and purchased electricity is delivered to wholesale markets and its retail customers via the transmission facilities of MidAmerican Energy and others. MidAmerican Energy participates in the MISO energy and ancillary services markets as a transmission-owning member and, accordingly, operates its transmission assets at the direction of the MISO. The MISO manages its energy and ancillary service markets using reliability-constrained economic dispatch of the region's generation. For both the day-ahead and real-time (every five minutes) markets, the MISO analyzes generation commitments to provide market liquidity and transparent pricing while maintaining transmission system reliability by minimizing congestion and maximizing efficient energy transmission. Additionally, through its FERC -approved open access transmission tariff ("OATT"), the MISO performs the role of transmission service provider throughout the MISO footprint and administers the long-term planning function. MISO and related costs of the participants are shared among the participants through a number of mechanisms in accordance with the MISO tariff.

Regulated Natural Gas Operations 

MidAmerican Energy is engaged in the procurement, transportation, storage and distribution of natural gas for customers in its service territory. MidAmerican Energy purchases natural gas from various suppliers and contracts with interstate natural gas pipelines for transportation of the gas to MidAmerican Energy's service territory and for storage and balancing services. MidAmerican Energy sells natural gas and delivery services to end-use customers on its distribution system; sells natural gas to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies; and transports natural gas through its distribution system for end-use customers who have independently secured their supply of natural gas. During 2015 , 52% of the total natural gas delivered through MidAmerican Energy's distribution system was associated with transportation service. 

Natural gas property consists primarily of natural gas mains and services lines, meters, and related distribution equipment, including feeder lines to communities served from natural gas pipelines owned by others. The natural gas distribution facilities of MidAmerican Energy included 23,000 &#32;miles of natural gas main and service lines as of December 31, 2015 .

Fuel Supply and Capacity 

MidAmerican Energy uses several strategies designed to maintain a reliable natural gas supply and reduce the impact of volatility in natural gas prices on its regulated retail natural gas customers. These strategies include the purchase of a geographically diverse supply portfolio from producers and third party energy marketing companies, the use of leased storage and LNG peaking facilities, the use of financial derivatives to fix the price on a portion of the anticipated natural gas requirements of MidAmerican Energy's customers, and the maintenance of regulatory arrangements to share savings and costs with customers. Refer to "General Regulation" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the purchased gas adjustment clauses ("PGA"). 

MidAmerican Energy contracts for firm natural gas pipeline capacity to transport natural gas from key production areas and liquid market centers to its service territory through direct interconnects to the pipeline systems of several interstate natural gas pipeline systems, including Northern Natural Gas, an affiliate company. MidAmerican Energy has multiple pipeline interconnections into several larger markets within its distribution system. Multiple pipeline interconnections create competition among pipeline suppliers for transportation capacity to serve those markets, thus reducing costs. In addition, multiple pipeline interconnections increase delivery reliability and give MidAmerican Energy the ability to optimize delivery of the lowest cost supply from the various production areas and liquid market centers into these markets. Benefits to MidAmerican Energy's distribution system customers are shared among all jurisdictions through a consolidated PGA. 

At times, the natural gas pipeline capacity available through MidAmerican Energy's firm capacity portfolio may exceed the requirements of retail customers on MidAmerican Energy's distribution system. Firm capacity in excess of MidAmerican Energy's system needs can be resold to other companies to achieve optimum use of the available capacity. Past IUB and South Dakota Public Utilities Commission ("SDPUC") rulings have allowed MidAmerican Energy to retain 30% of the respective jurisdictional revenue on the resold capacity, with the remaining 70% being returned to customers through the PGAs. 

MidAmerican Energy utilizes natural gas storage leased from the interstate pipelines to meet retail customer requirements, manage fluctuations in demand due to changes in weather and other usage factors and manage variation in seasonal natural gas pricing. MidAmerican Energy typically withdraws natural gas from storage during the heating season when customer demand is historically at its peak and injects natural gas into storage during off-peak months when customer demand is historically lower than during the heating season. MidAmerican Energy also utilizes its three LNG facilities to meet peak day demands during the winter heating season. The leased storage and LNG facilities reduce MidAmerican Energy's dependence on natural gas purchases during the volatile winter heating season and can deliver a significant portion of MidAmerican Energy's anticipated retail sales requirements on a peak winter day. For MidAmerican Energy's 2015/2016 winter heating season preliminary peak-day of January 17, 2016, supply sources used to meet deliveries to traditional retail sales service customers included 66% from leased storage, 30% from purchases from interstate pipelines and 4% from MidAmerican Energy's LNG facilities. 

MidAmerican Energy attempts to optimize the value of its regulated transportation capacity, natural gas supply and leased storage arrangements by engaging in wholesale transactions. IUB and SDPUC rulings have allowed MidAmerican Energy to retain 50% of the respective jurisdictional margins earned on wholesale sales of natural gas, with the remaining 50% being returned to customers through the PGAs. 

In 1995, the IUB gave initial approval of MidAmerican Energy's Incentive Gas Supply Procurement Plan, which seeks to establish a market-based reference price for key components of MidAmerican Energy's natural gas supply costs. In September 2013, the IUB extended the program through October 31, 2016. Under the program, as amended, MidAmerican Energy is required to file with the IUB annually a comparison of its actual natural gas procurement costs to the reference price. If MidAmerican Energy's actual natural gas supply costs for the applicable period were less or greater than an established tolerance band around the reference price, then MidAmerican Energy shares a portion of the savings or costs with customers. A similar program has also been in effect in South Dakota since 1995 and in October 2013 was extended through October 31, 2016. Since the implementation of these programs, MidAmerican Energy has successfully achieved savings relative to the applicable reference prices and shared such savings with its regulated retail natural gas customers. MidAmerican Energy's portion of shared savings is reflected in results of nonregulated energy operations. 

MidAmerican Energy is not aware of any factors that would cause material difficulties in meeting its anticipated retail customer demand for the foreseeable future.

Demand-side Management 

MidAmerican Energy has provided a comprehensive set of DSM &#32;programs to its Iowa electric and gas customers since 1990 and to customers in its other jurisdictions since 2008. The programs are designed to reduce energy consumption and more effectively manage when energy is used, including management of seasonal peak loads. Current programs offer services to customers such as energy engineering audits and information on how to improve the efficiency of their homes and businesses. To assist customers in investing in energy efficiency, MidAmerican Energy offers rebates or incentives encouraging the purchase and installation of high-efficiency equipment such as lighting, heating and cooling equipment, weatherization, motors, process equipment and systems, as well as incentives for efficient construction. Incentives are also paid to residential customers who participate in the air conditioner load control program and nonresidential customers who participate in the nonresidential load management program. Although subject to prudence reviews, state regulations allow for contemporaneous recovery of costs incurred for the DSM &#32;programs through state-specific energy efficiency service charges paid by all retail electric and gas customers. During 2015 , $111 million was expended on MidAmerican Energy's DSM &#32;programs resulting in estimated first-year energy savings of 303,000 MWh of electricity and 826,000 Dth &#32;of natural gas and an estimated peak load reduction of 288 MW of electricity and 9,710 Dth &#32;per day of natural gas. 

Nonregulated Energy Operations 

Nonregulated energy operations consist of competitive electricity and natural gas retail sales and gas income-sharing arrangements. Effective January 1, 2016, MidAmerican Energy, transferred its nonregulated competitive electricity and natural gas retail services operations to a subsidiary of BHE. Refer to Note 21 &#32;of the Notes to Financial Statements of MidAmerican Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of the transfer. Nonregulated electric operations predominantly include sales to retail customers in Illinois, Texas, Ohio, Maryland and other states that allow customers to choose their energy supplier. Nonregulated gas operations predominantly include sales to retail customers in Iowa and Illinois. For nonregulated retail services operations, electricity and natural gas are purchased from producers and third party energy marketing companies and sold directly to commercial, industrial and governmental end-users. Nonregulated retail services operations do not own electricity or natural gas production assets but hedge their contracted sales obligations either with physical supply arrangements or financial products. As of December 31, 2015 , nonregulated retail services contracts in place for the sale of electricity totaled 18,865,000 MWh with a weighted average life of 2.1 years and for the sale of natural gas totaled 35,725,000 Dth &#32;with a weighted average life of 1.4 years. In addition, nonregulated retail services operations manage natural gas supplies for a number of smaller commercial end-users, which includes the sale of natural gas to these customers to meet their supply requirements. Refer to MidAmerican Energy's Item 7A in this Form 10-K for a discussion of commodity price risk and derivative contracts.

NV ENERGY (NEVADA POWER AND SIERRA PACIFIC) 

General 

NV Energy, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE acquired on December 19, 2013, is an energy holding company headquartered in Nevada whose principal subsidiaries are Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific. Nevada Power is a United States regulated electric utility company serving 0.9 million &#32;retail customers, including residential, commercial and industrial customers primarily in the Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Henderson and adjoining areas. Sierra Pacific is a United States regulated electric and natural gas utility company serving 0.3 million &#32;retail electric customers, including residential, commercial and industrial customers, and 0.2 million &#32;retail and transportation natural gas customers in northern Nevada. 

The Nevada Utilities are principally engaged in the business of generating, transmitting, distributing and selling electricity and, in the case of Sierra Pacific, in distributing, selling and transporting natural gas. Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific have electric service territories covering approximately 4,500 square miles and 41,400 square miles, respectively. Sierra Pacific has a natural gas service territory in an area of about 900 &#32;square miles in Reno and Sparks. Natural gas property consists primarily of natural gas mains and service lines, meters, and related distribution equipment, including feeder lines to communities served from natural gas pipelines owned by others. The natural gas distribution facilities of Sierra Pacific included 3,200 miles of natural gas mains and service lines as of December 31, 2015 . 

The Nevada Utilities also buy and sell electricity on the wholesale market with other utilities, energy marketing companies, financial institutions and other market participants to balance and optimize the economic benefits of electricity generation, retail customer loads and existing wholesale transactions. The Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive state and federal regulation. Regulated electric utility operation is Nevada Power's only segment while regulated electric utility operations and regulated natural gas operations are the two segments of Sierra Pacific. Principal industries served by the Nevada Utilities include gaming, recreation, warehousing, manufacturing and governmental. Sierra Pacific also serves the mining industry. In addition to the Nevada Utilities electric retail sales and Sierra Pacific's natural gas transportation, the Nevada Utilities sell electricity and natural gas to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies on a wholesale basis. 

Nevada Power's principal executive offices are located at 6226 West Sahara Avenue, Las Vegas, Nevada 89146, and its telephone number is (702) 402-5000. Nevada Power was incorporated in 1929 under the laws of the state of Nevada. 

Sierra Pacific's principal executive offices are located at 6100 Neil Road, Reno, Nevada 89511, and its telephone number is (775) 834-4011. Sierra Pacific was incorporated in 1912 under the laws of the state of Nevada. 

&#32;19 

Regulated Operations 

The Nevada Utilities deliver electricity and, in the case of Sierra Pacific, natural gas to customers in Nevada. The Nevada Utilities own facilities or have power purchase contracts for coal, natural gas, water, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and waste heat resources to provide electricity. This electricity, together with electricity purchased on the wholesale market, is then transmitted via a grid of transmission lines, which are part of the Western Interconnection, the regional grid in the United States. The Western Interconnection includes the interconnected transmission systems of 14 western states, two Canadian provinces and parts of Mexico. The electricity is then transformed to lower voltages and delivered to customers through the Nevada Utilities' distribution system. 

The Nevada Utilities seek to manage growth in their customer demand through the construction and purchase of cost-effective, environmentally prudent and efficient sources of electricity supply and through energy efficiency programs. NV Energy began participating in the EIM &#32;in December 2015. By joining PacifiCorp in the EIM , the Nevada Utilities and the California ISO &#32;extended the scope of the existing EIM , which is expected to reduce costs to serve customers through more efficient dispatch of a larger and more diverse pool of resources, more effectively integrate renewables and enhance reliability through improved situational awareness and responsiveness. 

The Nevada Utilities' primary goal is to provide safe, reliable electricity to their customers at a reasonable cost. The Nevada Utilities operate under certificates of public convenience and necessity as regulated by the PUCN, and as such the Nevada Utilities have an obligation to provide electricity service to those customers within their service territory. In return, the PUCN has established rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow the Nevada Utilities an opportunity to recover all prudently incurred costs of providing services and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment. 

The Nevada Utilities' electric and natural gas operations are conducted under numerous nonexclusive franchise agreements, revocable permits and licenses obtained from federal, state and local authorities. The expiration of these franchise agreements range from 2020 &#32;through 2032 &#32;for Nevada Power and 2016 &#32;through 2035 &#32;for Sierra Pacific.

Customer Usage and Seasonality 

In addition to the variations in weather from year to year, fluctuations in economic conditions within the Nevada Utilities' service territory and elsewhere can impact customer usage, particularly for gaming, mining and wholesale customers. Wholesale sales are impacted by market prices for energy relative to the incremental cost to generate power. 

There are seasonal variations in the Nevada Utilities' electric business that are principally related to weather and the related use of electricity for air conditioning. Typically, 46 - 50% &#32;of Nevada Power's and 35 - 38% &#32;of Sierra Pacific's regulated electric revenue is reported in the months of June, July, August and September. 

&#32;21 

The annual hourly peak customer demand on the Nevada Utilities' electric systems occurs as a result of air conditioning use during the cooling season. Peak demand represents the highest demand on a given day and at a given hour. On June 30, 2015 , customer usage of electricity caused an hourly peak demand of 5,864 MW on Nevada Power's electric distribution system, which is 2 &#32;MW less than the record hourly peak demand of 5,866 &#32;MW set July 5, 2007 . On June 30, 2015 , customer usage of electricity caused an hourly peak demand of 1,711 MW on Sierra Pacific's electric distribution system, which is 50 &#32;MW less than the record hourly peak demand of 1,761 &#32;MW set July 14, 2014 . 

Generating Facilities and Fuel Supply

All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with renewable energy purchased may be: (a) used in future years to comply with RPS or other regulatory requirements or (b) sold to third parties in the form of renewable energy credits or other environmental commodities. 

The Nevada Utilities are required to have resources available to continuously meet their customer needs. The percentage of the Nevada Utilities' energy supplied by energy source varies from year-to-year and is subject to numerous operational and economic factors such as planned and unplanned outages; fuel commodity prices; fuel transportation costs; weather; environmental considerations; transmission constraints; and wholesale market prices of electricity. The Nevada Utilities evaluate these factors continuously in order to facilitate economical dispatch of their generating facilities. When factors for one energy source are less favorable, the Nevada Utilities must place more reliance on other energy sources. As long as the Nevada Utilities purchases are deemed prudent by the PUCN, through their annual prudency review, the Nevada Utilities are permitted to recover the cost of fuel and purchased power. The Nevada Utilities also have the ability to reset quarterly BTER , with PUCN approval, based on the last twelve months fuel costs and purchased power and to reset quarterly DEAA . 

In response to these energy supply challenges, the Nevada Utilities have adopted an approach to managing the energy supply function that has three primary elements. The first element is a set of management guidelines to procuring and optimizing the supply portfolio that is consistent with the requirements of a load serving entity with a full requirements obligation, and with the growth of distributed generation serving a small but growing group of customers with partial requirements. The second element is an energy risk management and risk control approach that ensures clear separation of roles between the day-to-day management of risks and compliance monitoring and control and ensures clear distinction between policy setting (or planning) and execution. Lastly, the Nevada Utilities pursue a process of ongoing regulatory involvement and acknowledgment of the resource portfolio management plans. 

The Nevada Utilities have entered into multiple long-term power purchase contracts (three or more years) with suppliers that generate electricity utilizing coal, natural gas and renewable resources. Nevada Power has entered into contracts with a total capacity of 2,253 MW with contract termination dates ranging from 2017 to 2040. Included in these contracts are 1,257 MW of capacity of renewable energy, of which 228 MW of capacity are under development or construction and not currently available. Sierra Pacific has entered into contracts with a total capacity of 508 MW with contract termination dates ranging from 2016 to 2039. Included in these contracts are 311 MW of capacity of renewable energy, of which 101 MW of capacity are under development or construction and not currently available. 

&#32;23 

The Nevada Utilities manage certain risks relating to their supply of electricity and fuel requirements by entering into various contracts, which may be accounted for as derivatives, including forwards, futures, options, swaps and other agreements. Refer to NV Energy's "General Regulation" section in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for a discussion of energy cost recovery by jurisdiction and Nevada Power's Item 7A and Sierra Pacific's Item 7A in this Form 10-K for a discussion of commodity price risk and derivative contracts. 

Natural Gas 

The Nevada Utilities rely on first-of-the-month indexed physical gas purchases for the majority of natural gas needed to operate its generating facilities. To secure natural gas supplies for the generating facilities, the Nevada Utilities execute purchases pursuant to a PUCN approved four season laddering strategy. In 2015, natural gas supply net purchases averaged 361,573 and 125,361 &#32; Dth &#32;per day with the winter period contracts averaging 307,504 and 142,009 &#32; Dth &#32;per day and the summer period contracts averaging 399,724 &#32;and 113,615 &#32; Dth &#32;per day for Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific, respectively. The Nevada Utilities believe supplies from these sources are presently adequate and available to meet its needs. 

The Nevada Utilities contract for firm natural gas pipeline capacity to transport natural gas from production areas to their service territory through direct interconnects to the pipeline systems of several interstate natural gas pipeline systems, including Nevada Power contracts with Kern River, an affiliated company. Sierra Pacific utilizes natural gas storage leased from interstate pipelines to meet retail customer requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather and other usage factors. The stored natural gas is typically replaced during off-peak months when the demand for natural gas is historically lower than during the heating season. 

Coal 

The Nevada Utilities have no coal commitments for 2016 or beyond and will rely on spot market solicitations for any coal supplies needed during 2016 and regularly monitor the western coal market for opportunities to meet these needs. Nevada Power's coal supply plan has the overall goal of eliminating its coal pile by Reid Gardner Unit No. 4's expected retirement date of December 2017. The Nevada Utilities have transportation services contracts with Union Pacific Railroad Company to ship coal from various origins in Central Utah, Western Colorado and Wyoming that expire December 31, 2017 for Nevada Power and December 31, 2019 for Sierra Pacific. The transportation services contracts with Union Pacific Railroad Company contain no firm volume or financial commitments. The Navajo Generating Station, jointly owned by Nevada Power along with five other entities and operated by Salt River Project, has a coal purchase agreement that extends through December 2019. 

Transmission and Distribution 

The Nevada Utilities' transmission system is part of the Western Interconnection. The Nevada Utilities' transmission system, together with contractual rights on other transmission systems, enables the Nevada Utilities to integrate and access generation resources to meet their customer load requirements. Nevada Power's transmission and distribution systems included approximately 2,000 miles of transmission lines, 24,000 miles of distribution lines and 200 substations as of December 31, 2015 . Sierra Pacific's transmission and distribution systems included approximately 2,300 &#32;miles of transmission lines, 16,500 &#32;miles of distribution lines and 200 &#32;substations as of December 31, 2015 . 

ON Line is a 231 mile, 500-kV transmission line connecting Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's service territories. ON Line provides the ability to jointly dispatch energy throughout Nevada and provide access to renewable energy resources in parts of northern and eastern Nevada, which enhances the Nevada Utilities' ability to manage and optimize their generating facilities. ON Line provides between 600 and 800 MW of transfer capability with interconnection between the Robinson Summit substation on the Sierra Pacific system and the Harry Allen substation on the Nevada Power system. ON Line was a joint project between the Nevada Utilities and Great Basin Transmission, LLC. The Nevada Utilities own a 25% interest in ON Line and have entered into a long-term transmission use agreement with Great Basin Transmission, LLC for its 75% interest in ON Line for a term of 41 years. The Nevada Utilities share of its 25% interest in ON Line and the long-term transmission use agreement is split 95% for Nevada Power and 5% for Sierra Pacific. 

&#32;24 

The Nevada Utilities began participating in the EIM &#32;operated by the California ISO &#32;in December 2015. The EIM &#32;expands the real-time component of the California ISO &#32;to optimize and balance electricity supply and demand every five minutes across the EIM &#32;footprint. The EIM &#32;is voluntary and available to all balancing authorities in the Western United States. EIM &#32;market participants submit bids to the California ISO &#32;market operator before each hour for each generating resource they choose to be dispatched by the market. Each bid is comprised of a dispatchable operating range, ramp rate and prices across the operating range. The California ISO &#32;market operator uses sophisticated technology to select the least-cost resources to meet demand and send simultaneous dispatch signals to every participating generator across the EIM &#32;footprint every five minutes. In addition to generation resource bids, the California ISO &#32;market operator also receives continuous real-time updates of the transmission grid network, meteorological and load forecast information that it uses to optimize dispatch instructions. Outside the EIM &#32;footprint, utilities in the Western United States do not utilize comparable technology and are largely limited to transactions within the borders of their balancing authority area to balance supply and demand intra-hour using a combination of manual and automated dispatch. The EIM &#32;delivers customer benefits by leveraging automation and resource diversity to result in more efficient dispatch, more effective integration of renewables and improved situational awareness. Benefits to customers are expected to increase with renewable resource expansion and as more entities join the EIM &#32;bringing incremental diversity. The PUCN's final order approving the merger between BHE and NV Energy stipulated that the Nevada Utilities would obtain PUCN authorization prior to participating in an EIM . The PUCN issued an order in August 2014 finding that it is in the public interest to grant the application and that NV Energy met the merger stipulation requirement to obtain PUCN approval prior to participating in an EIM . 

Future Generation 

The Nevada Utilities file IRPs every three years, and as necessary, may file amendments to their IRPs. IRPs are prepared in compliance with Nevada laws and regulations and cover a 20-year period. IRPs develop a comprehensive, integrated plan that considers customer energy requirements and propose the resources to meet those requirements in a manner that is consistent with prevailing market fundamentals. The ultimate goal of the IRPs is to balance the objectives of minimizing costs and reducing volatility while reliably meeting the electric needs of Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's customers. Projects approved through the IRP process still remain subject to review by the PUCN. 

In July 2015, Nevada Power filed its triennial IRP and in December 2015, Nevada Power received PUCN approval. Sierra Pacific is scheduled to file a triennial IRP before July 1, 2016. 

The energy supply function at the Nevada Utilities is responsible for the operation of the Nevada Utilities' owned generation, the procurement of all fuels and purchased power and optimization of resources (e.g., physical and economic dispatch). 

There is the potential for continued price volatility in the Nevada Utilities' service territories, particularly during peak periods. Too great of a dependence on generation from the wholesale market can lead to power price volatilities depending on available power supply and prevailing natural gas prices. The Nevada Utilities face load obligation uncertainty due to the potential for customer switching. Some counterparties in these areas have significant credit difficulties, representing credit risk to the Nevada Utilities. Finally, the Nevada Utilities' own credit situation can have an impact on its ability to enter into transactions. 

Within the energy supply planning process, there are three key components covering different time frames: 

&#8226; 

The PUCN-approved long-term IRP which is filed every three years and has a 20-year planning horizon; 

&#8226; 

The PUCN-approved energy supply plan which is an intermediate term resource procurement and risk management plan that establishes the supply portfolio strategies within which intermediate term resource requirements will be met and has a one to three year planning horizon; and 

&#8226; 

Tactical execution activities with a one-month to twelve-month focus. 

The energy supply plan operates in conjunction with the PUCN-approved 20-year IRP. It serves as a guide for near-term execution and fulfillment of energy needs. When the energy supply plan calls for executing contracts of longer than three years, PUCN approval is required. 

&#32;25 

Energy-Efficiency Programs 

The Nevada Utilities have provided a comprehensive set of energy efficiency, demand response and conservation programs to their Nevada electric customers. The programs are designed to reduce energy consumption and more effectively manage when energy is used, including management of seasonal peak loads. Current programs offer services to customers such as energy audits and customer education and awareness efforts that provide information on how to improve the efficiency of their homes and businesses. To assist customers in investing in energy efficiency, the Nevada Utilities have offered rebates or incentives encouraging the purchase and installation of high-efficiency equipment such as lighting, heating and cooling equipment, weatherization, motors, process equipment and systems, as well as incentives for efficient construction. Incentives are also paid to residential customers who participate in the air conditioner load control program and nonresidential customers who participate in the nonresidential load management program. Energy efficiency program costs are recovered through annual rates set by the PUCN, and adjusted based on the Nevada Utilities' annual filing to recover current program costs and any over or under collections from the prior filing, subject to prudence review. During 2015 , Nevada Power spent $37 million &#32;on energy efficiency programs, resulting in an estimated 187,226 MWh of electric energy savings and an estimated 32 MW of electric peak load management. During 2015 , Sierra Pacific spent $10 million &#32;on energy efficiency programs, resulting in an estimated 50,643 MWh of electric energy savings and an estimated 6 MW of electric peak load management. 

Regulated Natural Gas Operations 

Sierra Pacific is engaged in the procurement, transportation and distribution of natural gas for customers in its service territory. Sierra Pacific purchases natural gas from various suppliers and contracts with interstate natural gas pipelines for transportation of the natural gas from the production areas to Sierra Pacific's service territory and for storage services to manage fluctuations in system demand and seasonal pricing. Sierra Pacific sells natural gas and delivery services to end-use customers on its distribution system; sells natural gas to other utilities, municipalities and energy marketing companies; and transports natural gas through its distribution system for a number of end-use customers who have independently secured their supply of natural gas. During 2015 , 11% &#32;of the total natural gas delivered through Sierra Pacific's distribution system was for transportation service. 

Customers 

The percentages of natural gas sold to Sierra Pacific's retail and wholesale customers by class of customer, total Dth &#32;of natural gas sold, total Dth &#32;of transportation service and the average number of retail customers for the years ended December 31 were as follows:

Commercial and industrial customers are classified primarily based on their natural gas usage. Commercial customers are non-residential customers with monthly gas usage less than 12,000 therms during five consecutive winter months. Industrial customers are non-residential customers that use natural gas in excess of 12,000 therms during one or more winter months. 

There are seasonal variations in Sierra Pacific's regulated natural gas business that are principally due to the use of natural gas for heating. Typically, 48 - 59% &#32;of Sierra Pacific's regulated natural gas revenue is reported in the months of January, February, March and December. 

On December 31, 2015 , Sierra Pacific recorded its highest peak-day natural gas delivery of 143,903 &#160; Dth , which is 19,671 &#32; Dth &#32;less than the record peak-day delivery of 163,574 &#32; Dth &#32;set on December 9, 2013 . This peak-day delivery consisted of 93% &#32;traditional retail sales service and 7% &#32;transportation service. 

&#32;26 

Fuel Supply and Capacity 

The purchase of natural gas for Sierra Pacific's regulated natural gas operations is done in combination with the purchase of natural gas for Sierra Pacific's regulated electric operations. In response to energy supply challenges, Sierra Pacific has adopted an approach to managing the energy supply function that has three primary elements, as discussed earlier under Generating Facilities and Fuel Supply. Similar to Sierra Pacific's regulated electric operations, as long as Sierra Pacific's purchases of natural gas are deemed prudent by the PUCN, through its annual prudency review, Sierra Pacific is permitted to recover the cost of natural gas. Sierra Pacific also has the ability to reset quarterly BTER , with PUCN approval, based on the last twelve months fuel costs and to reset quarterly DEAA . 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , Nevada Power had approximately 1,400 employees, of which approximately 700 &#32;were covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Sierra Pacific had approximately 1,000 employees, of which approximately 600 &#32;were covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. 

NORTHERN POWERGRID &#32; 

Northern Powergrid , an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE , is a holding company which owns two companies that distribute electricity in Great Britain, Northern Powergrid (Northeast) Limited and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc. In addition to the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies, Northern Powergrid &#32;also owns a meter asset rental business that leases smart meters to energy suppliers in the United Kingdom and Ireland, an engineering contracting business that provides electrical infrastructure contracting services primarily to third parties and a hydrocarbon exploration and development business that is focused on developing integrated upstream gas projects in Europe and Australia. 

The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies serve 3.9 million end-users and operate in the north-east of England from North Northumberland through Tyne and Wear, County Durham and Yorkshire to North Lincolnshire, an area covering 10,000 square miles. The principal function of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies is to build, maintain and operate the electricity distribution network through which the end-user receives a supply of electricity. 

The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies receive electricity from the national grid transmission system and from generators that are directly connected to the distribution network and distribute it to end-users' premises using their networks of transformers, switchgear and distribution lines and cables. Substantially all of the end-users in the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' distribution service areas are directly or indirectly connected to the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' networks and electricity can only be delivered to these end-users through their distribution systems, thus providing the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies with distribution volumes that are relatively stable from year to year. The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies charge fees for the use of their distribution systems to the suppliers of electricity. 

The suppliers purchase electricity from generators, sell the electricity to end-user customers and use the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' distribution networks pursuant to an industry standard "Distribution Connection and Use of System Agreement." One supplier, RWE Npower PLC and certain of its affiliates, represented 24 % of the total combined distribution revenue of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies during 2015 . Variations in demand from end-users can affect the revenues that are received by the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies in any year, but such variations have no effect on the total revenue that the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies are allowed to recover in a price control period. Under- or over-recoveries against price-controlled revenues are carried forward into prices for future years. 

The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' combined service territory features a diverse economy with no dominant sector. The mix of rural, agricultural, urban and industrial areas covers a broad customer base ranging from domestic usage through farming and retail to major industry including automotives, chemicals, mining, steelmaking and offshore marine construction. The industry within the area is concentrated around the principal centers of Newcastle, Middlesbrough, Sheffield and Leeds. 

&#32;27 

The price controlled revenue of the regulated distribution companies is set out in the special conditions of the licenses of those companies. The licenses are enforced by the regulator, the Gas and Electricity Markets Authority through its office of gas and electric markets (known as "Ofgem") and limit increases to allowed revenues (or may require decreases) based upon the rate of inflation, other specified factors and other regulatory action. Changes to the price controls can be made by the regulator, but if a licensee disagrees with a change to its license it can appeal the matter to the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority. It has been the convention in Great Britain for regulators to conduct periodic regulatory reviews before making proposals for any changes to the price controls. The current electricity distribution price control became effective April 1, 2015 and is expected to continue through March 31, 2023. Following initial submission of the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies' business plans for the current price control period to Ofgem in July 2013 and resubmission, following feedback from Ofgem in March 2014, the final determinations for the current price control were published in November 2014. In March 2015 Northern Powergrid was the only electricity distributor to appeal Ofgem's price control decision and in September 2015 the appeal authority allowed part of the appeal, awarding an additional &#163;30 million (in 2012/13 prices) in expenditure allowances.

BHE PIPELINE GROUP &#32; 

The BHE Pipeline Group &#32;consists of BHE 's interstate natural gas pipeline companies, Northern Natural Gas &#32;and Kern River . 

Northern Natural Gas 

Northern Natural Gas, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE , owns the largest interstate natural gas pipeline system in the United States, as measured by pipeline miles, which reaches from southern Texas to Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Northern Natural Gas primarily transports and stores natural gas for utilities, municipalities, gas marketing companies, industrial and commercial users and other end-users. Northern Natural Gas' pipeline system consists of two operationally integrated systems. Its traditional end-use and distribution market area in the northern part of its system, referred to as the Market Area, includes points in Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Michigan and Illinois. Its natural gas supply and delivery service area in the southern part of its system, referred to as the Field Area, includes points in Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma and New Mexico. Northern Natural Gas' pipeline system consists of 14,700 miles of natural gas pipelines, including 6,300 miles of mainline transmission pipelines and 8,400 miles of branch and lateral pipelines, with a Market Area design capacity of 5.7 &#160; Bcf &#32;per day, a Field Area delivery capacity of 1.7 &#160; Bcf &#32;per day to the Market Area and over 73 &#160; Bcf &#32;of firm service and operational storage cycle capacity in five storage facilities. Northern Natural Gas' pipeline system is configured with approximately 2,300 active receipt and delivery points which are integrated with the facilities of LDCs. Many of Northern Natural Gas' LDC customers are part of combined utilities that also use natural gas as a fuel source for electric generation. Northern Natural Gas delivers over 0.9 Tcf of natural gas to its customers annually. 

Northern Natural Gas' transportation rates and most of its storage rates are cost-based. These rates are designed to provide Northern Natural Gas with an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and earn a reasonable return on its investments. In addition, Northern Natural Gas has fixed rates that were market-based for certain of its firm storage contracts with contract terms that expire in 2028. 

Northern Natural Gas' operating revenue for the years ended December 31 was as follows (in millions):

Substantially all of Northern Natural Gas' Market Area transportation revenue is generated from reservation charges, with the balance from usage charges. Northern Natural Gas transports natural gas primarily to local distribution markets and end-users in the Market Area. Northern Natural Gas provides service to 81 utilities, including MidAmerican Energy, an affiliate company, which serve numerous residential, commercial and industrial customers. Most of Northern Natural Gas' transportation capacity in the Market Area is committed to customers under firm transportation contracts, where customers pay Northern Natural Gas a monthly reservation charge for the right to transport natural gas through Northern Natural Gas' system. Reservation charges are required to be paid regardless of volumes transported or stored. As of December 31, 2015 , over 51% of Northern Natural Gas' customers' entitlement in the Market Area have terms beyond 2018. As of December 31, 2015 , the weighted average remaining contract term for Northern Natural Gas' Market Area firm transportation contracts is approximately four years. 

Northern Natural Gas' Field Area customers consist primarily of energy marketing companies and midstream companies, which take advantage of the price spread opportunities created between Field Area supply points and the Field-Market Demarcation Point. In addition, there are a growing number of midstream customers that are delivering gas south to the Field Area Waha Hub market. The remaining Field Area transportation service is sold to power generators connected to Northern Natural Gas' system in Texas and New Mexico that are contracted on a long-term basis with terms that extend to at least 2019, and various LDCs, energy marketing companies and midstream companies for both connected and off-system markets. 

&#32;29 

Northern Natural Gas' storage services are provided through the operation of one underground natural gas storage field in Iowa, two underground natural gas storage facilities in Kansas and two LNG storage peaking units, one in Iowa and one in Minnesota. The three underground natural gas storage facilities and two LNG storage peaking units have a total firm service and operational storage cycle capacity of over 73 &#160; Bcf &#32;and over 2.0 Bcf &#32;per day of peak delivery capability. These storage facilities provide operational flexibility for the daily balancing of Northern Natural Gas' system and provide services to customers for their winter peaking and year-round load swing requirements. 

Northern Natural Gas has 59.3 Bcf &#32;of firm storage contracts with its cost-based and market-based services. Firm storage contracts with cost-based rates, representing 51.3 Bcf , have an average remaining contract term of six years and are contracted at maximum tariff rates. The remaining firm storage contracts with market-based rates, representing 8.0 Bcf , have an average remaining contract term of twelve years. 

Except for quantities of natural gas owned and managed for operational and system balancing purposes, Northern Natural Gas does not own the natural gas that is transported through its system. The sale of natural gas for operational and system balancing purposes accounts for the majority of the remaining operating revenue. 

During 2015 , Northern Natural Gas had three customers, including MidAmerican Energy, that each accounted for greater than 10% of its transportation and storage revenue and its ten largest customers accounted for 65% of its system-wide transportation and storage revenue. Northern Natural Gas has agreements with terms from 2017 to 2019 to retain its three largest customers' volumes. The loss of any of these significant customers, if not replaced, could have a material adverse effect on Northern Natural Gas. 

Northern Natural Gas' extensive pipeline system, which is interconnected with many interstate and intrastate pipelines in the national grid system, has access to multiple major supply basins. Direct access is available from producers in the Anadarko, Permian and Hugoton basins, some of which have recently experienced increased production from shale and tight sands formations adjacent to Northern Natural Gas' pipeline. Since 2011, the pipeline has connected 1,595,000 Dth &#32;per day of supply access from the Wolfberry shale formation in west Texas and from the Granite Wash tight sands formations in the Texas panhandle and in Oklahoma. Additionally, Northern Natural Gas has interconnections with several interstate pipelines and several intrastate pipelines with receipt, delivery, or bi-directional capabilities. Because of Northern Natural Gas' location and multiple interconnections it is able to access natural gas from other key production areas, such as the Rocky Mountain and western Canadian basins. The Rocky Mountain basins are accessed through interconnects with Trailblazer Pipeline Company, Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transmission, LLC, Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Company, LLC, Colorado Interstate Gas Company and Rockies Express Pipeline, LLC ("REX"). The western Canadian basins are accessed through interconnects with Northern Border Pipeline Company ("Northern Border"), Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership ("Great Lakes") and Viking Gas Transmission Company ("Viking"). This supply diversity and access to both stable and growing production areas provides significant flexibility to Northern Natural Gas' system and customers. 

Northern Natural Gas' system experiences significant seasonal swings in demand and revenue, with the highest demand and revenues typically occurring during the months of November through March. This seasonality provides Northern Natural Gas with opportunities to deliver additional value-added services, such as firm and interruptible storage services. As a result of Northern Natural Gas' geographic location in the middle of the United States and its many interconnections with other pipelines, Northern Natural Gas has the opportunity to augment its steady end user and LDC revenue by capitalizing on opportunities for shippers to reach additional markets, such as Chicago, Illinois, other parts of the Midwest, and Texas, through interconnects. 

Kern River 

Kern River , an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE , owns an interstate natural gas pipeline system that extends from supply areas in the Rocky Mountains to consuming markets in Utah, Nevada and California. Kern River &#32;provided 22% of California's demand for natural gas in 2014. Kern River's pipeline system consists of 1,700 miles of natural gas pipelines, including 1,400 miles of mainline section and 300 miles of common facilities, with a design capacity of 2,166,575 &#160; Dth &#32;per day. Kern River owns the entire mainline section, which extends from the system's point of origination near Opal, Wyoming, through the Central Rocky Mountains area into Daggett, California. The mainline section consists of 1,300 miles of 36-inch diameter pipeline and 100 miles of various laterals that connect to the mainline. The common facilities are jointly owned by Kern River and Mojave Pipeline Company ("Mojave") as tenants-in-common, and ownership may increase or decrease pursuant to the capital contributions made by each respective joint owner. Kern River has exclusive rights to 1,613,400 Dth &#32;per day of the common facilities' capacity, and Mojave has exclusive rights to 414,000 Dth &#32;per day of capacity. Except for quantities of natural gas owned for operational purposes, Kern River does not own the natural gas that is transported through its system. Kern River's transportation rates are cost-based. The rates are designed to provide Kern River with an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and earn a reasonable return on its investments. 

&#32;30 

95% of Kern River's design capacity of 2,166,575 &#32; Dth &#32;per day is contracted pursuant to long-term firm natural gas transportation service agreements, whereby Kern River receives natural gas on behalf of customers at designated receipt points and transports the natural gas on a firm basis to designated delivery points. In return for this service, each customer pays Kern River a fixed monthly reservation fee based on each customer's maximum daily quantity, which represents 94% of total operating revenue, and a commodity charge based on the actual amount of natural gas transported pursuant to its long-term firm natural gas transportation service agreements and Kern River's tariff. 

These long-term firm natural gas transportation service agreements expire between March 2017 and April 2033 and have a weighted-average remaining contract term of over eight years. Kern River's customers include electric utilities and natural gas distribution utilities, major oil and natural gas companies or affiliates of such companies, electricity generating companies, energy marketing and trading companies, and financial institutions. The utilities provide services in Utah, Nevada and California. As of December 31, 2015 , nearly 80% of the firm capacity under contract has primary delivery points in California, with the flexibility to access secondary delivery points in Nevada and Utah. 

During 2015 , Kern River had one customer, Nevada Power Company, an affiliate company, who accounted for greater than 10% of its revenue. The loss of this significant customer, if not replaced, could have a material adverse effect on Kern River. 

Competition 

The Pipeline Companies &#32;compete with other pipelines on the basis of cost, flexibility, reliability of service and overall customer service, with the end-user's decision being made primarily on the basis of delivered price, which includes both the natural gas commodity cost and its transportation cost. Natural gas also competes with alternative energy sources, including coal, nuclear energy, wind, geothermal, solar and fuel oil. Legislation and governmental regulations, the weather, the futures market, production costs and other factors beyond the control of the Pipeline Companies &#32;influence the price of the natural gas commodity. 

The natural gas industry is undergoing a significant shift in supply sources. Production from conventional sources continues to decline while production from unconventional sources, such as shale gas, is increasing. This shift will affect the supply patterns, the flows, the locational and seasonal natural gas price spreads and rates that can be charged on pipeline systems. The impact will vary among pipelines according to the location and the number of competitors attached to these new supply sources. 

Electric power generation has been the source of most of the growth in demand for natural gas over the last 10 years, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. The growth of natural gas in this sector is influenced by regulation, new sources of natural gas, competition with other energy sources, primarily coal, and increased consumption of electricity as a result of economic growth. Short-term market shifts have been driven by relative costs of coal-fueled generation versus natural gas-fueled generation. A long-term market shift away from the use of coal in power generation could be driven by environmental regulations. The future demand for natural gas could be increased by regulations limiting or discouraging coal use. However, natural gas demand could potentially be adversely affected by laws mandating or encouraging renewable power sources that produce fewer GHG emissions than natural gas. 

The Pipeline Companies ' ability to extend existing customer contracts, remarket expiring contracted capacity or market new capacity is dependent on competitive alternatives, the regulatory environment and the market supply and demand factors at the relevant dates these contracts are eligible to be renewed or extended. The duration of new or renegotiated contracts will be affected by current commodity and transportation prices, competitive conditions and customers' judgments concerning future market trends and volatility. 

Subject to regulatory requirements, the Pipeline Companies &#32;attempt to recontract or remarket capacity at the maximum rates allowed under their tariffs, although at times the Pipeline Companies &#32;discount these rates to remain competitive. The Pipeline Companies ' existing contracts mature at various times and in varying amounts of entitlement. The Pipeline Companies &#32;manage the recontracting process to mitigate the risk of a significant negative impact on operating revenue. 

Historically, the Pipeline Companies &#32;have been able to provide competitively priced services because of access to a variety of relatively low cost supply basins, cost control measures and the relatively high level of firm entitlement that is sold on a seasonal and annual basis, which lowers the per unit cost of transportation. To date, the Pipeline Companies &#32;have avoided significant pipeline system bypasses. 

&#32;31 

In December 2009, the FERC &#32;issued an order establishing revised rates for Kern River's initial long-term contracts ("Period One rates") and required that rates be established based on a levelized rate design for eligible customers that elect to take service following the expiration of their initial contracts ("Period Two rates"). The Period Two rates are lower because they are designed to recover only the remaining plant balances. Beginning in late 2011, certain of Kern River's contracts with Period One rates expired. To the extent that eligible customers elected not to contract for service at Period Two rates, the volumes were turned back and sold at market rates for varying terms. Of the customers that were eligible to take Period Two service beginning October 1, 2016, 97% elected to extend their contracts at maximum Period Two rates, with 184,528 Dth per day electing 10-year contracts and 410,763 Dth per day electing 15-year contracts. As of February 1, 2016, Kern River has sold 194,047 Dth &#32;per day of the total turned back volume of 259,503 Dth &#32;per day with an average remaining contract term of five years. The remaining turned back capacity is sold on a short term basis at market rates. 

Northern Natural Gas needs to compete aggressively to serve existing load and add new load. Northern Natural Gas has been successful in competing for a significant amount of the increased demand related to residential and commercial needs and the construction of new power plants and new fertilizer or other industrial plants. The growth related to utilities has historically been driven by population growth and increased commercial and industrial needs. Northern Natural Gas has been generally successful in negotiating increased transportation rates for customers who received discounted service when such contract terms are renegotiated and extended. 

Northern Natural Gas' major competitors in the Market Area include ANR Pipeline Company, Northern Border, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America LLC, Great Lakes and Viking. In the Field Area, where the vast majority of Northern Natural Gas' capacity is used for transportation services provided on a short-term firm basis, Northern Natural Gas competes with a large number of interstate and intrastate pipeline companies. 

Northern Natural Gas' attractive competitive position relative to other pipelines in the upper Midwest was reinforced during the colder than normal winter of 2013-2014. Northern Natural Gas' customers' ability to access multiple supply basins has been critical to customers managing their reliability and supply costs. Northern Natural Gas' Field Area has access to diverse Mid-Continent, Permian and Rockies supplies with resulting prices delivered to Market Area customers at Demarcation significantly less than their alternative supply source. 

Northern Natural Gas expects the current level of Field Area contracting to continue in the foreseeable future, as Market Area customers presently need to purchase competitively-priced supplies from the Field Area to support their existing and growth demand requirements. However, the revenue received from these Field Area contracts is expected to vary in relationship to the difference, or "spread," in natural gas prices between the MidContinent and Permian Regions and the price of the alternative supplies that are available to Northern Natural Gas' Market Area. This spread affects the value of the Field Area transportation capacity because natural gas from the MidContinent and Permian Regions that is transported through Northern Natural Gas' Field Area competes directly with natural gas delivered directly into the Market Area from Canada and other supply areas, including new shale gas producing areas outside of the Field Area. 

Kern River competes with various interstate pipelines in developing expansion projects and entering into long-term agreements to serve market growth in Southern California; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Salt Lake City, Utah. Kern River also competes with various interstate pipelines and their customers to market unutilized capacity under shorter term transactions. Kern River provides its customers with supply diversity through interconnections with pipelines such as Northwest Pipeline GP, Colorado Interstate Gas Company, Overland Trails Transmission, LLC, Questar Pipeline Company, and Questar Overthrust Pipeline Company; storage facilities such as Ryckman Creek Resources, LLC and Clear Creek Storage Company, LLC; and through indirect pipeline interconnections with Wyoming Interstate Company and REX. These interconnections, in addition to the direct interconnections to natural gas processing facilities, allow Kern River to access natural gas reserves in Colorado, northwestern New Mexico, Wyoming, Utah and the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. 

Kern River is the only interstate pipeline that presently delivers natural gas directly from the Rocky Mountain gas supply region to end-users in the Southern California market. This enables direct connect customers to avoid paying a "rate stack" (i.e., additional transportation costs attributable to the movement from one or more interstate pipeline systems to an intrastate system within California). Kern River's levelized rate structure and access to upstream pipelines, storage facilities and economic Rocky Mountain gas reserves increases its competitiveness and attractiveness to end-users. Kern River believes it has an advantage relative to other interstate pipelines serving Southern California because its relatively new pipeline can be economically expanded and has required significantly less capital expenditures and ongoing maintenance than other systems to comply with the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. Kern River's favorable market position is tied to the availability of gas reserves in the Rocky Mountain area, an area that in recent years has attracted considerable expansion of pipeline capacity serving markets other than Southern California and Nevada.

BHE TRANSMISSION 

AltaLink 

ALP , an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BHE acquired on December 1, 2014, is a regulated electric transmission-only company headquartered in Alberta, Canada serving approximately 85% &#32;of Alberta's population. ALP &#32;connects generation plants to major load centers, cities and large industrial plants throughout its 87,000 square mile service territory, which covers a diverse geographic area including most major urban centers in central and southern Alberta. ALP 's transmission facilities, consisting of approximately 8,100 &#32;miles of transmission lines and 300 &#32;substations as of December 31, 2015 , are an integral part of the Alberta Integrated Electric System ("AIES"). 

The AIES is a network or grid of transmission facilities operating at high voltages ranging from 69kV to 500kV. The grid delivers electricity from generating units across Alberta, Canada through approximately 15,000 miles of transmission and over 600 substations. The AIES is interconnected to British Columbia's transmission system that links Alberta with the North American western interconnected system. 

ALP &#32;is a transmission facility owner within the electricity industry in Alberta and is permitted to charge a tariff rate for the use of its transmission facilities. Such tariff rates are established on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow ALP &#32;an opportunity to recover its costs of providing services and to earn a reasonable return on its investments. Transmission tariffs are approved by the AUC &#32;and are collected from the AESO . 

The electricity industry in Alberta consists of four principal segments. Generators sell wholesale power into the power pool operated by the AESO &#32;and through direct contractual arrangements. Alberta's transmission system or grid is composed of high voltage power lines and related facilities that transmit electricity from generating facilities to distribution networks and directly connected end-users. Distribution facility owners are regulated by the AUC &#32;and are responsible for arranging for, or providing, regulated rate and regulated default supply services to convey electricity from transmission systems and distribution-connected generators to end-use customers. Retailers can procure energy through the power pool, through direct contractual arrangements with energy suppliers or ownership of generation facilities and arrange for its distribution to end-use customers. 

In November 2015 the AESO finalized and made available the 2015 Long-Term Transmission Plan ("LTP"). The AESO mandate is defined in the Electric Utilities Act and its regulations, and requires the AESO to assess both current and future needs of Alberta&#8217;s interconnected electrical system. The 2015 LTP is based on the AESO's forecast of load and generation as documented in the 2014 Long Term Outlook ("LTO"). The AESO 2015 LTP recognizes the province's economic outlook has changed significantly since then. Current economic conditions have resulted in slower provincial growth. The AESO's current long range plan does not include any consideration for the Government of Alberta&#8217;s Climate Leadership Plan. 

In its general tariff application for 2015 and 2016, filed November 2014, ALP forecasted C$1.5 billion and C$1.1 billion, respectively, gross direct assigned capital expenditures based on the long-range plan released by the AESO &#32;in January 2014, using a risk-adjusted capital forecasting model that has been previously accepted by the AUC . In October 2015, the forecast expenditures were updated to C$961 million for 2015 and C$538 million for 2016. ALP 's actual capital program may vary from its regulatory filings, depending on the timing of regulatory approvals, directions from the AESO , and other factors beyond ALP 's control. 

BHE U.S. Transmission 

BHE U.S. Transmission &#32;is engaged in various joint ventures to develop, own and operate transmission assets and is pursuing additional investment opportunities in the United States. Currently, BHE U.S. Transmission &#32;has two joint ventures with transmission assets that are operational. 

BHE U.S. Transmission &#32;indirectly owns a 50% interest in ETT, along with subsidiaries of American Electric Power Company, Inc. ("AEP"). ETT owns and operates electric transmission assets in the ERCOT &#32;and, as of December 31, 2015 , had total assets of $2.7 billion. ETT is regulated by the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which has approved rates based on a 9.96% after tax rate of return on equity and a debt to equity capital structure of 60:40. A total of $2.3 billion of transmission projects were in-service as of December 31, 2015 , with $0.6 billion of projects forecast to be completed in 2016 through 2019. ETT's transmission system includes approximately 1,000 &#32;line miles of transmission and 30 substations as of December 31, 2015 . 

BHE U.S. Transmission &#32;indirectly owns a 25% interest in Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC, a joint venture with AEP and Westar Energy, Inc., to build, own and operate a 108-mile, 345 kV transmission project in Kansas. The necessary approvals from the FERC &#32;have been received, including a return on equity, inclusive of incentives, of 12.80% and a debt to equity capital structure of 50:50. The project cost $158 million and was fully placed in-service in November 2014.

HOMESERVICES 

HomeServices, a majority-owned subsidiary of BHE , is the second-largest full-service residential real estate brokerage firm in the United States. In addition to providing traditional residential real estate brokerage services, HomeServices offers other integrated real estate services, including mortgage originations and mortgage banking; title and closing services; property and casualty insurance; home warranties; relocation services; and other home-related services. HomeServices' real estate brokerage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations because more home sale transactions tend to close during the second and third quarters of the year. As a result, HomeServices' operating results and profitability are typically higher in the second and third quarters relative to the remainder of the year. HomeServices' owned brokerages currently operate in over 475 offices in 27 states with over 26,000 sales associates under 31 brand names. The United States residential real estate brokerage business is subject to the general real estate market conditions, is highly competitive and consists of numerous local brokers and agents in each market seeking to represent sellers and buyers in residential real estate transactions. In October 2014, HomeServices acquired the remaining 50.1% of HomeServices Lending, a mortgage origination company. 

In October 2012, HomeServices acquired a 66.7% interest in one of the largest residential real estate brokerage franchise networks in the United States, which offers and sells independently owned and operated residential real estate brokerage franchises. The noncontrolling interest member has the right to put the remaining 33.3% interest in the franchise business to HomeServices after March 2015 and HomeServices has the right to purchase the remaining 33.3% interest in the franchise business after March 2018 at an option exercise formula based on historical financial performance. 

HomeServices' franchise network currently includes over 400 &#32;franchisees in over 1,400 brokerage offices in 48 &#32;states with over 44,000 sales associates under three brand names. In exchange for certain fees, HomeServices provides the right to use the Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices, Prudential or Real Living brand names and other related service marks, as well as providing orientation programs, training and consultation services, advertising programs and other services. In 2013, HomeServices began rebranding certain of its Prudential franchisees as Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices and as of December 31, 2015 , over 220 franchisees of the original 330 identified Prudential brokers, representing 83% of the 2012 revenue, had been rebranded.

GENERAL REGULATION 

BHE 's regulated subsidiaries and certain affiliates are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation, which significantly influences their operating environment, prices charged to customers, capital structure, costs and, ultimately, their ability to recover costs. In addition to the discussion contained herein regarding general regulation, refer to "Regulatory Matters" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding certain regulatory matters. 

Domestic Regulated Public Utility Subsidiaries 

The Utilities &#32;are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The more significant aspects of this regulatory framework are described below. 

State Regulation 

Historically, state regulatory commissions have established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, which are designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility's reasonable costs of providing services, including a fair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. In addition to return on investment, a utility's cost of service generally reflects a representative level of prudent expenses, including cost of sales, operating expense, depreciation and amortization, and income and other tax expense, reduced by wholesale electricity and other revenue. The allowed operating expenses are typically based on actual historical costs adjusted for known and measurable or forecasted changes. State regulatory commissions may adjust cost of service for various reasons, including pursuant to a review of: (a) the utility's revenue and expenses during a defined test period and (b) the utility's level of investment. State regulatory commissions typically have the authority to review and change rates on their own initiative; however, they may also initiate reviews at the request of a utility, utility customers or organizations representing groups of customers. The utility and such parties, however, may agree with one another not to request a review of or changes to rates for a specified period of time. 

The retail electric rates of the Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, including generation, transmission and distribution services. The Utilities have established energy cost adjustment mechanisms and other cost recovery mechanisms in certain states, which help mitigate their exposure to changes in costs from those assumed in establishing base rates. 

With certain limited exceptions, the Utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in some jurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Under Oregon law, PacifiCorp has the exclusive right and obligation to provide electricity distribution services to all residential and nonresidential customers within its allocated service territory; however, nonresidential customers have the right to choose an alternative provider of energy supply. The impact of this right on PacifiCorp's consolidated financial results has not been material. In Washington, state law does not provide for exclusive service territory allocation. PacifiCorp's service territory in Washington is surrounded by other public utilities with whom PacifiCorp has from time to time entered into service area agreements under the jurisdiction of the WUTC. In Illinois, state law has established a competitive environment so that all Illinois customers are free to choose their retail service supplier. For customers that choose an alternative retail energy supplier, MidAmerican Energy continues to have an ongoing obligation to deliver the supplier's energy to the retail customer. MidAmerican Energy bills the retail customer for such delivery services. MidAmerican Energy also has an obligation to serve customers at regulated cost-based rates and has a continuing obligation to serve customers who have not selected a competitive electricity provider. To date, there has been no significant loss of customers in Illinois. In Nevada, state law allows retail electric customers with an average annual load of one MW or more to file a letter of intent and application with the PUCN to acquire electric energy and ancillary services from another energy supplier. The law requires customers wishing to choose a new supplier to receive the approval of the PUCN to meet public interest standards. In particular, departing customers must secure new energy resources that are not under contract to the Nevada Utilities, the departure must not burden the Nevada Utilities with increased costs or cause any remaining customers to pay increased costs, and the departing customers must pay their portion of any deferred energy balances. Also, the Utilities are individually evaluating how best to integrate distributed generation resources into their service and rate design, including considering such factors as maintaining high levels of customer safety and service reliability, minimizing adverse cost impacts and fairly allocating costs among all customers. 

Also in Nevada, large natural gas customers using 12,000 therms per month with fuel switching capability are allowed by tariff to participate in the incentive natural gas rate tariff. Once a service agreement has been executed, a customer can compare natural gas prices under this tariff to alternative energy sources and choose its source of natural gas. In addition, natural gas customers using greater than 1,000 therms per day have the ability to secure their own natural gas supplies under the gas transportation tariff.

MidAmerican Energy &#32; 

Under Iowa law, there are two options for temporary collection of higher rates following the filing of a request for a base rate increase. Collection can begin, subject to refund, either (1) within 10 days of filing, without IUB review, or (2) 90 days after filing, with approval by the IUB, depending upon the ratemaking principles and precedents utilized. In either case, if the IUB has not issued a final order within ten months after the filing date, the temporary rates become final and any difference between the requested rate increase and the temporary rates may then be collected subject to refund until receipt of a final order. Under Illinois law, new base rates may become effective 45 days after the filing of a request with the ICC, or earlier with ICC approval. The ICC has authority to suspend the proposed new rates, subject to hearing, for a period not to exceed approximately eleven months after filing. South Dakota law authorizes the SDPUC to suspend new base rates for up to six months during the pendency of rate proceedings; however, a utility may implement all or a portion of the proposed new rates six months after the filing of a request for a rate increase subject to refund pending a final order in the proceeding. 

Iowa law also permits rate-regulated utilities to seek ratemaking principles with the IUB prior to the construction of certain types of new generating facilities. Pursuant to this law, MidAmerican Energy has applied for and obtained IUB ratemaking principles orders for a 484-MW (MidAmerican Energy's share) coal-fueled generating facility, a 495-MW combined cycle natural gas-fueled generating facility and 4,048 MW (nominal ratings) of wind-powered generating facilities, including 599 MW (nominal ratings) under construction, as of December 31, 2015 . These ratemaking principles established cost caps for the projects and authorized a fixed rate of return on equity for the respective generating facilities over the regulatory life of the facilities in any future Iowa rate proceeding. As of December 31, 2015 , the generating facilities in-service totaled $4.9 billion, or 42%, of MidAmerican Energy's regulated property, plant and equipment, net, and were subject to these ratemaking principles at a weighted average return on equity of 11.9% with a weighted average remaining life of 24 years. 

Under its current Iowa, Illinois and South Dakota electric tariffs, MidAmerican Energy is allowed to recover fluctuations in electric energy costs for its retail electric generation through fuel, or energy, cost adjustment mechanisms. The Iowa mechanism also includes production tax credits associated with wind-powered generation placed in-service prior to 2013. Eligibility for production tax credits associated with MidAmerican Energy's earliest projects began expiring in 2014. Additionally, MidAmerican Energy has transmission adjustment clauses to recover certain transmission charges related to retail customers in Iowa and Illinois. The adjustment mechanisms reduce the regulatory lag for the recovery of energy and transmission costs related to retail electric customers in these jurisdictions. 

Of the wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service as of December 31, 2015, 1,212 MW (nominal ratings) have not been included in the determination of MidAmerican Energy&#8217;s Iowa retail electric base rates. In accordance with the related ratemaking principles, until such time as these generation assets are reflected in rates and ceasing thereafter, MidAmerican Energy is to reduce its Iowa energy adjustment clause recoveries by $5 million in 2015, $9 million in 2016 and $12 million for each calendar year thereafter. 

MidAmerican Energy's cost of gas is collected for each jurisdiction in its gas rates through a uniform PGA, which is updated monthly to reflect changes in actual costs. Subject to prudence reviews, the PGA accomplishes a pass-through of MidAmerican Energy's cost of gas to its customers and, accordingly, has no direct effect on net income. MidAmerican Energy's DSM &#32;program costs are collected through separately established rates that are adjusted annually based on actual and expected costs, as approved by the respective state regulatory commission. As such, recovery of DSM &#32;program costs has no direct impact on net income. 

NV Energy (Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific) 

Nevada statutes require the Nevada Utilities to file electric general rate cases at least once every three years with the PUCN. Sierra Pacific may also file natural gas general rate cases with the PUCN. The Nevada Utilities are also subject to a two-part fuel and purchased power adjustment mechanism. The Nevada Utilities make quarterly filings to reset BTER , based on the last 12 months of fuel and purchased power costs. The difference between actual fuel and purchased power costs and the revenue collected in the BTER &#32;is deferred into a balancing account. During required annual DEAA &#32;proceedings, the prudence of fuel and purchased power costs is reviewed, and if any costs are disallowed on such grounds, the disallowances will be incorporated into the next subsequent quarterly BTER &#32;rate change. Additionally, Nevada regulations allow an electric or natural gas utility that adjusts its BTER &#32;on a quarterly basis to request PUCN approval to make quarterly changes to its DEAA &#32;rate if the request is in the public interest. The Nevada Utilities received approval from the PUCN and file quarterly adjustments to the DEAA &#32;rate to clear amounts deferred into the balancing account. At the same time the Nevada Utilities make the annual DEAA &#32;filing, they also (a) seek a determination that energy efficiency program expenditures were reasonable, (b) request that the PUCN reset base and amortization energy efficiency program rates, and (c) request that the Commission reset base and energy efficiency implementation (formerly lost revenue) rates. When the Nevada Utilities&#8217; earned rate of return for a calendar year exceeds the rate of return used to set base tariff general rates, they are obligated to refund energy efficiency implementation revenue previously collected for that year.

Federal Regulation 

The FERC &#32;is an independent agency with broad authority to implement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act ("NGA"), the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ("Energy Policy Act") and other federal statutes. The FERC &#32;regulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for the expansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention; securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC &#32;also has the enforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and orders issued under the Federal Power Act. The Utilities have implemented programs and procedures that facilitate and monitor compliance with the FERC 's regulations described below. MidAmerican Energy is also subject to regulation by the NRC pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended ("Atomic Energy Act"), with respect to its ownership interest in the Quad Cities Station. 

Wholesale Electricity and Capacity 

The FERC &#32;regulates the Utilities' rates charged to wholesale customers for electricity &#32; and transmission capacity and related services. Most of the Utilities' wholesale electricity sales and purchases occur under market-based pricing allowed by the FERC &#32;and are therefore subject to market volatility. 

The Utilities' authority to sell electricity in wholesale electricity markets at market-based rates is subject to triennial reviews conducted by the FERC . Accordingly, the Utilities are required to submit triennial filings to the FERC that demonstrate a lack of market power over sales of wholesale electricity and electric generation capacity in their respective market areas. PacifiCorp's most recent triennial filing was made in June 2013 and is currently pending before the FERC . On December 9, 2014, the FERC &#32;issued an order requesting that the BHE subsidiaries having authority to sell power and energy at market-based rates, including the Utilities, show cause why their market-based rate authority remains just and reasonable following BHE's acquisition of NV Energy. This proceeding, which is focused on the western interconnection, remains ongoing. MidAmerican Energy's most recent triennial filings were submitted in June 2014 for the FERC -defined Northeast Region and December 2014 for the FERC -defined Central Region. The June 2014 triennial filing was accepted by the FERC &#32;in January 2015, and the December 2014 triennial filing was accepted by the FERC &#32;in November 2015. The Nevada Utilities' most recent triennial filing was made in July 2013 and approved by the FERC &#32;in April 2014. In July 2016, the Nevada Utilities plan to make their triennial filing. Under the FERC 's market-based rules, the Utilities must also file with the FERC &#32;a notice of change in status when there is a change in the conditions that the FERC &#32;relied upon in granting market-based rate authority. 

Transmission 

PacifiCorp's and the Nevada Utilities' wholesale transmission services are regulated by the FERC &#32;under cost-based regulation subject to PacifiCorp's and the Nevada Utilities' OATT, respectively. These services are offered on a non-discriminatory basis, which means that all potential customers are provided an equal opportunity to access the transmission system. PacifiCorp's and the Nevada Utilities' transmission business is managed and operated independently from its wholesale marketing business in accordance with the FERC 's Standards of Conduct. PacifiCorp and the Nevada Utilities have made several required compliance filings in accordance with these rules. 

In December 2011, PacifiCorp adopted a cost-based formula rate under its OATT for its transmission services. Cost-based formula rates are intended to be an effective means of recovering PacifiCorp's investments and associated costs of its transmission system without the need to file rate cases with the FERC , although the formula rate results are subject to discovery and challenges by the FERC &#32;and intervenors. A significant portion of these services are provided to PacifiCorp's energy supply management function. 

MidAmerican Energy participates in the MISO as a transmission-owning member. Accordingly, the MISO is the transmission provider under its FERC -approved OATT. While the MISO is responsible for directing the operation of MidAmerican Energy's transmission system, MidAmerican Energy retains ownership of its transmission assets and, therefore, is subject to the FERC 's reliability standards discussed below. MidAmerican Energy's transmission business is managed and operated independently from its wholesale marketing business in accordance with the FERC &#32;Standards of Conduct. 

&#32;39 

MidAmerican Energy has approval from the MISO to construct and own four Multi-Value Projects ("MVPs") located in Iowa and Illinois that will add approximately 245 miles of 345 kV transmission line to MidAmerican Energy's transmission system. The MISO OATT allows for broad cost allocation for MidAmerican Energy's MVPs, including similar MVPs of other MISO participants. Accordingly, a significant portion of the revenue requirement associated with MidAmerican Energy's MVP investments will be shared with other MISO participants based on the MISO's cost allocation methodology and a portion of the revenue requirement of the other participants' MVPs will be allocated to MidAmerican Energy. Additionally, MidAmerican Energy has approval from the FERC &#32;to include 100% of construction work in progress in the determination of rates for its MVPs and to use a forward-looking rate structure for all of its transmission investments and costs. The transmission assets and financial results of MidAmerican Energy's MVPs are excluded from the determination of its retail electric rates. 

The FERC &#32;has established an extensive number of mandatory reliability standards developed by the NERC and the WECC, including planning and operations, critical infrastructure protection and regional standards. Compliance, enforcement and monitoring oversight of these standards is carried out by the FERC , the NERC and the WECC for PacifiCorp, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific and the Midwest Reliability Organization for MidAmerican Energy. 

Hydroelectric 

The FERC &#32;licenses and regulates the operation of hydroelectric systems, including license compliance and dam safety programs. Most of PacifiCorp's hydroelectric generating facilities are licensed by the FERC &#32;as major systems under the Federal Power Act, and certain of these systems are licensed under the Oregon Hydroelectric Act. Under the Federal Power Act, 16 dams associated with PacifiCorp's hydroelectric generating facilities licensed with the FERC &#32;are classified as "high hazard potential," meaning it is probable in the event of dam failure that loss of human life in the downstream population could occur. The FERC &#32;provides guidelines utilized by PacifiCorp in development of public safety programs consisting of a dam safety program and emergency action plans. 

PacifiCorp's Klamath River hydroelectric system is the only significant hydroelectric system for which PacifiCorp is currently engaged in the relicensing process with the FERC . Refer to Note 16 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for an update regarding hydroelectric relicensing for PacifiCorp's Klamath River hydroelectric system. 

Nuclear Regulatory Commission 

General 

MidAmerican Energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC with respect to its license and 25% ownership interest in Quad Cities Station. Exelon Generation, the operator and 75% owner of Quad Cities Station, is under contract with MidAmerican Energy to secure and keep in effect all necessary NRC licenses and authorizations. 

The NRC regulates the granting of permits and licenses for the construction and operation of nuclear generating stations and regularly inspects such stations for compliance with applicable laws, regulations and license terms. Current licenses for Quad Cities Station provide for operation until December 14, 2032. The NRC review and regulatory process covers, among other things, operations, maintenance, and environmental and radiological aspects of such stations. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under such Act or the terms of such licenses. 

Federal regulations provide that any nuclear operating facility may be required to cease operation if the NRC determines there are deficiencies in state, local or utility emergency preparedness plans relating to such facility, and the deficiencies are not corrected. Exelon Generation has advised MidAmerican Energy that an emergency preparedness plan for Quad Cities Station has been approved by the NRC. Exelon Generation has also advised MidAmerican Energy that state and local plans relating to Quad Cities Station have been approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 

The NRC also regulates the decommissioning of nuclear powered generating facilities, including the planning and funding for the eventual decommissioning of the facilities. In accordance with these regulations, MidAmerican Energy submits a biennial report to the NRC providing reasonable assurance that funds will be available to pay its share of the costs of decommissioning Quad Cities Station. MidAmerican Energy has established a trust for the investment of funds collected for nuclear decommissioning of Quad Cities Station. The decommissioning costs are included in base rates in MidAmerican Energy's Iowa tariffs. 

&#32;40 

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 ("NWPA"), the U.S. Department of Energy ("DOE") is responsible for the selection and development of repositories for, and the permanent disposal of, spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastes. Exelon Generation, as required by the NWPA, signed a contract with the DOE under which the DOE was to receive spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste for disposal beginning not later than January 1998. The DOE did not begin receiving spent nuclear fuel on the scheduled date and remains unable to receive such fuel and waste. The costs to be incurred by the DOE for disposal activities were previously being financed by fees charged to owners and generators of the waste. In accordance with a 2013 ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ("D.C. Circuit"), the DOE, in May 2014, provided notice that, effective May 16, 2014, the spent nuclear fuel disposal fee would be zero. In 2004, Exelon Generation, reached a settlement with the DOE concerning the DOE's failure to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel in 1998. As a result, Quad Cities Station has been billing the DOE, and the DOE is obligated to reimburse the station for all station costs incurred due to the DOE's delay. Exelon Generation has completed construction of an interim spent fuel storage installation ("ISFSI") at Quad Cities Station to store spent nuclear fuel in dry casks in order to free space in the storage pool. The first pad at the ISFSI is expected to facilitate storage of casks to support operations at Quad Cities Station until at least 2020. The first storage in a dry cask commenced in November 2005. By 2020, Exelon Generation plans to add a second pad to the ISFSI to accommodate storage of spent nuclear fuel through the end of operations at Quad Cities Station. 

Nuclear Insurance 

MidAmerican Energy maintains financial protection against catastrophic loss associated with its interest in Quad Cities Station through a combination of insurance purchased by Exelon Generation, insurance purchased directly by MidAmerican Energy, and the mandatory industry-wide loss funding mechanism afforded under the Price-Anderson Amendments Act of 1988, which was amended and extended by the Energy Policy Act. The general types of coverage maintained are: nuclear liability, property damage or loss and nuclear worker liability, as discussed below. 

Exelon Generation purchases private market nuclear liability insurance for Quad Cities Station in the maximum available amount of $375 million, which includes coverage for MidAmerican Energy's ownership. In accordance with Price-Anderson, excess liability protection above that amount is provided by a mandatory industry-wide Secondary Financial Protection program under which the licensees of nuclear generating facilities could be assessed for liability incurred due to a serious nuclear incident at any commercial nuclear reactor in the United States. Currently, MidAmerican Energy's aggregate maximum potential share of an assessment for Quad Cities Station is approximately $64 million per incident, payable in installments not to exceed $10 million annually. 

The property insurance covers property damage, stabilization and decontamination of the facility, disposal of the decontaminated material and premature decommissioning arising out of a covered loss. For Quad Cities Station, Exelon Generation purchases primary and excess property insurance protection for the combined interests in Quad Cities Station, with coverage limits totaling $2.1 billion. MidAmerican Energy also directly purchases extra expense coverage for its share of replacement power and other extra expenses in the event of a covered accidental outage at Quad Cities Station. The property and related coverages purchased directly by MidAmerican Energy and by Exelon Generation, which includes the interests of MidAmerican Energy, are underwritten by an industry mutual insurance company and contain provisions for retrospective premium assessments to be called upon based on the industry mutual board of directors' discretion for adverse loss experience. Currently, the maximum retrospective amounts that could be assessed against MidAmerican Energy from industry mutual policies for its obligations associated with Quad Cities Station total $9 million. 

The master nuclear worker liability coverage, which is purchased by Exelon Generation for Quad Cities Station, is an industry-wide guaranteed-cost policy with an aggregate limit of $375 million for the nuclear industry as a whole, which is in effect to cover tort claims of workers in nuclear-related industries. 

United States Mine Safety 

PacifiCorp's mining operations are regulated by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration, which administers federal mine safety and health laws and regulations, and state regulatory agencies. The Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration has the statutory authority to institute a civil action for relief, including a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining order or other appropriate order against a mine operator who fails to pay penalties or fines for violations of federal mine safety standards. Federal law requires PacifiCorp to have a written emergency response plan specific to each underground mine it operates, which is reviewed by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration every six months, and to have at least two mine rescue teams located within one hour of each mine. Information regarding PacifiCorp's mine safety violations and other legal matters disclosed in accordance with Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Reform Act &#32;is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-K. 

&#32;41 

Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Subsidiaries 

The Pipeline Companies &#32;are regulated by the FERC , pursuant to the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC &#32;regulates, among other items, rates; charges; terms and conditions of service; and the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities, including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities. The Pipeline Companies &#32;hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC , which authorize them to construct, operate and maintain their pipeline and related facilities and services. 

FERC &#32;regulations and the Pipeline Companies ' tariffs allow each of the Pipeline Companies &#32;to charge approved rates for the services set forth in their respective tariff. Generally, these rates are a function of the cost of providing services to their customers, including prudently incurred operations and maintenance expenses, taxes, interest, depreciation and amortization and a reasonable return on their investments. Both Northern Natural Gas' and Kern River's tariff rates have been developed under a rate design methodology whereby substantially all of their fixed costs, including a return on invested capital and income taxes, are collected through reservation charges, which are paid by firm transportation and storage customers regardless of volumes shipped. Commodity charges, which are paid only with respect to volumes actually shipped, are designed to recover the remaining, primarily variable, costs. Kern River's reservation rates have historically been approved using a "levelized" cost-of-service methodology so that the rate remains constant over the levelization period. This levelized cost of service has been achieved by using a FERC -approved depreciation schedule in which depreciation increases as interest expense and return on equity amounts decrease. Both Northern Natural Gas' and Kern River's rates are subject to change in future general rate proceedings. 

Natural gas transportation companies may not grant any undue preference to any customer. FERC &#32;regulations also restrict each pipeline's marketing affiliates' access to certain non-public information regarding their affiliated interstate natural gas transmission pipelines. 

Interstate natural gas pipelines are also subject to regulations administered by the Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency within the United States Department of Transportation ("DOT"). Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended ("NGPSA"), which establishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas facilities, and requires an entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such plans. Major amendments to the NGPSA include the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 ("2002 Act"), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 ("2006 Act") and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 ("2011 Act"). 

The 2002 Act established additional safety and pipeline integrity regulations for all natural gas pipelines in high-consequence areas. The 2002 Act imposed major new requirements in the areas of operator qualifications, risk analysis and integrity management. The 2002 Act mandated more frequent periodic inspection or testing of natural gas pipelines in high-consequence areas, which are locations where the potential consequences of a natural gas pipeline accident may be significant or may do considerable harm to persons or property. Pursuant to the 2002 Act, the DOT promulgated new regulations that require natural gas pipeline operators to develop comprehensive integrity management programs, to identify applicable threats to natural gas pipeline segments that could impact high-consequence areas, to assess these segments, and to provide ongoing mitigation and monitoring. The regulations required that all baseline high-consequence area segments be assessed by December 17, 2012 and require recurring inspections every seven years thereafter. Based on the Pipeline Companies ' extensive compliance efforts, they have completed all required high-consequence area pipeline baseline integrity assessments. Kern River also completed the required in-line inspections in early 2011 on that portion of its pipeline system required by the conditions associated with a special permit which allowed for an increase to the maximum allowable operating pressure. 

The 2006 Act required pipeline operators to institute human factors management plans for personnel employed in pipeline control centers. DOT regulations published pursuant to the 2006 Act required development and implementation of written control room management procedures. 

The 2011 Act was a response to natural gas pipeline incidents, most notably the San Bruno natural gas pipeline explosion that occurred in September 2010 in California. The 2011 Act increased the maximum allowable civil penalties for violations, directs operator assistance for Federal authorities conducting investigations and authorized the DOT to hire additional inspection and enforcement personnel. The 2011 Act also directed the DOT to study several topics, including the definition of high-consequence areas, the use of automatic shutoff valves in high-consequence areas, expansion of integrity management requirements beyond high-consequence areas, and cast iron pipe replacement. The studies are complete, and the BHE Pipeline Group &#32;anticipate notices of proposed rules at some point in 2016 on each of the areas studied. The BHE Pipeline Group &#32;cannot currently assess the potential cost of compliance with new rules and regulations under the 2011 Act. 

&#32;42 

The DOT and related state agencies routinely audit and inspect the pipeline facilities for compliance with their regulations. The Pipeline Companies &#32;conduct internal audits of their facilities every four years; with more frequent reviews of those deemed higher risk. The Pipeline Companies &#32;also conduct preliminary audits in advance of agency audits. Compliance issues that arise during these audits or during the normal course of business are addressed on a timely basis. The Pipeline Companies &#32;believe their pipeline systems comply in all material respects with the NGPSA and with DOT regulations issued pursuant to the NGPSA. 

Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies 

The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies, as holders of electricity distribution licenses, are subject to regulation by GEMA. GEMA regulates distribution network operators ("DNOs") within the terms of the Electricity Act 1989 and the terms of DNO licenses, which are revocable with 25 years notice. Under the Electricity Act 1989, GEMA has a duty to ensure that DNOs can finance their regulated activities and DNOs have a duty to maintain an investment grade credit rating. GEMA discharges certain of its duties through its staff within Ofgem. Each of fourteen licensed DNOs distributes electricity from the national grid transmission system to end users within its respective distribution services area. 

DNOs are subject to price controls, enforced by Ofgem, that limit the revenue that may be recovered and retained from their electricity distribution activities. The regulatory regime that has been applied to electricity distributors in Great Britain encourages companies to look for efficiency gains in order to improve profits. The distribution price control formula also adjusts the revenue received by DNOs to reflect a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the rate of inflation (as measured by the United Kingdom's Retail Prices Index) and the quality of service delivered by the licensee's distribution system. The current price control, Electricity Distribution 1 ("ED1"), has been set for a period of eight years, starting April 1, 2015, although the formula has been, and may be, reviewed by the regulator following public consultation. The procedure and methodology adopted at a price control review are at the reasonable discretion of Ofgem. Ofgem's judgment of the future allowed revenue of licensees is likely to take into account, among other things: 

&#8226; 

the actual operating and capital costs of each of the licensees; 

&#8226; 

the operating and capital costs that each of the licensees would incur if it were as efficient as, in Ofgem's judgment, the more efficient licensees; 

&#8226; 

the actual value of certain costs which are judged to be beyond the control of the licensees; 

&#8226; 

the taxes that each licensee is expected to pay; 

&#8226; 

the regulatory value ascribed to the expenditures that have been incurred in the past and the efficient expenditures that are to be incurred in the forthcoming regulatory period; 

&#8226; 

the rate of return to be allowed on expenditures that make up the regulatory asset value; 

&#8226; 

the financial ratios of each of the licensees and the license requirement for each licensee to maintain investment grade status; 

&#8226; 

an allowance in respect of the repair of the pension deficits in the defined benefit pension schemes sponsored by each of the licensees; and 

&#8226; 

any under- or over-recoveries of revenues, relative to allowed revenues, in the previous price control period. 

A number of incentive schemes also operate within the current price control period to encourage DNOs to provide an appropriate quality of service to end users. This includes specified payments to be made for failures to meet prescribed standards of service. The aggregate of these guaranteed standards payments is uncapped, but may be excused in certain prescribed circumstances that are generally beyond the control of the DNO. 

A new price control can be implemented by GEMA without the consent of the DNO, but if a licensee disagrees with a change to its license it can appeal the matter to the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority ("CMA"), as can certain other parties. Any appeals must be notified within 20 working days of the license modification by GEMA. If the CMA determines that the appellant has relevant standing, then the statute requires that the CMA complete its process within six months, or in some exceptional circumstances seven months. The Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies appealed Ofgem's proposals for the resetting of the formula that commenced April 1, 2015, as did one other party, and the CMA subsequently revised GEMA's decision. 

&#32;43 

The current electricity distribution price control became effective April 1, 2015 and is due to terminate on March 31, 2023, and will be immediately replaced with a new price control (in line with GEMA's current timetable). This price control is the first to be set for electricity distribution in Great Britain since Ofgem completed its review of network regulation (known as the RPI-X @ 20 project). The key changes to the price control calculations, compared to those used in previous price controls are that: 

&#8226; 

the period over which new regulatory assets are depreciated is being gradually lengthened, from 20 years to 45 years, with the change being phased over eight years; 

&#8226; 

allowed revenues will be adjusted during the price control period, rather than at the next price control review, to partially reflect cost variances relative to cost allowances; 

&#8226; 

the allowed cost of debt will be updated within the price control period by reference to a long-run trailing average based on external benchmarks of utility debt costs; 

&#8226; 

allowed revenues will be adjusted in relation to some new service standard incentives, principally relating to speed and service standards for new connections to the network; and 

&#8226; 

there is scope for a mid-period review and adjustment to revenues in the latter half of the period for any changes in the outputs required of licensees for certain specified reasons. 

Under the price control, as revised by the CMA, and excluding the effects of incentive schemes and any deferred revenues from the prior price control, the base allowed revenue of Northern Powergrid (Northeast) Limited and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) plc decreased by approximately 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively, in 2016-17 and in all subsequent years within the price control period (RIIO-ED1), before the addition of inflation (as measured by the United Kingdom's Retail Prices Index). Base allowed revenue in 2015-16 remains unchanged from the price control final settlement. Nominal base allowed revenues will increase in line with inflation. 

Ofgem also monitors DNO compliance with license conditions and enforces the remedies resulting from any breach of condition. License conditions include the prices and terms of service, financial strength of the DNO, the provision of information to Ofgem and the public, as well as maintaining transparency, non-discrimination and avoidance of cross-subsidy in the provision of such services. Ofgem also monitors and enforces certain duties of a DNO set out in the Electricity Act 1989, including the duty to develop and maintain an efficient, coordinated and economical system of electricity distribution. Under changes to the Electricity Act 1989 introduced by the Utilities Act 2000, GEMA is able to impose financial penalties on DNOs that contravene any of their license duties or certain of their duties under the Electricity Act 1989, as amended, or that are failing to achieve a satisfactory performance in relation to the individual standards prescribed by GEMA. Any penalty imposed must be reasonable and may not exceed 10% of the licensee's revenue. 

ALP &#32;Transmission 

ALP &#32;is regulated by the AUC , pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act (Alberta). The AUC &#32;is an independent, quasi-judicial agency established by the province of Alberta, Canada, which is responsible for, among other things, approving the tariffs of transmission facility owners, including ALP , and distribution utilities, acquisitions of such transmission facility owners or utilities, and construction and operation of new transmission projects in Alberta. The AUC &#32;also investigates and rules on regulated rate disputes and system access problems. The AUC &#32;regulates and oversees Alberta's electricity transmission sector with broad authority that may impact many of ALP 's activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operations and financing. 

&#32;44 

The AUC &#32;has various core functions in regulating the Alberta electricity transmission sector, including the following: 

&#8226; 

regulating and adjudicating issues related to the operation of electric utilities within Alberta; 

&#8226; 

processing and approving general tariff applications relating to revenue requirements and rates of return including deemed capital structure for regulated utilities while ensuring that utility rates are just and reasonable and approval of the transmission tariff rates of regulated transmission providers paid by the AESO , which is the independent transmission system operator in Alberta, Canada that controls the operation of ALP 's transmission system; 

&#8226; 

approving the need for new electricity transmission facilities and permits to build and licenses to operate electricity transmission facilities; 

&#8226; 

reviewing operations and accounts from electric utilities and conducting on-site inspections to ensure compliance with industry regulation and standards; 

&#8226; 

adjudicating enforcement issues including the imposition of administrative penalties that arise when market participants violate the rules of the AESO ; and 

&#8226; 

collecting, storing, analyzing, appraising and disseminating information to effectively fulfill its duties as an industry regulator. 

ALP 's tariffs are regulated by the AUC &#32;under the provisions of the Electric Utilities Act in respect of rates and terms and conditions of service. The Electric Utilities Act and related regulations require the AUC &#32;to consider that it is in the public interest to provide consumers the benefit of unconstrained transmission access to competitive generation and the wholesale electricity market. In regulating transmission tariffs, the AUC &#32;must facilitate sufficient investment to ensure the timely upgrade, enhancement or expansion of transmission facilities, and foster a stable investment climate and a continued stream of capital investment for the transmission system. 

Under the Electric Utilities Act, ALP &#32;prepares and files applications with the AUC &#32;for approval of tariffs to be paid by the AESO &#32;for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms and conditions governing the use of those facilities. The AUC &#32;reviews and approves such tariff applications based on a cost-of-service regulatory model under a forward test year basis. Under this model, the AUC &#32;provides ALP &#32;with a reasonable opportunity to (i) earn a fair return on equity; and (ii) recover its forecast costs, including operating expenses, depreciation, borrowing costs and taxes associated with its regulated transmission business. The AUC &#32;must approve tariffs that are just, reasonable, and not unduly preferential, arbitrary or unjustly discriminatory. ALP 's transmission tariffs are not dependent on the price or volume of electricity transported through its transmission system. 

The AESO &#32;is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada that oversees the AIES and wholesale electricity market. The AESO &#32;is responsible for directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning. ALP &#32;and the other transmission facility owners receive substantially all of their transmission tariff revenues from the AESO . The AESO , in turn, charges wholesale tariffs, approved by the AUC , in a manner that promotes fair and open access to the AIES and facilitates a competitive market for the purchase and sale of electricity. The AESO &#32;monitors compliance with approved reliability standards, which are enforced by the Market Surveillance Administrator, which may impose penalties on transmission facility owners for non-compliance with the approved reliability standards. 

The AESO &#32;determines the need and plans for the expansion and enhancement of a congestion free transmission system in Alberta in accordance with applicable law and reliability standards. The AESO 's responsibilities include long-term transmission planning and management, including assessing and planning for the current and future transmission system capacity needs of AESO &#32;market participants. When AESO &#32;determines an expansion or enhancement of the transmission system is needed, with limited exceptions, it submits an application to the AUC &#32;for approval of the proposed expansion or enhancement. The AESO &#32;then determines which transmission provider should submit an application to the AUC &#32;for a permit and license to construct and operate the designated transmission facilities. Generally the transmission provider operating in the geographic area where the transmission facilities expansion or enhancement is to be located is selected by the AESO &#32;to build, own and operate the transmission facilities. In addition, Alberta law provides that certain transmission projects may be subject to a competitive process open to qualified bidders.

Independent Power Projects 

The Yuma, Cordova, Saranac, Power Resources, Topaz, Agua Caliente, Solar Star, Bishop Hill II, Jumbo Road, Marshall and Pinyon Pines independent power projects are Exempt Wholesale Generators ("EWG") under the Energy Policy Act while the Imperial Valley and Wailuku independent power projects are currently certified as Qualifying Facilities ("QF") under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. Both EWGs and QFs are generally exempt from compliance with extensive federal and state regulations that control the financial structure of an electric generating plant and the prices and terms at which electricity may be sold by the facilities. In addition, the Cordova, Saranac, Yuma, Imperial Valley, Topaz, Agua Caliente, Solar Star, Bishop Hill II and Pinyon Pines independent power projects have obtained authority from the FERC &#32;to sell their power using market-based rates. Jumbo Road's entire output is dedicated to its offtaker within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (" ERCOT ") and does not require market-based authority for such sales solely within ERCOT &#32;as the ERCOT &#32;market is not a FERC -jurisdictional market. Similarly, Wailuku sells its output solely to the Hawaii Electric Company within the Hawaii electric grid which is not a FERC -jurisdictional market and Wailuku therefore does not require market-based rate authority. 

EWGs are permitted to sell capacity and electricity only in the wholesale markets, not to end users. Additionally, utilities are required to purchase electricity produced by QFs at a price that does not exceed the purchasing utility's "avoided cost" and to sell back-up power to the QFs on a non-discriminatory basis, unless they have successfully petitioned the FERC &#32;for an exemption from this purchase requirement. Avoided cost is defined generally as the price at which the utility could purchase or produce the same amount of power from sources other than the QF on a long-term basis. The Energy Policy Act eliminated the purchase requirement for utilities with respect to new contracts under certain conditions. New QF contracts are also subject to FERC &#32;rate filing requirements, unlike QF contracts entered into prior to the Energy Policy Act. FERC &#32;regulations also permit QFs and utilities to negotiate agreements for utility purchases of power at rates other than the utilities' avoided cost. 

The Philippine Congress has passed the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 ("EPIRA"), which is aimed at restructuring the Philippine power industry, privatizing the National Power Corporation and introducing a competitive electricity market, among other initiatives. The implementation of EPIRA may impact future operations in the Philippines and the Philippine power industry as a whole, the effect of which is not yet known as changes resulting from EPIRA are ongoing.

PacifiCorp 

Utah Mine Disposition 

In December 2014, PacifiCorp filed applications with the UPSC, the OPUC, the WPSC and the IPUC seeking certain approvals, prudence determinations and accounting orders to close its Deer Creek mining operations, sell certain Utah mining assets, enter into a replacement coal supply agreement, amend an existing coal supply agreement, withdraw from the United Mine Workers of America ("UMWA") 1974 Pension Plan and settle PacifiCorp's other postretirement benefit obligation for UMWA participants (collectively, the "Utah Mine Disposition"). 

The applications filed with the UPSC, the WPSC and the IPUC, requested that the commissions approve: (a) closure of the Deer Creek mine; (b) asset sales to a third party for certain Utah mining assets, including the Cottonwood Preparatory Plant; (c) the execution of a long-term coal supply agreement for the Huntington generating facility and amendment to the existing long-term coal supply agreement for the Hunter generating facility; and (d) the withdrawal from the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan that was triggered upon closure of the Deer Creek mine. In the UPSC and WPSC applications, PacifiCorp's request for approval to sell certain Utah mining assets included the sale of the Fossil Rock coal reserves that are currently reflected in rates in Utah and Wyoming. In addition to the requested approvals, PacifiCorp's applications filed with the UPSC, the WPSC and the IPUC requested that the noted components of the transaction and the settlement of PacifiCorp's other postretirement benefit obligation related to the UMWA participants be found prudent and in the public interest. These applications also requested accounting orders to defer the costs associated with the Utah Mine Disposition for current or future recovery. As certain amounts are currently reflected in rates, such as the recovery through depreciation of the Deer Creek mining assets and assets to be sold, these amounts serve to reduce the regulatory assets established as a result of the Utah Mine Disposition. The application requested continued recovery of contributions to the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan with ultimate ratemaking treatment of the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan withdrawal to be determined in a future proceeding once the final withdrawal obligation is determined. 

In April 2015, PacifiCorp filed all-party settlement stipulations with the UPSC and the WPSC finding that the decision to enter into the Utah Mine Disposition transaction was prudent and in the public interest and recommended the appropriate treatment for accounting and ratemaking purposes. The UPSC approved the stipulation in April 2015 and the WPSC approved the stipulation in May 2015. The IPUC also issued an order in May 2015, approving the Utah Mine Disposition and ruling that the decision to enter into the transaction was prudent and in the public interest. The IPUC's order established the accounting treatment necessary to implement the transaction while deferring any incremental ratemaking treatment to the next general rate case. 

PacifiCorp's application filed with the OPUC requested that the OPUC determine that closure of the Deer Creek mine was in the public interest, that its decision to enter into the Utah Mine Disposition was prudent and sought approval to sell certain Utah mine assets. PacifiCorp also requested that the costs associated with the Utah Mine Disposition, including the unrecovered investments and closure costs, be transferred to or deferred as a regulatory asset and recovered through a one-year tariff rider beginning June 1, 2015 with an offset for amounts currently in rates. The application requested the same treatment of the UMWA 1974 Pension Plan withdrawal sought in the applications filed with the UPSC, the WPSC and the IPUC. In May 2015, the OPUC issued its final order concluding that the transaction produces net benefits for customers and was in the public interest. In accordance with the OPUC order, PacifiCorp implemented two tariffs that reflect an overall annual rate increase of $3 million effective June 2015. 

In December 2014, PacifiCorp also filed an advice letter with the CPUC &#32;to request approval to sell certain Utah mining assets and to establish memorandum accounts to track the costs associated with the Utah Mine Disposition for future recovery. In July 2015, the CPUC Energy Division issued a letter requiring PacifiCorp to file a formal application for approval of the sale of certain Utah mining assets. Accordingly, in September 2015, PacifiCorp filed an application with the CPUC . 

For additional information related to the accounting impacts associated with the Utah Mine Disposition, refer to Note 6 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Notes 5 and 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

&#32;47 

Utah 

In March 2015, PacifiCorp filed its annual EBA &#32;with the UPSC requesting recovery of $31 million in deferred net power costs for the period January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. In September 2015, a settlement agreement was filed with the UPSC in which the parties agreed to recovery of $30 million. In October 2015, the UPSC approved the settlement agreement with the new rates effective November 2015. 

In March 2015, PacifiCorp filed its annual REC balancing account application with the UPSC requesting recovery of $6 million over a two-year period. In May 2015, the UPSC approved the new rates effective June 2015 on an interim basis until a final order is issued by the UPSC. In September 2015, the UPSC issued a final order approving the interim rates as final. 

Oregon 

In April 2015, PacifiCorp made its initial filing for the annual TAM with the OPUC for an annual increase of $12 million, or an average price increase of 1%, based on forecasted net power costs for calendar year 2016. In October 2015, the OPUC issued a preliminary order approving PacifiCorp's request. PacifiCorp filed the final update reducing the requested increase to $9 million effective January 2016. A final order from the OPUC approving the revised increase was issued in December 2015. 

Wyoming 

In March 2015, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case with the WPSC requesting an annual increase of $32 million, or an average price increase of 5%, effective January 2016. The filing included a proposal to implement a modified ECAM &#32;to replace the current ECAM , which sunsets for new deferrals December 2015. In June 2015, PacifiCorp filed a net power cost update that reduced the requested increase to $30 million. In September 2015, PacifiCorp filed rebuttal testimony reducing the requested increase to $27 million, or an average price increase of 4%. Hearings were held in October and early November of 2015. In December 2015, the WPSC approved an overall increase of $16 million effective January 2016, and approved the continuation of the current ECAM &#32;with certain modifications that allow for the inclusion of chemical costs and start-up fuel costs. In addition, the WPSC ordered a $1 million credit to customers for benefits related to bonus tax depreciation through a separate tariff rider effective January 2016. 

In March 2015, PacifiCorp filed its annual ECAM &#32;and RRA applications with the WPSC. The ECAM &#32;filing requests approval to recover $8 million in deferred net power costs for the period January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, and the RRA application requests approval to refund $1 million to customers. In May 2015, the WPSC approved the ECAM &#32;and RRA rates effective May 2015 on an interim basis. In September 2015, the WPSC approved a stipulation in which the parties agreed to allow the interim rates that were effective in May 2015 to become final. 

Washington 

In May 2014, PacifiCorp filed a general rate case with the WUTC requesting an annual increase of $27 million, or an average price increase of 8%. In November 2014, PacifiCorp filed rebuttal testimony that increased the request to $32 million, or an average price increase of 10%, primarily as a result of updated net power costs. In March 2015, the WUTC issued a final order in the proceeding approving an overall annual increase of $10 million, or an average price increase of 3%, effective March 2015. In April 2015, PacifiCorp filed a petition for judicial review of certain findings of the WUTC's March 2015 order. 

In the March 2015 general rate case order described above, the WUTC initiated a second phase of the proceeding to implement a PCAM under which a portion of the difference between base net power costs set during a general rate case and actual net power costs would be deferred and reflected in future rates. In May 2015, the WUTC approved an all-party stipulation in which the parties agreed to the implementation of a PCAM. The PCAM applies a $4 million dead band for positive or negative net power cost variances. For net power cost variances between $4 million and $10 million, the PCAM reflects asymmetrical sharing bands in which amounts to be recovered from customers will be allocated 50% to customers and 50% to PacifiCorp, and amounts to be credited to customers will be allocated 75% to customers and 25% to PacifiCorp. Positive or negative net power cost variances in excess of $10 million will be allocated 90% to customers and 10% to PacifiCorp. PacifiCorp will make its first annual PCAM filing in June 2016 to cover net power costs for the period April 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015. The PCAM will convert to a calendar year basis beginning in 2016. 

&#32;48 

In November 2015, PacifiCorp submitted a filing with the WUTC for approval of an expedited rate filing, a two-year rate plan and a proposal for a decoupling mechanism. As part of the filing, PacifiCorp is seeking approval of a rate increase of $10 million, or an average price increase of 3%, effective mid-2016, and a second rate increase of $10 million, or an average price increase of 3%, effective mid-2017. The filing also includes a proposal to accelerate depreciation of certain coal-fueled generating facilities in the west control area that serve Washington. As part of the proposed rate plan, if approved, PacifiCorp commits to not file a general rate case for rates effective earlier than April 1, 2018. The WUTC decision is pending with a target effective date of the first step rate increase of July 1, 2016. 

Idaho 

In February 2015, PacifiCorp filed its annual ECAM &#32;application with the IPUC requesting recovery of $17 million, consisting primarily of $10 million for deferred net power costs and $6 million for the difference between REC revenues included in base rates and actual REC revenues. In March 2015, the IPUC approved recovery of $16 million effective April 2015. 

In May 2015, PacifiCorp filed an application with the IPUC requesting approval to modify the ECAM , update base net power costs and increase rates by $10 million, effective January 2016. The requested increase included $7 million for the difference between REC revenues included in base rates and actual REC revenues, and $3 million as a result of updating base net power costs. In October 2015, PacifiCorp filed a settlement agreement with the IPUC in which the parties agreed to the requested increase in rates, effective January 2016. The IPUC approved the settlement agreement in December 2015. The settlement agreement modifies the ECAM &#32;to include production tax credits and exclude sulfur dioxide revenues. In addition, the settlement agreement allows another update to base net power costs in rates to be effective January 2017 and also specifies that January 2018 would be the earliest effective date that PacifiCorp could seek an increase to base rates through a general rate case. 

In February 2016, PacifiCorp filed its annual ECAM &#32;application with the IPUC requesting recovery of $17 million, consisting primarily of $7 million for deferred net power costs, $6 million for the difference between REC revenues included in base rates and actual REC revenues and $4 million for a Lake Side 2 resource adder. If approved by the IPUC, the new rates will be effective April 2016. 

California 

In August 2014, PacifiCorp filed for a rate increase of $5 million, or 4%, through its annual ECAC . The CPUC &#32;approved the new rates effective March 2015. 

In June 2015, PacifiCorp filed for a rate increase of $1 million, or 1%, through its PTAM for major capital additions to include the costs of the Sigurd-Red Butte transmission line in rates. The CPUC &#32;approved the new rates effective July 2015. 

In August 2015, PacifiCorp filed for a rate decrease of $2 million, or 2%, through its annual ECAC . In December 2015, the CPUC &#32;approved the new rates effective January 2016. 

In October 2015, PacifiCorp filed for a rate increase of $1 million, or 1%, through its PTAM for attrition factor. The CPUC &#32;approved PacifiCorp's filing in October 2015 with new rates effective January 2016. 

MidAmerican Energy 

In July 2014, the IUB issued an order approving new retail electric base rates for MidAmerican Energy's Iowa customers. The order allowed MidAmerican Energy to increase its base rates over approximately three years with equal annualized increases in revenues of $45 million, or 3.6% over 2012, effective August 2013 and again on January 1, 2015 and 2016, for a total annualized increase of $135 million when fully implemented. In addition to an increase in base rates, the order approved (1) the implementation of two new adjustment clauses related to the recovery of retail energy production costs and certain electric transmission charges (2) seasonal pricing that increased the difference between higher base rates in effect for June through September and base rates applicable to the remaining months of the year; and (3) a revenue sharing mechanism that shares with MidAmerican Energy's customers 80% of revenues related to equity returns above 11% and 100% of revenues related to equity returns above 14%, with the customer portion of any sharing reducing rate base. The changes in seasonal pricing, adjustment clauses and new revenue sharing mechanism were effective with final base rates. Additionally, MidAmerican Energy and the OCA have agreed not to seek or support an increase or decrease in the final base rates to become effective prior to January 1, 2018, unless MidAmerican Energy projects its return on equity for 2015, 2016 or 2017 to be below 10%. 

&#32;49 

NV Energy (Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific) 

The PUCN's final order approving the merger between BHE and NV Energy stipulated that the Nevada Utilities would not seek recovery of any lost revenue for calendar year 2014 in an amount that exceeded 50% of the lost revenue the Nevada Utilities could otherwise request. In February 2014, the Nevada Utilities each filed an application with the PUCN to reset the EEIR &#32;and EEPR. In June 2014, the PUCN accepted a stipulation to adjust the EEIR , as of July 1, 2014, to collect 50% of the estimated lost revenue that the Nevada Utilities would otherwise be allowed to recover for the 2014 calendar year. The EEIR &#32;was effective from July through December 2014, reset on January 1, 2015 and was in effect through September 2015. 

In February 2015, the Nevada Utilities each filed an application to reset the EEIR &#32;and EEPR. In August 2015, the PUCN accepted a stipulation for the Nevada Utilities to calculate the base EEIR &#32;using a revised methodology for calculating lost revenue and for Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific to make a $5 million and $1 million reduction, respectively, to the EEPR revenue requirement to more accurately reflect the actual level of spending and to minimize any over collection from its customers. The reset of the EEIR &#32;and EEPR was effective October 1, 2015 and remains in effect through September 30, 2016. To the extent the Nevada Utilities' earned rate of return exceeds the rate of return used to set base general rates, the Nevada Utilities' are required to refund to customers EEIR &#32;revenue collected. The current EEIR &#32;liability for Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific is $18 million &#32;and $3 million , respectively, which is included in current regulatory liabilities on each respective Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. 

In November 2014, one Nevada Power retail electric customer filed an application with the PUCN to purchase energy from a provider of a new electric resource and become a distribution only service customer. The application was denied in June 2015 and the customer subsequently filed a petition for reconsideration. In July 2015, the PUCN approved a settlement between the customer and Nevada Power. In October 2015, the PUCN approved a separate green energy agreement between Nevada Power and the customer and tariff changes embedded in the settlement agreement. The customer withdrew its petition for reconsideration in November 2015. In May 2015, three additional customers filed applications to purchase energy from a provider of a new electric resource and become a distribution only service customer. In December 2015, the PUCN granted the applications of the three customers subject to conditions, including paying an impact fee, on-going charges and receiving approval for specific alternative energy providers and terms. 

In December 2015, the customers filed petitions for reconsideration. In January 2016, the PUCN granted reconsiderations and updated some of the terms, removing a limitation related to energy purchased indirectly from NV Energy. One of the applicants subsequently filed a petition for judicial review and a complaint for declaratory relief in state district court. In addition, there are no material applications pursuant to Chapter 704B pending before the PUCN in Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's respective service territories. 

Net Metering 

Nevada enacted Senate Bill 374 ("SB 374") on June 5, 2015. The legislation required the Nevada Utilities to prepare cost-of-service studies and propose new rules and rates for customers who install distributed, renewable generating resources. In July 2015, the Nevada Utilities made filings in compliance with SB 374 and the PUCN issued final orders December 23, 2015. 

The final orders issued by the PUCN establish separate rate classes for customers who install distributed, renewable generating facilities. The establishment of separate rate classes recognizes the unique characteristics, costs and services received by these partial requirements customers. The PUCN also established new, cost-based rates or prices for these new customer classes, including increases in the basic service charge and related reductions in energy charges. Finally, the PUCN established a separate value for compensating customers who produce and deliver excess energy to the Nevada Utilities. The valuation will consider eleven factors, including alternatives available to the Nevada Utilities. The PUCN established a gradual, five-step process for transition over four years to the new, cost-based rates. 

In January 2016, the PUCN denied requests to stay the order issued December 23, 2015. The PUCN also voted to reopen the evidentiary proceeding to address the application of new net metering rules for customers who applied for net metering service before the issuance of the final order. In February 2016, the PUCN affirmed most of the provisions of the December 23, 2015 order and adopted a twelve-year transition plan for changing rates for net metering customers to cost-based rates for utility services and value-based pricing for excess energy. 

&#160; 

&#32;50 

Emissions Reduction and Capacity Replacement Plan 

In July 2015, Nevada Power filed an amendment to its Emissions Reduction and Capacity Replacement Plan ("ERCR Plan") with the PUCN. In September 2015, the PUCN approved the filed amendment requesting two renewable power purchase agreements with 100&#8209;MW solar photovoltaic generating facilities related to the replacement of coal plants. Each of these agreements were entered into by issuing requests for proposals for the procurement of energy through the competitive solicitation process that was set forth in Nevada Power's ERCR Plan in compliance with Senate Bill No. 123 ("SB 123"). In June 2015, the Nevada State Legislature passed Assembly Bill No. 498, which modified the capacity replacement components of SB 123. As a result, Nevada Power will not proceed with issuance of a third 100-MW request for proposal for renewable energy until such time as the PUCN determines Nevada Power has satisfactorily demonstrated a need for such electric generating capacity. 

Joint Dispatch Agreement Application 

The Nevada Utilities were parties to an Interim Joint Dispatch Agreement ("Interim JDA") which outlined the joint dispatch of their combined power supply resources utilizing ON Line. In March 2015, the Nevada Utilities filed an application with the PUCN seeking approval of a Joint Dispatch Agreement with a new term (the "JDA"). In July 2015, the PUCN approved the JDA with minor modifications, and established December 31, 2019 as the termination date for the agreement. The JDA became effective September 29, 2015, by approval from the FERC , replacing the Interim JDA. The JDA covers real-time, hourly and daily transactions, including sales of the combined resources into the California ISO through the EIM . 

The primary difference between the Interim JDA and the JDA is the extension of the agreement to December 31, 2019, at which time the Nevada Utilities and their regulators will review the JDA to determine if it should be renewed or amended. The JDA also recognizes that, upon NV Energy&#8217;s entry into the EIM , dispatch and non-native sales include transactions with the California ISO . As with the prior versions of the JDA, the agreement establishes Nevada Power as the EIM &#32;scheduling coordinator for both Sierra Pacific and Nevada Power and recognizes that the joint dispatch costs and benefits associated with the EIM &#32;transactions will be governed by the accounting protocols and allocations set forth in the JDA. 

Advanced Metering Infrastructure 

In October 2014, the PUCN issued an order directing the Nevada Utilities to provide information relating to failures in certain remote disconnect/reconnect electric meters the Nevada Utilities have installed after media reports were published that electric meter failures may have resulted in fire events. The Nevada Utilities completed an internal review in response to this and other federal, state and local inquiries relating to these events. The information compiled and submitted indicates that no fire has resulted from the remote disconnect/reconnect electric meters. Additionally, in October 2014, the Nevada State Fire Marshal issued a report concluding that the incidents of electric arcing fires continue to decrease in Nevada and at this time there is no statewide fire problem related to the replacement of electric meters. In December 2014, the Nevada Utilities filed the requested information with the PUCN. In March 2015, the PUCN staff made additional requests and in May 2015, the Nevada Utilities provided the follow up items. In September 2015, the Nevada Utilities provided the PUCN electric meter testing results from a third party laboratory. All tests of the integrity and functionality of the meters subject to the distress testing passed. Analysis and internal investigation is continuing, but Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific do not believe this will have a material adverse impact on each respective Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ALP 

General Tariff Applications 

In November 2014, ALP filed a general tariff application ("GTA") asking the AUC &#32;to approve revenue requirements of C$811 million for 2015 and C$1.0 billion for 2016, primarily due to continued investment in capital projects as directed by the AESO . 

In June 2015, ALP amended the GTA to propose additional transmission tariff relief measures for customers and modifications to its capital structure. The amended GTA includes timing benefits to customers by discontinuing (i) the use of construction work-in-progress in-rate base effective January 1, 2015, and refunding related amounts received as part of the 2011 to 2014 transmission tariffs and (ii) the collection in advance of future income taxes, effective January 1, 2016, and refunding amounts previously received as part of the transmission tariffs. 

&#32;51 

In October 2015, an update to this amended application was filed. The October 2015 update requested the AUC &#32;to approve an increase to 39% in ALP's common equity ratio resulting in revenue requirements of C$672 million for 2015 and C$703 million for 2016. In addition, the October 2015 update forecasted capital expenditures to be C$961 million for 2015 and C$538 million for 2016. ALP based its direct assign capital forecast, which comprises more than 80% of its total capital expenditures, on the long-range capital plan released by the AESO &#32;in January 2014, using its risk-adjusted capital forecasting model accepted by the AUC &#32;in its decision on ALP's previous general tariff application. ALP's actual capital program may vary from ALP's regulatory filings, depending on the timing of regulatory approvals, directions from the AESO , and other factors beyond ALP's control. 

The oral hearing for the 2015-2016 GTA, which was amended and updated, took place December 2015 and the AUC &#32;is expected to issue its final decision in the second quarter of 2016. In addition, the AUC &#32;approved ALP's request to continue its 2015 interim transmission tariff decision to invoice the AESO &#32;C$61 million per month commencing January 1, 2016, until a final decision is issued for the 2015-2016 GTA. 

In February 2016, ALP filed a GTA asking the AUC to approve its transmission tariff of C$853 million for 2017 and C$990 million for 2018. 

2016 Generic Cost of Capital Proceeding 

In April 2015, the AUC &#32;opened a new GCOC proceeding to set the deemed capital structure and generic returns for 2016 and 2017. The AUC &#32;has issued a schedule for this proceeding with a hearing scheduled for the second quarter of 2016. ALP filed evidence in January 2016. ALP&#8217;s external rate of return expert evidence proposes 9% to 10.5% return on equity, on a recommended equity component of 40%, compared to the placeholder return on equity of 8.3% on a 36% equity component. The fair return and equity thickness recommended reflect the concerns noted by rating agencies and other members of the financial community regarding the increased business risks of utilities in Alberta. ALP&#8217;s credit metrics expert has recommended that the AUC authorize return on equity and equity thickness determinations that allow for a funds from operations to debt credit ratio above the 13% that Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s has cautioned might be a floor for regulated utilities facing growing uncertainty while operating in Alberta. ALP also filed evidence which outlined capital market participant&#8217;s heightened view of the Alberta utility regulatory environment and the widening credit spreads. 

Deferral Account Reconciliation Application 

In December 2014, ALP filed its 2012-2013 Deferral Accounts Reconciliation Application seeking the AUC 's approval to collect C$30 million from the AESO &#32;for previously uncollected deferral account balances. In addition, ALP is seeking approval of nearly C$1.7 billion of direct assign capital additions, included as part of the direct assigned capital deferral account filing. The oral hearing took place in November 2015 and reconvened in January 2016 because there was not sufficient time to complete the hearing. A decision from the AUC &#32;is expected in mid-2016. 

Appeals of Recent AUC &#32;Decisions 

In March 2015, the AUC &#32;issued its decision regarding cost of capital matters applicable to all electricity and natural gas utilities under its jurisdiction, including ALP. In its decision, which was retroactively applied to January 1, 2013, the AUC &#32;decreased the generic rate of return on common equity applicable to all utilities to 8.30% from the previously approved placeholder rate of 8.75% and decreased ALP's common equity ratio from 37% to 36% for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015. The approved common equity ratio and generic rate of return on common equity will remain in effect on an interim basis for 2016 and beyond, until changed by the AUC . ALP and other utilities had applied to the Alberta Court of Appeal for Leave to appeal this decision, which is set to be heard in May 2016. 

In November 2013, the AUC &#32;issued its Utility Asset Disposition ("UAD") decision in which it concluded, among other things, that in the case of the extraordinary retirement of an asset before it is fully depreciated, under or over recovery of capital investment on an extraordinary retirement should be borne by the utility and its shareholders. ALP and other utilities appealed the AUC 's UAD decision to the Alberta Court of Appeal, which was dismissed in September 2015. In November 2015, ALP, Epcor and Enmax, filed a joint leave application to the Supreme Court of Canada for appeal of the Alberta Court of Appeal's UAD decision. 

&#32;52 

In its November 2013 decision pertaining to ALP's 2013-2014 GTA, the AUC &#32;directed ALP to re-forecast the capital project expenditures for 2013 and 2014 Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management ("EPCM") services to reflect a two times labor multiplier and other approved mark-ups. While the AUC &#32;has not disallowed the new EPCM rates that ALP negotiated, there is a risk that, in a future direct assigned capital deferral account decision, the AUC &#32;may disallow a portion of the costs ALP has incurred for EPCM services in connection with capital projects executed under these relationship agreements. ALP has appealed this decision, which is scheduled to be heard in February 2016. ALP has requested approval of the capital project expenditures, including the new competitively bid EPCM rates, in its 2012-2013 direct assigned capital deferral account filing. ALP filed additional evidence supporting the new EPCM rates in 2015. 

BHE U.S. Transmission &#32; 

A significant portion of ETT's revenues are based on interim rate changes that can be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next filed base rate proceeding. In July 2015, the most recent interim filing was approved which set total annual revenue requirements at $304 million and a rate base of $2.2 billion. In November 2015, the PUCT ordered ETT to file a base rate case by February 2017. Results of a base rate review would be prospective except for any deemed disallowance by the PUCT of the transmission investment since the initial base rate case in 2007. A refund of interim transmission rates would reduce future net income and cash flows. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring. 

Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies &#32; 

In March 2015, Northern Powergrid sought permission from the Competition and Markets Authority ("CMA") to appeal against the license modifications that give effect to the RIIO-ED1 price control. The appeal related to three specific areas: 

&#8226; 

Ofgem's decision to demand further cost savings in relation to smart grid technology over and above the ones captured by its original benchmarking exercise; 

&#8226; 

Ofgem's assessment of the variation in wage rates across the country; and 

&#8226; 

Ofgem's projections for labor cost increases. 

Permission to appeal was granted by the CMA on March 30, 2015. British Gas Trading Limited (an electricity supplier) was granted permission to appeal the price control, with a view to reduce the revenue available to all slow-tracked Distribution Network Operators. 

In September 2015, the CMA announced that it had upheld Northern Powergrid's appeal on cost savings in relation to smart grid technology concluding that Ofgem's decision was not based on robust evidence. The CMA has therefore increased Northern Powergrid's cost allowance for the period to March 2023 by &#163;32 million (2012/13 prices). The CMA decided that Ofgem's decision on the assessment of the variation in wage rates across the country and their projections for labor cost increases fell within the margin of discretion that is available to Ofgem. 

In September 2015, the CMA also announced that it had upheld one part of one ground of the British Gas appeal. As a result the CMA has reduced the value of an incentive scheme for all slow-tracked Distribution Network Operators which reduces Northern Powergrid revenues by &#163;14 million (2012/13 prices) over the period to March 2023.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

Each Registrant is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding air and water quality, RPS, emissions performance standards, climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact each Registrant's current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by the EPA &#32;and various state, local and international agencies. Each Registrant believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many laws and regulations are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Refer to "Liquidity and Capital Resources" of each respective Registrant in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for discussion of each Registrant's forecast environmental-related capital expenditures. 

Clean Air Act Regulations 

The Clean Air Act is a federal law administered by the EPA &#32;that provides a framework for protecting and improving the nation's air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. The implementation of new standards is generally outlined in SIPs, which are a collection of regulations, programs and policies to be followed. SIPs vary by state and are subject to public hearings and EPA &#32;approval. Some states may adopt additional or more stringent requirements than those implemented by the EPA . The major Clean Air Act programs most directly affecting the Registrants' operations are described below. 

National Ambient Air Quality Standards 

Under the authority of the Clean Air Act, the EPA &#32;sets minimum national ambient air quality standards for six principal pollutants, consisting of carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, ozone and sulfur dioxide, considered harmful to public health and the environment. Areas that achieve the standards, as determined by ambient air quality monitoring, are characterized as being in attainment, while those that fail to meet the standards are designated as being nonattainment areas. Generally, sources of emissions in a nonattainment area that are determined to contribute to the nonattainment are required to reduce emissions. Most air quality standards require measurement over a defined period of time to determine the average concentration of the pollutant present. Currently, with the exceptions described in the following paragraphs, air quality monitoring data indicates that all counties where the relevant Registrant's major emission sources are located are in attainment of the current national ambient air quality standards. 

In November 2014, the EPA &#32;released a new proposal to strengthen the national ambient air quality standard for ground level ozone from the current level of 75 parts per billion to a level between 65 and 70 parts per billion. In October 2015, the EPA &#32;set the standard at 70 parts per billion. The EPA &#32;anticipates making attainment/nonattainment designations for the revised standards by late 2017, which will likely be based on 2014-2016 air quality data. Nonattainment areas will have until 2020 to late 2037 to meet the standard. Given the level at which the standard was set in conjunction with retirements and the installation of controls, the new standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the relevant Registrant. 

Until the 2015 standard is fully implemented, the EPA &#32;continues to implement the 2008 ozone standards. The Upper Green River Basin Area in Wyoming, including all of Sublette and portions of Lincoln and Sweetwater Counties, were proposed to be designated as nonattainment for the 2008 ozone standard. When the final designations were released in April 2012, portions of Lincoln and Sweetwater Counties and Sublette County were determined to be in marginal nonattainment. While PacifiCorp's Jim Bridger plant is located in Sweetwater County, it is not in the portion of the designated nonattainment area and has not been impacted by the 2012 designation. In December 2012, the EPA &#32;approved Nevada's request to redesignate Clark County to be in attainment for the 1997 eight-hour ozone standard while also approving Clark County's plan to maintain compliance with the standard through 2022. However, Clark County remains unclassifiable for the 2008 ozone standard. If the EPA &#32;revises the ozone standard to be more stringent, it is possible that Clark County will again be designated as nonattainment for ozone, creating the potential to impact Nevada Power's Clark, Sun Peak, Las Vegas, Lenzie, Silverhawk, Harry Allen, Higgins, and Goodsprings generating facilities. However, until such time as the 2015 standard is implemented or Clark County is classified as nonattainment for the 2008 or 2015 standards, potential impacts cannot be determined. 

In January 2010, the EPA &#32;finalized a one-hour air quality standard for nitrogen dioxide at 100 parts per billion. In February 2012, the EPA &#32;published final designations indicating that based on air quality monitoring data, all areas of the country are designated as "unclassifiable/attainment" for the 2010 nitrogen dioxide national ambient air quality standard. 

&#32;54 

In June 2010, the EPA &#32;finalized a new national ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide. Under the 2010 rule, areas must meet a one-hour standard of 75 parts per billion utilizing a three-year average. The rule utilizes source modeling in addition to the installation of ambient monitors where sulfur dioxide emissions impact populated areas. Attainment designations were due by June 2012; however, citing a lack of sufficient information to make the designations, the EPA &#32;did not issue its final designations until July 2013 and determined, at that date, that a portion of Muscatine County, Iowa was in nonattainment for the one-hour sulfur dioxide standard. MidAmerican Energy's Louisa coal-fueled generating facility is located just outside of Muscatine County, south of the violating monitor. In its final designation, the EPA &#32;indicated that it was not yet prepared to conclude that the emissions from the Louisa coal-fueled generating facility contribute to the monitored violation or to other possible violations, and that in a subsequent round of designations, the EPA &#32;will make decisions for areas and sources outside Muscatine County. MidAmerican Energy does not believe a subsequent nonattainment designation will have a material impact on the Louisa coal-fueled generating facility. Although the EPA 's July 2013 designations did not impact PacifiCorp's nor the Nevada Utilities' generating facilities, the EPA 's assessment of sulfur dioxide area designations will continue with the deployment of additional sulfur dioxide monitoring networks across the country. 

The Sierra Club filed a lawsuit against the EPA &#32;in August 2013 with respect to the one-hour sulfur dioxide standards and its failure to make certain attainment designations in a timely manner. In March 2015, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ("Northern District of California") accepted as an enforceable order an agreement between the EPA &#32;and Sierra Club to resolve litigation concerning the deadline for completing the designations. The Northern District of California's order directed the EPA &#32;to complete designations in three phases: the first phase by July 2, 2016; the second phase by December 31, 2017; and the final phase by December 31, 2020. The first phase of the designations require the EPA &#32;to designate two groups of areas: 1) areas that have newly monitored violations of the 2010 sulfur dioxide standard; and 2) areas that contain any stationary source that, according to the EPA 's data, either emitted more than 16,000 tons of sulfur dioxide in 2012 or emitted more than 2,600 tons of sulfur dioxide and had an emission rate of at least 0.45 lbs/sulfur dioxide per million British thermal unit in 2012 and, as of March 2, 2015, had not been announced for retirement. MidAmerican Energy's George Neal Unit 4 and the Ottumwa Generating Station (in which MidAmerican Energy has a majority ownership interest, but does not operate), are included as units subject to the first phase of the designations, having emitted more than 2,600 tons of sulfur dioxide and having an emission rate of at least 0.45 lbs/sulfur dioxide per million British thermal unit in 2012. States may submit to the EPA &#32;updated recommendations and supporting information for the EPA &#32;to consider in making its determinations. Iowa has assembled technical support documents demonstrating that all facilities affected by the first phase of designations have attained the standard, but has not yet submitted the information to the EPA . The EPA &#32;intends to promulgate final sulfur dioxide area designations no later than July 2, 2016. 

In December 2012, the EPA &#32;finalized more stringent fine particulate matter national ambient air quality standards, reducing the annual standard from 15 micrograms per cubic meter to 12 micrograms per cubic meter and retaining the 24-hour standard at 35 micrograms per cubic meter. The EPA &#32;did not set a separate secondary visibility standard, choosing to rely on the existing secondary 24-hour standard to protect against visibility impairment. In December 2014, the EPA &#32;issued final area designations for the 2012 fine particulate matter standard. Based on these designations, the areas in which the relevant Registrant operates generating facilities have been classified as "unclassifiable/attainment." Unless additional monitoring suggests otherwise, the relevant Registrant does not anticipate that any impacts of the revised standard will be significant. 

In December 2014, the Utah SIP for fine particulate matter was adopted by the Utah Air Quality Board. PacifiCorp's Lake Side and Gadsby generating facilities operate within nonattainment areas for fine particulate matter; however, the SIP did not impose significant new requirements on PacifiCorp's impacted generating facilities, nor did the EPA 's comments on the Utah SIP identify requirements for PacifiCorp's existing generating facilities that would have a material impact on its consolidated financial results. 

As new, more stringent national ambient air quality standards are adopted, the number of counties designated as nonattainment areas is likely to increase. Businesses operating in newly designated nonattainment counties could face increased regulation and costs to monitor or reduce emissions. For instance, existing major emissions sources may have to install reasonably available control technologies to achieve certain reductions in emissions and undertake additional monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting. The construction or modification of facilities that are sources of emissions could also become more difficult in nonattainment areas. Until new requirements are promulgated and additional monitoring and modeling is conducted, the impacts on the Registrants cannot be determined. 

&#32;55 

Mercury and Air Toxics Standards 

In March 2011, the EPA &#32;proposed a rule that requires coal-fueled generating facilities to reduce mercury emissions and other hazardous air pollutants through the establishment of "Maximum Achievable Control Technology" standards. The final MATS became effective on April 16, 2012, and required that new and existing coal-fueled generating facilities achieve emission standards for mercury, acid gases and other non-mercury hazardous air pollutants. Existing sources were required to comply with the new standards by April 16, 2015 with the potential for individual sources to obtain an extension of up to one additional year, at the discretion of the Title V permitting authority, to complete installation of controls or for transmission system reliability reasons. The relevant Registrants have completed emission reduction projects to comply with the final rule's standards for acid gases and non-mercury metallic hazardous air pollutants. 

MidAmerican Energy is retiring certain coal-fueled generating units as the least-cost alternative to comply with the MATS. Walter Scott, Jr. Energy Center Units 1 and 2 were retired in 2015, and George Neal Energy Center Units 1 and 2 are to be retired by April 15, 2016. A fifth unit, Riverside Generating Station, was limited to natural gas combustion in March 2015. 

PacifiCorp retired its two coal-fueled generating units at the Carbon Facility in 2015 to comply with the MATS requirements and other environmental regulations as well as in conformance with Utah's Regional Haze SIP. Refer to the Regional Haze section below for additional requirements regarding the Carbon Facility. 

Numerous lawsuits have been filed in the D.C. Circuit challenging the MATS. In April 2014, the D.C. Circuit upheld the MATS requirements. In November 2014, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear the MATS appeal on the limited issue of whether the EPA &#32;unreasonably refused to consider costs in determining whether it is appropriate to regulate hazardous air pollutants emitted by electric utilities. Oral argument in the case was held before the United States Supreme Court in March 2015, and a decision was issued by the United States Supreme Court in June 2015, which reversed and remanded the MATS rule to the D.C. Circuit for further action. The United States Supreme Court held that the EPA &#32;had acted unreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the decision to regulate generating facilities, and that cost, including costs of compliance, must be considered before deciding whether regulation is necessary and appropriate. The United States Supreme Court's decision did not vacate or stay implementation of the MATS rule. In December 2015, the D.C. Circuit issued an order remanding the rule to the EPA , without vacating the rule. As a result, the relevant Registrants continue to have a legal obligation under the MATS rule and the respective permits issued by the states in which each respective Registrant operates to comply with the MATS rule, including operating all emissions controls or otherwise complying with the MATS requirements. 

Cross-State Air Pollution Rule 

The EPA &#32;promulgated an initial rule in March 2005 to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide, precursors of ozone and particulate matter, from down-wind sources in the eastern United States, including Iowa, to reduce emissions by implementing a plan based on a market-based cap-and-trade system, emissions reductions, or both. After numerous appeals, the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR") was promulgated to address interstate transport of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions in 27 eastern and Midwestern states. 

The first phase of the rule was implemented January 1, 2015. In November 2015, the EPA &#32;released a proposed rule that would further reduce nitrogen oxides emissions in 2017. The public comment period closed on the proposal February 1, 2016. 

MidAmerican Energy has installed emissions controls at some of its coal-fueled generating facilities to comply with the CSAPR and may purchase emissions allowances to meet a portion of its compliance obligations. The cost of these allowances is subject to market conditions at the time of purchase and historically has not been material. MidAmerican Energy believes that the controls installed to date are consistent with the reductions to be achieved from implementation of the rule; however, the rule's full impact cannot be predicted until the EPA &#32;takes final action on the Phase II rules. 

MidAmerican Energy operates natural gas-fueled generating facilities in Iowa and BHE Renewables &#32;operates natural gas-fueled generating facilities in Texas, Illinois and New York, which are subject to the CSAPR. However, the provisions are not anticipated to have a material impact on Berkshire Hathaway Energy or MidAmerican Energy. None of PacifiCorp's, Nevada Power's or Sierra Pacific's generating facilities are subject to the CSAPR. 

&#32;56 

Regional Haze 

The EPA 's Regional Haze Rule, finalized in 1999, requires states to develop and implement plans to improve visibility in designated federally protected areas ("Class I areas"). Some of PacifiCorp's coal-fueled generating facilities in Utah, Wyoming, Arizona and Colorado and certain of Nevada Power's and Sierra Pacific's fossil-fueled generating facilities are subject to the Clean Air Visibility Rules. In accordance with the federal requirements, states are required to submit SIPs that address emissions from sources subject to best available retrofit technology ("BART") requirements and demonstrate progress towards achieving natural visibility requirements in Class I areas by 2064. 

The state of Utah issued a regional haze SIP requiring the installation of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter controls on Hunter Units 1 and 2, and Huntington Units 1 and 2. In December 2012, the EPA &#32;approved the sulfur dioxide portion of the Utah regional haze SIP and disapproved the nitrogen oxides and particulate matter portions. Certain groups appealed the EPA 's approval of the sulfur dioxide portion and oral argument was heard before the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ("Tenth Circuit") in March 2014. In October 2014, the Tenth Circuit upheld the EPA 's approval of the sulfur dioxide portion of the SIP. The state of Utah and PacifiCorp filed petitions for administrative and judicial review of the EPA 's final rule on the BART determinations for the nitrogen oxides and particulate matter portions of Utah's regional haze SIP in March 2013. In May 2014, the Tenth Circuit dismissed the petition on jurisdictional grounds. In addition, and separate from the EPA 's approval process and related litigation, the Utah Division of Air Quality completed an alternative BART analysis for Hunter Units 1 and 2, and Huntington Units 1 and 2. The alternative BART analysis and revised regional haze SIP were submitted in June 2015 to the EPA &#32;for review and proposed action after a public comment period. The revised regional haze SIP included a state-enforceable requirement to cease operation of the Carbon Facility by August 15, 2015. PacifiCorp retired the Carbon Facility in December 2015. In January 2016, the EPA &#32;published two alternative proposals to either approve the Utah SIP as written or reject the Utah SIP relating to nitrogen oxides controls and require the installation of selective catalytic reduction ("SCR") controls at Hunter Units 1 and 2 and Huntington Units 1 and 2 within five years. In January 2016, a public hearing was held on the EPA 's alternative proposals and the public comment period closes March 14, 2016. The EPA 's final action on the Utah regional haze SIP is expected in mid-2016. Until the EPA &#32;makes its final determination, it is unknown whether additional controls will be required on the four BART-eligible units in Utah. 

The state of Wyoming issued two regional haze SIPs requiring the installation of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter controls on certain PacifiCorp coal-fueled generating facilities in Wyoming. The EPA &#32;approved the sulfur dioxide SIP in December 2012 and the EPA 's approval was upheld on appeal by the Tenth Circuit in October 2014. In addition, the EPA &#32;initially proposed in June 2012 to disapprove portions of the nitrogen oxides and particulate matter SIP and instead issue a federal implementation plan ("FIP"). The EPA &#32;withdrew its initial proposed actions on the nitrogen oxides and particulate matter SIP and the proposed FIP, published a re-proposed rule in June 2013, and finalized its determination in January 2014, which aligns more closely with the SIP proposed by the state of Wyoming. The EPA 's final action on the Wyoming SIP approved the state's plan to have PacifiCorp install low-nitrogen oxides burners at Naughton Units 1 and 2, SCR controls at Naughton Unit 3 by December 2014, SCR controls at Jim Bridger Units 1 through 4 between 2015 and 2022, and low-nitrogen oxides burners at Dave Johnston Unit 4. The EPA &#32;disapproved the Wyoming SIP and issued a FIP for Dave Johnston Unit 3, where it required the installation of SCR controls by 2019 or, in lieu of installing SCR controls, a commitment to shut down Dave Johnston Unit 3 by 2027, its currently approved depreciable life. The EPA &#32;also disapproved the Wyoming SIP and issued a FIP for the Wyodak coal-fueled generating facility ("Wyodak Facility"), requiring the installation of SCR controls within five years (i.e., by 2019). The EPA &#32;action became final on March 3, 2014. PacifiCorp filed an appeal of the EPA 's final action on the Wyodak Facility in March 2014. The state of Wyoming also filed an appeal of the EPA 's final action, as did the Powder River Basin Resource Council, National Parks Conservation Association and Sierra Club. In September 2014, the Tenth Circuit issued a stay of the March 2019 compliance deadline for the Wyodak Facility, pending further action by the Tenth Circuit in the appeal. In June 2014, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality issued a revised BART permit allowing Naughton Unit 3 to operate on coal through 2017 and providing for natural gas conversion of the unit in 2018. In its final action, the EPA &#32;indicated it supported the conversion of the unit to natural gas as its fuel source and would expedite action relative to consideration of the natural gas conversion once the state of Wyoming submitted the requisite SIP amendment; nonetheless, Naughton Unit 3 natural gas conversion, should it ultimately be pursued, remains subject to final approval by the EPA . 

&#32;57 

The state of Arizona issued a regional haze SIP requiring, among other things, the installation of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter controls on Cholla Unit 4. The EPA &#32;approved in part, and disapproved in part, the Arizona SIP and issued a FIP for the disapproved portions requiring SCR controls on Cholla Unit 4. PacifiCorp filed an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ("Ninth Circuit") regarding the FIP as it relates to Cholla Unit 4, and the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality and other affected Arizona utilities filed separate appeals of the FIP as it relates to their interests. The Ninth Circuit issued an order in February 2015, holding the matter in abeyance relating to PacifiCorp and Arizona Public Service Company as they work with state and federal agencies on an alternate compliance approach for Cholla Unit 4. In January 2015, permit applications and studies were submitted to amend the Cholla Title V permit, and subsequently the Arizona SIP to convert Cholla Unit 4 to a natural gas-fueled unit in 2025. The Arizona Department of Environmental Quality prepared a draft permit and a revision to the Arizona regional haze SIP, held two public hearings in July 2015 and, after considering the comments received during the public comment period that closed on July 14, 2015, submitted the final proposals to the EPA &#32;for review, public comment and final action. The EPA 's final action on the Arizona regional haze SIP is expected by late 2016. 

The state of Colorado regional haze SIP requires SCR controls at Craig Unit 2 and Hayden Units 1 and 2, in which PacifiCorp has ownership interests. Each of those regional haze compliance projects are underway. In addition, in February 2015, the state of Colorado submitted an amendment to its regional haze SIP relating to Craig Unit 1, in which PacifiCorp has an ownership interest, to require the installation of SCR controls by 2021. The amended SIP is pending consideration by the EPA . 

The Navajo Generating Station, in which Nevada Power is a joint owner with an 11.3% ownership share, is also a source that is subject to the regional haze BART requirements. In January 2013, the EPA &#32;announced a proposed FIP addressing BART and an alternative for the Navajo Generating Station that includes a flexible timeline for reducing nitrogen oxides emissions. Nevada Power, along with the other owners of the facility, have been reviewing the EPA 's proposal to determine its impact on the viability of the facility's future operations. The land lease for the Navajo Generating Station is subject to renewal in 2019. Renewal of the lease will require completion of an Environmental Impact Statement as well as a renewal of the fuel supply agreement. In September 2013, the EPA &#32;issued a supplemental proposal that included another BART alternative called the Technical Work Group Alternative, which is based on a proposal submitted to the EPA &#32;by a group of Navajo Generating Station stakeholders. The EPA &#32;accepted comments on the various alternatives through January 6, 2014 and, in August 2014, the EPA &#32;announced it had approved the final plan for the Navajo Generating Station, including the reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxides by approximately 80% through the retirement of one unit, or the curtailment of generation equivalent to one unit, in 2019 and installation of SCR controls at the other two units by 2030. In October 2014, several groups filed an appeal of the EPA 's decision in the Ninth Circuit. The Hopi Tribe was initially part of the larger group appeal but their challenge was subsequently severed from that appeal and is proceeding separately. Until such time as additional action is taken by the Ninth Circuit and the uncertainties regarding lease and agreement renewal terms for the Navajo Generating Station are addressed, Nevada Power cannot predict the outcome of this matter. Nevada Power filed the ERCR Plan in May 2014 that proposed to eliminate its ownership participation in the Navajo Generating Station in 2019, which was approved by the PUCN. 

Until the EPA &#32;takes final action in each state and decisions have been made on each appeal, PacifiCorp, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific cannot fully determine the impacts of the Regional Haze Rule on its respective generating facilities. 

Climate Change 

In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their emissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits all countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive. In the context of the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025 from 2005 levels. The cornerstone of the United States' commitment is the Clean Power Plan which was finalized by the EPA &#32;in 2015. 

&#32;58 

GHG Performance Standards 

Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA &#32;may establish emissions standards that reflect the degree of emissions reductions achievable through the best technology that has been demonstrated, taking into consideration the cost of achieving those reductions and any non-air quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements. On August 3, 2015, the EPA &#32;issued final new source performance standards, establishing a standard of 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per MWh for large natural gas-fueled generating facilities and 1,400 pounds of carbon dioxide per MWh for new coal-fueled generating facilities with the "Best System of Emission Reduction" reflecting highly efficient supercritical pulverized coal facilities with partial carbon capture and sequestration or integrated gasification combined-cycle units that are co-fired with natural gas or pre-combustion slipstream capture of carbon dioxide. The new source performance standards have been appealed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. However, despite the pendency of the appeal, any new fossil-fueled generating facilities constructed by the relevant Registrants will be required to meet the GHG new source performance standards. 

&#160; 

Clean Power Plan 

In June 2014, the EPA &#32;released proposed regulations to address GHG emissions from existing fossil-fueled generating facilities, referred to as the Clean Power Plan, under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The EPA 's proposal calculated state-specific emission rate targets to be achieved based on the "Best System of Emission Reduction." In August 2015, the final Clean Power Plan was released, which established the Best System of Emission Reduction as including: (a) heat rate improvements; (b) increased utilization of existing combined-cycle natural gas-fueled generating facilities; and (c) increased deployment of new and incremental non-carbon generation placed in-service after 2012. The EPA &#32;also changed the compliance period to begin in 2022, with three interim periods of compliance and with the final goal to be achieved by 2030. Based on changes to the state emission reduction targets, which are now all between 771 pounds per MWh and 1,305 pounds per MWh, the Clean Power Plan, when fully implemented, is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the power sector to 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. The EPA &#32;also released in August 2015, a draft federal plan as an option or backstop for states to utilize in the event they do not submit approvable state plans. The public comment period on the draft federal plan and proposed model trading rules closed January 21, 2016. States were required to submit their initial implementation plans by September 2016 but could request an extension to September 2018. However, on February 9, 2016, the United States Supreme Court ordered that the EPA 's emission guidelines for existing sources be stayed pending the disposition of the challenges to the rule in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and any action on a writ of certiorari before the United States Supreme Court. The full impacts of the final rule or the federal plan on the Registrants cannot be determined until the outcome of the pending litigation and subsequent appeals, the development and implementation of state plans, and finalization of the federal plan. PacifiCorp, MidAmerican Energy, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific have historically pursued cost-effective projects, including plant efficiency improvements, increased diversification of their generating fleets to include deployment of renewable and lower carbon generating resources, and advancement of customer energy efficiency programs. 

In the absence of comprehensive climate legislation or regulation, the Registrants have continued to invest in lower- and non-carbon generating resources and to operate in an environmentally responsible manner. In July 2015, BHE &#32;signed the American Business Act on Climate pledge, in which BHE &#32;pledged to build on the Company's combined investment of more than $15 billion in renewable energy generation under construction and in operation through 2014 by investing up to an additional $15 billion. Components of BHE 's pledge include: 

&#8226; 

Pursue the construction of an additional 552 MW of new wind-powered generation in Iowa, increasing MidAmerican Energy's generating portfolio to more than 4,000 MW of wind, which is equivalent to 58 percent of its retail energy load in 2017. MidAmerican Energy owns the largest portfolio of wind-powered generating capacity in the United States among rate-regulated utilities. 

&#8226; 

Retire more than 75 percent of the Nevada Utilities' coal-fueled generating capacity in Nevada by 2019. 

&#8226; 

Add more than 1,000 MW of incremental solar and wind capacity through long-term power purchase agreements to PacifiCorp's owned 1,030 MW of wind-powered generating capacity. PacifiCorp owns the second largest portfolio of wind-powered generating capacity in the United States among rate-regulated utilities. This incremental renewable generation, expected to be on-line by the end of 2017, would bring PacifiCorp's non-carbon generating capacity to more than 4,500 MW, which equates to approximately 22 percent of PacifiCorp's retail energy load in 2017.

&#32;59 

New federal, regional, state and international accords, legislation, regulation, or judicial proceedings limiting GHG emissions could have a material adverse impact on the Registrants, the United States and the global economy. Companies and industries with higher GHG emissions, such as utilities with significant coal-fueled generating facilities, will be subject to more direct impacts and greater financial and regulatory risks. The impact is dependent on numerous factors, none of which can be meaningfully quantified at this time. These factors include, but are not limited to, the magnitude and timing of GHG emissions reduction requirements; the design of the requirements; the cost, availability and effectiveness of emissions control technology; the price, distribution method and availability of offsets and allowances used for compliance; government-imposed compliance costs; and the existence and nature of incremental cost recovery mechanisms. Examples of how new requirements may impact the Registrants include: 

&#8226; 

Additional costs may be incurred to purchase required emissions allowances under any market-based cap-and-trade system in excess of allocations that are received at no cost. These purchases would be necessary until new technologies could be developed and deployed to reduce emissions or lower carbon generation is available; 

&#8226; 

Acquiring and renewing construction and operating permits for new and existing generating facilities may be costly and difficult; 

&#8226; 

Additional costs may be incurred to purchase and deploy new generating technologies; 

&#8226; 

Costs may be incurred to retire existing coal-fueled generating facilities before the end of their otherwise useful lives or to convert them to burn fuels, such as natural gas or biomass, that result in lower emissions; 

&#8226; 

Operating costs may be higher and generating unit outputs may be lower; 

&#8226; 

Higher interest and financing costs and reduced access to capital markets may result to the extent that financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a greater business risk; and 

&#8226; 

The relevant Registrant's natural gas pipeline operations, electric transmission and retail sales may be impacted in response to changes in customer demand and requirements to reduce GHG emissions. 

The impact of events or conditions caused by climate change, whether from natural processes or human activities, could vary widely, from highly localized to worldwide, and the extent to which a utility's operations may be affected is uncertain. Climate change may cause physical and financial risk through, among other things, sea level rise, changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. Consumer demand for energy may increase or decrease, based on overall changes in weather and as customers promote lower energy consumption through the continued use of energy efficiency programs or other means. Availability of resources to generate electricity, such as water for hydroelectric production and cooling purposes, may also be impacted by climate change and could influence the Registrants' existing and future electricity generating portfolio. These issues may have a direct impact on the costs of electricity production and increase the price customers pay or their demand for electricity. 

&#32;60 

Regional and State Activities 

Several states have promulgated or otherwise participate in state-specific or regional laws or initiatives to report or mitigate GHG emissions. These are expected to impact the relevant Registrant, and include: 

&#8226; 

In June 2013, Nevada Senate Bill 123 ("SB 123") was signed into law. Among other things, SB 123 and regulations thereunder require Nevada Power to file with the PUCN an emission reduction and capacity replacement plan by May 1, 2014. In May 2014, Nevada Power filed its emissions reduction capacity replacement plan. The plan provided for the retirement or elimination of 300 MW of coal generating capacity by December 31, 2014, another 250 MW of coal generating capacity by December 31, 2017, and another 250 MW of coal generating capacity by December 31, 2019, along with replacement of such capacity with a mixture of constructed, acquired or contracted renewable and non-technology specific generating units. The plan also sets forth the expected timeline and costs associated with decommissioning coal-fired generating units that will be retired or eliminated pursuant to the plan. The PUCN has the authority to approve or modify the emission reduction and capacity replacement plan filed by Nevada Power. Given the PUCN may recommend and/or approve variations to Nevada Power's resource plans relative to requirements under SB 123, the specific impacts of SB 123 on Nevada Power cannot be determined. 

&#8226; 

Under the authority of California's Global Warming Solutions Act signed into law in 2006, the California Air Resources Board adopted a GHG cap-and-trade program with an effective date of January 1, 2012; compliance obligations were imposed on entities beginning in 2013. The program purports to impose compliance obligations on entities, including PacifiCorp, that deliver wholesale energy to points that are outside of California, irrespective of retail service obligations. These obligations and other impacts to wholesale energy market structures may, if implemented as written, increase costs to PacifiCorp. In addition, California law imposes a GHG emissions performance standard to all electricity generated within the state or delivered from outside the state that is no higher than the GHG emissions levels of a state-of-the-art combined-cycle natural gas-fueled generating facility, as well as legislation that adopts an economy-wide cap on GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. An executive order issued in 2015 aims to reduce emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and 80% by 2050. 

&#8226; 

The states of California, Washington and Oregon have adopted GHG emissions performance standards for base load electricity generating resources. Under the laws in California and Oregon, the emissions performance standards provide that emissions must not exceed 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide per MWh. Effective April 2013, Washington's amended emissions performance standards provide that GHG emissions for base load electricity generating resources must not exceed 970 pounds of carbon dioxide per MWh. These GHG emissions performance standards generally prohibit electric utilities from entering into long-term financial commitments (e.g., new ownership investments, upgrades, or new or renewed contracts with a term of five or more years) unless any base load generation supplied under long-term financial commitments comply with the GHG emissions performance standards. 

&#8226; 

Washington and Oregon enacted legislation in May 2007 and August 2007, respectively, establishing goals for the reduction of GHG emissions in their respective states. Washington's goals seek to (a) reduce emissions to 1990 levels by 2020; (b) reduce emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by 2035; and (c) reduce emissions to 50% below 1990 levels by 2050, or 70% below Washington's forecasted emissions in 2050. Oregon's goals seek to (a) cease the growth of Oregon GHG emissions by 2010; (b) reduce GHG levels to 10% below 1990 levels by 2020; and (c) reduce GHG levels to at least 75% below 1990 levels by 2050. Each state's legislation also calls for state government to develop policy recommendations in the future to assist in the monitoring and achievement of these goals. 

&#8226; 

In January 2016, the Washington State Department of Ecology proposed a new rule regulating greenhouse gas emissions from sources in Washington. The proposed rule would regulate greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride beginning in 2017 with three-year compliance periods thereafter (i.e., 2017-2019, 2020-2022, etc.). Under the proposed rule, the Washington State Department of Ecology will establish a greenhouse gas emissions reduction pathway for all covered entities. Covered entities may use emission reduction units, which may be traded with other covered entities, to meet their compliance requirements. PacifiCorp's resources that would be covered under the proposed rule would include the Chehalis generating facility, which is a natural gas combined-cycle plant located in Washington state. 

&#8226; 

The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a mandatory, market-based effort to reduce GHG emissions in ten Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, required, beginning in 2009, the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector of 10% by 2018. In May 2011, New Jersey withdrew from participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Following a program review in 2012, the nine Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative states implemented a new 2014 cap which was approximately 45% lower than the 2012-2013 cap. The cap is reduced each year thereafter by 2.5%. 

&#32;61 

GHG Litigation 

Each Registrant closely monitors ongoing environmental litigation applicable to its respective operations. Numerous lawsuits have been unsuccessfully pursued against the industry that attempt to link GHG emissions to public or private harm. The lower courts initially refrained from adjudicating the cases under the "political question" doctrine, because of their inherently political nature. These cases have typically been appealed to federal appellate courts and, in certain circumstances, to the United States Supreme Court. An adverse ruling in similar cases would likely result in increased regulation and costs for GHG emitters, including the Registrants' generating facilities. 

The GHG rules and the Registrants' compliance requirements are subject to potential outcomes from proceedings and litigation challenging the rules. 

Renewable Portfolio Standards 

Each state's RPS described below could significantly impact the relevant Registrant's consolidated financial results. Resources that meet the qualifying electricity requirements under each RPS vary from state to state. Each state's RPS requires some form of compliance reporting and the relevant Registrant can be subject to penalties in the event of noncompliance. Each Registrant believes it is in material compliance with all applicable RPS laws and regulations. 

Washington's Energy Independence Act establishes a renewable energy target for qualifying electric utilities, including PacifiCorp. The requirements are 3% of retail sales by January 1, 2012 through 2015, 9% of retail sales by January 1, 2016 through 2019 and 15% of retail sales by January 1, 2020 and each year thereafter. In April 2013, Washington State Senate Bill No. 5400 ("SB 5400") was signed into law. SB 5400 expands the geographic area in which eligible renewable resources may be located to beyond the Pacific Northwest, allowing renewable resources located in all states served by PacifiCorp to qualify. SB 5400 also provides PacifiCorp with additional flexibility and options to meet Washington's renewable mandates. 

The Oregon Renewable Energy Act ("OREA") provides a comprehensive renewable energy policy and RPS for Oregon. Subject to certain exemptions and cost limitations established in the law, PacifiCorp and other qualifying electric utilities must meet minimum qualifying electricity requirements for electricity sold to retail customers of at least 5% in 2011 through 2014, 15% in 2015 through 2019, 20% in 2020 through 2024, and 25% in 2025 and subsequent years. As required by the OREA, the OPUC has approved an automatic adjustment clause to allow an electric utility, including PacifiCorp, to recover prudently incurred costs of its investments in renewable energy generating facilities and associated transmission costs. 

The California RPS required all California retail sellers to procure an average of 20% of retail load from renewable resources by December 31, 2013, 25% by December 31, 2016 and 33% by December 31, 2020. In October 2015, California Senate Bill No. 350 was signed into law, which increased the current RPS requirement to 40% by December 31, 2024, 45% by December 31, 2027 and 50% by December 31, 2030. In December 2011, the CPUC &#32;adopted a decision confirming that multi-jurisdictional utilities, such as PacifiCorp, are not subject to the percentage limits within the three product content categories of RPS-eligible resources established by the legislation that have been imposed on other California retail sellers. 

Utah's Energy Resource and Carbon Emission Reduction Initiative provides that, beginning in the year 2025, 20% of adjusted retail electric sales of all Utah utilities be supplied by renewable energy, if it is cost effective. Retail electric sales will be adjusted by deducting the amount of generation from sources that produce zero or reduced carbon emissions, and for sales avoided as a result of energy efficiency and DSM &#32;programs. Qualifying renewable energy sources can be located anywhere within the WECC, and renewable energy credits can be used. 

Since 1997, NV Energy has been required to comply with a RPS. Current law requires the Nevada Utilities to meet 18% of their energy requirements with renewable resources for 2014, 20% for 2015 through 2019, 22% for 2020 and 2024, and 25% for 2025 and thereafter. The RPS also requires 5% of the portfolio requirement come from solar resources through 2015 and increasing to 6% in 2016. Nevada law also permits energy efficiency measures to be used to satisfy a portion of the RPS through 2025, subject to certain limitations. 

&#32;62 

Water Quality Standards 

The federal Water Pollution Control Act ("Clean Water Act") establishes the framework for maintaining and improving water quality in the United States through a program that regulates, among other things, discharges to and withdrawals from waterways. The Clean Water Act requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the "best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact" to aquatic organisms. After significant litigation, the EPA &#32;released a proposed rule under &#167;316(b) of the Clean Water Act to regulate cooling water intakes at existing facilities. The final rule was released in May 2014, and became effective in October 2014. Under the final rule, existing facilities that withdraw at least 25% of their water exclusively for cooling purposes and have a design intake flow of greater than two million gallons per day are required to reduce fish impingement (i.e., when fish and other aquatic organisms are trapped against screens when water is drawn into a facility's cooling system) by choosing one of seven options. Facilities that withdraw at least 125 million gallons of water per day from waters of the United States must also conduct studies to help their permitting authority determine what site-specific controls, if any, would be required to reduce entrainment of aquatic organisms (i.e., when organisms are drawn into the facility). PacifiCorp and MidAmerican Energy are assessing the options for compliance at their generating facilities impacted by the final rule and will complete impingement and entrainment studies. PacifiCorp's Dave Johnston generating facility and all of MidAmerican Energy's coal-fueled generating facilities, except Louisa, Ottumwa and Walter Scott, Jr. Unit 4, which have water cooling towers, withdraw more than 125 million gallons per day of water from waters of the United States for once-through cooling applications. PacifiCorp's Jim Bridger, Naughton, Gadsby, Hunter and Huntington generating facilities currently utilize closed cycle cooling towers but are designed to withdraw more than two million gallons of water per day. The standards are required to be met as soon as possible after the effective date of the final rule, but no later than eight years thereafter. The costs of compliance with the cooling water intake structure rule cannot be fully determined until the prescribed studies are conducted. In the event that PacifiCorp's or MidAmerican Energy's existing intake structures require modification, the costs are not anticipated to be significant to the consolidated financial statements. Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific do not utilize once-through cooling water intake or discharge structures at any of their generating facilities. All of the Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific generating stations are designed to have either minimal or zero discharge; therefore, they are not impacted by the &#167;316(b) final rule. 

In November 2015, the EPA &#32;published final effluent limitation guidelines and standards for the steam electric power generating sector which, among other things, regulate the discharge of bottom ash transport water, fly ash transport water, combustion residual leachate and non-chemical metal cleaning wastes. These guidelines, which had not been revised since 1982, were revised in response to the EPA 's concerns that the addition of controls for air emissions has changed the effluent discharged from coal- and natural gas-fueled generating facilities. Permitting authorities are required to include the new limits in each impacted facility's discharge permit upon renewal; the new limits must be met as soon as possible, beginning November 1, 2018 and must be implemented by December 31, 2023. Most of the issues raised by this rule are already being addressed through the coal combustion residuals rule and are not expected to impose significant additional requirements on the facilities. 

In April 2014, the EPA &#32;and the United States Army Corps of Engineers issued a joint proposal to address "Waters of the United States" to clarify protection under the Clean Water Act for streams and wetlands. The proposed rule comes as a result of United States Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 that created confusion regarding jurisdictional waters that were subject to permitting under either nationwide or individual permitting requirements. The final rule was released in May 2015 but is currently under appeal in multiple courts and a nationwide stay on the implementation of the rule was issued in October 2015. Depending on the outcome of the appeal(s), a variety of projects that otherwise would have qualified for streamlined permitting processes under nationwide or regional general permits will be required to undergo more lengthy and costly individual permit procedures based on an extension of waters that will be deemed jurisdictional. However, until the rule is fully litigated and finalized, the Registrants cannot determine whether projects that include construction and demolition will face more complex permitting issues, higher costs or increased requirements for compensatory mitigation. 

Coal Combustion Byproduct Disposal 

In May 2010, the EPA &#32;released a proposed rule to regulate the management and disposal of coal combustion byproducts, presenting two alternatives to regulation under the RCRA. The public comment period closed in November 2010. The final rule was released by the EPA &#32;on December 19, 2014, was published in the Federal Register on April 17, 2015 and was effective on October 19, 2015. The final rule regulates coal combustion byproducts as non-hazardous waste under RCRA Subtitle D and establishes minimum nationwide standards for the disposal of coal combustion residuals. Under the final rule, surface impoundments and landfills utilized for coal combustion byproducts may need to be closed unless they can meet the more stringent regulatory requirements. 

&#32;63 

At the time the rule was published in April 2015, PacifiCorp operated 18 surface impoundments and seven landfills that contained coal combustion byproducts. Prior to the effective date in October 2015, nine surface impoundments and three landfills were either closed or repurposed to no longer receive coal combustion byproducts and hence are not subject to the final rule. MidAmerican Energy owns or operates nine surface impoundments and four landfills that contain coal combustion byproducts. At the time the rule was published in April 2015, the Nevada Utilities operated ten evaporative surface impoundments and two landfills that contained coal combustion byproducts. Prior to the effective date in October 2015, four of the surface impoundments were closed, four impoundments discontinued receipt of coal combustion byproducts and are subject to final closure on or before April 2018, and two surface impoundments remain active and subject to the final rule. The two landfills remain active and subject to the final rule. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of the impacts on asset retirement obligations as a result of the final rule. 

Other 

Other laws, regulations and agencies to which the relevant Registrants are subject include, but are not limited to: 

&#8226; 

The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and similar state laws may require any current or former owners or operators of a disposal site, as well as transporters or generators of hazardous substances sent to such disposal site, to share in environmental remediation costs. 

&#8226; 

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, under which the United States Department of Energy is responsible for the selection and development of repositories for, and the permanent disposal of, spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive wastes. Refer to Note 13 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 11 of the Notes to Financial Statements of MidAmerican Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding MidAmerican Energy's nuclear decommissioning obligations. 

&#8226; 

The federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 and similar state statutes establish operational, reclamation and closure standards that must be met during and upon completion of PacifiCorp's mining activities. 

&#8226; 

The FERC &#32;evaluates hydroelectric systems to ensure environmental impacts are minimized, including the issuance of environmental impact statements for licensed projects both initially and upon relicensing. The FERC &#32;monitors the hydroelectric facilities for compliance with the license terms and conditions, which include environmental provisions. Refer to Note 16 &#32;of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Berkshire Hathaway Energy in Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of PacifiCorp in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for information regarding the relicensing of PacifiCorp's Klamath River hydroelectric system. 

The Registrants expect they will be allowed to recover their respective prudently incurred costs to comply with the environmental laws and regulations discussed above. The Registrants' planning efforts take into consideration the complexity of balancing factors such as: (a) pending environmental regulations and requirements to reduce emissions, address waste disposal, ensure water quality and protect wildlife; (b) avoidance of excessive reliance on any one generation technology; (c) costs and trade-offs of various resource options including energy efficiency, demand response programs and renewable generation; (d) state-specific energy policies, resource preferences and economic development efforts; (e) additional transmission investment to reduce power costs and increase efficiency and reliability of the integrated transmission system; and (f) keeping rates affordable. Due to the number of generating units impacted by environmental regulations, deferring installation of compliance-related projects is often not feasible or cost effective and places the Registrants at risk of not having access to necessary capital, material, and labor while attempting to perform major equipment installations in a compressed timeframe concurrent with other utilities across the country. Therefore, the Registrants have established installation schedules with permitting agencies that coordinate compliance timeframes with construction and tie-in of major environmental compliance projects as units are scheduled off-line for planned maintenance outages; these coordinated efforts help reduce costs associated with replacement power and maintain system reliability.
