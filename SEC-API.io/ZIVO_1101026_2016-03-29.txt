 Item 1. Business. 

General 

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 28, 1983, under the name of &#147;L. Peck Enterprises, Inc.&#148; On May 27, 1999, we changed our name to &#147;Western Glory Hole, Inc.&#148; From 1990 until October 2003, we had no business operations; we were in the development stage and were seeking profitable business opportunities. On October 30, 2003, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Health Enhancement Corporation (&#147;HEC&#148;) in exchange for 9,000,000 of our shares, making HEC our wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with this transaction, we changed our name to Health Enhancement Products, Inc. On October 14, 2014, at the annual meeting of the Shareholders of the Company, a proposal was passed to change the name of the Company from Health Enhancement Products, Inc. to Zivo Bioscience, Inc. (&#147;ZIVO&#148;). On October 30, 2014, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#147;FINRA&#148;) approved the name Zivo Bioscience, Inc. for trading purposes and the symbol change to ZIVO effective November 10, 2014.

We acquired HEC in 2003 because we believed its unique and complex algal culture produced natural bioactive compounds that promoted health benefits. A production facility based in Scottsdale, AZ produced and marketed a liquid dietary supplement with marginal success beginning in 2003 until sales were suspended in January of 2012.

Our new management team, in place since December 2011, determined the sole focus for the near term was to move forward with a research-based product development program. From 2012 through 2015, we engaged fully in such activities, all as more fully explained herein. We are implementing a business model in which we would derive future income from licensing and selling natural bioactive ingredients that may be derived from or are initially based on the algae cultures. We expect that these planned new products will likely be sold to much larger, better-financed animal, food, dietary supplement and medical food manufacturers. The anticipated income streams are to be generated from a) royalties and advances for licensed natural bioactive ingredients, and b) bulk sales of such ingredients. These bulk ingredients will likely be made by contracted ingredient manufacturers and then sold by us to animal food, dietary supplement and medical food processors and/or name-brand marketers. Further, we expect to license our bioactive molecules as lead compounds or templates for synthetic variants intended for therapeutic applications.

In January 2007, we established HEPI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as our wholly owned subsidiary (&#147;HEPI Pharma&#148;). The purpose of HEPI Pharma was to develop potential pharmaceutical applications for the bioactive ingredients that may be derived from our algae cultures.

In February 2013, we formed Zivo Biologic, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for the purpose of manufacturing and commercialization of proprietary ingredients for non-medicinal animal health applications. Zivo Biologic is 100% owned by Health Enhancement Products, Inc.

In August 2013, we acquired the assets, consisting primarily of intellectual property rights, of Wellness Indicators, Inc. (&#147;Wellness&#148;), a Michigan corporation based in Illinois. Concurrently, we formed WellMetris, LLC (&#147;WellMetris&#148;) as a 100% owned entity of ZIVO. We acquired four patent applications as part of the transaction, in addition to engineering drawings, prototypes, chemical formulae, validation data, laboratory equipment and IT equipment. We assigned all of the intellectual property acquired to WellMetris with a stated value of $1,391,281. The mission of WellMetris is to develop, manufacture, market and sell Wellness Tests. The Wellness Tests are intended to provide individuals the information and opportunity to optimize their health and identify future health risks or to provide insurers, employers and healthcare providers timely information to intervene with wellness programs, fitness regimes or other preventative measures. During the period of time since we have owned WellMetris, we have filed / drafted an additional eight patent applications around the intellectual property acquired, as noted in the section &#147;Patents and Proprietary Rights.&#148; In the summer of 2014, we evaluated the circumstances related to the original four patent applications acquired and determined that that two of the existing patent applications could be improved and filed new patents applications to redefine and better protect our intellectual property than the original purchased patent applications. We have abandoned one of the initial four patent applications purchased, released two of the four applications purchased and substituted them with two new patent applications, and retained ownership of one of the four applications purchased, which has now converted to a national phase application. In connection with the abandoned patents, we have protected our rights with regards to the original patent applications purchased, however we determined we should record a loss on abandonment of $1,391,281 for the year ended December 31, 2014 as the initial value of the acquired patent applications pending resides in the newly filed / drafted eight patent applications. 

Marketing and Sales

ZIVO Algal Products &#38; Derivatives 

The marketing and sale of all future products is subject to compliance with applicable regulations. Based on the findings from ongoing research, we intend to approach potential customers or licensees in the following market verticals. The products described throughout this document are still in the development stage, and subject to development risk. There can be no assurance that any of the products described below will prove to be effective, or if found to be effective, will be able to be produced in a commercially viable manner.

Animal Supplement 

A 2007 pilot study in dairy cows indicated that our algal culture may be effective in fending off the onset, or significantly reducing symptoms, of bovine mastitis &#150; a condition that effectively stops milk production. According to the National Mastitis Council, the condition affects 10% of the U.S. dairy herd at any one time, costing producers approximately $1,100 per case. In the U.S. alone, production losses are nearly $3 billion. Mycoplasma bovis causes a highly contagious and potentially fatal form of bovine mastitis (an infection of the mammary gland), for which there currently is no treatment. In the cow&#146;s udder, mammary epithelial cells form an immunological barrier to protect the mammary gland. When bacteria or other pathogens break through this barrier, an infection sets in, affecting quality and quantity of milk produced. Our compounds showed promising early results for restoration of the immunological barrier in experiments conducted in vitro, as conducted by the Principal Researcher at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, Department of Dairy Science.

On December 20, 2013, we entered into a confidential Collaboration and Option Agreement (&#147;Agreement&#148;) with Zoetis, a global animal health company, in connection with the prevention, treatment, and management of bovine mastitis. In the Agreement, we granted to the counterparty an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive license with us. Specifically, upon completion of a collaborative study (which is in process and will be completed upon adequate funding), the Agreement provides for a 90 day exclusivity period for evaluation of results and, based on the counterparty&#146;s desire for an exclusive license thereto, 90 days to conclude an exclusive license agreement.

With respect to livestock applications, we intend to move on three related fronts &#150; working to bring an algal feed ingredient to market in the United States by amplifying the algae culture; working to produce a bovine dietary supplement for global consumption outside the U.S.; and, putting ourselves in a position to license the isolated bioactive molecules to a pharmaceutical or drug development company for synthetic development as a prescribed drug for production animal applications. The isolated bioactive molecules form the intellectual property of interest to Zoetis. The feed ingredient and dietary supplement are intended for other potential collaborators.

The veterinarian who conducted the initial dairy cow in vivo study believes that the same autoimmune effect may be useful in combating bovine respiratory disease complex (&#147;BRDC&#148;), also known as &#147;shipping fever.&#148; BRDC typically occurs when beef cattle are shipped from the ranch to the feedlot prior to processing. According to the researchers at Kansas State University, cattle ranchers and feedlot operators attribute significant loss in body weight to BRDC when it occurs &#150; a $4 billion problem in the U.S. alone. Upon adequate funding, we are planning a field study to validate the effectiveness of our algal culture for this application.

The veterinarian who conducted the initial dairy cow in vivo study believes that the same autoimmune effect may be useful in combating bovine respiratory disease complex (&#147;BRDC&#148;), also known as &#147;shipping fever.&#148; BRDC typically occurs when beef cattle are shipped from the ranch to the feedlot prior to processing. According to the American Association of Beef Producers, cattle ranchers and feedlot operators attribute a 30% loss in body weight to BRDC when it occurs &#150; a $10 billion problem in the U.S. alone. We are planning a field study to validate several dosing modalities before offering a licensing option.

A 2008 pilot study in dogs indicated that our algal culture may be effective in relieving the symptoms of osteoarthritis and soreness from overexertion. That same experiment with our amplified algae culture can be repeated in dogs, which if successful could allow a relatively rapid release to production and sales as a companion animal dietary supplement. According to the Nutrition Business Journal, the canine joint-health dietary supplement market segment tops $360 million annually in the U.S. alone. Estimates for the world market may be substantially higher, but such estimates are difficult to obtain. An in vitro tissue explant experiment conducted by the Comparative Orthopaedics Laboratory at University of Missouri found that direct stimulation of living canine joint tissue with our bioactive compounds protected cartilage from degradation by IL-1b, an inflammatory cytokine. If our product is proven to be effective in vivo and can be produced on an efficient basis, we intend to sell or license our product as a supplement ingredient to larger, well-established and profitable brand names in the pet industry. We have conducted other laboratory studies simulating the effects of canine osteoarthritis with positive results.

With all of the above, the isolated bioactive molecules found in the amplified algae product may, subject to successful negotiations, be licensed to a pharmaceutical company for development as a synthetic prescription drug. We expect that the process of developing and testing such a drug could take years. Therefore, as is common practice, we intend to work toward negotiating a reasonable upfront licensing fee, milestone payments upon each successful conclusion of a development phase, followed by pre-market approval; and finally, a steady stream of royalties in the future. The other revenue streams generated by feed and supplement sales may begin to be realized in 2016, but no assurance can be provided in that regard. Much of the research and licensing progress has been and will continue to be paced by the availability of capital funding and/or debt financing (see Item 7 &#150; Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Liquidity and Capital Resources). 

Functional Food Ingredient 

According to NutraIngredients-USA, functional foods, or health foods, represent an estimated $20 billion business in the U.S. and a $28 billion business in Europe. The Middle East, although significantly smaller, is growing at a rate of 12-14% annually, followed closely by the newly-affluent in China and India. These foods typically are processed products that contain one or more staple foods augmented with a variety of performance-enhancing ingredients.

We intend to enter the food market with a healthy cholesterol and healthy immune response ingredient if and when the efficacy of our product can be demonstrated and it clears necessary regulatory hurdles. The timeframe is difficult to predict because of capital funding issues.

Dietary Supplement &#38; Nutraceutical 

The success of spirulina algae, dried kelp, Omega-3 fish oil, resveratrol, saw palmetto and similar supplements attests to the American public&#146;s obsession with &#145;natural&#146; products. The dietary supplement business is a $24 billion industry in the U.S. alone, and twice that the world over.

Rather than attempting to market a potential cholesterol related bioactive as a branded nutraceutical or supplement, we will endeavor to private-label the compound or finished product for larger, established marketers and retailers. If we are able to accomplish this, we believe this is a more efficient use of capital and resources while still retaining control of the intellectual property, the manufacturing process and pricing decisions. We do not intend to be placed in a position where our premier product application is commoditized and we must compete on price.

Medicinal Food 

Doctors prescribe medicinal foods prior to, during or after various medical procedures, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and physical therapy. At times, medicinal foods are used to augment the effects of prescription drugs. These medicinal foods are expensive and typically reimbursed by health insurers.

We believe that this area has potential for us if we can demonstrate that various properties of the algal extract can be isolated and produced as a medicinal food or beverage prescribed by physicians. This is an FDA-regulated sector, but the standards are less stringent than pharmaceutical applications. Once again, under our new business model, if we are able to produce a commercial product in this area, we will endeavor to enter into a private-label arrangement with a larger strategic partner to produce and distribute this product application.

In January of 2014, we developed an alternate use for extracted algal carrageenan, which can be mixed with sugar and other ingredients to create a gelatin-like substance and then mixed with over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, gluten-free proteins, medical food ingredients such as electrolytes, and our own, proprietary algal compounds to create a novel delivery method for children and individuals who can&#146;t swallow pills or chew, but are not candidates for intravenous feeding or medical intervention.

The gelatin-like substance can suspend and evenly disperse active ingredients, remains inert with the majority of such active ingredients, and remains stable and flavorful at room temperature for up to two (2) years. A provisional patent has been filed while various combinations of medicines and supplements are being evaluated as ingredient candidates. 

Once again, we will endeavor to license or private-label this new development to larger, well-established brand names in their respective fields. 

Pharmaceuticals 

We believe that we may be able to pursue prescription drug applications for our product. However, the process for developing a new prescription drug is costly, complex and time-consuming. It is an undertaking well beyond our current financial capabilities and one that may take years to achieve. If we pursue the development of a prescription drug, we will likely seek a partnership with a co-developer that will share in the risk and expense of the initial development process, and then share in any royalties resulting from the licensing or sale of any synthetic molecule and its homologs we are able to develop and license.

The first such step was the execution of the confidential bovine mastitis Collaboration and Option Agreement with Zoetis. Part of our business plan is to execute agreements that may ultimately result in option payments, licenses fees and royalty payments across animal and human applications.

WellMetris 

WellMetris was formed for the purpose of developing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling tests that we believe will allow individuals and their care providers to optimize personal health and identify future health risks. The information obtained will also provide insurers, employers and healthcare providers timely information to intervene with wellness programs, fitness regimes or other preventative measures. We plan to develop and commercialize such tests in three phases:

&#183;

In phase one (&#147;Phase One&#148;) or, alternately named Gen 1.0, we plan to develop and commercialize a series of tests, which are intended to measure indicators of good health and optimal metabolic function (collectively, the &#147;Phase One Test&#148;). The Phase One Test is being designed to measure biomarkers related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and antioxidant status to establish a metabolic assessment from which intervention can commence, and from which metabolic syndrome can be inferred.

&#183;

In phase two (&#147;Phase Two&#148;) or alternately named Gen 1.5, we plan to develop and commercialize a testing technology focused on the positive or negative metabolic effects of metabolizing fat and muscle efficiency due to changes in diet, exertion, hydration and dietary supplements in a self-administered format that integrates with smartphone operating systems.

&#183;

In phase three (&#147;Phase Three&#148;) or alternately named Gen 2.0, we plan to develop and commercialize additional tests intended to provide a more complete metabolic profile for an individual utilizing the metabolites present in urine. The Company believes the Gen 2.0 tests, in aggregate, will allow identification of healthy versus unhealthy bodily processes in real-time. This technology can also be applied to livestock and companion animals. As capital funding becomes available, the Company will move forward with finalizing its transition cow syndrome test, for which a provisional patent application has already been filed.

We are currently in Phase One of development as described above.

We believe there is a viable market for our Wellness Tests. More than 19% of Americans are afflicted with cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. The Wellness Tests are intended to identify pre-conditions to such illnesses. Such identification may allow for early intervention and reduce incidence of such illnesses or forestall their onset. This is critically important to large employers, insurers and governmental agencies who are payers for health claims and are facing massive increases in premiums or cash outlays.

The WellMetris technology also incorporates sophisticated software to analyze, report, record and manage wellness and health data for large groups such as large employers, pension funds, accountable care organizations, state Medicaid agencies and their actuarial consultants, underwriters, re-insurers and wellness consultants. The software also contains tools to conduct meta-analysis of baseline health benchmarks and monitor the progress of pre-clinical intervention programs within large groups.

Competition 

ZIVO Algal Products &#38; Derivatives

Generic dietary supplements and functional food ingredients such as vitamins, Omega-3 and antioxidants are made and marketed in a fiercely competitive, price-sensitive market environment. Recently, several algae producers have made health claims for their proprietary algae strains, ranging from treatment for diabetes to controlling HIV symptoms. Proprietary products offered by some marketers are often dogged by unsubstantiated claims of product efficacy or present potential product safety issues, which in turn draw the attention of regulators. The optimal position for a supplement and ingredient maker is when pricing power can be exerted through well-protected intellectual property and further backed by well-documented safety and efficacy claims.

We believe that our primary competition will come from innovators in food technology such as DSM-Martek, Cognis, ConAgra, Cargill and Nestle, each of which has active M&#38;A efforts, a large scientific staff and a generous R&#38;D budget to develop supplements and ingredients for a wide range of applications. However, we intend to approach these very same competitors as potential strategic partners, in order to leverage their specific expertise in certain food and supplement categories where a mutually beneficial relationship can be established. There can be no assurance that this strategy will be effective.

With respect to animal health, the companion animal dietary supplement segment, and specifically joint health, is made up almost exclusively of chondroitin/glutathione supplements, which have dominated that segment for more than a decade. This $360 million segment represents a potentially lucrative opportunity to introduce a completely new product if we are able to demonstrate superior benefits and produce a product at a comparable price.

Further, the animal health market as it pertains to mastitis in dairy cows, and specifically feed ingredients that exhibit beneficial properties, has been largely in the realm of yeast-based products. Only recently has there been a focus on algae-based alternatives, as promoted by Alltech with its $200 million expansion of an algae facility in Kentucky. In the U.S., feed ingredients cannot be promoted using any form of health claim, and dietary supplements for production animals are, to our knowledge, non-existent. However, outside the U.S., the use of dietary supplements is widespread, and we intend to market our refined ingredients to a worldwide market in partnership with a global brand name.

WellMetris 

The biomedical and biotech fields are fiercely competitive. Many of the &#147;wellness&#148; tests available to the healthcare consumer or provider are not necessarily accurate nor reliable because some do not take into account urine concentration as normalized by creatinine or specific gravity, which changes markedly throughout the day. Blood-based wellness tests can be even less reliable because the biomarkers for oxidative stress and inflammation are extremely dynamic and will often change before the blood can be tested, casting doubt on the results.

Although we are not aware of competitors or competing products have entered the market recently, there is no guarantee that our products will be proven to be effective and commercially viable, or that a larger, better-financed competitor may not emerge once we begin promoting our products. 

Raw Materials 

ZIVO Algal Products &#38; Derivatives 

We own the microbial mixture, including algae, and these source materials are held in growing environments at our contract research facilities. We are currently using these materials for research and development purposes only. We have also contracted a well-known research facility where we have cryopreserved a broad sampling of our cultures.

WellMetris 

In tandem with seeking regulatory approval, we will need two physical components to deliver our services. A dedicated, custom reader device and a test strip comprised of eight (8) different chemistry tests on a single urine test strip housed in a proprietary cartridge.

&#183;

The dedicated, custom reader device is manufactured by a third party to our specifications. We do not believe that there is a risk of supply, as there are several manufacturers available to produce the unit.

Regulation 

ZIVO Algal Products &#38; Derivatives 

General Regulatory Framework

&#160;

In the United States and any foreign market we may choose to enter, our product(s) are subject to extensive governmental regulations.

In the United States, these laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the federal, state and local levels and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions. The majority of these regulations directly relate to (1) the formulation, clinical testing, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, sale and storage of our product(s) and (2) product claims and advertising, including claims and advertising by us, as well as claims and advertising by distributors for which we may be held responsible.

U.S. product classification 

In the U.S., the formulation, testing, manufacturing, packaging, storing, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and sale of our product(s) are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies, primarily (1) the Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) and (2) the Federal Trade Commission (&#147;FTC&#148;). Our activities also are regulated by various agencies of the states and localities and foreign countries in which our product(s) are manufactured, promoted, distributed and sold. The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture and labeling of conventional foods, dietary ingredients and dietary supplements (or nutraceuticals).

The FDA is responsible for the oversight of all foods (including dietary supplements), drugs, cosmetics and medical devices in the United States. To the extent that we manufacture finished product(s) for sale to consumers (and in certain other limited circumstances where we sell our product as an ingredient), FDA regulations require us to comply with current good manufacturing practice (&#147;cGMP&#148;) regulations for the preparation, packing and storage of dietary supplements. This is a complex series of regulations that have posed significant compliance challenges to the supplement industry. To the extent that we supply our product(s) as ingredients for the use in foods or nutraceuticals, we would be required to comply with cGMP regulations for foods, as well as the provisions of the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 which require all companies involved in the production of food and food ingredients to develop and implement a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (&#147;HACCP&#148;) program.

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA&#148;) revised the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (&#147;FFDCA&#148;) by recognizing &#147;dietary supplements&#148; as a distinct category of food and, we believe, is generally favorable to the dietary supplement industry. The legislation grandfathered, with some limitations, dietary ingredients that were on the market before October 15, 1994. A dietary supplement that contains a dietary ingredient that was not on the market before October 15, 1994 will require evidence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that it is reasonably expected to be safe. To the extent that we offer for sale unique, proprietary ingredients we will be required to file with FDA evidence supporting the conclusion that we have a &#147;reasonable expectation&#148; that they will be safe for human consumption when used as directed. The FDA recently published an &#147;Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking&#148; which the nutraceutical industry believes will substantially increase the level of evidence required to satisfy the &#147;reasonable expectation&#148; standard.

DSHEA provides for specific nutritional labeling requirements for dietary supplements. DSHEA permits substantiated, truthful and non-misleading statements of nutritional support to be made in labeling, such as statements describing general well-being from consumption of a nutraceutical ingredient or the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient in affecting or maintaining structure or function of the body. A company making a statement of nutritional support must possess adequate substantiating scientific evidence for the statement, disclose on the label that the FDA has not reviewed the statement and that the product is not intended to mitigate, treat, cure or prevent disease, and notify the FDA of the statement within 30 days after its initial use. To the extent we produce finished product for use by consumers as nutraceuticals, we will be required to comply with these provisions of DSHEA.

Labeling and advertising regulations 

We may market one or more of our products as a conventional food or for use as an ingredient in conventional foods. Within the U.S., this category of products is subject to the Nutrition, Labeling and Education Act (&#147;NLEA&#148;) and regulations promulgated under the NLEA. The NLEA regulates health claims, ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in the product. The ingredients added to conventional foods must either be generally recognized as safe by experts (&#147;GRAS&#148;) or be approved as food additives under FDA regulations.

The FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of our product, has for years instituted enforcement actions against companies marketing supplements for alleged false, misleading or unsubstantiated advertising of some of their products. The FTC has specific guides for advertising claim substantiation as well as for the use of testimonials. As a general matter, companies making health related claims for their products or ingredients are required to possess well designed human clinical studies supporting such claims at the time they are made. Enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and significant monetary payments by the companies involved. In addition, the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials which we have and may in the future utilize. 

International regulations of our product(s) 

In many foreign markets in which we may choose to offer our product(s) for sale, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the relevant country's ministry of health or comparable agency. This would hold true for jurisdictions such as Canada, the European Union, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The approval process generally requires us to present each product and product ingredient to appropriate regulators for review of data supporting safety as well as substantiating any claims we may desire to make. We would also be required to comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that vary from country to country. Our failure to comply with these regulations could prevent our product(s) from being legally offered for sale. 

California Proposition 65 

California&#146;s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, also known as Proposition 65, provides that no person in the course of doing business shall knowingly discharge or release a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity into water or into land where such chemical passes or probably will pass into any source of drinking water, without first giving clear and reasonable warning. Among other things, the statute covers all consumer goods (including foods) sold in the State of California. Prop. 65 allows private enforcement actions (sometimes called &#147;bounty hunter&#148; actions). Reports indicate that over 100 such actions have been commenced annually over the past 3 years against companies in the nutraceutical industry (e.g., lead content of calcium, lead content of ginseng, PCB in fish oil) alleging that their products are contaminated with heavy metals or other compounds that would trigger the warning requirements of the Act. While we intend to take appropriate steps to ensure that any of our products that we may market will be in compliance with the Act, given the nature of this statute and the extremely low tolerance limits it establishes (well below federal requirements), there is a risk that we, our contracted producer or a licensee could be found liable for the presence of miniscule amounts of a prohibited chemical in our product. Such liability could be significant.

General 

To the extent dictated by our research partners, we will produce research-only feedstock for chemical analysis, safety studies and efficacy studies compliant with applicable state and federal regulations. However, we will rely on our research partners to conduct their respective R&#38;D programs in a manner compliant with applicable regulation and law. Once a product concept has been fully developed, we intend to manufacture that product, either internally or on a contract basis. In either case, we intend to adhere to all state and federal regulations relative to the safety and efficacy of the product application, as well as relevant regulations covering the safe and consistent manufacture of that product.

WellMetris 

We are working to make the WellMetris testing systems compliant with existing FDA regulations and to that end have retained FDA counsel and a medical device consulting firm, which are advising us as to the most time and cost-efficient path to classification and approvals.

Research and Development 

ZIVO 

Research 

Our algal culture has been subjected to product testing in its original form over several years, beginning in 2004. In spring of 2009, we undertook a research and development process with a view to fractioning the existing product into much smaller, concentrated groups of molecules with similar physical properties. These groups were then tested in vivo and in vitro with successful results noted in maintaining healthy cholesterol levels. A patent application describing a novel method of cholesterol regulation was submitted to the US Patent &#38; Trademark Office in spring of 2010 and a PCT filing was submitted in February of 2011.

Since January 2012 we are now developing our research programs internally and directing outside research companies. We spent approximately $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 on research and development, as compared to $2 million in 2014. The resources were spent on external research, mainly to independent facilities involved in the analysis and validation of our bioactive compounds in various applications and animal models. To date, all of these amounts have been directly expensed as they have been incurred.

As of mid-March 2016, the Company has moved forward with the following R&#38;D activities:

&#183;

Beginning in December 2012, a long-term study utilizing primary bovine mammary epithelial cells at the University of Wisconsin &#150; Madison allowed the Company to conduct more than one hundred individual experiments to test the bioactivity of different culturing, concentration and isolation methods. This phase of the research has been concluded.

&#183;

We are conducting a large-scale bovine study in direct cooperation with our counterparty (Zoetis) in the confidential Collaboration and Option Agreement, utilizing samples validated in vitro by the principal researcher at the University of Wisconsin and other research labs. The pre-pilot and pilot arms of this study have been completed and the results gained thus far may shorten the primary arm of this bovine study, which is expected to commence upon available funding.

&#183;

A study utilizing cadaver cartilage and joint tissue at the Comparative Orthopaedics Laboratory located at the University of Missouri showed positive early results for protective effects in canine joint health, using our natural bioactive compounds. The study will be repeated and expanded when capital funding is made available.

&#183;

A canine whole blood experiment was conducted at an international contract research organization to study the effects of our natural bioactive compounds on inflammatory cytokines and chemokines present in blood to assess whether a systemic or localized mechanism of action can be determined. Although the results trended in a positive direction, Company principals determined that a more definitive in vivo study would be more useful, pending capital funding.

&#183;

A large study has been placed on hold with an international contract research organization to gauge the efficacy of our natural bioactive compounds in treating the symptoms of canine osteoarthritis using surrogate test subjects. The study will commence pending capital funding

&#183;

The ongoing elucidation and characterization of the natural bioactive compounds had undergone a data integrity review in early 2014. Further work to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the bioactives and developing a 3D model has been placed on hold since spring of 2014 pending available funding.

&#160;

The purposes for these various tests and experiments are manifold: We are not only isolating bioactive molecules, but also testing the method of isolation and then validating that the isolated molecules retain their bioactivity across a select range of human and animal cell lines, and that these molecules exhibit no deleterious effects before they are introduced into humans or animals during in vivo studies. We must ensure that this does not occur occasionally, it is required for every production process, every safety validation process and every intended application, such as a canine dietary supplement that is mixed with food, as opposed to a canine dietary supplement that is administered in the form of a chewable caplet. Further, as we now enter production scale-up, we are required to provide cGMP protocols and QA protocols that show we can produce the algal biomass and/or the active ingredients safely, consistently and in defined quantities, and therefore rely on these same experiments and methods to substantiate our quality claims. These datasets form the basis for establishing the value of a license agreement. Therefore, every single license that we hope to issue requires its own data set and safety validation for the specific application being licensed. These datasets represent the core of the intellectual property that is being licensed.

Status of Culturing and Production 

Independent of identifying the bioactive compound(s) or validating their bioactivity and safety is the process and method of growing and maintaining the algal culture that gives rise to the bioactive compound(s) in the first place. This culture and its growing environment were developed decades ago. However, the method was not commercially viable, and the Company has expended considerable resources to develop a single-species, high-volume and commercially viable production methodology.

We made the decision to spread product development risk, resulting in the creation of a product platform strategy whereby four different forms of the bioactive compound(s) could be formulated and developed for future marketing across several categories and applications:

a) the raw algae biomass, which would naturally contain the beneficial compound(s); b) a more refined extraction which could be introduced into animal feed or supplements; c) the isolated natural molecule(s) which could be more appropriate for human consumption in food or supplements; and d) the synthetic version of any such natural molecule(s) which could be licensed to drug development companies or joint-ventured in a risk-sharing arrangement.

To that end, we contracted with several experts in the field to coordinate isolation of the different organisms present in the culture, grow each of them separately and then subject them to the same life-cycle stressors as the original culture. The stated goal was to grow algae in bulk as a direct source of micro-nutrition and feed ingredient for production animals, namely beef cattle and dairy cows, as well as companion animal dietary supplementation. The production capability would be licensed to others. Per the business model, we have no intention of fielding a finished product, but rather empowering licensees to strike supply agreements with larger, better-financed brand names or licensing directly with such brand names. There can be no assurance that commercially viable products will be developed, or that they can be successfully and profitably manufactured and marketed.

Over the course of 2013 and 2014, our contracted researchers have been able to successfully isolate one or more algal species, scale up the production/output of the isolated species and still retain some of the key, desirable bioactive properties associated with the earlier, complex culture. Proof of concept growing techniques, including both pond and bioreactor modes, have shown that our target algal specie can be grown in commercially viable quantities, and the harvest time has been compressed from several months to several days&#146; time. We are uncertain if we can grow biomass in sufficient tonnage for livestock feed, but we believe that the current production methods will allow us to satisfy demand for a more refined extract introduced into animal supplements and, as a more purified substance, into human supplements.

In 2014, we tested the algal biomass and isolates derived from the aforementioned prototype growing facilities in dairy cows with successful results.

In 2015, we finalized development of Standard Operating Procedures (&#147;SOP&#146;s&#148;) in order to draft contractual terms with contract growers domestically and abroad. The SOP&#146;s form the basis for current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#147;cGMP&#148;) protocols to which contract growers must adhere as part of the FDA&#146;s updated FSMA requirements, regardless of country of origin. We identified and began contract negotiations with select growers. We conducted experiments in post-processing, such as lyophilization, cytoplasm separation, drying, centrifugal water extraction and other techniques to better understand feed and food handling requirements. We interviewed FDA compliance consultants for animal feed applications in order to execute a contract in 2106.

Looking Forward 

A significant portion of our research efforts have been directed towards identifying a candidate &#147;class of compound&#148; and one or more &#147;active ingredients&#148;, as it relates to autoimmune and anti-inflammatory response. These are very broad categories and work is still required to fully describe the 3D structure of such compounds, as the actual structure is how the bioactivity exists and where the value is locked. One approach among several we&#146;ve taken is to create synthetic homologs, and from them deduce the composition and 3D structure of the naturally bioactive compounds. This is an iterative process, with equal potential for dead-ends and breakthroughs. Substantial time, money, and effort have been expended in this regard. In early 2014, we determined that the synthetic approach was not yielding the hoped-for results and halted that particular effort. 

Further, in spring of 2014 we commenced an intensive data integrity study to re-examine the analytics and isolation techniques to make sure we were approaching the characterization process in as expeditious and efficient manner as possible. We believe that we have made substantial progress towards achieving these hoped-for results, but more confirmatory studies and scale-up experiments are still needed.

Subject to the availability of sufficient funding, we estimate that we will, in fiscal 2016, be required to expend in excess of $2,000,000 on research and subsequent product development in order to complete the initiatives discussed herein and cover operating expenses. In addition to the activity in 2015, we will continue our research and development efforts in 2016 and beyond. These expenditures will need to be met from external funding sources. In the past, we have had difficulty raising funds from external sources. Thus, we may not be able to raise the funding required to continue our research and development activities. In the event that these sources are not available or adequate to meet our research needs, we will be unable to pursue our research activities, in which case our ability to substantiate the accumulated intellectual property with objective clinical support for its characterization, method of action and efficacy will continue to be impeded, thereby severely hindering our ability to generate licensing revenue (or otherwise commercialize our products) and adversely affect our operating results.

In the event that we are successful in raising the necessary capital, we will continue our current research program with our research partners, we will expand our investigations to include various experts and consultants on an as-needed basis and explore new product concepts and applications. Our current contracts with our research partners cover the following activities:

&#183;

Ongoing isolation and characterization of individual natural molecules from various production formats in sufficient quantities for downstream analyses, experiments, standards development, FDA compliance, cGMP and QA protocols

&#183;

Ongoing validation of samples in vivo and in vitro to substantiate efficacy and safety for each specific application or claim, i.e., bovine mastitis, bovine respiratory disease complex, canine osteoarthritis, canine joint health, porcine respiratory/reproductive syndrome, etc., to boost value for each specific license

&#183;

Synthetic development/validation of individual molecules to boost value of licenses

&#183;

Ongoing validation of samples in vivo and in vitro for standards development, FDA safety compliance, cGMP and QA protocols

Ancillary development activities would occur in parallel with our research partners.

Development 

WellMetris 

WellMetris is initially focused on large-scale, programmatic applications of its testing and reporting platform. We are interested in supporting the intervention by wellness consultants or medical professionals in the lifestyle choices made by individuals covered by traditional health insurance plans, retiree medical benefits pools, employer-sponsored health initiatives and taxpayer-sponsored programs like Medicaid and the ACA (Affordable Care Act). These interventions, which are typically non-medical, have been shown to be successful in delaying the onset of chronic diseases such as diabetes or cardiovascular problems. We believe that targeting asymptomatic individuals and focusing intervention efforts on these individuals may have a positive result for wellness programs, and potentially lower premiums and health claims.

At the close of 2015, the WellMetris product platform requires additional prototype analyzers and additional dry chemistry reagent strips and cartridges to conduct pilot programs for potential customers, and to use the result of these pilot programs to help normalize data for the dry chemistry reagents as part of the FDA submission package. Such efforts are currently on hold, pending capital funding.

The next step in product development revolves around self-administration and self-monitoring of individual health, primarily focused on those individuals who purchase dietary supplements, join health clubs or are otherwise actively pursuing a healthy lifestyle. This involves miniaturizing some aspects of our test cartridge concept and creating a mobile application, thereby eliminating the need for the analyzer device. This is a significant undertaking, which will not commence until we realize revenues from our Phase 1 product launch or attract additional capital funding.

Compliance with Environmental Laws 

We believe that we are, in all material respects, in compliance with local, state, and federal environmental laws applicable to our production and waste disposal. The cost of this compliance activity to date has not been material, and has been absorbed within our general operations overhead.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 we had two full-time employees, positioned in executive management. In addition, we have three part-time people acting on a consulting basis as our Chief Science Officer, Director, Research &#38; Development and Lead Scientist &#38; Clinical Coordinator. We believe that our employee relations are good. No employee is represented by a union.
