General 

F &#38; M Bank Corp. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;), incorporated in Virginia in 1983, is a one bank holding company pursuant to section 3(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, and owns 100% of the outstanding stock of its affiliate, Farmers &#38; Merchants Bank (Bank). TEB Life Insurance Company (TEB) and Farmers &#38; Merchants Financial Services, Inc. (FMFS) are wholly owned subsidiaries of Farmers &#38; Merchants Bank. Farmers &#38; Merchants Bank also holds a majority ownership in VBS Mortgage LLC, (VBS). 

Farmers &#38; Merchants Bank was chartered on April 15, 1908, as a state chartered bank under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia. TEB was incorporated on January 27, 1988, as a captive life insurance company under the laws of the State of Arizona. FMFS is a Virginia chartered corporation and was incorporated on February 25, 1993. VBS (formerly Valley Broker Services, Inc.) was incorporated on May 11, 1999. The Bank purchased a majority interest in VBS on November 3, 2008. 

As a commercial bank, the Bank offers a wide range of banking services including commercial and individual demand and time deposit accounts, repurchase agreements for commercial customers, commercial and individual loans, internet and mobile banking, drive-in banking services, ATMs at all branch locations and several off-site locations, as well as a courier service for its commercial banking customers. TEB was organized to re-insure credit life and accident and health insurance currently being sold by the Bank in connection with its lending activities. FMFS was organized to write title insurance but now provides brokerage services, commercial and personal lines of insurance to customers of the Bank. VBS originates conventional and government sponsored mortgages through their offices in Harrisonburg, Woodstock and Fishersville. 

&#160; &#160; 

The Bank makes various types of commercial and consumer loans and has a large portfolio of residential mortgages and a concentration in development lending. The local economy is relatively diverse with strong employment in the agricultural, manufacturing, service and governmental sectors. 

The Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s principal executive office is at 205 South Main Street, Timberville, VA 22853, and its phone number is (540) 896-8941.

No one employee devotes full-time services to F &#38; M Bank Corp. 

Competition

These other institutions include large national and regional banks, other community banks, nationally chartered savings banks, credit unions, consumer finance companies, mortgage companies, loan production offices, mutual funds and life insurance companies. Competition for loans and deposits is affected by a variety of factors including interest rates, types of products offered, the number and location of branch offices, marketing strategies and the reputation of the Bank within the communities served.

Regulation and Supervision 

General. The operations of F &#38; M Bank Corp. and the Bank are subject to federal and state statutes, which apply to bank holding companies and state member banks of the Federal Reserve System. The common stock of F &#38; M Bank Corp. is registered pursuant to and subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). These include, but are not limited to, the filing of annual, quarterly and other current reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). As an Exchange Act reporting company, the Company is directly affected by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (&#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley&#8221;), which is aimed at improving corporate governance and reporting procedures. The Company believes it is in compliance with SEC and other rules and regulations implemented pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley and intends to comply with any applicable rules and regulations implemented in the future. 

F &#38; M Bank Corp., as a bank holding company, is subject to the provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "Act") and is supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve Board&#8221;). The Act requires F &#38; M Bank Corp. to secure the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before F &#38; M Bank Corp. acquires ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any institution, including another bank. 

As a bank holding company, F &#38; M Bank Corp. is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as it may require pursuant to the Act. The Federal Reserve Board may also conduct examinations of F &#38; M Bank Corp. and any or all of its subsidiaries. Under Section 106 of the 1970 Amendments to the Act and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with an extension of credit, pro&#173;vision of credit, sale or lease of property or furnishing of services. 

Federal Reserve Board regulations limit activities of bank holding companies to managing or controlling banks or non-banking activities closely related to banking. These activities include the making or servicing of loans, performing certain data processing services, and certain leasing and insurance agency activities. Since 1994, the Company has entered into agreements with the Virginia Community Development Corporation to purchase equity positions in several Low Income Housing Funds; these funds provide housing for low-income individuals throughout Virginia. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is necessary to engage in any of the activities described above or to acquire interests engaging in these activities. 

The Bank as a state member bank is supervised and regularly examined by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Board. Such supervision and examination by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions and the Federal Reserve Board is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and not the stockholders of F &#38; M Bank Corp. 

Payment of Dividends. The Company is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. A significant portion of the revenues of the Company result from dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are various legal limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company. Under the current regulatory guidelines, prior approval from the Federal Reserve Board is required if cash dividends declared in any given year exceed net income for that year, plus retained net profits of the two preceding years. A bank also may not declare a dividend out of or in excess of its net undivided profits without regulatory approval. The payment of dividends by the Bank or the Company may also be limited by other factors, such as requirements to maintain capital above regulatory guidelines. 

Bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank or the Company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting their businesses. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, or the Company, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. Based on the Bank&#8217;s current financial condition, the Company does not expect that any of these laws will have any impact on its ability to obtain dividends from the Bank. 

The Company also is subject to regulatory restrictions on dividends to its shareholders. Regulators have indicated that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends only if the organization&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Further, a bank holding company should inform and consult with the Federal Reserve Board prior to declaring a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period (e.g., quarter) for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the organization&#8217;s capital structure.

Capital Requirements. In 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC approved a new rule that substantially amends the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The final rule implements the "Basel III" regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (see definition below). The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios which was effective for us on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes "capital" for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are : (i) a new common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%, which is increased from 4%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%, which is unchanged from the previous rules; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a "capital conservation buffer" of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and when fully effective in 2019, will result in the following minimum ratios: (a) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (b) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (c) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement would be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such activities. 

The CETI and Tier 1 leverage ratio of the Company as of December 31, 2015, were 12.46% and 12.18%, respectively, which are significantly above the minimum requirements. The guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets. 

&#160; 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Effective on March 11, 2001, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the &#8220;GLB Act&#8221;) allows a bank holding company or other company to certify status as a financial holding company, which will allow such company to engage in activities that are financial in nature, that are incidental to such activities, or are complementary to such activities. The GLB Act enumerates certain activities that are deemed financial in nature, such as underwriting insurance or acting as an insurance principal, agent or broker; dealing in or making markets in securities; and engaging in merchant banking under certain restrictions. It also authorizes the Federal Reserve to determine by regulation what other activities are financial in nature, or incidental or complementary thereto. 

USA Patriot Act of 2001. In October 2001, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 was enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania and Northern Virginia which occurred on September 11, 2001. The Patriot Act is intended to strengthen U.S. law enforcements&#8217; and the intelligence communities&#8217; abilities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The continuing and potential impact of the Patriot Act and related regulations and policies on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging. The Patriot Act contains sweeping anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, and imposes various regulations, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. 

Community Reinvestment Act. The requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act are also applicable to the Bank. The act imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions. A financial institution&#8217;s efforts in meeting community needs currently are evaluated as part of the examination process pursuant to twelve assessment factors. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility.

Regulation and Supervision, continued 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law on July 21, 2010. Its wide ranging provisions affect all federal financial regulatory agencies and nearly every aspect of the American financial services industry. Among the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that directly impact the Company is the creation of an independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has the ability to implement, examine and enforce complaints with federal consumer protection laws, which govern all financial institutions. For smaller financial institutions such as the Company and the Bank, their primary regulators will continue to conduct its examination activities. 

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions designed to reform mortgage lending, which includes the requirement of additional disclosures for consumer mortgages. In addition, the Federal Reserve has issued new rules that have the effect of limiting the fees charged to merchants for debit card transactions. The result of these rules will be to limit the amount of interchange fee income available explicitly to larger banks and indirectly to us. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation. 

Although the Dodd-Frank Act provisions themselves are extensive, the ultimate impact on the Company of this massive legislation is unknown. The Act provides that several federal agencies, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission, shall issue regulations implementing major portions of the legislation, and this process is ongoing. 

Mortgage Lending. In 2013, the CFPB adopted a rule, effective in January 2014, to implement certain sections of the Dodd-Frank Act requiring creditors to make a reasonable, good faith determination of a consumer&#8217;s ability to repay any closed-end consumer credit transaction secured by a 1-4 family dwelling. The rule also establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement to ensure a borrower&#8217;s ability to repay for loans that meet the definition of &#8220;qualified mortgage.&#8221; Loans that satisfy this &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; safe harbor will be presumed to have complied with the new ability-to-repay standard.
