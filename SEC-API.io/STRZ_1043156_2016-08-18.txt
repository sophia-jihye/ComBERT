Chapter 11 Reorganization 

&#160; 

On September 28, 2011, Star Buffet, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Star&#8221;) filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (&#8220;Bankruptcy Code&#8221;) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Arizona (the &#8220;Bankruptcy Court&#8221;), in the proceeding titled In re: Star Buffet, Inc., Case No.2:11-bk-27518-GBN (the &#8220;Chapter 11 Case&#8221;). Star&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary, Summit Family Restaurants Inc. (&#8220;Summit&#8221;), also filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 on September 29, 2011 in the Bankruptcy Court, in the proceeding titled In re: Summit Family Restaurants Inc., Case No. 2:11-bk-27713-GBN. The cases for Star Buffet, Inc. and Summit Family Restaurants Inc. (collectively the &#8220;Debtors&#8221;) were consolidated and jointly administered. None of the Company&#8217;s other subsidiaries were included in the bankruptcy filings. The Debtors continued to operate their businesses as &#8220;debtors-in-possession&#8221; under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. Under the Bankruptcy Code, certain claims against the Debtors that were in existence prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition were stayed during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Reorganization. The balance of the unresolved claims are reflected in the January 27, 2014 balance sheet as &#8220;Liabilities subject to compromise.&#8221; 

&#160; 

On December 17, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the &#8220;Confirmation Order&#8221;) confirming the Company&#8217;s plan of reorganization (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;), which provided for the payment in full of all approved claims. A copy of the Confirmation Order and the Plan as confirmed are attached as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, to the Company&#8217;s Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 20, 2012. The Plan became effective on January 17, 2013 and the Company emerged from bankruptcy. The payment obligations under the Plan were estimated to be in excess of $10 million. The Plan provided for these obligations to be discharged from operating income derived from the restaurants operated by its affiliates, an exit loan of $300,000 from Suzanne H. Wheaton, the wife of CEO Robert E. Wheaton, and proceeds from sale of certain restaurant properties. 

&#160; 

Since filing for reorganization, the Debtors have sold fifteen properties, $5.8 million of the proceeds were used to pay off the obligation to Wells Fargo, the Company&#8217;s primary secured creditor in full, $1.9 million was used to pay the other secured creditors and $801,000 was used to pay unsecured creditors, pursuant to the Plan. As of January 26, 2015, the Company has reduced its liabilities subject to compromise to $800,000 and has made all payments required under the Plan. Resolution and payment of the remaining liabilities subject to compromise will result of payment in full of all of the Company&#8217;s creditors at the time of the bankruptcy filing and a complete discharge of the Company. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Star Buffet, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#8220;Star&#8221; and collectively with its subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company&#8221;), is a multi-concept holding company. As of January 27, 2014, the Company, through eight independently capitalized subsidiaries operated five 4B&#8217;s restaurants, four JB&#8217;s restaurants, two Barnhill&#8217;s Buffet restaurants, two Pecos Diamond Steakhouses, two Western Sizzlin restaurants, one BuddyFreddys restaurant, one Casa Bonita Mexican theme restaurant and one Bar-H Steakhouse. The Company also had seven restaurants closed for remodeling and repositioning of which two were used as warehouses, four restaurants were leased to third-party operators and one used as an office. The Company&#39;s restaurants are located in Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Tennessee, Texas and Utah. The Company has an executive and accounting office in Scottsdale, Arizona and an accounting office in Salt Lake City, Utah. As a result of the significant developments identified below, the Company&#8217;s holdings have changed significantly. The Company was incorporated on July 28, 1997 in Delaware. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160;

As a result of the continued weakness in the U.S. economy, the Company&#8217;s comparable restaurant sales declined in the fiscal year ended January 27, 2014. The Company continues to evaluate the local geographic markets in which it operates and individual restaurant units for trends and changes in operating metrics. Over the past four fiscal years, the Company has closed 34 restaurants that have experienced deteriorating operating results and for which our management has assessed a low probability of near term prospects of reversing such trends. The Company may rebrand restaurants where management believes that the local market remains desirable but that the existing brand is not performing well. There may be further restaurant unit closures in the future as our management continues to evaluate operating results. However, our management believes that it has closed and incurred impairment charges on the substantial number of restaurant units that have exhibited poor operating results. The Company continues to explore the expansion of its non-buffet brands as those recently have generally performed better. As a result of the store closings, the Company will experience significantly lower revenue levels than those in the recent past. Our management believes the Company will generate sufficient cash flows from operations at these lower revenue levels to support its operations and, together with the proceeds from the sale of certain of its properties, to pay its scheduled debt repayments. &#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s business strategy is to operate a broadly diversified portfolio of well-established, family-oriented restaurants throughout the southeastern and western United States. The Company believes that a broad, diversified business base combined with a low field and corporate overhead cost structure will result in consistently positive cash flows . 

&#160; 

Segment and Related Reporting 

&#160; 

All of the brands the Company operates are in the U.S. within the full-service dining industry and provide similar products to similar customers and therefore, are considered to be one segment for reporting purposes. The brands also possess similar economic characteristics, resulting in similar long-term expected financial performance characteristics. Sales to external customers are derived principally from food and beverage sales. We do not rely on any major customers as a source of sales. We believe we meet the criteria for aggregating our operating segments into a single reporting segment. 

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

The Company has indicated that it plans moderate growth based primarily through acquisitions or re-opening existing closed stores. The Company supplements its program of acquisitions with the purchase of restaurant properties that can be converted to the Company&#8217;s existing brands and minority investments in, or strategic alliances with, other restaurant chains. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Acquisitions. The Company believes that a number of acquisition opportunities exist in restaurant segments that include buffets, cafeterias, family dining and steakhouses. The Company believes that many restaurants in these segments are privately owned and may be available for acquisition particularly when the owners decide to retire. Other restaurants may become available for purchase when corporate owners decide to convert from a company store to a franchisor business model or when a company is faced with a financial reorganization. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Restaurant Conversions. In recent years, a number of chains in the family dining and budget steakhouse segments of the restaurant industry have experienced operational difficulties and declining performance. The Company believes that these difficulties are the result of increasing competition from national casual dining and steakhouse chains which offer superior product quality and service at competitive prices. Many of these restaurants and steakhouses occupy desirable locations that the Company believes can be acquired and converted to one of its concepts at lower prices or leased at lower rates when compared to the cost of new construction. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Minority Investments and Strategic Alliances. The Company intends to seek minority investments in, or strategic alliances with, other restaurant chains. The Company believes that these investments can provide an attractive opportunity for the Company and may facilitate the acquisition of restaurants at a later date.

As the Company and its principal competitors expand operations in various geographic areas, competition can be expected to increase.
