&#160; 

We were recognized and certified as a Hi-Tech Enterprise jointly by the Shaanxi Department of Science and Technology, Department of Finance, Bureau of National Taxation and Bureau of Local Taxation in August 2009.

&#160; 

Specialty fruit juices, or &#8220;small breed&#8221; fruit juices, are juices squeezed from fruits that are grown in relatively small quantities such as kiwi juice, mulberry juice, turnjujube juice and pomegranate juice. Currently, our specialty juice beverage offerings include pear juice, kiwi juice and mulberry juice. By the end of 2015, we possessed 22 patents and proprietary technologies in the processing technology of specialty fruit juice and gained a number of honors and qualifications in the fruit juice industry. 

&#160; 

We intend to complete our current construction in progress, which will help to further diversify our business to reduce market risk, and also expand our distribution channel of fruit juice beverages to meet increasing customer demand.

Competitive Advantages 

&#160; 

We believe our competitive advantages include the modern equipment and technology employed at our production factories in Shaanxi and Liaoning Provinces and the strategic locations of our manufacturing facilities. Our equipment and technology help us to ensure product quality, control costs and allow us to meet international fruit juice production standards such as ISO9001, HACCP, and Kosher certifications, and those imposed by the United States Food and Drug Administration. In addition, our manufacturing facilities are strategically located near regional fruit production centers. For example, Shaanxi Province, where two of our manufacturing facilities are located, is known in the PRC for pear and kiwi production. Our proximity to regional fruit production centers enables us to purchase fresh fruits directly from farmers, avoid the need of transporting fresh fruit over long distances to processing facilities, reduce our transportation expenses and damage to fresh fruit during transportation and helps us maintain high quality of finished products by preserving freshness. 

&#160; 

We own and operate four manufacturing facilities in the PRC. To take advantage of economies of scale and to enhance our production efficiency, each of our manufacturing facilities focuses on juice products centering around one particular fruit based on the proximity of each facility to the supply center of that fruit. All concentrated juice products are manufactured using the same type of production line with slight variations in processing methods. We operate our pear juice products business out of our Jingyang Branch Office of SkyPeople (China). Our business involving apple juice products is operated out of Huludao Wonder and Yingkou, and our business involving kiwi products is operated out of Shaanxi Qiyiwangguo, in which we have held a 91.15% ownership interest since June 2006.

Corporate History 

&#160;

On June 17, 2009, we incorporated a new Delaware corporation called Harmony MN Inc., (&#8220;HMN&#8221;), to be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company with offices initially in California to act as a sales company for the Company. The total number of shares of capital stock that HMN has authority to issue is 3,000 shares, all of which are Common Stock with a par value of $1.00 per share. On June 20, 2009, HMN was registered in the State of California to transact business in such state. HMN has not yet commenced operations and the Company plans to close down this dormant subsidiary.

&#160;

&#160; 

The Yidu project includes the establishment of: 

&#160; 

1. one modern orange distribution and sales center (the &#8220;distribution center&#8221;); &#160; 

2. one orange comprehensive utilization deep processing zone (the &#8220;deep processing zone&#8221;), including: &#160;

&#160; 

Principal Products 

&#160; 

There are two general categories of fruit and vegetable juices available in the market. One is fresh juice that is canned directly upon filtering and sterilization after being squeezed out of fresh fruits or vegetables. The other general category is juice drinks made out of concentrated fruit and vegetable juices. Concentrated fruit and vegetable juices are produced through the pressing, filtering, sterilization and evaporation of fresh fruits or vegetables. Concentrated juices are not drinkable. Instead, they are used as a basic ingredient for manufacturing juice drinks and as an additive to fruit wine and fruit jam, cosmetics and medicines. 

&#160; 

Our core products are (1) fruit juice concentrates, mainly including concentrated apple, pear, and kiwi juices; (2) fruit beverages, including pure fruit beverages and fruit cider beverages; and (3) other fruit-related products, including, for example, fresh fruits, vegetables and fructose. 

&#160; 

Fruit Juice Concentrate 

&#160; 

Our family of fruit juice concentrate products mainly includes concentrated apple, pear, and kiwi juices. Fruit juice concentrates can only be produced during the &#8220;squeezing season&#8221; of a year, when fresh fruits are available in the market. Generally, the squeezing season for apples is from August through January or February of the following year, the squeezing season for pears is from July or August through April of the following year, and the squeezing season for kiwifruits is from September through December or January of the following year. 

&#160; 

Fruit juice concentrates are manufactured through a multi-stage process, which includes pressing, filtering, sterilizing and evaporating fresh fruits and fruit juices. 

&#160; 

Fruit juice concentrates are used as the base ingredient in fruit juice beverages and are also used in other products such as ice cream, fruit wine and, to a lesser extent, cosmetics and medicine. 

&#160; 

We currently sell apple, pear, and kiwifruit concentrates. Our fruit juice concentrate products include concentrated apple and pear juice. Our concentrated kiwifruits are made of three different categories: kiwifruit puree, concentrated kiwifruit puree and concentrated kiwifruit juice. 

&#160; 

Kiwifruit puree is prepared from clean, sound kiwifruits that have been washed and sorted prior to processing. The kiwifruits are crushed and pressed and the pulp of the kiwifruit is kept. All of the water and some of the pulp are then removed from the kiwifruit puree and the sugar level is increased in order to produce concentrated kiwifruit puree. We use advanced technologies to maintain the natural flavors and nutrients of the kiwifruit puree. Kiwifruit puree and concentrated kiwifruit puree are ideal raw materials used in the production of concentrated kiwifruit juices, kiwifruit beverages, kiwifruit flavored ice creams, smoothies and health care products. Concentrated kiwifruit juice is made from concentrated kiwifruit puree by removing all of the remaining pulp. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our production line at the Shaanxi Qiyiwangguo factory can only produce puree and concentrated puree. We use the production line that produces concentrated apple and pear juice in the facility of the Jingyang branch of SkyPeople (China) to produce concentrated clear kiwifruit juice. 

&#160; 

Concentrated apple juice and concentrated pear juice are prepared from fresh fruits. Fruit juice concentrates can also be combined with other fruit juices for the production of blended fruit juices, canned foods, confectionaries, fruit cider beverages and other beverage products. 

&#160; 

Fruit Juice Beverages &#160; 

&#160; 

As compared to our fruit juice concentrate products, which experience seasonality, fruit juice beverages can be produced and sold year round. We plan to focus on developing new beverages with higher margins. 

&#160; 

The manufacturing process for fruit juice beverages involves further processing of fruit juice concentrates. Our fruit juice beverages are divided into two categories: pure fruit juice and fruit cider beverages. The gross margins for our fruit beverages were 41% and 36% in fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively.

&#160; 

Currently we produce six flavors of fruit beverages in 280 ml glass bottles, 418 ml glass bottles and 500 ml glass bottles as well as BIB (&#8220;Bag in Box&#8221;) packages, including apple juice, pear juice, kiwifruit juice, mulberry juice, peach juice and pomegranate juice. We currently sell our fruit beverages to over 100 distributors and more than 20,000 retail stores in approximately 20 provinces. Our products are sold through distributors in stores such as Yonghui Supermarket in Beijing, RT-Mart in Shenyang, Carrefour in Chongqing and Shenyang and GMS Supermarket in Shanghai. 

&#160; 

Other Fruit-Related Products 

&#160; 

We also generally sell fresh fruits and vegetables, fructose and other products. 

&#160; 

The fruit processing capacity of our fructose production line is 10 tons of fresh apples or pears per hour. Fructose is often used as an ingredient to make beverages and other food products. Although we currently plan to use the new fructose production line to produce pear fructose, this production may also be used to produce apple fructose from apple juice concentrates. 

&#160; 

The gross margin for our other fruit-related products was 29% in the 2014 fiscal year. We did not have revenue from the sale of fruit-related products during the 2015 fiscal year.

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We believe that continuous investment in research and development is a key component to being a leader in fruit juice concentrate and fruit beverages. Our Research and Development Center of SkyPeople (China) was certified as the Provincial Industrial Research &#38; Development Center jointly by six provincial institutions of Shaanxi Provincial People&#8217;s Government, including the Department of Communications, the Department of Science and Technology, the Department of Finance, the Bureau of National Taxation, the Bureau of Local Taxation and Xi&#8217;an Customs in December 2009. Our research and development effort emphasizes the design and development of our processing technology with the goal of decreasing processing costs, optimizing our production capabilities and maintaining product quality. During 2015 and 2014, the Company did not incur any research and development expenses. In 2015 and 2014, the Company suspended four research and development agreements with research institutions. No penalties were imposed on the suspension of agreements. We currently intend to concentrate on further building up our internal research and development team. 

&#160; 

Industry and Principal Markets 

&#160; 

Global Market 

&#160; 

The fruit juice processing industry is an emerging industry. Consumption of fruit juice beverages has grown and sales have increased rapidly in recent years due to the increasing health consciousness of consumers and the natural and healthy qualities of fruit juice beverages. According to a new report from specialist food and drink consultancy Zenith International, global fruit juice and drink consumption exceeded 80 billion litres in 2015, representing 10% of overall soft drink volume, and the market is forecast to rise by an annual 5% over the next 5 years to 105 billion litres in 2020. 

&#160; 

According to the Fruit Juice Section of the PRC Food and Agriculture Export Association, www.Chinajuice.org, the PRC exported approximately $1 billion in concentrated fruit juice to foreign countries every year in the past few years, which accounted for around 60% of the global output of concentrated fruit juice. 

&#160; 

The PRC Market 

&#160; 

The PRC has the world&#8217;s largest population, but the consumption of fruit juice beverages is relatively low. According to the report &#8220;China Fruit Juice Beverages Business and Market Analysis&#8221; published by the PRC Food and Agriculture Export Association, www.Chinajuice.org, the annual per capita consumption of fruit beverages in the PRC in 2009 was approximately 1 kilogram, which accounted for only 13% of the average world per capita consumption and 4% of the average per capita consumption in industrialized countries. In 2010, Chinese fruit juice production reached 17 million tons, an increase of 20.6% compared to 2009. In 2014, fruit juice consumption was RMB8.2 billion, an increase of 3% compared to the previous year. The growth rate of the revenue from fruit juice and fruit juice drink has ranked first compared with other food related industries. We believe that the increasing health consciousness of consumers and the quality of living powered by the PRC&#8217;s economic growth will continue to fuel the demand for our fruit juice products. 

&#160; 

Marketing, Sales and Distribution 

&#160; 

We market our products through three primary methods: direct contact with foreign businesses, attendance at international exhibitions and sales made through trade websites. Our marketing and sales teams work closely together to maintain a consistent message to our customers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The sales team is divided into three subdivisions, focusing on the sales of fruit juice concentrates, fruit beverage products and derivative products, respectively. 

&#160; 

We sell our fruit juice concentrates both domestically and internationally, while we have only sold our fruit beverages domestically. We sell our products either indirectly through distributors with good credit history or directly to end-users. 

&#160; 

Our export business is primarily comprised of fruit juice concentrates. The export of our fruit juice concentrates is handled internally by our international trade department, which has 20 employees. 

&#160; 

The North American and European markets represent a large portion of apple and pear concentrate consumption. The U.S. market is a highly mature market with stable growth for apple concentrate. Although we sell to distributors in the PRC, and therefore cannot be certain of where our exported fruit juice concentrate products are ultimately sold, we believe that the volume of exports to the United States of our fruit juice concentrate products has increased annually since 2004. The European market, which we believe has a generally stable consumer base, has been a target market since our inception. Apple concentrate is used to produce many beverages and wines consumed by Europeans. The Middle East is also a target market for our apple juice concentrate. 

&#160; 

The Chinese market drives our fruit beverage sales most beverages are sold through provincial, city and county-level agents. We also sell directly to hotels, supermarkets and similar outlets in smaller quantities. The fruit beverage sales are carried out by a team of 45 employees. Historically, we have only sold our fruit beverages regionally in Shaanxi Province and some neighboring cities in the PRC. One of our strategies is to broaden the geographic presence of our brand-named fruit beverages and expand production and sales of higher margin fruit beverages in the PRC. 

&#160; 

Our kiwifruit products are targeted at the European, Southeast Asian, South Korean, Japanese, Middle Eastern, Mainland Chinese and Taiwanese markets. The growth of our kiwifruit concentrate and kiwifruit beverages has exceeded the growth rate of any other product we offer. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The markets in which we operate are competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to shifting customer demands and expectations. We believe that a number of companies are producing products that compete directly with our product offerings and some of our competitors have significantly more financial resources than we possess. 

&#160; 

Our apple juice concentrate competitors include Sdic Zhounglu Fruit Juice Co., Ltd., Yantai North Andre (Group) Juice Co., Ltd., Shaanxi Hengxing Fruit Juice and Shaanxi Haisheng Juice Holdings Co., Ltd. We also compete with fruit juice companies such as Wahaha, Huiyuan, Nongfu Guoyuan, Tongyi and Meizhiyuan. 

&#160; 

We believe our competitive advantages include our modern equipment and our proprietary processes for the production of specialty fruit juices or small breed fruit juices. We currently possess thirteen patents technologies in fruit juice production. Among these thirteen proprietary technologies, we have obtained nine patents and are in the process of applying for another six patents for other technologies. Our current specialty fruit juice offering includes kiwifruit and mulberry related juice products. We also have technologies to produce concentrated persimmon, turnjujube, apricot, cherry, cherry tomato, sea-buckthorn, strawberry and wolfberry juices. Our technology allows us to develop and produce beverages, such as our new mulberry and kiwifruit cider beverages, which we introduced in the Chinese market in the first quarter of 2009. Our research indicates that these new beverages have higher gross margins than that of the industry average. 

&#160; 

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We believe the proximity of our manufacturing facilities to fruit farms is also one of our competitive advantages. It allows us to purchase fruit directly from fruit farmers, avoid the need for long distance transportation, minimize damages to the fruits and maximize the freshness of the fruits. 

&#160; 

We produce fruit beverages from our fruit juice concentrates, which allows us to better control the quality of our beverages. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials and Other Supplies 

&#160; 

Fresh fruits, including apples, pears and kiwifruits are the primary raw materials for our products. The continuous supply of high quality fresh fruit is necessary for our current operations and our future business growth. 

&#160; 

The PRC has the largest planting area of kiwifruit and apples in the world. Shaanxi Province, the location of two of our factories, has the largest planting area of kiwifruit and apples in the PRC. According to &#8220;Statistical Bulletin of Development of Fruit Industry in Shaanxi Province 2010,&#8221; in 2010, the kiwifruit planting area in Shaanxi Province was over 114,226 acres. In 2015, the kiwifruit planting area in Shaanxi Province was about 164,737 acres, with an output of 12.3 million tons, which is 20% of the world output and 33% of China&#8217;s total output. Pomegranate, strawberry, peach and cherry yields are also high in Shaanxi Province. Liaoning Province in the PRC, the location of our Huludao Wonder and Yingkou factories, abounds with high acidity apples. Other raw materials used in our business include pectic enzyme, amylase, auxiliary power fuels and other power sources such as coal, electricity and water. 

&#160; 

We purchase raw materials from local markets and fruit growers that deliver directly to our plants. We have implemented a fruit purchasing program in areas surrounding our factories. In addition, we organize purchasing centers in rich fruit production areas, helping farmers deliver fruit to our purchasing agents easily and in a timely manner. We are then able to deliver the fruit directly to our factory for production. &#160; We have assisted local farmers in their development of kiwifruit fields to help ensure a high quality product throughout the production channel. Our raw material supply chain is highly fragmented and raw fruit prices are highly volatile. 

&#160; 

Shaanxi Province is a large agricultural and fruit producing province with sufficient resources to satisfy our raw material needs. Shaanxi Province is also the main pear-producing province in the PRC and its pear supply can generally meet our production requirements. Liaoning Province, the PRC&#8217;s center for high acidity apples, can generally supply enough apples to meet our Liaoning Province factory&#8217;s production needs. 

&#160; 

In addition to raw materials, we purchase various ingredients and packaging materials such as sweeteners, glass and plastic bottles, cans and packing barrels. We generally purchase our materials or supplies from multiple suppliers. We are not dependent on any one supplier or group of suppliers. 

&#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

We can only produce fruit juice concentrates during the squeezing season generally from July or August through April of the following year, while our fruit juice beverages can be produced year round. Annual capacity of our production lines varies based on the availability of the fresh fruit and is ultimately contingent on weather and other climatic conditions leading up to and through the harvest seasons. As a result, our business is highly seasonal as sales of our products are generally higher during the squeezing season. Sales of our products during the months from March through July, or the non-squeezing season, generally tend to be lower due to a shortage of fresh fruit and a lower level of production activity. As a result, our results of operations for the first and fourth quarters are generally stronger than those for our second and third quarters. We can produce fruit juice beverages year round. 

&#160; 

We plan to broaden our fruit product offerings to expand into fruits with harvesting seasons complementary to our current fruits. This will enable us to lengthen our squeezing season, thus increasing our annual production of fruit concentrate and fruit juice beverages. In the first quarter of 2009, we introduced mulberry and kiwifruit cider beverages in the Chinese market. We intend to diversify our product mix and increase our revenues. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation &#160; 

&#160; 

Our products are subject to central government regulation as well as provincial government regulation in Shaanxi and Liaoning Provinces. Business and product licenses must be obtained through application to the central, provincial and local governments. We have obtained our business licenses to operate domestically and export products under the laws and regulations of the PRC. We obtained business licenses to conduct businesses, including an operating license to sell packaged foods such as concentrated fruit and vegetable juices, fruit sugar, fruit pectin, frozen and freeze dried fruits and vegetables, dehydrated fruits and vegetables, fruit and vegetable juice drinks, fruit cider and organic food. Business, company and product registrations are certified on a regular basis and we must comply with the laws and regulations of the PRC, provincial and local governments and industry agencies. 

&#160; 

In accordance with PRC laws and regulations, we are required to comply with applicable hygiene and food safety standards in relation to our production processes. Failure to pass these inspections, or the loss of or failure to renew our licenses and permits, could require us to temporarily or permanently suspend some or all of our production activities, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business. 

&#160; 

Currently Chinese environment laws and regulations do not negatively impact our business and our cost to comply with such laws and regulations is immaterial. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We believe that these technologies are leading technologies in our industry. 

&#160; 

In addition, using our proprietary technologies, we have developed flow-through capacitor membrane, reverse osmosis concentration and composite biological enzymolysis technology to clarify and remove murkiness from fruit juice. We believe that such are leading technologies in our industry. 

&#160; 

We believe that our continued success and competitive status depend largely on our proprietary technology and ability to innovate. We have taken the required measures to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary technologies and processes. We rely on a combination of know-how, patent and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We will take the necessary action to seek remuneration if we believe our intellectual property rights have been infringed upon.
