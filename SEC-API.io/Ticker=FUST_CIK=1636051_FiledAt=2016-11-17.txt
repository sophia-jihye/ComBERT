 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Our Business 

&#160;

Fuse Enterprises Inc. is a digital marketing company. We generate our revenue by delivering complete marketing solutions to small and medium size businesses. Whether our client needs to develop a social media presence strategy, create a new website, or employ innovative online marketing techniques, we can provide services from across the digital marketing spectrum. 

&#160;

Fuse Enterprises Inc. is a development stage company as defined by section 915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Although the Company has recognized nominal amounts of revenue, it is still devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business. All losses accumulated since Inception (December 24, 2013) have been considered as part of the Company&#146;s development stage activities. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. 

&#160;

The amendments in this Update remove the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from U.S. GAAP. In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. 

&#160;

For public business entities, those amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Fuse Enterprises has elected to early adopt Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements. The adoption of this ASU allows the company to remove the inception to date information and all references to development stage.
