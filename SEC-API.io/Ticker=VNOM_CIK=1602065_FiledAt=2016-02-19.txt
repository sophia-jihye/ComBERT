 ITEMS 1 and 2. BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES 

Overview 

We are a Delaware limited partnership formed by Diamondback on February 27, 2014 to own, acquire and exploit oil and natural gas properties in North America. 

Our primary business objective is to provide an attractive return to our unitholders by focusing on business results, maximizing distributions through organic growth and pursuing accretive growth opportunities through acquisitions of mineral, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits and similar interests from Diamondback and from third parties. Our initial assets consisted of mineral interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin in West Texas, substantially all of which are leased to working interest owners who bear the costs of operation and development. Diamondback contributed these assets, which it acquired in September 2013 from a third party for cash, to us upon the closing of our IPO on June 23, 2014. 

Like Diamondback, we are currently focused primarily on oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin, which is one of the oldest and most prolific producing basins in North America. The Permian Basin, which consists of approximately 85,000 &#32;square miles centered around Midland, Texas, has been a significant source of oil production since the 1920s. The Permian Basin is known to have a number of zones of oil and natural gas bearing rock throughout. 

Our Properties 

As of December 31, 2015 , our assets consisted of mineral interests underlying 46,562 &#32;gross ( 17,060 &#32;net) acres in the Permian Basin. Diamondback is the operator of approximately 60% &#32;of this acreage. As of December 31, 2015 , there were 367 &#32;vertical wells and 107 &#32;horizontal wells producing on this acreage, and average net production was approximately 6,313 &#32;net BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, there were 24 &#32;horizontal wells in various stages of completion. For the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;and the period from inception to December 31, 2013 , royalty revenue generated from these mineral interests was $74.9 million , $77.8 million &#32;and $15.0 million , respectively. 

The estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves of our assets, as of December 31, 2015 , were 26,345 &#32;MBOE based on a reserve report prepared by Ryder Scott, our independent reserve engineers. Of these reserves, approximately 54% &#32;were classified as proved developed producing reserves. PUD reserves included in this estimate were from 75 &#32;gross horizontal well locations. As of December 31, 2015 , our proved reserves were approximately 70% &#32;oil, 15% &#32;natural gas liquids and 15% &#32;natural gas. 

Our mineral interests entitle us to receive an average 9.1% &#32;royalty interest on an acreage weighted basis on all production from our approximately 46,562 &#32;gross acres with no additional future capital or operating expense required. The actual royalty percentage varies by lease and ranges from less than 1% &#32;to 25% . The average royalty percentage on a production basis can therefore vary over time depending on the relative amount of production from the various leases. In the Spanish Trail area of Midland County, Texas where the majority of the drilling activity has been, our average royalty interest on an acreage weighted basis is 21.4% &#32;in 14,820 gross acres and Diamondback is the operator of 63% of this acreage. 

Based on Diamondback&#8217;s evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data with respect to the approximate 60% &#32;of our mineral interests for which it is the operator, Diamondback had identified approximately 210 &#32;potential economic horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons in the Spanish Trail area. We do not have potential (not involving proved reserves) drilling location information with respect to the portion of our properties not operated by Diamondback, although we believe that the portion of the Spanish Trail area in Midland County, Texas operated by others has very similar production characteristics to the portion operated by Diamondback. RSP Permian, Inc., or RSP Permian, is the operator of a majority of our properties in Spanish Trail that are not operated by Diamondback. Diamondback has advised us that it believes it has a good relationship with RSP Permian and that it shares, on occasion, drilling and production information with RSP Permian to encourage further development 

of our properties. Additionally, Diamondback has participated with RSP Permian in the drilling of 17 &#32;horizontal wells on shared acreage subject to our mineral interests. Of these 17 &#32;horizontal wells, 11 &#32;are producing and six &#32;are in various stages of completion. 

In addition to our mineral interests, we own a minor equity interest in an entity that owns mineral, overriding royalty, net profits, leasehold and other similar interests. The equity interest is so minor that we have no influence over partnership operating and financial policies and is accounted for under the cost method. 

Our Relationship with Diamondback 

Diamondback owns and controls our general partner and, as of December 31, 2015 , owned approximately 88% &#32;of our outstanding common units. We believe that the properties held by Diamondback include properties that have, or with additional development will have, production and reserves characteristics that could make them attractive for inclusion in our partnership. We believe Diamondback&#8217;s significant ownership in us will motivate it to offer additional mineral and other interests in oil and natural gas properties to us in the future, although Diamondback has no obligation to do so and may elect to dispose of mineral and other interests in such properties without offering us the opportunities to acquire them. 

We believe Diamondback views our partnership as part of its growth strategy and that Diamondback will be incentivized to pursue acquisitions jointly with us in the future. However, Diamondback will regularly evaluate acquisitions and may elect to acquire properties without offering us the opportunity to participate in such transactions. Moreover, Diamondback may not be successful in identifying potential acquisitions. Diamondback is free to act in a manner that is beneficial to its interests without regard to ours, which may include electing not to present us with acquisition or disposition opportunities. 

In addition, neither we nor our subsidiary nor our general partner has any employees. Diamondback provides management, operating and administrative services to us and our general partner. Please read &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the consolidated financial statements and related notes, each of which is included elsewhere in this report. 

Business Strategies 

Our primary business objective is to provide an attractive return to unitholders by focusing on business results, maximizing distributions through organic growth and pursuing accretive growth opportunities through acquisitions of mineral interests from Diamondback and from third parties. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies: 

&#8226; 

Capitalize on the development of the properties underlying our mineral interests . Our assets consist primarily of mineral interests in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We expect the production from our mineral interests to increase as Diamondback and our other operators drill and develop our acreage without cost to us. 

&#8226; 

Leverage our relationship with Diamondback to participate with it in acquisitions of mineral or other interests in producing properties from third parties and to increase the size and scope of our potential third-party acquisition targets . We intend to make opportunistic acquisitions of mineral interests that have substantial oil-weighted resource potential and organic growth potential. Diamondback was formed in part to acquire and develop oil and natural gas properties, some of which will likely meet our acquisition criteria. In addition, Diamondback&#8217;s executives have long histories of evaluating, pursuing and consummating oil and natural gas property acquisitions in North America. Through our relationships with Diamondback and its affiliates, we have access to their significant pool of management talent and industry relationships, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in pursuing potential third-party acquisition opportunities. We may have additional opportunities to work jointly with Diamondback to pursue certain acquisitions of mineral or other interests in oil and natural gas properties from third parties. For example, we and Diamondback may jointly pursue an acquisition where we would acquire mineral or other interests in properties and Diamondback would acquire the remaining working and revenue interests in such properties. We believe this arrangement may give us access to third-party acquisition opportunities that we would not otherwise be in a position to pursue. 

&#8226; 

Seek to acquire from Diamondback, from time to time, mineral or other interests in producing oil and natural gas properties that meet our acquisition criteria . Since our formation, we have acquired, and may have additional opportunities from time to time in the future to acquire, mineral or other interests in producing oil and natural gas properties directly from Diamondback. We believe Diamondback may be incentivized to sell properties to us, as doing so may enhance Diamondback&#8217;s economic returns by monetizing long-lived producing properties while potentially retaining a portion of the resulting cash flow through distributions on Diamondback&#8217;s limited partner interests in us. However, none of Diamondback or any of its affiliates is contractually obligated to offer or sell any interests in properties to us. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe that the following competitive strengths will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies and achieve our primary business objective: 

&#8226; 

Oil rich resource base in one of North America&#8217;s leading resource plays . All of the acreage underlying our mineral interests is located in one of the most prolific oil plays in North America, the Permian Basin in West Texas. The majority of our current properties are well positioned in the core of the Wolfberry play. Production on our properties for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was approximately 78% &#32;oil, 12% &#32;natural gas liquids and 9% &#32;natural gas. As of December 31, 2015 , our estimated net proved reserves were comprised of approximately 70% &#32;oil, 15% &#32;natural gas liquids and 15% &#32;natural gas. 

&#8226; 

Multi-year drilling inventory in one of North America&#8217;s leading oil resource plays. &#32;Diamondback, as the operator of approximately 60% &#32;of our properties, has advised us that it has identified a multi-year inventory of potential drilling locations for our oil-weighted reserves from the acreage underlying our mineral interests. At an assumed price of $40.00 per Bbl WTI, Diamondback had identified approximately 210 &#32;potential economic horizontal locations on the acreage Diamondback operates in its Spanish Trail area in Midland County, Texas, based on Diamondback&#8217;s evaluation of applicable geologic and engineering data. These locations have an average lateral length of approximately 7,700 feet, with the actual length depending on lease geometry and other considerations, and exist across most of the acreage and in multiple horizons. Of these potential economic locations, 100 &#32;are in the Wolfcamp B and Lower Spraberry horizons, with the remaining horizontal locations in the Wolfcamp A, Middle Spraberry, Clearfork and Cline horizons. Diamondback&#8217;s current potential horizontal location count is based on 660 -foot spacing between wells in the Wolfcamp B horizon, 500 -foot spacing in the Lower Spraberry horizon, 880-foot spacing in the Wolfcamp A and Middle Spraberry horizons, and 1,320 -foot spacing in the Clearfork and Cline horizons. The ultimate inter-well spacing may vary from these distances due to different factors, which would result in a higher or lower location count. Based on horizontal wells drilled to date, Ryder Scott assigned reserves to PUD locations ranging from 404 &#32;MBOE for 5,000-foot laterals in the Wolfcamp B to 1,319 &#32;MBOE for 10,000-foot laterals in the Lower Spraberry. When normalized to 7,500-foot laterals, Ryder Scott assigned average PUD values of 635 &#32;MBOE for the Wolfcamp B horizon, 990 &#32;MBOE for the Lower Spraberry horizon and 783 &#32;MBOE for the Wolfcamp A horizon. These PUD locations, as assigned by Ryder Scott, are for direct offsets to producing wells. Based on various geologic and engineering parameters, we believe that the estimates assigned to these PUD locations are reasonable estimates for PUD locations on the remaining portion of our acreage. Additionally, we believe that there is similar potential for horizontal development on the portion of our acreage for which Diamondback is not the operator. 

Oil and Natural Gas Data 

Proved Reserves 

Evaluation and Review of Reserves 

Our historical reserve estimates as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were prepared by Ryder Scott. A reserve audit is not the same as a financial audit and is less vigorous in nature than an independent reserve report where the independent reserve engineer determines the reserves on its own. 

Ryder Scott is an independent petroleum engineering firm. The technical persons responsible for preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications, independence, objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Ryder Scott is a third-party engineering firm and does not own an interest in any of our properties and is not employed by us on a contingent basis. 

Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible&#8211;from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations&#8211;prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. If deterministic methods are used, the SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a &#8220;high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.&#8221; All of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 &#32;were estimated using a deterministic method. The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the 

definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods, (2) volumetric-based methods and (3) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. The proved reserves for our properties were estimated by performance methods, analogy or a combination of both methods. Approximately 90% &#32;of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods. These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis, which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data. The remaining 10% &#32;of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy, or a combination of performance and analogy methods. The analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate. All proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method. 

To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, Ryder Scott considered many factors and assumptions, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and the SEC pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates. To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data, downhole completion information, geologic data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data. 

Our petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets in the Permian Basin. Our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve report to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process. We provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest, oil and gas production, well test data, commodity prices and operating and development costs. The Vice President&#8211;Reservoir Engineering of our general partner is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates. The Vice President&#8211;Reservoir Engineering of our general partner is a petroleum engineer with over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 24 years of industry experience per person. Our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest, oil and gas production, well test data, commodity prices and operating and development costs. 

The preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures. These procedures, which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations, include the following: 

&#8226; 

review and verification of historical production data, which data is based on actual production as reported by our operators; 

&#8226; 

preparation of reserve estimates by the Vice President&#8211;Reservoir Engineering of our general partner or under his direct supervision; 

&#8226; 

review by the Vice President&#8211;Reservoir Engineering of our general partner of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each quarter, including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves additions; 

&#8226; 

direct reporting responsibilities by the Vice President&#8211;Reservoir Engineering of our general partner to the Chief Executive Officer of our general partner; 

&#8226; 

verification of property ownership by our land department; and 

&#8226; 

no employee&#8217;s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves booked. 

The following table presents our estimated net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;based on the reserve reports prepared by Ryder Scott. Each reserve report has been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. All of our proved reserves included in the reserve reports are located in the continental United States.

Estimates of reserves as of December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a field-by-field basis on the first day of each month within the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, in accordance with SEC guidelines applicable to reserve estimates as of the end of such periods. Reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our proved developed reserves totaled 9,700 &#32;MBbls of oil, 13,739 &#32;MMcf of natural gas and 2,205 &#32;MBbls of natural gas liquids, for a total of 14,195 &#32;MBOE. Of the total proved developed reserves, 99% &#32;were producing and the remaining 1% &#32;was from a vertical well with behind&#8211;pipe reserves. Producing reserves were from 367 &#32;vertical wells and 107 &#32;horizontal wells, of which Diamondback was the operator of 222 &#32;vertical wells and 80 &#32;horizontal wells and RSP Permian was the operator of 99 &#32;vertical wells and 24 &#32;horizontal wells. The remaining 46 &#32;vertical wells and three &#32;horizontal wells were operated by various other companies. Of the total 474 &#32;producing wells, Diamondback had a working interest in 344 &#32;wells. 

The foregoing reserves are all located within the continental United States. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices and future production rates and costs. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; We have not filed any estimates of total, proved net oil or natural gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the SEC. 

Proved Undeveloped Reserves 

As of December 31, 2015 , our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 8,677 &#32;MBbls of oil, 10,569 &#32;MMcf of natural gas and 1,711 &#32;MBbls of natural gas liquids, for a total of 12,150 &#32;MBOE. PUDs will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production. Our undeveloped reserves were from 75 &#32;horizontal wells, of which Diamondback is the operator of 51 &#32;horizontal wells and RSP Permian is the operator of 22 &#32;horizontal wells, with the remaining two &#32;horizontal wells operated by others. Diamondback also had a non-operated working interest in eight &#32;of the horizontal wells that are operated by RSP Permian. 

Of the horizontal locations, 18 &#32;are Wolfcamp B wells, 44 &#32;are Lower Spraberry wells, three &#32;are Middle Spraberry wells and ten &#32;are Wolfcamp A wells. 

All of our PUD drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled within five years from the date they were initially recorded. As of December 31, 2015 , less than 1.0% &#32;of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed non-producing. 

Changes in PUDs that occurred during 2015 &#32;were primarily due to: 

&#8226; 

additions of 8,087 &#32;MBOE, primarily from 51 &#32;horizontal well locations, 15 &#32;in the Wolfcamp interval and 36 &#32;in Spraberry intervals, attributable to extensions resulting from strategic drilling of wells to delineate our acreage position; 

&#8226; 

downgrade of PUDs into probable category of 2,070 &#32;MBOE for 48 &#32;vertical wells that are not anticipated to be drilled under the five-year rule due to lower commodity prices and a shift in focus from vertical development to horizontal development and for nine &#32;short lateral horizontal wells that are not expected to be drilled due to the lower price environment; 

&#8226; 

the conversion of approximately 2,592 &#32;MBOE attributable to PUDs into proved developed reserves; and 

&#8226; 

positive revisions of approximately 368 &#32;MBOE in PUDs primarily due to increased lateral lengths on several wells.

Productive Wells 

As of December 31, 2015 , our operators owned a working interest in 474 &#32;productive wells located on the acreage in which we have a mineral interest. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. During 2015 , we received division orders or first payments for 181 &#32;new wells completed on our acreage. 

Acreage 

The following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2015 &#32;relating to the gross and net acreage of our mineral interests: 

Basin 

Gross Acreage 

&#160; 

Net Acreage 

Permian 

46,562 

&#160; 

17,060 

&#160; 

Our net interest in production from our mineral interests is based on lease royalty terms which vary from property to 

property. Our interest in the majority of these properties is perpetual in nature, however approximately 5% of the net royalty acreage consists of over-riding royalty interests which may be subject to expiration. Net royalty acres are defined as gross acreage multiplied by the average royalty interest. 

Competition 

The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional mineral, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits and similar interests in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for these and other oil and natural gas properties. Further, oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas. 

Seasonal Nature of Business 

Generally, demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for our operators in meeting well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations. 

Regulation 

The following disclosure describes regulation more directly associated with operators of oil and natural gas properties, including our current operators, and other owners of working interests in oil and natural gas properties. To the extent we elect in the future to engage in the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas properties, we would be directly subject to the same regulations described below. For purposes of this section, where applicable, references to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to Viper Energy Partners LP to the extent the partnership were to acquire working interests in the future as well as to any operators of our properties, including our current operators. 

Oil and natural gas operations are subject to various types of legislation, regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities. This legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business. 

Environmental Matters 

O il and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous federal, 

state and local governmental agencies, such as the EPA, issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas, and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from &#32;operations. Liability under such laws and regulations is strict (i.e., no showing of &#8220;fault&#8221; is required) and can be joint and several. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our &#32;business and prospects. 

Waste Handling 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although most wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, such wastes may constitute &#8220;solid wastes&#8221; that are subject to the less stringent requirements of non-hazardous waste provisions. Moreover, the EPA or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as &#8220;hazardous wastes.&#8221; Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. 

Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase the costs to manage and dispose of wastes. 

Remediation of Hazardous Substances 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, which we refer to as CERCLA or the &#8220;Superfund&#8221; law, and analogous state laws, generally imposes liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed &#8220;responsible parties&#8221; are subject to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state statutes. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; have been released. 

Water Discharges 

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the &#8220;Clean Water Act,&#8221; the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require 

appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. These laws and regulations also prohibit certain activity in wetlands unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. In addition, on April 7, 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule establishing federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater discharged from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works, or POTW, which regulations are discussed in more detail below under the caption &#8220;&#8211;Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.&#8221; Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. &#32; 

The Oil Pollution Act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability. The Oil Pollution Act contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. The Oil Pollution Act subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. &#32; 

Noncompliance with the Clean Water Act or the Oil Pollution Act may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations. &#32; 

Air Emissions 

The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. For example, on August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations, which regulations are discussed in more detail below in &#8220;&#8211;Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.&#8221; These laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities we own or operate, and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. &#32; Obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. &#32; 

Climate Change 

In December 2009, the EPA issued an Endangerment Finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings by the EPA allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Subsequently, the EPA adopted two sets of related rules, one of which purports to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of greenhouse gases from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial facilities. In response to its endangerment finding, the EPA adopted two sets of rules regarding possible future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The motor vehicle rule, which became effective in July 2010, purports to limit emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles. The EPA adopted the stationary source rule, which we refer to as the tailoring rule, in May 2010, and it became effective January 2011. The tailoring rule established new greenhouse gas emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the PSD and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA , the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their greenhouse gas emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for greenhouse gas emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On December 19, 2014, the EPA issued two memoranda providing initial guidance on greenhouse gas permitting requirements in response to the Court&#8217;s decision in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA . In its preliminary guidance, the EPA indicates it will undertake a rulemaking action to rescind any PSD permits issued under the portions of the tailoring rule that were vacated by the Court. In the interim, the EPA issued a narrowly crafted &#8220;no action assurance&#8221; indicating it will exercise its enforcement discretion not to pursue enforcement of the terms and conditions relating to greenhouse gases in an EPA-issued PSD permit, and for related terms and conditions in a Title V permit. On April 30, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule allowing permitting authorities to rescind PSD permits issued under the invalid regulations. &#32; 

Additionally, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the U.S., including natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas distribution companies, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA expanded the greenhouse gas reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which may include certain of our facilities, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In October 2015, the EPA amended the greenhouse gas reporting rule to add the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from gathering and boosting systems, completions and workovers of oil wells using hydraulic fracturing, and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines. &#32; 

The EPA has continued to adopt greenhouse gas regulations applicable to other industries, such as its August 2015 adoption of three separate, but related, actions to address carbon dioxide pollution from power plants, including final Carbon Pollution Standards for new, modified and reconstructed power plants, a final Clean Power Plan to cut carbon dioxide pollution from existing power plants, and a proposed federal plan to implement the Clean Power Plan emission guidelines. Upon publication of the Clean Power Plan on October 23, 2015, more than two dozen States as well as industry and labor groups challenged the Clean Power Plan in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. As a result of this continued regulatory focus, future greenhouse gas regulations of the oil and gas industry remain a possibility. In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not adopted such legislation at this time, it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. &#32;&#32; 

In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake &#8220;ambitious efforts&#8221; to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Agreement, if ratified, establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. &#32; 

Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business. &#32; 

In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or property damages. While our business is not a party to this litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. &#32; 

Moreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations. &#32; 

Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing 

Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, the EPA has recently taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the Underground Injection Control program, specifically as &#8220;Class II&#8221; Underground Injection Control wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Furthermore, legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of &#8220;underground injection&#8221; and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. &#32; 

In addition, on May 9, 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The EPA plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by December 2016, which would describe a proposed mechanism - regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both - to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. Also, on April 7, 2015, the EPA published a proposed rule establishing federal pre-treatment standards for wastewater discharged from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to POTW. The EPA asserts that wastewater from such facilities can be generated in large quantities and can contain constituents that may disrupt POTW operations and/or be discharged, untreated, from the POTW to receiving waters. If adopted, the new pre-treatment rule would require unconventional oil and gas facilities to pre-treat wastewater before transferring it to a POTW. The public comment period ended on July 17, 2015, and the EPA is expected to publish a final rule by August 2016. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities. &#32; 

On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA&#8217;s rule package includes New Source Performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in volatile organic compounds emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or &#8220;green completions&#8221; on all hydraulically-fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. &#32;The rules also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration. &#32; In response, the EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration. For example, in September 2013 and December 2014, the EPA amended its rules to extend compliance deadlines and to clarify the NSP standards. Further, on July 31, 2015, the EPA finalized two updates to the NSP standards to address the definition of low-pressure wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another (referred to as connected in parallel). In addition, on September 18, 2015, the EPA published a suite of proposed rules to reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions from oil and gas industry, including new &#8220;downstream&#8221; requirements covering equipment in the natural gas transmission segment of the industry that was not regulated by the 2012 rules. The public comment period closed on December 4, 2015. &#32;We cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty. 

Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The EPA is currently evaluating the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. In June 2015, the EPA released its draft assessment report for peer review and public comment, finding that, while there are certain mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities could potentially impact drinking water resources, there is no evidence available showing that those mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business. &#32; 

Several states, including Texas, &#32; have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances , impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. &#32; The Texas Legislature adopted new legislation, effective September 1, 2011, requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. &#32; The Texas Railroad Commission adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that apply to all wells for which the Texas Railroad Commission issues an initial drilling permit after February 1, 2012. The new law requires that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of OSHA for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the Texas Railroad Commission with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the Texas Railroad Commission. Also, in May 2013, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The new rules took effect in January 2014. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the Texas Railroad Commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, among other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches 

utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the Texas Railroad Commission&#8217;s authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The Texas Railroad Commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal wells. &#32; 

There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal &#32;or state level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal &#32;or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing. 

Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry 

The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases &#32;the cost of doing business, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production. 

The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC&#8217;s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas. &#32; 

Although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. &#32; 

Drilling and Production 

The operations of our operators are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The states, and some counties and municipalities, in which our operators conduct business also regulate one or more of the following: 

&#8226; 

the location of wells; &#32; 

&#8226; 

the method of drilling and casing wells; &#32; 

&#8226; 

the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures; &#32; 

&#8226; 

the rates of production or &#8220;allowables&#8221;; &#32; 

&#8226; 

the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; &#32; 

&#8226; 

the plugging and abandoning of wells; and &#32; 

&#8226; 

notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties. &#32; 

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas &#32;that our operators can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but we cannot assure &#32;our unitholders that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill. 

Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements. 

Natural Gas Sales and Transportation 

Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price &#32;and marketing of natural gas. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Since 1978, various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in &#8220;first sales .&#8221; Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties. 

FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that &#32;our operators produce, as well as the revenues our operators receive for sales of natural gas and release of natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC&#8217;s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities. 

Under FERC&#8217;s current regulatory regime, transmission services are provided on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis at cost-based rates or negotiated rates. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our &#32;operators&#8217; costs of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations. 

Oil Sales and Transportation 

Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 

Crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors. 

Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines&#8217; published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to &#32;our operators to the same extent as to our or their competitors. 

State Regulation 

Texas regulates the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure &#32;our unitholders that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations &#32;our operators can drill. 

The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.

We do not have any employees. We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner. All of the employees that conduct our business, including our executive officers, are employed by Diamondback. We and our general partner have entered into an advisory services agreement with Wexford Capital LP, or Wexford, pursuant to which Wexford provides general financial and strategic advisory services to us and our general partner. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Diamondback had 141 &#32;full-time employees. None of Diamondback&#8217;s employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements. Diamondback also hires independent contractors and consultants involved in land, technical, regulatory and other disciplines to assist its full time employees. Please read &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and the consolidated financial statements and related notes, each of which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 

Facilities 

Diamondback leases office space for our principal executive offices in Midland, Texas. We believe that these facilities are adequate for our current operations.
