 Item 1: Business 

Snap-on was incorporated under the laws of the state of Wisconsin in 1920 and reincorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in 1930.

Snap-on markets its products and brands through multiple sales distribution channels in more than 130 countries.

Snap-on reaches its customers through the company&#146;s franchisee, company-direct, distributor and internet channels. Snap-on originated the mobile tool distribution channel in the automotive repair market. 

The company began with the development of the original Snap-on interchangeable socket set in 1920 and subsequently pioneered mobile tool distribution in the automotive repair market, where fully stocked vans sell to professional vehicle technicians at their place of business. Snap-on now defines its value proposition more broadly, extending its reach &#147;beyond the garage&#148; to deliver a broad array of unique solutions that make work easier for serious professionals performing critical tasks. The company&#146;s &#147;coherent growth&#148; strategy focuses on developing and expanding its professional customer base in its legacy automotive market, as well as in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In addition to its coherent growth strategy, Snap-on is committed to its &#147;Value Creation Processes&#148; &#150; a set of strategic principles and processes designed to create value and employed in the areas of (i) safety; (ii) quality; (iii) customer connection; (iv) innovation; and (v) rapid continuous improvement (&#147;RCI&#148;). Snap-on&#146;s RCI initiatives employ a structured set of tools and processes across multiple businesses and geographies intended to eliminate waste and improve operations. Savings from Snap-on&#146;s RCI initiatives reflect benefits from a wide variety of ongoing efficiency, productivity and process improvements, including savings generated from product design cost reductions, improved manufacturing line set-up and change-over practices, lower-cost sourcing initiatives and facility consolidations. 

Snap-on&#146;s primary customer segments include: (i) commercial and industrial customers, including professionals in critical industries and emerging markets; (ii) professional vehicle repair technicians who purchase products through the company&#146;s worldwide mobile tool distribution network; and (iii) other professional customers related to vehicle repair, including owners and managers of independent and original equipment manufacturer (&#147;OEM&#148;) dealership service and repair shops (&#147;OEM dealerships&#148;). Snap-on&#146;s Financial Services customer segment includes: (i) franchisees&#146; customers and Snap-on&#146;s industrial and other customers who require financing for the purchase or lease of tools and diagnostics and equipment products on an extended-term payment plan; and (ii) franchisees who require financing for business loans and vehicle leases. 

Snap-on&#146;s business segments are based on the organization structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Snap-on&#146;s reportable business segments are: (i) the Commercial &#38; Industrial Group; (ii) the Snap-on Tools Group; (iii) the Repair Systems &#38; Information Group; and (iv) Financial Services. The Commercial &#38; Industrial Group consists of business operations serving a broad range of industrial and commercial customers worldwide, including customers in the aerospace, natural resources, government and technical education market segments (collectively, &#147;critical industries&#148;), primarily through direct and distributor channels. The Snap-on Tools Group consists of business operations primarily serving vehicle service and repair technicians through the company&#146;s worldwide mobile tool distribution channel. The Repair Systems &#38; Information Group consists of business operations serving other professional vehicle repair customers worldwide, primarily owners and managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealerships, through direct and distributor channels.

Snap-on evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenues, including both external and intersegment net sales, and segment operating earnings. Snap-on accounts for intersegment sales and transfers based primarily on standard costs with reasonable mark-ups established between the segments. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets used in the respective reportable segment&#146;s operations. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash equivalents (excluding cash held at Financial Services), deferred income taxes and certain other assets. All significant intersegment amounts are eliminated to arrive at Snap-on&#146;s consolidated financial results.

Financial Services 

Snap-on also generates revenue from various financing programs that include: (i) installment sales and lease contracts arising from franchisees&#146; customers and Snap-on&#146;s industrial and other customers for the purchase or lease of tools, including tool storage, and diagnostic and equipment products on an extended-term payment plan; and (ii) business loans and vehicle leases to franchisees. The decision to finance through Snap-on or another financing entity is solely at the customer&#146;s election. When assessing customers for potential financing, Snap-on considers various factors including financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience, credit bureau information and proprietary credit models. 

Snap-on offers financing through SOC and the company&#146;s international finance subsidiaries in those markets where Snap-on has franchise operations. Financing revenue from contract originations is recognized over the life of the contracts, with interest computed primarily on the average daily balances of the underlying contracts. 

Sales and Distribution 

Snap-on markets and distributes its products and related services principally to professional tool and equipment users around the world. The two largest market sectors are the vehicle service and repair sector and the industrial sector. 

Vehicle Service and Repair Sector 

The vehicle service and repair sector has three main customer groups: (i) professional technicians who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for themselves; (ii) other professional customers related to vehicle repair, including owners and managers of independent repair shops and OEM dealerships who purchase tools and diagnostic and equipment products for use by multiple technicians within a service or repair facility; and (iii) OEMs. 

Snap-on provides innovative tool, equipment and business solutions, as well as technical sales support and training, designed to meet technicians&#146; evolving needs. Snap-on&#146;s mobile tool distribution system offers technicians the convenience of purchasing quality tools at their place of business with minimal disruption of their work routine. Snap-on also provides owners and managers of repair shops, where technicians work, with tools, diagnostic equipment, and repair and service information, including electronic parts catalogs and shop management products. Snap-on&#146;s OEM facilitation business provides OEMs with products and services including tools, consulting and facilitation services, which include product procurement, distribution and administrative support to customers for their dealership equipment programs. 

The vehicle service and repair sector is characterized by an increasing rate of technological change within motor vehicles, vehicle population growth and increasing vehicle life, and the resulting effects of these changes on the businesses of both our suppliers and customers. Snap-on believes it is a meaningful participant in the vehicle service and repair market sector. 

Industrial Sector 

Snap-on markets its products and services globally to a broad cross-section of commercial and industrial customers, including maintenance and repair operations; manufacturing and assembly facilities; various government agencies, facilities and operations, including military operations; vocational and technical schools; aviation and aerospace operations; OEM and service and repair customers; oil and gas developers; mining operations; energy and power generation, equipment fabricators and operators; railroad manufacturing and maintenance; customers in agriculture; infrastructure construction companies; and other customers that require instrumentation, service tools and/or equipment for their product and business needs. 

The industrial sector for Snap-on focuses on providing value-added products and services to an increasingly expanding global base of customers in critical industries. Through its experienced and dispersed sales organization, industrial &#147;solutioneers&#148; develop unique and highly valued productivity solutions for customers worldwide that leverage Snap-on&#146;s product, service and development capabilities. 

The industrial sector is characterized by a highly competitive, cost-conscious environment, and a trend toward customers making many of their tool and equipment purchases through one integrated supplier. Snap-on believes it is a meaningful participant in the industrial tools and equipment market sector.

&#160; 

Distribution Channels 

Snap-on serves customers primarily through the following channels of distribution: (i) the mobile van channel; (ii) company direct sales; (iii) distributors; and (iv) e-commerce. The following discussion summarizes Snap-on&#146;s general approach for each channel, and is not intended to be all-inclusive. 

Mobile Van Channel 

In the United States, a significant portion of sales to the vehicle service and repair sector is conducted through Snap-on&#146;s mobile franchise van channel. Snap-on&#146;s franchisees primarily serve vehicle repair technicians and vehicle service shop owners, generally providing weekly contact at the customer&#146;s place of business. Franchisees&#146; sales are concentrated in hand and power tools, tool storage products, shop equipment, and diagnostic and repair information products, which can easily be transported in a van or trailer and demonstrated during a brief sales call. Franchisees purchase Snap-on&#146;s products at a discount from suggested list prices and resell them at prices established by the franchisee. U.S. franchisees are provided a list of calls that serves as the basis of the franchisee&#146;s sales route. Snap-on&#146;s franchisees also have the opportunity to add a limited number of additional franchises. 

Snap-on charges nominal initial and ongoing monthly franchise fees. Franchise fee revenue, including nominal, non-refundable initial and ongoing monthly fees (primarily for sales and business training, and marketing and product promotion programs), is recognized as the fees are earned. Franchise fee revenue totaled $12.7 million, $12.1 million and $11.9 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Snap-on also has a company-owned route program that is designed to: (i) provide another pool of potential field organization personnel; (ii) service customers in select new and/or open routes not currently serviced by franchisees; and (iii) allow Snap-on to pilot new sales and promotional ideas prior to introducing them to franchisees. As of 2015 year end, company-owned routes comprised approximately 3% of the total route population; Snap-on may elect to increase or reduce the number of company-owned routes in the future. 

In addition to its mobile van channel in the United States, Snap-on has replicated its U.S. franchise distribution model in certain other countries including the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, South Africa, New Zealand, Belgium and Ireland. In many of these markets, as in the United States, purchase decisions are generally made or influenced by professional vehicle service technicians as well as repair shop owners and managers. As of 2015 year end, Snap-on&#146;s worldwide route count was approximately 4,800, including approximately 3,500 routes in the United States. 

Through SOC, financing is available to U.S. franchisees, including financing for van leases, working capital loans and loans to help enable new franchisees to fund the purchase of the franchise. In many international markets, Snap-on offers a variety of financing options to its franchisees and/or customer networks through its international finance subsidiaries. The decision to finance through Snap-on or another financing entity is solely at the customer&#146;s election. 

Snap-on supports its franchisees with a field organization of regional offices, franchise performance teams, customer care centers and distribution centers. Snap-on also provides sales and business training, and marketing and product promotion programs, as well as customer and franchisee financing programs through SOC and the company&#146;s international finance subsidiaries, all of which are designed to strengthen franchisee sales. National Franchise Advisory Councils in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, composed primarily of franchisees that are elected by franchisees, assist Snap-on in identifying and implementing enhancements to the franchise program. 

Company Direct Sales 

A significant proportion of shop equipment sales in North America under the John Bean, Hofmann, Blackhawk, Challenger and Pro-Cut brands, diagnostic products under the Snap-on brand and information products under the Mitchell1 brand are made by direct and independent sales forces that have responsibility for national and other accounts. As the vehicle service and repair sector consolidates (with more business conducted by national chains and franchised service centers), Snap-on believes these larger organizations can be serviced most effectively by sales people who can demonstrate and sell the full line of diagnostic and equipment products and services. Snap-on also sells these products and services directly to OEMs and their franchised dealers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 2015 ANNUAL REPORT &#160; 9 &#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Snap-on brand tools and equipment are marketed to industrial and governmental customers in the United States through both industrial sales representatives, who are employees, and independent industrial distributors. Outside of the United States, industrial sales are also conducted through other independent distributors. Sales representatives focus on industrial customers whose main purchase criteria are quality and integrated solutions. As of 2015 year end, Snap-on had industrial sales representatives in the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Puerto Rico and various European, Asian, Latin American, Middle Eastern and African countries, with the United States representing the majority of Snap-on&#146;s total industrial sales. 

Snap-on also sells software, services and solutions to the automotive, commercial, heavy duty, agriculture, power equipment and power sports segments. Products and services are marketed to targeted groups, including OEMs and their dealerships, fleets and individual repair shops. To effectively reach OEMs, which frequently have a multi-national presence, Snap-on has deployed focused business teams globally. 

Distributors 

Sales of certain tools and equipment are made through independent distributors who purchase the items from Snap-on and resell them to end users. Hand tools sold under the BAHCO, Fish and Hook, Irimo, Lindstr&#246;m and Williams brands and trade names, for example, are sold through distributors in Europe, North and South America, Asia and certain other parts of the world. Wheel service and other vehicle service equipment are sold through distributors primarily under brands including Hofmann, John Bean, Challenger, Pro-Cut, Cartec, Blackhawk and Ecotechnics. Diagnostic and equipment products are marketed through distributors in South America and Asia, and through both a direct sales force and distributors in Europe under the Snap-on, Sun, BAHCO and Blue-Point brands. 

E-commerce 

Snap-on offers current and prospective customers online access to research and purchase products through its public website at www.snapon.com . The site features an online catalog of Snap-on hand tools, power tools, tool storage units and diagnostic equipment available to customers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. E-commerce and certain other system enhancement initiatives are designed to improve productivity and further leverage the one-on-one relationships and service Snap-on has with its current and prospective customers. Sales through the company&#146;s e-commerce distribution channel were not significant in any of the last three years. 

Competition 

Snap-on competes on the basis of its product quality and performance, product line breadth and depth, service, brand awareness and imagery, technological innovation and availability of financing (through SOC or its international finance subsidiaries). While Snap-on does not believe that any single company competes with it across all of its product lines and distribution channels, various companies compete in one or more product categories and/or distribution channels. 

Snap-on believes it is a leading manufacturer and distributor of professional tools, tool storage, diagnostic and equipment products, and repair software and solutions, offering a broad line of these products to both vehicle service and industrial marketplaces. Various competitors target and sell to professional technicians in the vehicle service and repair sector through the mobile tool distribution channel; Snap-on also competes with companies that sell tools and equipment to vehicle service and repair technicians online and through retail stores, vehicle parts supply outlets and tool supply warehouses/distributorships. Within the power tools category and the industrial sector, Snap-on has various other competitors, including companies with offerings that overlap with other areas discussed herein. Major competitors selling diagnostics, shop equipment and information to vehicle dealerships and independent repair shops include OEMs and their proprietary electronic parts catalogs and diagnostics and information systems, and other companies that offer products serving this sector. 

Raw Materials and Purchased Product 

Snap-on&#146;s supply of raw materials and purchased components are generally and readily available from numerous suppliers. Snap-on believes it has secured an ample supply of both bar and coil steel for the near future to ensure stable supply to meet material demands. The company does not currently anticipate experiencing any significant impact in 2016 from steel pricing or availability issues.

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 

Snap-on vigorously pursues and relies on patent protection to protect its intellectual property and position in its markets. As of 2015 year end, Snap-on and its subsidiaries held approximately 700 active and pending patents in the United States and approximately 1,550 active and pending patents outside of the United States. Sales relating to any single patent did not represent a material portion of Snap-on&#146;s revenues in any of the last three years. 

Examples of products that have features or designs that benefit from patent protection include wheel alignment systems, wheel balancers, tire changers, vehicle lifts, tool storage, tool control, test lanes, brake lathes, sealed ratchets, electronic torque instruments, ratcheting screwdrivers, emissions-sensing devices and diagnostic equipment. 

Much of the technology used in the manufacture of vehicle service tools and equipment is in the public domain. Snap-on relies primarily on trade secret protection to protect proprietary processes used in manufacturing. Methods and processes are patented when appropriate. Copyright protection is also utilized when appropriate. 

Trademarks used by Snap-on are of continuing importance to Snap-on in the marketplace. Trademarks have been registered in the United States and more than 120 other countries, and additional applications for trademark registrations are pending. Snap-on vigorously polices proper use of its trademarks. Snap-on&#146;s right to manufacture and sell certain products is dependent upon licenses from others; however, these products under license do not represent a material portion of Snap-on&#146;s net sales. 

Domain names have become a valuable corporate asset for companies around the world, including Snap-on. Domain names often contain a trademark or service mark or even a corporate name and are often considered intellectual property. The recognition and value of the Snap-on name, trademark and domain name are core strengths of the company. 

Snap-on strategically licenses the Snap-on brand to carefully selected manufacturing and distribution companies for items such as apparel, work boots, lighting and a variety of other goods, in order to further build equity and market presence for the company&#146;s strongest brand. 

Environmental 

Snap-on is subject to various environmental laws, ordinances, regulations, and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. At Snap-on, these environmental liabilities are managed through the Snap-on Environmental, Health and Safety Management System (&#147;EH &#38; SMS&#148;), which is applied worldwide. The system is based upon continual improvement and is certified to ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007, verified through Det Norske Veritas (DNV) Certification, Inc. 

Snap-on believes that it complies with applicable environmental control requirements in its operations. Expenditures on environmental matters through EH &#38; SMS have not had, and Snap-on does not for the foreseeable future expect them to have, a material effect upon Snap-on&#146;s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 

Employees 

Snap-on employed approximately 11,500 people at the end of January 2016; Snap-on employed approximately 11,400 people at the end of January 2015. 

Approximately 2,600 employees, or 23% of Snap-on&#146;s worldwide workforce, are represented by unions and/or covered under collective bargaining agreements. The number of covered union employees whose contracts expire over the next five years approximates 1,400 employees in 2016, 700 employees in 2017, and 500 employees in 2018; there are no contracts currently scheduled to expire in 2019 or 2020. In recent years, Snap-on has not experienced any significant work slowdowns, stoppages or other labor disruptions. 

There can be no assurance that these and other future contracts with Snap-on&#146;s unions will be renegotiated upon terms acceptable to Snap-on.

Working Capital 

Most of Snap-on&#146;s businesses are not seasonal and their inventory needs are relatively constant. Snap-on did not have a significant backlog of orders at 2015 year end. In recent years, Snap-on has been using its working capital to fund, in part, the continued growth of the company&#146;s financial services portfolio. 

Snap-on&#146;s liquidity and capital resources and use of working capital are discussed herein in &#147;Part II, Item 7, Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#148; 

As of 2015 year end, neither Snap-on nor any of its segments depend on any single customer, small group of customers or government for any material part of its revenues.
