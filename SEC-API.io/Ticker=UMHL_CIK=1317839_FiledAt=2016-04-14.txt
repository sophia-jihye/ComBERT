&#160;

Background of Umatrin Holding Limited 

&#160;

UMATRIN HOLDING LIMITED, formerly known as Golden Opportunities Corporation, was incorporated in the state of Delaware on February 2, 2005 ("UMHL", or the "Company"). The Company was originally incorporated in order to locate and negotiate with a targeted business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. 

&#160;

On March 27, 2015, a total of 19,555,000 shares were acquired by Umatrin Group Ltd ("UGL", a company incorporated in Seychelles, through its principal and director, Dato' Sri Eu Hin Chai ("Dato' Sri").

&#160;

Despite Michael's exit, Dato' Sri remains and is dedicated in delivering increased shareholder value. In order to moving forward with this vision, UMHL decided to acquire an operating company in Malaysia to which he is one of the main stockholders, known as U Matrin Worldwide SDN BHD, into UMHL.

Consequently, we will appoint them as our dealers if they wish to start-up their own business. Umatrin will provide market support to the dealers, such as advertisements, products introductory speeches and website to introduce the products to public. This strategy allows Umatrin's products to reach to each and every single person around the Asia Pacific as Umatrin's believe the best advertising will always be by way of word-of-mouth referrals. &#160;

&#160;

Most of our customers and dealers are from Asia. We have 20,000 dealers in Asia. From Umatrin's sales, we have seen a market trend that consumers are buying more anti-aging products from us. &#160; &#160;

Industry Trends- Anti-Aging Products Market 

&#160;

Based on global research, by 2015, the anti-aging industry will grow by 82% in Asia Pacific and 72% in Japan. The global wellness products industry is a $569 billion industry, and anti-aging is one of the fastest growing categories. The global cosmetics and toiletries industry is a $333 billion industry, and anti-aging is its largest growing segment. In fact, the anti-aging market is predicted to reach a trillion dollars by 2025. 

&#160;

Hence, Umatrin is moving towards developing our own brand and anti-aging products. Recently we have developed a 100% natural anti-aging skin care series products under the brand "AKERO SECRET". We have received lots of positive feedbacks on this new skin care series. GCI Magazine had reported that "In anti-aging and beauty trends, the desire for more natural ingredients is one of the fastest growing around the world. According to Kline &#38; Company, the natural personal care market is predicted to reach $6.7 billion in 2015 in the U.S. alone, and according to a recent anti-aging survey by Mintel, 76% of respondents who are concerned with aging report being interested in products with natural/organic ingredients". &#160;

In view of the above, Umatrin does not stop right here, but aims at developing and manufacturing more anti-aging products to benefit the public enlarged. In order to achieve this, additional capital funds are required for Umatrin to venture into manufacturing industry and expanding further research and development to develop more and more quality products. 

&#160;

To save time, Umatrin plans to go public and offers stock in an initial public offering by way of a reverse merger.

Competitive Analysis 

&#160;

Market Analysis 

&#160;

Asia is the Earth's largest and most populous continent. It comprises 30% of Earth's land area, and has historically been home to 60% of the planet's human population (roughly 4.4 billion people reside in Asia). Asian is notable for not only the overall large size, but unusually dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions. 

&#160;

Rising individual incomes and changing lifestyles drive the global beauty care products industry. Revenue in the industry is forecast to reach an estimated $265 billion in 2017 with a CAGR of 3.4% over the next five years (2012-2017), highly influenced by the increasing demand in Asia Pacific (APAC) and Europe due to increase in GDP and the improving living standard. 

&#160;

Lucintel, a leading global management consulting and market research firm, has analyzed the global beauty care industry and presents its findings in "Global Beauty Care Products Industry 2012-2017: Trend, Profit, and Forecast Analysis." The industry encompasses manufacturers' segment revenue related to beauty care products. As per the study, increased awareness has resulted in higher demand for luxury products, especially cosmetics. Providing quality products at a low cost is a challenge for manufacturers. Skincare, the largest segment, represents the growth in products during the forecast period. Increased demand for multi-feature products such as moisturizing cream with sun protection and anti-aging or anti-wrinkle properties are likely to drive market growth. 

&#160;

The cosmetics segment also has growth potential as demand is increasing for premium cosmetics in the expanding middle class in developing countries. Total sales in the beauty and personal care industry were roughly $426 billion in 2011, total global beauty sales for January &#8211; March 2012 were up 14% to $2,278,000,000. Total Skincare sales were $844 million, up 19%. The cosmetic industry worldwide seems to be continuously developing, now more than ever with the advent of the Internet companies. 

&#160;

Many famous companies sell their cosmetic products online also in countries where they do not have representatives. At present, cosmetics industry is focusing on launching organic cosmetic products because people are now becoming more and more conscious about the chemicals and the harmful effects in the cosmetics. Players are globally exploring the markets to tap the hidden growth potential. Regulatory bodies are also ensuring that consumers have full knowledge about the ingredients of products and hence focusing on labeling. &#160;

A new global anti-ageing report from Research and Markets, forecasts the global product market will grow at a CAGR of 6.7% over the period 2013-2018, with the rising global ageing population being the main driver. (www.cosmeticsdesign-europe.com)

&#160; &#160;

Competitors 

&#160;

The beauty and health industry is highly competitive and, at times, subject to rapidly changing consumer preferences and industry trends. Competition generally provides incentives to boost brand strength, assortment and continuity of merchandise selection, reliable order fulfillment and on-time delivery, and a higher level of brand support and customer support. We compete with a large number of multi-national manufacturers of beauty and health products, many of which have significantly greater resources than we do. Many of our competitors also have the ability to develop and market products similar to and competitive with our products. Specifically, we compete with the major skin care companies which market many brands including Avon, Chanel, Clarins, Clinique, Est&#233;e Lauder, L'Or&#233;al, Lanc&#244;me, Neutrogena and Shiseido, major health supplement companies which market many brands including USANA, CVS, Nature Made and Carlson Labs. Most, if not all of these competitors, have launched anti-aging skin care products. We also compete with several smaller prestige boutique and designer anti-aging products brands. 

&#160;

We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of product differentiation, sales and marketing strategy and distribution model. We focus on anti-aging industry by introducing quality natural products to be consumed or applied on skins to naturally reach the ultimate results. In addition, we are moving forward to develop our innovative product formulation and differentiated product concepts. We believe that our expertise within the anti-aging industry, brand authenticity and loyal consumer base, and multi-channel marketing and distribution expertise provide us with competitive advantages in the market for prestige anti-aging beauty and health products. 

&#160;

Principal Methods of Competition 

&#160;

A core element of our success is our distinctive Online to Offline (O2O) marketing strategy and multi-channel distribution model. We focus on educating consumers about the unique benefits of our products, developing intimate relationships with consumers, capitalizing on our multi-channel distribution strategy to effectively reach and engage those consumers and allowing our consumers to enjoy the benefit to be profitable by sharing the same to other consumers. We believe educational media such as products introductory demo and continuous products roadshows are effective at informing consumers about the innovative product formulation, application technique and resulting benefits of our products. We also believe that our company-owned boutiques enhance the authenticity of our brand and provide a personal environment in which we offer our broadest product assortment and provide one-on-one consumer consultations and product demonstrations. At the same time, our physical presence at the event hosted by our dealers have helped to further strengthen our brand image and provide additional points of contact to educate consumers about our products. Moreover, this model allows us to: 

&#160;

&#183; 

acquire new consumers and maintain premium brand positioning without large expenditures on print-based advertising and marketing common in our industry; 

&#183; 

provide consumers the ability to select the most convenient channel to purchase our products; 

&#183; 

develop intimate consumer relationships that foster brand loyalty and encourage repeat purchases; 

&#183; 

build a base of recurring revenues as a substantial percentage of our consumers participate in our product continuity programs through which products initially purchased are automatically replenished; and 

&#183; 

drive traffic across our sales channels. 

&#160; &#160; 12 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160;

We believe that our company benefits from strong consumer loyalty as well as the emotional connection formed between our consumers and our brand. In turn, we believe that our consumers are strong advocates for our brand and have displayed a desire and willingness to convert others to our brand. Strong consumer loyalty has resulted in the development of a community of consumers who share a passion for our products and our brand. This community has expressed itself through attendance at events we sponsor, as well as events initiated by individual consumers. In addition, these loyal consumers have established multiple online community independent of the Company's efforts. This loyal community of users provides invaluable feedback that we often incorporate into our product development. &#160;

As consumers continue to blend their off-line and on-line activities, from "showrooming" and retail apps to sofa shopping and click-and-collect, the lines between internet retailing, e-commerce and physical retailing are increasingly blurred. Big retailers are taking an "omni-channel" approach by merging their offline, on-line and mobile capabilities to create a seamless experience for shoppers. To elaborate, consumer behavior driving internet sales surge. E-commerce and m-commerce have changed the way that consumers', even those who still visit physical stores, approach on shopping. The main drivers of e-commerce include: the search for value and convenience; increased access to, and usage of, the internet; faster download speeds; improved delivery and online payment methods; and the shift towards mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Hence, we will be co-operating with our partners to allow our consumer to purchase our products by just a click at their mobile devices apps. &#160;

We use third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain substantially all raw materials, components and packaging products and to manufacture finished some of products relating to our Umatrin and AKERO SECRET brands products. We utilize approximately 20 different product and packaging suppliers from which we source and contract manufacture our products. Suppliers purchase all necessary raw materials, including the natural ingredients used to manufacture our products. 

&#160; &#160;

With respect to our other third-party manufacturers, we make purchases through purchase orders. We believe that we have good relationships with our manufacturers and that there are alternative sources in the event that one or more of these manufacturers is not available. We continually review our manufacturing needs against the capacity of our contract manufacturers to ensure that we are able to meet our production goals, reduce costs, and operate more efficiently.
