Products and Services 

Manufacturing 

North American Railcar Manufacturing &#160; - &#160; We manufacture a broad array of railcar types in North America, which includes most railcar types other than coal cars. We have demonstrated an ability to capture high market shares in many of the car types we produce. The primary products we produce for the North American market are: 

Intermodal Railcars &#160; &#150; &#160; We manufacture a comprehensive range of intermodal railcars. Our most important intermodal product is our articulated double-stack railcar. The double-stack railcar is designed to transport containers stacked two-high on a single platform and provides significant operating and capital savings over other types of intermodal railcars. 

Tank Cars &#160; &#150; &#160; We produce a variety of tank cars, including both general and certain pressurized tank cars, which are designed for the transportation of products such as crude oil, ethanol, liquefied petroleum gas, caustic soda, urea ammonium nitrate, vegetable oils, bio-diesel and various other products and we continue to expand our product lines. 

Automotive &#160; &#150; We manufacture a full line of railcar equipment specifically designed for the transportation of automotive products. Our automotive offerings include our proprietary Auto-Max railcar, Multi-Max auto rack and flat cars for automotive transportation. 

&#160; 

4 &#160; The Greenbrier Companies 2016 Annual Report &#160; Conventional Railcars &#160; - We produce a wide range of boxcars, which are used in the transport of forest products, perishables, general merchandise and commodities. We also produce a variety of covered hopper cars for the grain, fertilizer, sand, cement and petrochemical industries as well as gondolas for the steel, metals and aggregate markets and various other conventional railcar types. Our flat car products include center partition cars for the forest products industry, bulkhead flat cars and solid waste service flat cars. 

European Railcar Manufacturing &#160; - &#160; Our European manufacturing operation produces a variety of tank, automotive and conventional freight railcar (wagon) types, including a comprehensive line of pressurized tank cars for liquid petroleum gas and ammonia and non-pressurized tank cars for light oil, chemicals and other products. In addition, we produce flat cars, coil cars for the steel and metals market, coal cars, gondolas, sliding wall cars and automobile transporter cars for both the continental European and United Kingdom markets. In 2016, we began production of tank cars to support industrial mining operations for the Saudi Arabian market for delivery beginning in 2017. 

Marine Vessel Fabrication &#160; -&#160; Our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility, located on a deep-water port on the Willamette River, includes marine vessel fabrication capabilities. The marine facilities also increase utilization of steel plate burning and fabrication capacity providing flexibility for railcar production. United States (U.S.) coastwise law, commonly referred to as the Jones Act, requires all commercial vessels transporting merchandise between ports in the U.S. to be built, owned, operated and manned by U.S. citizens and to be registered under the U.S. flag. We manufacture a broad range of Jones Act ocean-going and river barges for transporting merchandise between ports within the U.S. including conventional deck barges, double-hull tank barges, railcar/deck barges, barges for aggregates and other heavy industrial products and dump barges. Our primary focus is on the larger ocean-going vessels although the facility has the capability to compete in other marine-related products. 

Wheels &#38; Parts 

Wheel Services and Component Parts Manufacturing &#160; -&#160; We operate a large wheel services and component parts network in North America. Our wheel shops, operating in ten locations, provide complete wheel services including reconditioning of wheels and axles in addition to new axle machining and finishing and axle downsizing. Our component parts facilities, operating in four locations, recondition and manufacture railcar cushioning units, couplers, yokes, side frames, bolsters and various other parts. We also produce roofs, doors and associated parts for boxcars. 

GBW Joint Venture 

Railcar Repair, Refurbishment, Maintenance and Retrofitting &#160; - &#160; GBW Railcar Services LLC (GBW), an unconsolidated 50/50 joint venture, became our fourth reportable segment (GBW Joint Venture) upon formation in July 2014. The results of GBW are included as part of Earnings (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates as we account for our interest in GBW under the equity method of accounting. GBW operates the largest independent railcar repair shop network in North America consisting of over 30 Repair shops including more than 10 tank car repair shops certified by the Association of American Railroads (AAR). This network of Repair shops performs heavy railcar repair and refurbishment, as well as routine railcar maintenance for third parties, as well as for our leased and managed fleet. 

Leasing &#38; Services 

Leasing - Our relationships with financial institutions, combined with our ownership of a lease fleet of approximately 8,900 railcars (6,600 railcars held as equipment on operating leases, 2,200 held as leased railcars for syndication and 100 held as finished goods inventory), enables us to offer flexible financing programs including operating leases and &#147;by the mile&#148; leases to our customers. In addition, we frequently originate leases of railcars, which are either newly built or refurbished by us, or buy railcars from the secondary market, and sell the railcars and attached leases to financial institutions and subsequently provide such institutions with management services under multi-year agreements. As an equipment owner and an originator of leases, we participate principally in the operating lease segment of the market. The majority of our leases are &#147;full service&#148; leases whereby we are responsible for maintenance and administration. Maintenance of the fleet is provided, in 

&#160; 

&#160; The Greenbrier Companies 2016 Annual Report &#160; &#160; 5 &#160; part, through GBW. Assets from our owned lease fleet are periodically sold to take advantage of market conditions, manage risk and maintain liquidity. 

Management Services - Our management services business offers a broad array of software and services that include railcar maintenance management, railcar accounting services (such as billing and revenue collection, car hire receivable and payable administration), total fleet management (including railcar tracking using proprietary software), administration and railcar remarketing. We currently own or provide management services for a fleet of approximately 273,000 railcars for railroads, shippers, carriers, institutional investors and other leasing and transportation companies in North America. In 2017, we formed our Regulatory Services Group which offers regulatory, engineering, process consulting and advocacy support to the tank car and petrochemical rail shipper community, among other services.

&#160; (1) &#160; Each platform of a railcar is treated as a separate unit. 

(2) The percentage of owned units on lease excluding newly manufactured railcars not yet on lease and a recent railcar portfolio acquisition was 91.0% at August 31, 2016 with an average remaining lease term of 2.5 years. The average age of owned units is 13 years. 

Backlog 

Subsequent to August 31, 2016, we reached agreements to restructure certain railcar contracts for favorable financial and other considerations resulting in a reduction of approximately 1,200 units. The adjustment is reflected as of August 31, 2016. The following table depicts our reported third party railcar backlog in number of railcars and estimated future revenue value attributable to such backlog, at the dates shown: 

&#160;

&#160; $ 3,190 &#160; &#160; $ 4,710 &#160; &#160; $ 3,330 &#160; (1) &#160; Each platform of a railcar is treated as a separate unit. 

(2) &#160; Subject to change based on finalization of product mix. 

Our total manufacturing backlog of railcar units as of August 31, 2016 included 23,500 units for direct sales, 3,700 units intended for syndications to third parties with a lease attached and 300 units intended to be placed into our owned lease fleet. 

Based on current production schedules, approximately 12,000 units in the August 31, 2016 backlog are scheduled for delivery in 2017. The balance of the production is scheduled for delivery in 2018 and beyond. Multi-year supply agreements are a part of rail industry practice. A portion of the orders included in backlog reflects an assumed product mix. Under terms of the orders, the exact mix will be determined in the future, which may impact the dollar amount of backlog. Marine backlog as of August 31, 2016 was $114 million compared to $52 million as of August 31, 2015. 

Our backlog of railcar units and marine vessels is not necessarily indicative of future results of operations. Certain orders in backlog are subject to customary documentation and completion of terms. Customer orders 

&#160; 

6 &#160; The Greenbrier Companies 2016 Annual Report &#160; contain terms and conditions customary in the industry. Customers may attempt to cancel or modify orders in backlog. Historically, little variation has been experienced between the quantity ordered and the quantity actually delivered, though the timing of deliveries has been modified from time to time. Backlog as of August 31, 2016 includes an aggregate of 3,800 covered hopper railcars for use in energy related sand transportation; customers may seek to cancel, settle or modify a portion of these railcars. We cannot guarantee that our reported railcar backlog will convert to revenue in any particular period, if at all. 

Customers 

Our customers include railroads, leasing companies, financial institutions, shippers, carriers and transportation companies. We have strong, long-term relationships with many of our customers. We believe that our customers&#146; preference for high quality products, our technological leadership in developing innovative products and competitive pricing of our railcars have helped us maintain our long-standing relationships with our customers. 

In 2016, revenue from two customers, TTX Company (TTX) and CIT Group Inc. (CIT), accounted for approximately 31% of total revenue, 38% of Manufacturing revenue and 14% of Wheels &#38; Parts revenue. No other customers accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue. 

Raw Materials and Components 

Our products require a supply of materials including steel and specialty components such as brakes, wheels and axles. Specialty components purchased from third parties represent a significant amount of the cost of most freight cars. Our customers often specify particular components and suppliers of such components. Although the number of alternative suppliers of certain specialty components has declined in recent years, there are at least two suppliers for these components. 

Certain materials and components are periodically in short supply which could potentially impact production at our new railcar and refurbishment facilities. In an effort to mitigate shortages and reduce supply chain costs, we have entered into strategic alliances and multi-year arrangements for the global sourcing of certain materials and components, we operate a replacement parts business and we continue to pursue strategic opportunities to protect and enhance our supply chain. We periodically make advance purchases to avoid possible shortages of material due to capacity limitations of component suppliers, shipping and transportation delays and possible price increases. 

In 2016, the top ten suppliers for all inventory purchases accounted for approximately 46% of total purchases. Amsted Rail Company, Inc. accounted for 21% of total inventory purchases in 2016. No other suppliers accounted for more than 10% of total inventory purchases. The Company believes it maintains good relationships with its suppliers. 

Competition 

There are currently six major railcar manufacturers competing in North America. In addition, a number of small manufacturers have recently entered the market. We believe that in Europe we are in the top tier of railcar manufacturers. European freight car manufacturers are largely located in central and eastern Europe where labor rates are lower and work rules are more flexible. In all railcar markets, we compete on the basis of quality, price, reliability of delivery, product design and innovation, reputation and customer service and support. 

Competition in the marine industry is dependent on the type of product produced. There are two principal competitors that build product types similar to ours. We compete on the basis of experienced labor, launch ways capacity, quality, price and reliability of delivery. 

Competition in the wheels &#38; parts and repair businesses is dependent on the type of product or service provided. There are many competitors in the railcar repair and refurbishment business and an increasing number of competitors in the wheel services and other parts businesses. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, timeliness of delivery, customer service, location of shops, price and engineering expertise. 

&#160; 

&#160; The Greenbrier Companies 2016 Annual Report &#160; &#160; 7 &#160; There are at least twenty institutions that provide railcar leasing and services similar to ours. Many of them are also customers that buy new railcars from our manufacturing facilities and used railcars from our lease fleet, as well as utilize our management services. Many of these institutions have greater resources than we do on our own balance sheet. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, price, delivery, reputation, service offerings and deal structuring and syndication ability. We believe our strong servicing capability and our ability to sell railcars with a lease attached (syndicate railcars), integrated with our manufacturing, repair shops, railcar specialization and expertise in particular lease structures provide a strong competitive position. 

Marketing and Product Development 

In North America, we use an integrated marketing and sales effort to coordinate relationships in our various segments. We provide our customers with a diverse range of equipment and financing alternatives designed to satisfy each customer&#146;s unique needs, whether the customer is buying new equipment, refurbishing existing equipment or seeking to outsource the maintenance or management of equipment. These custom programs may involve a combination of railcar products, leasing, refurbishing and remarketing services. In addition, we provide customized maintenance management, equipment management, accounting and compliance services and proprietary software solutions. 

Outside of North America, we maintain relationships with customers through country-specific sales personnel. Our engineering and technical staff works closely with their customer counterparts on the design and certification of railcars. Many European railroads are state-owned and are subject to European Union (EU) regulations covering the tender of government contracts. 

Through our customer relationships, insights are derived into the potential need for new products and services. Marketing and engineering personnel collaborate to evaluate opportunities and develop new products and features. For example, we continue to expand our tank car and covered hopper product offerings in North America. Research and development costs incurred during the years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $2.7 million, $2.5 million and $3.6 million. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We have a number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents of varying duration, and pending patent applications, registered trademarks, copyrights and trade names that are important to our products and product development efforts. The protection of our intellectual property is important to our business and we have a proactive program aimed at protecting our intellectual property and the results from our research and development. 

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to national, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, air emissions, wastewater discharge, solid and hazardous waste disposal and employee health and safety. Prior to acquiring facilities, we usually conduct investigations to evaluate the environmental condition of subject properties and may negotiate contractual terms for allocation of environmental exposure arising from prior uses. We operate our facilities in a manner designed to maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Environmental studies have been conducted on certain of our owned and leased properties that indicate additional investigation and some remediation on certain properties may be necessary. 

Our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility is located adjacent to the Willamette River. We have entered into a Voluntary Clean-up Agreement with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) in which we agreed to conduct an investigation of whether, and to what extent, past or present operations at the Portland property may have released hazardous substances to the environment. We are also conducting groundwater remediation relating to a historical spill on the property that preceded our ownership. 

Portland Harbor Site 

In December 2000, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified portions of the Willamette River bed known as the Portland Harbor, including the portion fronting our manufacturing facility, as a federal 

&#160; 

8 &#160; The Greenbrier Companies 2016 Annual Report &#160; &#147;National Priority List&#148; or &#147;Superfund&#148; site due to sediment contamination (the Portland Harbor Site). We and more than 140 other parties have received a &#147;General Notice&#148; of potential liability from the EPA relating to the Portland Harbor Site. The letter advised us that we may be liable for the costs of investigation and remediation (which liability may be joint and several with other potentially responsible parties) as well as for natural resource damages resulting from releases of hazardous substances to the site. At this time, ten private and public entities, including us (the Lower Willamette Group or LWG), have signed an Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) of the Portland Harbor Site under EPA oversight, and several additional entities have not signed such consent, but are nevertheless contributing money to the effort. The EPA-mandated RI/FS is being produced by the LWG and has cost over $110 million during a 15-year period. We have agreed to initially bear a percentage of the total costs incurred by the LWG in connection with the investigation. Our aggregate expenditure has not been material during the 15-year period. Some or all of any such outlay may be recoverable from other responsible parties. 

Eighty-three parties, including the State of Oregon and the federal government, have entered into a non-judicial mediation process to try to allocate costs associated with the Portland Harbor site. Approximately 110 additional parties have signed tolling agreements related to such allocations. On April 23, 2009, we and the other AOC signatories filed suit against 69 other parties due to a possible limitations period for some such claims; Arkema Inc. et al v. A &#38; C Foundry Products, Inc. et al , U.S. District Court, District of Oregon, Case #3:09-cv-453-PK. All but 12 of these parties elected to sign tolling agreements and be dismissed without prejudice, and the case has now been stayed by the court, pending the EPA&#146;s Record of Decision, currently scheduled by the EPA for December 31, 2016. 

On June 8, 2016, the EPA issued its Feasibility Study (FS) and Proposed Plan for the Portland Harbor Site. The EPA accepted comments from the public on its Proposed Plan through September 6, 2016. The EPA&#146;s FS includes remediation alternatives that would take from 4 to 62 years of active remediation, with an estimated undiscounted cost ranging from $642 million to $10.2 billion and a net present value assuming a 7% discount rate ranging between $451 million and $9.4 billion. The Proposed Plan identifies the alternative currently favored by the EPA, which it assigns an estimated undiscounted cost of between $1.1 and $1.2 billion and a net present value of between $746 and $811 million. The EPA expects its cost estimates to be accurate within a range of +50 to -30 percent. EPA estimates that the remedy in the Proposed Plan would take 7 years of active remediation followed by 30 years of monitoring. The EPA&#146;s FS and its Proposed Plan identify 13 Sediment Decision Units. One of the units, RM9W, includes the nearshore area of the river sediments offshore of our Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility as well as upstream and downstream of the facility. It also includes a portion of our riverbank. Neither the FS nor the Proposed Plan breaks down total remediation costs by unit. 

Neither the EPA&#146;s FS nor its Proposed Plan addresses responsibility for the costs of clean-up, allocates such costs among the potentially responsible parties, or defines precise boundaries for the cleanup. Responsibility for funding and implementing the EPA&#146;s selected cleanup option will be determined after the issuance of the Record of Decision, currently scheduled by the EPA for December 31, 2016. Based on the investigation to date, we believe that we did not contribute in any material way to contamination in the river sediments or the damage of natural resources in the Portland Harbor Site and that the damage in the area of the Portland Harbor Site adjacent to our property precedes its ownership of the Portland, Oregon manufacturing facility. Because these environmental investigations are still underway, sufficient information is currently not available to determine our liability, if any, for the cost of any required remediation or restoration of the Portland Harbor Site or to estimate a range of potential loss. Based on the results of the pending investigations and future assessments of natural resource damages, we may be required to incur costs associated with additional phases of investigation or remedial action, and may be liable for damages to natural resources. In addition, we may be required to perform periodic maintenance dredging in order to continue to launch vessels from its launch ways in Portland, Oregon, on the Willamette River, and the river&#146;s classification as a Superfund site could result in some limitations on future dredging and launch activities. Any of these matters could adversely affect our business and Consolidated Financial Statements, or the value of our Portland property. 

We have also signed an Order on Consent with the DEQ to finalize the investigation of potential onsite sources of contamination that may have a release pathway to the Willamette River. Interim precautionary measures are also required in the order and we are currently discussing with the DEQ potential remedial actions which may be 

&#160; 

&#160; The Greenbrier Companies 2016 Annual Report &#160; &#160; 9 &#160; required. Our aggregate expenditure has not been material, however we could incur significant expenses for remediation. Some or all of any such outlay may be recoverable from other responsible parties. 

Regulation 

The Federal Railroad Administration in the U.S. and Transport Canada in Canada administer and enforce laws and regulations relating to railroad safety. These regulations govern equipment and safety appliance standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce. The AAR promulgates a wide variety of rules and regulations governing the safety and design of equipment, relationships among railroads and other railcar owners with respect to railcars in interchange, and other matters. The AAR also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on North American railroads. These regulations require us to maintain our certifications with the AAR as a railcar builder, repair and service provider and component manufacturer, and products sold and leased by us in North America must meet AAR, Transport Canada, and Federal Railroad Administration standards. 

The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the ocean-going barge industry are the U.S. Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping. 

The regulatory environment in Europe consists of a combination of EU regulations and country specific regulations, including a harmonized set of Technical Standards for Interoperability of freight wagons throughout the EU. 

Tank Car Regulation 

On May 1, 2015 the U.S. Department of Transportation&#146;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) released new regulations related to new railcar manufacturing and retrofitting modification standards for tank cars in flammable liquids service (the PHMSA Rules). In December 2015, the U.S. Congress passed the Fixing America&#146;s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), which changed certain requirements of the PHMSA Rules. Under the PHMSA Rules as amended by the FAST Act, the deadlines for modifying or removing existing tank cars from flammables service currently range from January 2018 to May 2029, depending on the type of car and the type of commodity carried. Transport Canada, separately and concurrent with PHMSA, issued final rules on May 1, 2015, establishing new design standards for tank cars carrying flammable liquids in Canada. On July 25, 2016, Transport Canada announced that certain older tank cars, commonly referred to as &#147;DOT 111&#148; tank cars, must be removed from crude oil service effective October 31, 2016. 

These regulatory changes, along with prevailing market conditions, could materially affect new tank railcar manufacturing and retrofitting activities industry-wide, and activities related to ownership and management of tank cars, including negative impacts to customer demand for products and services offered by Greenbrier and its related entities. 

Employees 

As of August 31, 2016, we had 9,418 full-time employees, consisting of 8,635 employees in Manufacturing, 545 in Wheels &#38; Parts and 238 employees in Leasing &#38; Services and corporate. In Manufacturing, 5,092 employees, all of whom are located in Mexico and Poland, are represented by unions. At our Wheels &#38; Parts locations, 19 employees are represented by a union. We believe that our relations with our employees are generally good.
