 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

BofI Holding, Inc., is the holding company for BofI Federal Bank, a diversified financial services company with over $7.6 billion &#32;in assets that provides consumer and business banking products through its branchless, low-cost distribution channels and affinity partners. The Bank has deposit and loan customers nationwide including consumer and business checking, savings and time deposit accounts and financing for single family and multifamily residential properties, small-to-medium size businesses in target sectors, and selected specialty finance receivables. The Bank generates fee income from consumer and business products including fees from loans originated for sale and transaction fees earned from processing payment activity. BofI Holding, Inc.&#8217;s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is a component of the Russell 2000&#174; Index, the S&#38;P SmallCap 600&#174; Index and the KBW Nasdaq Financial Technology Index. 

At June 30, 2016 , we had total assets of $7,601.4 million , loans of $6,409.1 million , mortgage-backed and other investment securities of $472.2 million , total deposits of $6,044.1 million &#32;and borrowings of $820.1 million . Because we do not incur the significantly higher fixed operating costs inherent in a branch-based distribution system, we are able to rapidly grow our deposits and assets by providing a better value to our customers and by expanding our low-cost distribution channels. 

We distribute our deposit products through a wide range of retail distribution channels, and our deposits consist of demand, savings and time deposits accounts. We distribute our loan products through our retail, correspondent and wholesale channels, and the loans we retain are primarily first mortgages secured by single family real property and by multifamily real property as well as commercial &#38; industrial loans to businesses. Our mortgage-backed securities consist primarily of mortgage pass-through securities issued by government-sponsored entities and non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-through mortgage-backed securities issued by private sponsors. We believe our flexibility to adjust our asset generation channels has been a competitive advantage allowing us to avoid markets and products where credit fundamentals are poor or risks and rewards are not sufficient to support our required return on equity. 

Our retail distribution channels for our deposit and lending products include: 

&#8226; 

Multiple national online banking brands with tailored products targeted to specific consumer segments; 

&#8226; 

Affinity groups where we gain access to the affinity group&#8217;s members, and our exclusive relationships with financial advisory firms; 

&#8226; 

&#32;A business banking division focused on providing deposit products and loans to specific nationwide industry verticals (e.g., Homeowners Associations) and small and medium size businesses; 

&#8226; 

A commission-based lending sales force that operates from home offices focusing primarily on the origination of single family and multifamily mortgage loans; 

&#8226; 

A commission-based lending sales force that operates from the corporate office focusing on commercial and industrial loans to businesses; 

&#8226; 

A commission-based leasing sales force that operates from our Utah office focusing on commercial and industrial leases to businesses; and 

&#8226; 

Inside sales teams that originate loans and deposits from self-generated internet leads, third-party purchase leads, and from our retention and cross-sell of our existing customer base. 

Our business strategy is to grow our loan and lease originations and our deposits to achieve increased economies of scale and reduce the cost of products and services to our customers by leveraging our distribution channels and technology. We have designed our branchless banking platform and our workflow processes to handle traditional banking functions with elimination of duplicate and unnecessary paperwork and human intervention. Our charter allows us to operate in all 50 states, and our online presence allows us increased flexibility to target a large number of loan and deposit customers based on demographics, geography and price. Our low-cost distribution channels provide opportunities to increase our core deposits and increase our loan originations by attracting new customers and developing new and innovative products and services. 

Our current business plan includes the following principal objectives: 

&#8226; 

Maintain an annualized return on average common stockholders&#8217; equity of 15.0% or better; 

&#8226; 

Annually increase average interest-earning assets by 15% or more; and 

&#8226; 

Maintain annualized efficiency ratio to a level 35% or lower. 

ASSET ORIGINATION AND FEE INCOME BUSINESSES 

&#160; We have built diverse loan origination and fee income businesses that generate attractive financial returns through our branchless distribution channels. We believe the diversity of our businesses and our branchless distribution channels provide us with increased flexibility to manage through changing market and operating environments. 

Single Family Mortgage Secured Lending 

We generate earning assets and fee income from our mortgage lending activities, which consist of originating and servicing mortgages secured primarily by first liens on single family residential properties for consumers and for lender-finance businesses. We divide our single family mortgage originations between loans we retain and loans we sell. Our mortgage banking business generates fee income and gains from sales of those consumer single family mortgage loans we sell. Our loan portfolio generates interest income and fees from loans we retain. We also provide home equity loans for consumers secured by second liens on single family mortgages. Our lender-finance loans are secured by our first lien on single family mortgages and include warehouse lines for third-party mortgage companies. 

We originate fixed and adjustable rate prime residential mortgage loans using a paperless loan origination system and centralized underwriting and closing process. We warehouse our mortgage banking loans and sell to investors prime conforming and jumbo residential mortgage loans. Our mortgage servicing business includes collecting loan payments, applying principal and interest payments to the loan balance, managing escrow funds for the payment of mortgage-related expenses, such as taxes and insurance, responding to customer inquiries, counseling delinquent mortgagors and supervising foreclosures. 

We originate single family mortgage loans for consumers through multiple channels on a retail, wholesale and correspondent basis. 

&#8226; 

Retail. &#32;We originate single family mortgage loans directly through i) our multiple national online banking brand websites, where our customers can view interest rates and loan terms, enter their loan applications and lock in interest rates directly over the internet, ii) our relationships with large affinity groups and iii) our call center which uses self-generated internet leads, third-party purchased leads, and cross-selling to existing customer base. 

&#8226; 

Wholesale. &#32;We have developed relationships with independent mortgage companies, cooperatives and individual loan brokers and we manage these relationships and our wholesale loan pipeline through our originations systems and websites. Through our secure website, our approved brokers can compare programs, terms and pricing on a real time basis and communicate with our staff. 

&#8226; 

Correspondent. &#32;We acquire closed loans from third-party mortgage companies that originate single family loans in accordance with our portfolio specifications or the specifications of our investors. We may purchase pools of seasoned, single-family loans originated by others during economic cycles when those loans have more attractive risk-adjusted returns than those we may originate. 

We originate lender-finance loans to businesses secured by first liens on single family mortgage loans from cross selling, retail direct and through third-parties . &#32;Our warehouse customers are primarily generated through cross selling to our network of third-party mortgage companies approved to wholesale our consumer mortgage loans. Other lender-finance customers are generated by our commissions-based sales force dedicated to commercial &#38; industrial lending who contact businesses directly or through individual loan brokers. 

Multifamily Mortgage Secured Lending 

We originate adjustable rate multifamily residential mortgage loans and project-based multifamily real estate secured loans with interest rates that adjust based on U.S. Treasury security yields and LIBOR. Many of our loans have initial fixed rate periods (three, five or seven years) before starting a regular adjustment period (annually, semi-annually or monthly) as well as prepayment protection clauses, interest rate floors, ceilings and rate change caps. 

We divide our multifamily residential mortgage originations between the loans we retain and the loans we sell. Our mortgage banking business generates gains from those multifamily mortgage loans we sell. Our loan portfolio generates interest income and fees from the loans we retain. 

We originate multifamily mortgage loans using a commission-based commercial lending sales force that operates from home offices across the United States or from our headquarters location. Customers are targeted through origination techniques such as direct mail marketing, personal sales efforts, email marketing, online marketing and print advertising. Loan applications are submitted electronically to centralized employee teams who underwrite, process and close loans. The sales force team members operate regionally both as retail originators for apartment owners and wholesale representatives to other mortgage brokers. 

Commercial Real Estate Secured and Commercial Lending 

Our commercial real estate secured lending consists of mortgages secured by first liens on commercial real estate. Historically, we have limited our exposure to commercial real estate and have primarily purchased seasoned mortgages on small commercial properties when they were offered as a part of a residential mortgage loan pool. In fiscal 2015, we began to originate adjustable rate small balance commercial real estate loans with interest rates that adjust based on U.S. Treasury security yields and LIBOR. Many of our loans have initial fixed rate periods (three, five or seven years) before starting a regular adjustment period (annually, semi-annually or monthly) as well as prepayment protection clauses, interest rate floors, ceilings and rate change caps. 

Our commercial and industrial lending (&#8220;C&#38;I&#8221;) is based upon business cash flow and asset-backed financing. We began our C&#38;I lending in 2010 with a focus on fixed and floating rate financing of businesses engaged in the origination of niche mortgage products secured by residential or commercial real estate. Our senior commercial lending group has expanded our corporate finance lending to include other select business types, including leverage lending for selected industries, project-based real estate secured lending and other asset-backed financing. 

&#160; Our C&#38;I division also provides leases that are used to purchase equipment essential to the operations of our borrower or lessee and are secured by the specific equipment financed. The primary source of repayment is the operating income of the borrower or lessee. The loan and lease terms are two to ten years and amortize primarily to a full repayment or, in some cases, to a residual balance or investment that is expected to be collected through a sale of the equipment to the lessee or a third party. 

Specialty Finance Factoring &#32; 

Our specialty finance division engages in the wholesale and retail purchase of state lottery prize and structured settlement annuity payments. These payments are high credit quality deferred payment receivables having a state lottery commission or primarily highly rated insurance company payor. Purchases of state lottery prize or structured settlement annuity payments are governed by specific state statutes requiring judicial approval of each transaction. No transaction is funded before an order approving such transaction has been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Our commission-based sales force originates contracts for the retail purchase of such payments from leads generated by our dedicated research department through the use of proprietary research techniques. The Specialty Finance Division also utilizes direct mail and online marketing to generate leads. Since 2013, pools of structured settlement receivables have been originated for sale depending upon management&#8217;s assessment of interest rate risk, liquidity, and offers containing favorable terms. 

Prepaid Cards and Refund Transfer 

Our prepaid cards division provides card issuing and bank identification number (&#8220;BIN&#8221;) sponsorship services to companies who have developed payroll, general purpose reloadable, incentive and gift card programs serving consumers. BIN Sponsorship includes issuing debit and prepaid cards from BINs licensed to the Bank by the various payment networks, managing risk for all programs, overseeing compliance with network and government regulations, and functioning as liaison between program managers and the payment networks. These programs generate recurring fee income and low cost deposits. 

We are also responsible for the primary oversight and control of a refund transfer program under an agreement with Emerald Financial Services, LLC (&#8220;EFS&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of H&#38;R Block, Inc. (&#8220;H&#38;R Block&#8221;). Under this program, the Bank opens a temporary bank account for each H&#38;R Block customer who is receiving an income tax refund and elects to defer payment of his or her tax preparations fees. After the Internal Revenue Service and any state income tax authorities transfer the refund into the customer&#8217;s account, the net funds are transferred to the customer and the temporary deposit account is closed. We earn a fixed fee paid by H&#38;R Block for each of the H&#38;R Block customers electing a refund transfer. 

Auto and RV and Other Consumer Lending &#32; 

Our consumer lending consists of prime loans to purchase new and used automobiles and recreational vehicles (&#8220;RV&#8221;) , and deposit-related overdraft lines of credit. In 2015 and 2016 we added extra systems and personnel to increase our auto lending portfolio. In 2008, we elected to significantly decrease RV loans. We hold all of the auto and RV loans that we originated and perform the loan servicing functions for these loans. 

Additionally, under agreements with EFS and H&#38;R Block, our Bank uses our underwriting guidelines and credit policies to offer and fund unsecured lines of credit to consumers primarily through the H&#38;R Block tax preparation offices and earns interest income and fee income, which is included in gain on sale - other in our consolidated statements of income. Our Bank retains 10% of these lines of credit and sells the remainder to H&#38;R Block. 

Our Bank also provides overdraft lines of credit for our qualifying deposit customers with checking accounts. 

Portfolio Management 

Our investment analysis capabilities are a core competency of our organization. We decide whether to hold originated assets for investment or to sell them in the capital markets based on our assessment of the yield and risk characteristics of these assets as compared to other available opportunities to deploy our capital. Because risk-adjusted returns available on acquisitions may exceed returns available through retaining assets from our origination channels, we have elected to purchase loans and securities (see discussion below) from time to time. Some of our loans and security acquisitions were purchased at discounts to par value, which enhance our effective yield through accretion into income in subsequent periods.

1 &#32;Consists of mortgage loans secured by real property in California with ZIP Code ranges from 90000 to 92999. 

2 &#32;Consists of mortgage loans secured by real property in California with ZIP Code ranges from 93000 to 96999. 

The ratio of the loan amount to the value of the property securing the loan is called the loan-to-value ratio (&#8220;LTV&#8221;). The following table shows the LTVs of our loan portfolio on weighted-average and median bases at June 30, 2016 . The LTVs were calculated by dividing (a) the loan principal balance less principal repayments by (b) the appraisal value of the property securing the loan.

1 &#32;Amounts represent combined LTV calculated by adding the current balances of both the first and second liens of the borrower and dividing that sum by an independent estimated value of the property at the time of origination. 

We believe our effective weighted-average LTV of 59.08% &#32;for loans originated during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 , has resulted and will continue to result in relatively low average loan defaults and favorable write-off experience. 

Loan Underwriting Process and Criteria . &#32;We individually underwrite the loans that we originate and all loans that we purchase. Our loan underwriting policies and procedures are written and adopted by our board of directors and our credit committee. Credit extensions generated by the Bank conform to the intent and technical requirements of our lending policies and the applicable lending regulations of our federal regulators. 

In the underwriting process we consider all relevant factors including the borrower&#8217;s credit score, credit history, documented income, existing and new debt obligations, the value of the collateral, and other internal and external factors. For all multifamily and commercial loans, we rely primarily on the cash flow from the underlying property as the expected source of repayment, but we also endeavor to obtain personal guarantees from all material owners or partners of the borrower. In evaluating a multifamily or commercial credit, we consider all relevant factors including the outside financial assets of the material owners or partners, payment history at the Bank or other financial institutions, and the management / ownership experience with similar properties or businesses. In evaluating the borrower&#8217;s qualifications, we consider primarily the borrower&#8217;s other financial resources, experience in owning or managing similar properties and payment history with us or other financial institutions. In evaluating the underlying property, we consider primarily the recurring net operating income of the property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of net operating income to debt service and the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value. 

Lending Limits . &#32;As a savings association, we are generally subject to the same lending limit rules applicable to national banks. With limited exceptions, the maximum amount that we may lend to any borrower, including related entities of the borrower, at any one time may not exceed 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus, plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral. See &#8220;Regulation of BofI Federal Bank&#8221; for further information. At June 30, 2016 , the Bank&#8217;s loans-to-one-borrower limit was $105.1 million , based upon the 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus measurement. At June 30, 2016 , our largest loan and single lending relationship was $53.2 million . 

Loan Quality and Credit Risk . &#32;Historically, our level of non-performing mortgage loans as a percentage of our loan portfolio has been relatively low compared to the overall residential lending market. The economy and the mortgage and consumer credit markets have stabilized. Additionally, we have recently increased our efforts to make loans to businesses through lending programs that are not as seasoned as our mortgage lending. Therefore, we anticipate that our rate of non-performing loans may increase in the future, and we have provided an allowance for estimated loan losses. 

Non-performing assets are defined as non-performing loans and real estate acquired by foreclosure or deed-in-lieu thereof. Generally, non-performing loans are defined as nonaccrual loans and loans 90 days &#32;or more overdue. Troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;) are defined as loans that we have agreed to modify by accepting below market terms either by granting interest rate concessions or by deferring principal or interest payments due to financial difficulty of the customer. Our policy with respect to non-performing assets is to place such assets on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the probability of collection of interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, previously accrued but unpaid interest will be deducted from interest income. Our general policy is to not accrue interest on loans past due 90 days &#32;or more, unless the individual borrower circumstances dictate otherwise. 

See Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8212; &#8220;Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan Loss&#8221; for a history of non-performing assets and allowance for loan loss. 

Investment Securities Portfolio. We classify each investment security according to our intent to hold the security to maturity, trade the security at fair value or make the security available-for-sale. We invest available funds in government and high-grade non-agency securities. Our investment policy, as established by our Board of Directors, is designed to maintain liquidity and generate a favorable return on investment without incurring undue interest rate risk, credit risk or portfolio asset concentration risk. Under our investment policy, we are currently authorized to invest in agency mortgage-backed obligations issued or fully guaranteed by the United States government, non-agency mortgage-backed obligations, specific federal agency obligations, municipal obligations, specific time deposits, negotiable certificates of deposit issued by commercial banks and other insured financial institutions, investment grade corporate debt securities and other specified investments. We also buy and sell securities to facilitate liquidity and to help manage our interest rate risk.

1 &#32;Weighted-average yield is based on amortized cost of the securities. Residential mortgage-backed security yields and maturities include impact of expected prepayments and other timing factors such as interest rate forward curve. Yields presented in this table are adjusted for OTTI, which is non-accretable. 

2 &#32; U.S. government-backed or government-sponsored enterprises including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. 

3 &#32; Private sponsors of securities collateralized primarily by pools of 1-4 family residential first mortgages. Primarily super senior securities and secured by prime, Alt-A or pay-option ARM mortgages. 

4 &#32; Collateralized debt obligations secured by pools of bank trust preferred securities. 

Our securities portfolio of $472.2 &#32;million at June 30, 2016 &#32;is composed of approximately 14.6% U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;) and other debt securities issued by the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (each, a &#8220;GSE&#8221; and, together, the &#8220;GSEs&#8221;), primarily Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae; 0.6% Prime private-issue super senior, first-lien RMBS; 3.1% Alt-A, private-issue super senior, first-lien RMBS; 24.6% Pay-Option ARM, private-issue super senior first-lien RMBS; 15.0% Municipal securities and 42.1% other residential mortgage-backed, asset-backed and bank pooled trust preferred securities. We had no commercial mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;CMBS&#8221;) or sub-prime RMBS at June 30, 2016 . 

We manage the credit risk of our non-agency RMBS by purchasing those securities which we believe have the most favorable blend of historic credit performance and remaining credit enhancements including subordination, over collateralization, excess spread and purchase discounts. Substantially all of our non-agency RMBS are super senior tranches protected against realized loss by subordinated tranches. The amount of structural subordination available to protect each of our securities (expressed as a percentage of the current face value) is known as credit enhancement. At June 30, 2016 , the weighted-average credit enhancement in our entire non-agency RMBS portfolio was 20.0%. The credit enhancement percentage and the ratings agency grade (e.g. &#8220;AA&#8221;) do not consider additional credit protection available to the Bank, if needed, from its purchase discount. All of the Bank&#8217;s non-agency RMBS purchases were at a discount to par and we do not solely rely upon nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (&#8220;NRSRO&#8221;) ratings when determining classification. This change in Bank policy was brought about by changes in regulatory stance regarding classification of securities as mandated by Congress under section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act, which required any reference to, or reliance on, NRSROs to be removed when determining the creditworthiness of securities. We have experienced personnel monitor the performance and measure the security for impairment in accordance with regulatory guidance. As of June 30, 2016 , 10.4% of our non-agency RMBS securities have been downgraded from investment grade at acquisition to below investment grade.

Our deposit operations are conducted through a centralized, scalable operating platform which supports all of our distribution channels. The integrated nature of our systems and our ability to efficiently scale our operations create competitive advantages that support our value proposition to customers. Additionally, the features described above such as online account opening and online bill-pay promote self-service and further reduce our operating expenses. 

We believe our deposit franchise will continue to provide lower all-in funding costs (interest expense plus operating costs) with greater scalability than branch-intensive banking models because the traditional branch model with high fixed operating costs will experience continued declines in consumer traffic due to the decline in paper check deposits and due to growing consumer preferences to bank online. 

The number of deposit accounts at the end of each of the last five fiscal years is set forth below:

Borrowings . &#32;In addition to deposits, we have historically funded our asset growth through advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;). Our bank can borrow up to 40% &#32;of its total assets from the FHLB, and borrowings are collateralized by mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities pledged to the FHLB. At June 30, 2016 , the Company had $727.0 million &#32;advances outstanding with another $1.3 billion &#32;available immediately and an additional $13.0 million &#32;available with additional collateral for advances from the FHLB for terms up to ten years. 

The Bank has federal funds lines of credit with two major banks totaling $35.0 million . At June 30, 2016 , the Bank had no outstanding balance on either line. 

The Bank can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (&#8220;FRB&#8221;), and borrowings are collateralized by consumer loans and mortgage-backed securities pledged to the FRB. Based on loans and securities pledged at June 30, 2016 , we had a total borrowing capacity of approximately $42.2 million , none of which was outstanding. The Bank has additional unencumbered collateral that could be pledged to the FRB Discount Window to increase borrowing liquidity. 

The Company has sold securities under various agreements to repurchase for total proceeds of $35.0 million . The repurchase agreements have fixed interest rates between 3.75% &#32;and 4.75% &#32;and scheduled maturities between April 2017 &#32;and December 2017 . Pursuant to these agreements, under certain conditions, the Company may be required to repay the $35.0 million &#32;and repurchase its securities before the scheduled maturity if the issuer requests repayment on scheduled quarterly call dates. As of June 30, 2016 , the weighted-average remaining contractual maturity period was 1.11 &#32;years and the weighted average remaining period before such repurchase agreements could be called was 0.14 &#32;years. 

On December 16, 2004, we completed a transaction in which we formed a trust and issued $5.2 million of trust-preferred securities. The net proceeds from the offering were used to purchase approximately $5.2 million of junior subordinated debentures of our company with a stated maturity date of February 23, 2035. The debentures are the sole assets of the trust. The trust preferred securities are mandatorily redeemable upon maturity, or upon earlier redemption as provided in the indenture. We have the right to redeem the debentures in whole (but not in part) on or after specific dates, at a redemption price specified in the indenture plus any accrued but unpaid interest through the redemption date. Interest accrues at the rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.4%, for a rate of 3.05% &#32;as of June 30, 2016 , and is paid quarterly. 

The table below sets forth the amount of our borrowings, the maximum amount of borrowings in each category during any month-end during each reported period, the approximate average amounts outstanding during each reported period and the approximate weighted average interest rate thereon at or for the last five fiscal years:

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS 

&#160; 

From time to time we undertake acquisitions or similar transactions consistent with the Bank&#8217;s operating and growth strategies. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were transactions that are discussed further in Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading &#8220; Mergers and Acquisitions .&#8221; 

TECHNOLOGY 

Our technology is built on a collection of enterprise and client platforms that have been purchased, developed in-house or integrated with software systems to provide products and services to our customers. The implementation of our technology has been conducted using industry best-practices and using standardized approaches in system design, software development, testing and delivery. At the core of our infrastructure, we have designed and implemented secure and scalable hardware solutions to ensure we meet the needs of our business. Our customer experiences were designed to address the needs of an internet-only bank and its customers. Our websites and technology platforms drive our customer-focused and self-service engagement model, reducing the need for human interaction while increasing our overall operating efficiencies. Our focus on internal technology platforms enable continuous automation and secure and scalable processing environments for increased transaction capacity. We intend to continue to improve and adapt technology platforms to meet business objectives and implement new systems with the goal of efficiently enabling our business. 

SECURITY 

BofI Federal Bank recognizes that information is a critical asset. How information is managed, controlled and protected has a significant impact on the delivery of services. Information assets, including those held in trust, must be protected from unauthorized use, disclosure, theft, loss, destruction and alteration. 

BofI Federal Bank employs an information security program to achieve its security objectives. The program is designed to identify, measure, manage and control the risks to system and data availability, integrity, and confidentiality, and to ensure accountability for system actions. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS 

We register our various Internet URL addresses with service companies, and work actively with bank regulators to identify potential naming conflicts with competing financial institutions. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary information is difficult and litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. We own certain Internet domain names. Domain names in the United States and in foreign countries are regulated, and the laws and regulations governing the Internet are continually evolving. Additionally, the relationship between regulations governing domain names and laws protecting intellectual property rights is not entirely clear. As a result, in the future, we may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our trademark and other intellectual property rights. 

EMPLOYEES 

At June 30, 2016 , we had 647 &#32;full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 

COMPETITION 

The market for banking and financial services is intensely competitive, and we expect competition to continue to intensify in the future. The Bank attracts deposits through its branchless acquisition channels. Competition for those deposits comes from a wide variety of other banks, savings institutions, and credit unions. The Bank competes for these deposits by offering superior service and a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates. 

In real estate lending, we compete against traditional real estate lenders, including large and small savings banks, commercial banks, mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and are capable of providing strong price and customer service competition. In order to compete profitably, we may need to reduce the rates we offer on loans and investments and increase the rates we offer on deposits, which may adversely affect our overall financial condition and earnings. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. 

REGULATION 

GENERAL 

BofI Holding, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;). The Company is required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of, the Federal Reserve. The Bank, as a federal savings bank, is subject to regulation, examination and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) as its primary regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) as its deposit insurer. The Bank must file reports with the OCC and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;), enacted on July 21, 2010, the Office of Thrift Supervision (&#8220;OTS&#8221;) was abolished as of July 21, 2011 (the &#8220;Transfer Date&#8221;), and its rights and duties transferred to the Federal Reserve as to savings and loan holding companies, and to the OCC as to savings banks. Therefore, as of the Transfer Date the Company became subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve rather than the OTS, and the Bank became subject to regulation by the OCC rather than the OTS. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve, to begin operations on the Transfer Date. The CFPB has broad authority to issue regulations implementing numerous consumer laws, to which we are subject. 

The regulation of savings and loan holding companies and savings associations is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and not for the benefit of our stockholders. The following information describes aspects of the material laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank. The information below does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to all applicable laws and regulations. In addition, new and amended legislation, rules and regulations governing the Company and the Bank are introduced from time to time by the U.S. government and its various agencies. Any such legislation, regulatory changes or amendments could adversely affect the Company or the Bank, and no assurance can be given as to whether, or in what form, any such changes may occur. 

REGULATION OF BOFI HOLDING, INC. 

General . BofI Holding, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owner&#8217;s Loan Act (&#8220;HOLA&#8221;). Accordingly, the Company is registered with the Federal Reserve and is subject to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over the Company and its subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. 

&#32;As noted above, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve assumed responsibility for the primary supervision and regulation of all savings and loan holding companies, including the Company, on July 21, 2011. Rules published by the Federal Reserve in 2011 provide for the transfer from the OTS to the Federal Reserve of the regulations necessary for the Federal Reserve to administer the statutes governing savings and loan holding companies, and implemented Regulation LL, which includes comprehensive new regulations governing the activities and operations of savings and loan holding companies and acquisitions of savings associations. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s regulations supersede OTS regulations for purposes of Federal Reserve supervision and regulation of savings and loan holding companies. 

&#160; 

Capital . &#32;&#32;Savings and loan holding companies, such as the Company, were historically not subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. However, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, savings and loan holding companies are now subject to the same capital and activity requirements as those applicable to bank holding companies. Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act required that the Federal Reserve promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are not less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. 

In July 2013, the Company&#8217;s primary federal regulator, the Federal Reserve, and the Bank&#8217;s primary federal regulator, the OCC, published final rules (the &#8220;New Capital Rules&#8221;) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee&#8217;s December 2010 capital framework known as &#8220;Basel III&#8221; for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The New Capital Rules substantially revise the capital requirements applicable to depository institutions and their holding companies, including the Company and the Bank, and are discussed in more detail below under &#8220;Regulation of BofI Federal Bank &#8211; Regulatory Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Source of Strength . The Dodd-Frank Act extends the Federal Reserve &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. Such policy requires holding companies to act as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of an institution&#8217;s financial distress. The regulatory agencies have yet to issue joint regulations implementing this policy. 

&#160; 

Change in Control . The federal banking laws require that appropriate regulatory approvals must be obtained before an individual or company may take actions to &#8220;control&#8221; a bank or savings association. The definition of control found in the HOLA is similar to that found in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;) for bank holding companies. Both statutes apply a similar three-prong test for determining when a company controls a bank or savings association. Specifically, a company has control over either a bank or savings association if the company: 

&#8226; 

directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls, or has the power to vote 25% or more of the voting securities of a company; 

&#8226; 

controls in any manner the election of a majority of the directors (or any individual who performs similar functions in respect of any company, including a trustee under a trust) of the board; or 

&#8226; 

directly or indirectly exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank. 

Regulation LL includes a specific definition of &#8220;control&#8221; similar to the statutory definition, with certain additional provisions. Additionally, Regulation LL modifies the regulations previously used by the OTS for purposes of determining when a company or natural person acquires control of a savings association or savings and loan holding company under the HOLA or the Change in Bank Control Act (&#8220;CBCA&#8221;). In light of the similarity between the statutes governing bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to use its established rules and processes with respect to control determinations under HOLA and the CBCA to ensure consistency between equivalent statutes administered by the same agency. Overall, the indication of control used by the Federal Reserve under the BHCA to determine whether a company has a controlling influence over the management or policies of a banking organization (which for Federal Reserve purposes, will now include savings associations and savings and loan holding companies) are similar to the control factors found in the former OTS regulations. However, the OTS rules weighed these factors somewhat differently and used a different review process designed to be more mechanical. 

Furthermore, the Federal Reserve may not approve any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions; (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions. 

REGULATION OF BOFI FEDERAL BANK 

General . As a federally-chartered savings and loan association whose deposit accounts are insured by FDIC, BofI Federal Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the FDIC and, as of the Transfer Date, the OCC. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the examination, regulation and supervision of savings associations, such as BofI Federal Bank, were transferred from the OTS to the OCC, the federal regulator of national banks under the National Bank Act. The following discussion summarizes some of the principal areas of regulation applicable to the Bank and its operations. 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts . The FDIC administers a deposit insurance fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;) that insures depositors in certain types of accounts up to a prescribed amount for the loss of any such depositor&#8217;s respective deposits due to the failure of an FDIC member depository institution. As the administrator of the DIF, the FDIC assesses its member depository institutions and determines the appropriate DIF premiums to be paid by each such institution. The FDIC is authorized to examine its member institutions and to require that they file periodic reports of their condition and operations. The FDIC may also prohibit any member institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the DIF. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings associations, after giving the primary federal regulator, now the OCC, the opportunity to take such action. The FDIC may terminate an institution&#8217;s access to the DIF if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of our access to the DIF. 

BofI Federal Bank is a member depository institution of the FDIC and its deposits are insured by the DIF up to the applicable limits, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U. S. Government. Effective with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Act, the basic deposit insurance limit was permanently raised to $250,000, instead of the $100,000 limit previously in effect. 

Beginning in late 2008, the economic environment caused higher levels of bank failures, which dramatically increased FDIC resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the DIF. As a result, the FDIC has significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by member institutions for access to the DIF. The base assessment rate was increased by seven basis points (seven cents for every $100 of deposits) for the first quarter of 2009. Effective April 1, 2009, initial base assessment rates were changed to range from 12 basis points to 45 basis points across all risk categories with possible adjustments to these rates based on certain debt-related components. These increases in the base assessment rate have increased our deposit insurance costs and negatively impacted our earnings. In addition, in May 2009, the FDIC imposed a special assessment on all member institutions due to recent bank and savings association failures. The emergency assessment amounted to five basis points on each institution&#8217;s assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009, subject to a maximum equal to 10 basis points times the institution&#8217;s assessment base. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 

Regulatory Capital Requirements and Prompt Corrective Action . The prompt corrective action regulation of the OCC requires mandatory actions and authorizes other discretionary actions to be taken by the OCC against a savings association that falls within undercapitalized capital categories specified in OCC regulations. 

The New Capital Rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios that, when fully phased in, will require banking organizations to maintain a minimum &#8220;common equity Tier 1&#8221; (or &#8220;CET1&#8221;) ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% (increased from 4.0%), a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0% (calculated as Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets). The effective date of these requirements for the Company and the Bank was January 1, 2015. 

A capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above each of these levels (to be phased in over three years which began in 2016, beginning at 0.625% and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019) will be required for banking institutions to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of dividends. 

The New Capital Rules provide for a number of new deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased in over three years for the Bank. 

The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect our regulatory capital position relative to that of our competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Bank. Various aspects of Basel III will be subject to multi-year transition periods ending December 31, 2018 and Basel III generally continues to be subject to further evaluation and interpretation by the U.S. banking regulators. As of June 30, 2016 , the Company and the Bank remain well-capitalized under the currently enacted capital adequacy requirements of Basel III, and would remain well-capitalized when including implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 on a fully phased-in basis. 

In general, the prompt corrective action regulation prohibits an FDIC member institution from declaring any dividends, making any other capital distribution, or paying a management fee to a controlling person if, following the distribution or payment, the institution would be within any of the three undercapitalized categories. In addition, adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits only with a waiver from the FDIC, but are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits. Undercapitalized institutions may not accept, renew or roll-over brokered deposits. 

If the OCC determines that an institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition, or if the institution is deemed to be engaging in an unsafe and unsound practice, the OCC may, if the institution is well-capitalized, reclassify it as adequately capitalized. If the institution is adequately capitalized, but not well-capitalized, the OCC may require it to comply with restrictions applicable to undercapitalized institutions. If the institution is undercapitalized, the OCC may require it to comply with restrictions applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions. Finally, pursuant to an interagency agreement, the FDIC can examine any institution that has a substandard regulatory examination score or is considered undercapitalized without the express permission of the institution&#8217;s primary regulator. 

Capital regulations applicable to savings associations such as the Bank also require savings associations of meeting the additional capital standard of tangible capital equal to at least 1.5% of total adjusted assets. 

The Bank&#8217;s capital requirements are viewed as minimum standards and most financial institutions are expected to maintain capital levels well above the minimum. In addition, OCC regulations provide that minimum capital levels greater than those provided in the regulations may be established by the OCC for individual savings associations upon a determination that the savings association&#8217;s capital is or may become inadequate in view of its circumstances. BofI Federal Bank is not subject to any such individual minimum regulatory capital requirement and the Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements as of June 30, 2016 . See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources.&#8221; 

Standards for Safety and Soundness . The federal banking regulatory agencies have prescribed, by regulation, guidelines for all insured depository institutions relating to: (i) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (ii) loan documentation; (iii) credit underwriting; (iv) interest rate risk exposure; (v) asset growth; (vi) asset quality; (vii) earnings; and (viii) compensation, fees and benefits. The guidelines set forth safety and soundness standards that the federal banking regulatory agencies use to identify and address problems at FDIC member institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the OCC determines that the Bank fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the OCC may require us to submit to it an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. OCC regulations establish deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans in response to any such determination. We are not aware of any conditions relating to these safety and soundness standards that would require us to submit a plan of compliance to the OCC. 

Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations . Savings associations generally are subject to the lending limits applicable to national banks. With limited exceptions, the maximum amount that a savings association or a national bank may lend to any borrower, including related entities of the borrower, at one time may not exceed 15% of the unimpaired capital and surplus of the institution, plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Savings associations are additionally authorized to make loans to one borrower by order of its regulator, in an amount not to exceed the lesser of $30.0 million or 30% &#32;of unimpaired capital and surplus for the purpose of developing residential housing, if the following specified conditions are met: 

&#8226; 

The savings association is in compliance with its fully phased-in capital requirements; 

&#8226; 

The loans comply with applicable loan-to-value requirements; and 

&#8226; 

The aggregate amount of loans made under this authority does not exceed 150% of unimpaired capital and surplus. 

Qualified Thrift Lender Test . Savings associations must meet a qualified thrift lender, or &#8220;QTL,&#8221; test. This test may be met either by maintaining a specified level of portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments as specified by the HOLA, or by meeting the definition of a &#8220;domestic building and loan association&#8221; under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the &#8220;Code&#8221;. Qualified thrift investments are primarily residential mortgage loans and related investments, including mortgage related securities. Portfolio assets generally mean total assets less specified liquid assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and the value of property used in the conduct of the Bank&#8217;s business. The required percentage of qualified thrift investments under the HOLA is 65% of &#8220;portfolio assets&#8221; (defined as total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business). An association must be in compliance with the QTL test or the definition of domestic building and loan association on a monthly basis in nine out of every 12 months. Savings associations that fail to meet the QTL test will generally be prohibited from engaging in any activity not permitted for both a national bank and a savings association. At June 30, 2016 , the Bank was in compliance with its QTL requirement and met the definition of a domestic building and loan association. 

Liquidity Standard . Savings associations are required to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations. As of June 30, 2016 , BofI Federal Bank was in compliance with the applicable liquidity standard. 

Volcker Rule. Effective April 15, 2014, the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations with a conformance period for certain features lasting until July 21, 2017, to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act known as the Volcker Rule. Under the regulations, FDIC-insured depository institutions, their holding companies, subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, &#8220;banking entities&#8221;), are generally prohibited, subject to certain exemptions, from proprietary trading of securities and other financial instruments and from acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a &#8220;covered fund.&#8221; The term &#8220;covered fund&#8221; can include, in addition to many private equity and hedge funds and other entities, certain collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations, and other items, but does not include wholly owned subsidiaries, certain joint ventures, or loan securitizations generally if the underlying assets are solely loans. 

Trading in certain government obligations is not prohibited by the Volcker Rule, including obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or an agency or government-sponsored entity of the United States, obligations of a State of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, and municipal securities. Proprietary trading generally does not include transactions under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions and purchases and sales for the purpose of liquidity management if the liquidity management plan meets specified criteria; nor does it generally include transactions undertaken in a fiduciary capacity. In addition, activities eligible for exemption include, among others, certain brokerage, underwriting and marketing activities, and risk-mitigating hedging activities with respect to specific risks and subject to specified conditions. 

Transactions with Related Parties . The authority of the Bank to engage in transactions with &#8220;affiliates&#8221; (i.e., any company that controls or is under common control with it, including the Company and any non-depository institution subsidiaries) is limited by federal law. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of a savings institution&#8217;s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies, and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally prohibits loans by public companies to their executive officers and directors. However, there is a specific exception for loans by financial institutions, such as the Bank, to its executive officers and directors that are made in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, our authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors, and 10% or more shareholders (&#8220;insiders&#8221;), as well as entities such person&#8217;s control is limited. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on its capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and cannot involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. 

Capital Distribution Limitations . Regulations applicable to the Bank impose limitations upon all capital distributions by savings associations, like cash dividends, payments to repurchase or otherwise acquire its shares, payments to stockholders of another institution in a cash-out merger and other distributions charged against capital. Under these regulations, a savings association may, in circumstances described in those regulations: 

&#8226; 

Be required to file an application and await approval from the OCC before it makes a capital distribution; 

&#8226; 

Be required to file a notice 30 days before the capital distribution; or 

&#8226; 

Be permitted to make the capital distribution without notice or application to the OCC. 

Community Reinvestment Act and the Fair Lending Laws . Savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations of the OCC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the denial of applications. In addition, an institution&#8217;s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in the OCC, other federal regulatory agencies or the Department of Justice, taking enforcement actions against the institution. To the best of our knowledge, BofI Federal Bank is in full compliance with each of the Community Reinvestment Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act and we do not anticipate the Bank becoming the subject of any enforcement actions. 

Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) System . The Bank is a member of the FHLB system. Among other benefits, each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. Each FHLB is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB system. Each FHLB makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual FHLB. As an FHLB member, the Bank is required to own capital stock in a Federal Home Loan Bank in specified amounts based on either its aggregate outstanding principal amount of its residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts and similar obligations at the beginning of each calendar year or its outstanding advances from the FHLB. 

Federal Reserve System . The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain non-interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts (primarily checking, negotiable order of withdrawal (&#8220;NOW&#8221;), and Super NOW checking accounts) and non-personal time deposits. At June 30, 2016 , the Bank was in compliance with these requirements. 

Activities of Subsidiaries . A savings association seeking to establish a new subsidiary, acquire control of an existing company or conduct a new activity through a subsidiary must provide 30 days prior notice to the FDIC and the OCC and conduct any activities of the subsidiary in compliance with regulations and orders of the OCC. The OCC has the power to require a savings association to divest any subsidiary or terminate any activity conducted by a subsidiary that the OCC determines to pose a serious threat to the financial safety, soundness or stability of the savings association or to be otherwise inconsistent with sound banking practices. 

Consumer Laws and Regulations . The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB in order to regulate any person who offers or provides personal, family or household financial products or services. The CFPB is an independent &#8220;watchdog&#8221; within the Federal Reserve System to enforce and create &#8220;Federal consumer financial laws.&#8221; Banks as well as nonbanks are subject to any rule, regulation or guideline created by the CFPB. Congress established the CFPB to create one agency in charge of protecting consumers by overseeing the application and implementation of &#8220;Federal consumer financial laws,&#8221; which includes (i) rules, orders and guidelines of the CFPB, (ii) all consumer financial protection functions, powers and duties transferred from other federal agencies, such as the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and (iii) a long list of consumer financial protection laws enumerated in the Dodd-Frank Act, such as the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Consumer Leasing Act of 1976, the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act of 1982, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Truth in Lending Act and the Truth in Savings Act, among many others. The CFPB has broad examination and enforcement authority, including the power to issue subpoenas and cease and desist orders, commence civil actions, hold investigations and hearings and seek civil penalties, as well as the authority to regulate disclosures, mandate registration of any covered person and to regulate what it considers unfair, deceptive, abusive practices. 

Depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer protection laws and regulations by their primary bank regulators (the OCC for the Bank), rather than the CFPB. Such laws and regulations and the other consumer protection laws and regulations to which the Bank has been subject have historically mandated certain disclosure requirements and regulated the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits from, making loans to, or engaging in other types of transactions with, such customers. The effect of the CFPB on the development and promulgation of consumer protection rules and guidelines and the enforcement of federal &#8220;consumer financial laws&#8221; on the Bank, if any, cannot be determined with certainty at this time. 

Depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets and their affiliates are subject to direct supervision by the CFPB, including any applicable examination, enforcement and reporting requirements the CFPB may establish. As of June 30, 2016, we had $7.6 billion in total assets. If the Bank continues to grow and has assets in excess of $10 billion in the future, the Bank and its operations will become subject to the direct supervision and oversight of the CFPB. 

In addition, if our total assets equal or exceed $10 billion, we will become subject to certain enhanced prudential standards established by FRB regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act for larger institutions, including additional risk management policies and practices and annual stress tests using various scenarios established by the FRB, designed to determine whether our capital planning, assessment of capital adequacy and risk management practices adequately protect the Company in the event of an economic downturn. 

Privacy Standards . The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) modernized the financial services industry by establishing a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks, insurance companies, securities firms and other financial service providers. The Bank is subject to OCC regulations implementing the privacy protection provisions of the GLBA. These regulations require the Bank to disclose its privacy policy, including informing consumers of its information sharing practices and informing consumers of their rights to opt out of certain practices. 

Anti-Money Laundering and Customer Identification . The U.S. government enacted the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (&#8220;USA PATRIOT Act&#8221;) on October 26, 2001 in response to the terrorist events of September 11, 2001. The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government broad powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. In February 2010, Congress re-enacted certain expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act.
