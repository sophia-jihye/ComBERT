General 

&#160;

Sugarmade, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as&#8239;&#8220;we&#8221;,&#8239;&#8220;us&#8221;&#8239;or&#8239;&#8220;the/our Company&#8221;) is a publicly traded company incorporated in the state of Delaware. We are headquartered in City of Industry, California, a suburb of Los Angeles, with two additional warehouse locations in Southern California. As of date of this filing, we employ 21 full and part-time workers and contractors. Our previous legal name was Diversified Opportunities, Inc. &#8239;Our Company, Sugarmade, Inc. operates through our subsidiary, Sugarmade, Inc., a California corporation (&#8220;SWC Group, Inc., - CA&#8221;). 

&#160;

As of June 30, 2016, Sugarmade, Inc. is a product and brand marketing company investing in products and brands with disruptive potential. We are involved in several businesses including the supply of products to several market sectors, including to the quick service restaurant sub-sector of the restaurant industry and as a distributor of paper products derived from non-wood sources. In addition, the Company is planning a market entry during the fourth calendar quarter of 2016 into the marketplace for seasonings and spices by way of separate licensing and distribution agreements with its business partners.

Our main business operation, CarryOutSupplies.com, is a producer and wholesaler of custom printed and generic supplies and has served more than 3,000 quick service restaurants. &#160; Our products include double poly paper cups for cold beverage; disposable, clear, plastic cold cups, paper coffee cups, yogurt cups, ice cream cups, cup lids, cup sleeves, food containers, soup containers, plastic spoons and many other similar products for this market sector. CarryOutSupplies.com was founded in 2009 when the founders gained first-hand experience within the restaurant industry of the difficulty for restaurant owners to acquire custom printed supplies at a reasonable cost. Many quick service restaurants wish to acquire custom printed products, such as those embossed with logos, but the minimum order size for such customization had been cost prohibitive. With that in mind, carry out supplies was founded to provide products to this underserved section of the market. Since that time, the company has become a key supplier to many popular U.S. franchises, particularly in the frozen dessert segments. The company estimates it holds approximately 40% market share of generic and printed products within the take out frozen yogurt and ice cream industries. We also hold a product supply and licensing agreement FreeHand&#174; ThumbTray&#8482; for the western part of the United States. 

&#160;

We are also a distributor of paper made from 100% reclaimed sugarcane fiber, enhanced with bamboo. Sugarcane fiber, called bagasse, is a discarded byproduct of sugarcane production. Sugarmade, Inc. was founded in 2010. As is explained below, in 2014, CarryOutSupplies.com was acquired by Sugarmade, Inc., creating the Company as it is today. Relative to Sugarmade Paper, our third-party contract manufacturer uses bagasse and bamboo, as opposed to wood products significantly reducing its manufacturing carbon footprint, energy consumption, and attendant water pollution during the manufacture of its products. This allows us to offer our unique, exclusive, tree-free paper products at price-parity equal to or less than current recycled fiber products already on the market. Our products are unique and we believe offer an ideal solution for those consumers (both corporate and individual) seeking to meet their sustainability mandates or personal environmentally conscious goals, at a price that is equal to or less than current recycled products. We are currently restructuring this business unit to focus on the organization and administration of fundraisers and paper drives for schools, non-profits and other institutions. 

&#160;

During September of 2016, the Company completed negotiations for and signed a license agreement with HUY FONG FOODS, INC. (&#8220;HFFI&#8221;), the maker of Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is granted license to use the licensed marks of HFFI on and for products the Company is currently in process of designing and testing. Based on this agreement and a separate license agreement signed during 2015 with Seasoning Stixs International, LLC, the Company plans to introduce a new culinary seasoning product named Sriracha Seasoning Stixs. Sriracha Seasoning Stixs are encapsulated Huy Fong Sriracha Sauce and other seasonings in the form of a stick, which are inserted into meat, fish and poultry prior to cooking. Sriracha Seasoning Stixs are a hard solid at room temperature, but as heat is applied the sticks begin to liquefy allowing the meat fibers to act like a sponge absorbing the seasonings and flavors that had previously been encapsulated in the stick. The Company plans to introduce this product via a nationwide advertising and social media campaign during the December quarter of 2016.

&#160;
