 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

General 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 30, 2005 under the name &#8220;Oliver Creek Resources Inc.&#8221; At inception, we were an exploration stage company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resources. In 2014, we discontinued our oil and gas operations and changed our business focus. Currently, we are a diversified holding company which, through our subsidiaries, is engaged in sales and distribution of medical devices, sales of branded generic pharmaceutical drugs, commercial real estate investment and leasing, sales of point of entry full-body security systems, and specialized financial services.

&#160;

The Company, through its medical products business unit, sells WoundClot Surgical - Advanced Bleeding Control, the Disintegrator&#8482; Insulin Needle Destruction Unit, the Carotid Artery Digital Non-Contact Thermometer and Zonis&#174;. The Company&#8217;s real estate leasing revenues are generated from a commercial property under a long-term lease. Additionally, the Company&#8217;s real estate investment unit holds limited liability company interest in a commercial restoration project in Hawaii. The Company&#8217;s financial service revenue is from brokerage services earned in connection with debt placement services. RedHawk Energy Corp., LLC holds the exclusive U.S. manufacturing and distribution rights for the Centri Controlled Entry System, a unique, closed cabinet, nominal dose transmission full body x-ray scanner. 

&#160;

Effective June 22, 2012, we completed a forward split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a 5 new for 1 old basis such that our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 375,000,000 shares of common stock and, correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock increased from 24,360,831 to 121,804,155 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001 per share.

&#160;

On April 5, 2013, we entered into a private placement subscription agreement with Europa Capital AG (which we refer to as &#8220;Europa&#8221;), pursuant to which we issued to Europa a convertible debenture in the aggregate amount of $46,000. The convertible debenture carried interest at the rate of 6% per annum and could be converted into shares of our common stock at the rate of $0.01 per share. Interest and principal were payable on the third anniversary of the debenture, provided that any unconverted portions could be pre-paid at our discretion. As of January 31, 2014, we owed $2,284 of accrued interest in respect of the debenture. On January 31, 2014, the debenture holder forgave the convertible promissory note and all accrued interest, resulting in a gain on forgiveness of loan of $48,284.

&#160;

Effective July 22, 2013, we entered into and closed a securities purchase agreement with Asher Enterprises, Inc. (which we refer to as &#8220;Asher&#8221;). Under the terms of the agreement, we issued an 8% convertible promissory note, in the principal amount of $57,000, with a maturity date of April 17, 2014 which could be converted into shares of our common stock at a rate of 58% of the market price on any conversion date, any time after 180 days from July 15, 2013, subject to adjustments as further set out in the note. We had the right to prepay the note together with all accrued interest within 180 days of July 15, 2013 subject to a prepayment penalty equal to 15% during the first 30 days of the prepayment period and increasing by 5% during each subsequent 30-day period. Following the maturity date of April 17, 2014, the note bore interest at the rate of 22%. As of March 25, 2014, all of the unpaid principal and accrued interest in respect to these convertible promissory note was converted into shares of our common stock. (See &#8220;Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities&#8221;)

&#160;

On September 23, 2013, we closed another securities purchase agreement dated September 17, 2013 with Asher. Under the terms of the agreement, we issued an 8% convertible promissory note, in the principal amount of $32,500, with a maturity date of June 19, 2014 which could be converted into shares of our common stock at a rate of 58% of the market price on any conversion date, any time after 180 days from June 19, 2014, subject to adjustments as further set out in the note. We had the right to prepay the note together with all accrued interest within 180 days of September 17, 2013 subject to a prepayment penalty equal to 15% during the first 30 days of the prepayment period and increasing by 5% during each subsequent 30-day period. Following the maturity date of June 19, 2014, the note would have borne interest at the rate of 22%. As of April 8, 2014, all unpaid principal and accrued interest in respect of the convertible promissory note was converted into shares of our common stock. (See &#8220;Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities&#8221;).

&#160;

Effective November 12, 2014, we completed a private equity funding with certain accredited investors pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (&#8220;SPA&#8221;). Under the terms of the SPA, we sold 14,905,918 shares of our common stock in exchange for $50,000 ($0.0034 per share) in the aggregate. Additionally, in consideration of the purchase price, we granted warrants to acquire an additional 7,452,959 shares of our common stock over a two-year period at an aggregate exercise price of $0.0050 per share or gross proceeds of $37,265.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On July 31, 2015, by a vote of the majority of our shareholders, we changed our name from &#8220;Independence Energy Corp.&#8221; to &#8220;RedHawk Holdings Corp.&#8221;, increased the number of authorized shares of common stock to 450,000,000, and authorized the issuance of 5,000 shares of preferred stock with an initial stated value of $1,000 per share.

&#160;

On December 31, 2015, the Company received from Beechwood Properties, LLC (which we refer to as &#8220;Beechwood&#8221;) a working capital injection of approximately $1.9 million of cash and marketable securities, net of an approximately $1.0 million line of credit with a 3.5% per annum interest rate. This infusion was received in exchange for 1,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s newly designated 5% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, $1,000 stated value. Additionally, Beechwood converted into 100 shares of the Company&#8217;s 5% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $1,000 par value, $100,000 of the Company&#8217;s outstanding obligation to Beechwood. Beechwood beneficially owns approximately 51.9% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock.

&#160;

On February 1, 2016, we issued 250 shares of the Company&#8217;s 5% Series B Convertible Preferred stock, $1,000 stated value, to Thomas J. Concannon, our Chief Executive Officer in exchange for $250,000 in cash. Additionally, the Company has issued $340,000 of Convertible Notes (which we refer to as the &#8220;Convertible Notes&#8221;) in exchange for cash in the amount of $340,000. The Convertible Notes accrue interest at a rate of 5% per annum, mature five years from their date of issuance and are secured by certain Company real estate and real estate of an officer and shareholder of the Company.

Current Business Segments 

&#160; 

Medical Device Distribution and Generic Pharmaceuticals 

&#160; 

Non-Contact Thermometers. On March 31, 2014, we entered into and closed an asset purchase agreement with American Medical Distributors, LLC (which we refer to as &#8220;AMD&#8221;), pursuant to which we have acquired from AMD all right, title and interest of AMD in and to a certain distribution contract (which we refer to as the &#8220;HuBDIC Agreement&#8221;) dated November 27, 2013 with HuBDIC Co. Ltd., a Korean corporation (which we refer to as &#8220;HuBDIC&#8221;), pursuant to which AMD had been granted the exclusive right to distribute in the Americas certain professional and consumer grade non-contact thermometers known as the Thermofinder FS-700 Pro (professional model) and FS-700 (retail model), and any future versions (which we refer to as collectively, the &#8220;Thermofinder&#8221;). In connection with the acquisition, we also received $60,000 and any assets of AMD related to its distribution business, including all sales leads and related materials (which we refer to as collectively, including the HuBDIC Agreement, the &#8220;AMD Assets&#8221;), and in consideration of the AMD Assets, we issued to four designees of AMD an aggregate of 152,172,287 shares of our common stock.

&#160;

The material terms of the HuBDIC Agreement are as follows: (a) term of five years from November 7, 2013; (b) upon receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration (which we refer to as &#8220;FDA&#8221;) marketing clearance of the HuBDIC products, we are required to purchase a minimum of 3,000 product units for re-sale during year one of the distribution period, 8,000 during year two, and 15,000 during each subsequent year; (c) a $10,000 distribution fee previously paid to HuBDIC by AMD will be credited toward our first product order; and (d) the distribution fee is refundable to us at our election. On or about July 2, 2014, HuBDIC received marketing clearance from the FDA for the sale and distribution of the Thermofinder. In November 2014, we paid for and took delivery of 500 units of the Thermofinder FS-700 Pro. We have agreed with HuBDIC to defer payment for and delivery of the balance of 2,500 units until a later date. The Company is actively soliciting orders for and has sold some of the first 500 units. The Company&#8217;s board of directors is currently evaluating future marketing strategies for the sales and distribution of additional units. 

&#160;

The Thermofinder is medical grade non-contact thermometer that is currently approved and distributed in Asia and Europe, and its features include the following:

&#160;

&#167; Two measuring modes, including body temperature and surface/ambience modes, which allow the reading of air temperature and fluid temperature (for example, bath water, baby&#8217;s bottles). &#167; Non-invasive design&#8212;Operated by pointing and pressing within 3-5 centimeters of the patient&#8217;s forehead or other target. &#167; Easy to read LCD backlit display with multi-color screen and alert function. A green light is shown for normal reading, and an orange light for high readings. &#167; Less than 2 second reading response time. &#167; Reading accuracy within 0.3 degrees Celsius for body temperature and 2 degrees Celsius for object temperature. &#167; International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 13485 and American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Compliant. &#167; More hygienic than conventional oral and ear reading thermometers&#8212;Eliminates the need for probe covers and reduces sterilization requirements. &#167; The FS-700 Pro model is equipped with a medical grade protection cover, logo lanyard, anti-microbial option, and rechargeable battery and station. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Needle Destruction. On December 31, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of certain high-quality medical products technology, including the tangible and intangible assets, for the Disintegrator Insulin Needle Destruction Unit (which we refer to as &#8220;Disintegrator&#8221;) and the Carotid Artery Non-Contact Thermometer. The Disintegrator is the only needle destruction device which has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

&#160;

The proper management of medical waste, also referred to as biohazardous waste, biomedical waste or infectious waste, which is generated in healthcare facilities, commercial businesses and private home healthcare is extremely important to avoid regulatory issues and more importantly to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. Needles and soft wastes, those saturated with blood or certain other bodily fluids, must be properly handled, contained, stored, shipped and treated in accordance with all governmental regulations. To date, the most common system used to dispose of used needles has been sharp container boxes. Generally, this type of device is compatible for use in healthcare facilities, commercial businesses and private homes. It is a portable device used to destroy needles and lancets utilizing an electrical current which incinerates the lancet or syringes. It uses a rechargeable battery which delivers an electrical current to produce an arc of electricity directed at the tip of the syringe. This electrical arc disintegrates the needle and any residue is collected in a self-contained chamber in the device. The Company&#8217;s initial needle destruction device is referred to as the Sharps and Needle Destruction Device, the SANDD mini. This device aims to change both the way patients and physicians dispose of their needles and to eliminate the risk of needle stick injuries in the future. Utilizing a plasma arc the SANDD mini heats the needle to over 2500 degrees Celsius in less than three seconds, eliminating both the needle and all known pathogens in the process. The device uses a rechargeable battery to deliver the plasma arc to the needle. A fully charged battery will disintegrate greater than 100 needles before needing to be recharged. The SANDD mini is designed to be used with hypodermic needles attached to prefilled syringes or diabetic pen injection devices that measure less than 1 inch in length and between 27-32 gauges in diameter. The device produces little to no waste leaving the syringe to be disposed of in general waste as opposed to the need for the use of a sharps box. The change in this route of waste disposal is projected to offer healthcare providers significant budgetary savings and ease of disposal in home healthcare settings. The SANDD mini is scheduled to begin evaluation and be available for sale to appropriate healthcare markets in the United Kingdom and Middle East during the fourth calendar quarter of 2016.

&#160;

Woundclot. On February 2, 2016, the Company announced that RedHawk Medical Products UK Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, had entered into a contract with Core Scientific Creations Ltd. for the exclusive distribution rights to WoundClot Surgical &#8211; Advanced Bleeding Control (which we refer to as &#8220;WoundClot&#8221;) in the United Kingdom. WoundClot, developed and manufactured in Israel by Core Scientific Creations Ltd, is the first UK Class III medical device, fully implantable surgical hemostat designed to stop moderate to severe arterial and venous hemorrhage without the need to compress directly onto the wound.

&#160;

Hemostatic refers to a procedure, device or substance that arrests the flow of blood. Direct pressure, tourniquets and surgical clamps are mechanical hemostatic measures. Gelatin sponges, solutions of thrombin and microfibrillar collagen, which cause the aggregation of platelets and formation of clots, are used to arrest bleeding in surgical procedures. WoundClot is a single use sterile bio-absorb Hemostatic product made of non-oxidized cellulose, which can be fabricated into a variety of forms suitable in controlling bleeding from various kinds of wounds. WoundClot has been uniquely engineered and manufactured with a patented molecular structure, designed to entrap platelets and coagulants in a modified physical molecular matrix. WoundClot is the first cellulose based product to be manufactured using a non-oxidative process. This change in the manufacturing process of WoundClot results in major clinical advantages. The first of these advantages is a significantly increased absorptive capability, enabling WoundClot to arrest and control even severe arterial bleeding. Once bleeding has been stopped and coagulation has formed, WoundClot can be easily removed without disrupting the already formed clot. Additionally, it opens up a much wider range of indications than traditional oxidized cellulose based competitive products, has a truly non-compression application and is fully biodegradable within seven days, meaning it can be implanted within the body, further minimizing the risk of secondary post-surgical bleeding.

&#160;

The Company, in conjunction with EcoGen Europe Ltd (which we refer to as &#8220;EcoGen&#8221;), its European pharmaceutical partner, has begun marketing the product to large teaching hospitals in the United Kingdom. The product has been successfully trialed in various surgery disciplines including cardiothoracic, hepatobiliary, pediatric neurosurgery, vascular and trauma surgery and has been shown to outperform currently established products.

&#160;

Zonis. EcoGen also holds the distribution rights in a number of European countries, Australia and New Zealand for Zonis, a patented antimicrobial ionic silver calcium catheter dressing with both wound healing and hemostatic properties. It is designed to be placed directly over the exit site of all vascular and non-vascular percutaneous medical devices. Zonis reduces bacteria colonization and related bloodstream infections by delivering ionic silver directly to the site.

&#160;

Generic Pharmaceuticals . On March 24, 2016, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, RedHawk Pharma UK Ltd, has signed a definitive agreement with Scarlett Pharma LTD (which we refer to as &#8220;Scarlett&#8221;) to complete the acquisition of a 25% ownership investment in EcoGen, a United Kingdom based company specializing in the manufacturing and marketing of certain branded generic pharmaceuticals and medical devices.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

A generic drug is a pharmaceutical drug that is the equivalent to a brand name product in dosage, strength, route of administration, quality, performance and intended use. The term may also refer to any drug marketed under its chemical name without advertising, or to the chemical makeup of a drug rather than the brand name under which the drug is sold. Although they may not be associated with a particular company, generic drugs are subject to government regulations in the countries where they are dispensed. They are labeled with the name of the manufacturer and the nonproprietary adopted name of the drug. A generic drug must contain the same active ingredients as the original brand name formulation. In most cases, generic drugs become available after the patent afforded to a drug&#8217;s original developer expires. Once generic drugs enter the market, competition often leads to substantially lower prices for both the brand name drug and its generic equivalents. Clinicians in the United Kingdom are encouraged to write prescriptions for patent protected drugs by their generic name in preparation for such drugs losing their patent protected status, with the prescribed drug being dispensed to the patient by a community pharmacy. Pharmacists are obligated by law to dispense the brand that is written, should the clinician not use the generic name when prescribing a particular treatment, with all drugs being dispensed against a set tariff pricing structure. The pharmacist therefore procures the generic drug at the lowest available price from the wholesale supply chain, who in turn procures the lowest priced drug from any available manufacturer, ensuring that the generic drug market in the United Kingdom is purely drive by cost. The legal obligation on United Kingdom pharmacists to dispense a branded product if that is so prescribed presents the opportunity for the branded generic strategy of EcoGen. With a portfolio of widely prescribed generic drugs listed as trademarked branded generics, EcoGen can offer significant budgetary savings when compared to standard generics by offering these branded generics for sale at a price below the listed generic tariff. With UK Commissioning Groups being driven to find savings across their budgets where possible, EcoGen&#8217;s branded generic strategy has been met favorably and sales of EcoGen&#8217; branded generic drugs are expected to initially occur in the third calendar quarter of 2016.

Land and Hospitality 

&#160;

Tower Hotel Fund 2013, LLC. On December 31, 2015, RedHawk Land &#38; Hospitality, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired from Beechwood 280,000 Class A Units (approximately a 2.0% membership interest) of fully paid, non-assessable units of limited liability company interest in Tower Hotel Fund 2013, LLC, a real estate development limited liability company formed in the state of Hawaii for acquisition, restoration and development of the Naniloa Hilo Resort in Hilo, Hawaii. The $625,000 purchase price was paid by the issuance of 625 shares of the Company&#8217;s Series A Preferred Stock. The purchase price was determined by an independent third-party valuation. Beechwood is a real estate limited liability Company owned and controlled by G. Darcy Klug, a stockholder and Chief Financial Officer of the Company.

&#160;

Jefferson Street Property. On November 13, 2015, we acquired certain commercial rental property, consisting of $75,000 of land and $405,000 of buildings and improvements, from Beechwood for $480,000. The purchase price was paid by the Company through the assumption of $265,000 of long-term bank indebtedness (see Note 7) plus the issuance of 215 shares of the Company&#8217;s newly designated Series A Preferred Stock (see Note 8). The purchase price of the property was determined by independent third-party appraisers commissioned by the financial institution providing the long-term financing for the acquisition, which included the cost of specific security improvements requested by the lessee.

&#160;

Youngsville Property. On December 31, 2015, we acquired certain commercial real estate from Beechwood to be used as our corporate office for $300,000, consisting of $35,000 of land and $265,000 of buildings and improvements. The purchase price was paid by the Company with the issuance of 300 shares of the Company&#8217;s Series A Preferred Stock. The purchase price of the property was determined by independent third-party appraisal.

&#160;

Specialized Security System Manufacturing and Distribution 

&#160; 

Centri Controlled Entry System. On April 11, 2016, the Company acquired the exclusive United States manufacturing and distribution rights for the Centri Controlled Entry System (which we refer to as &#8220;Centri&#8221;), a unique, nominal dose transmission x-ray full body scanner capable of finding weapons, drugs and other metallic and non-metallic contraband concealed on and within the human body. The Company acquired these exclusive rights from Basic Technologies, Inc. who holds the exclusive worldwide license to manufacture and sell Centri. The Company will initially target state and local correctional facilities located in the southern United States. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company received approval from the FDA for the importation, assembly and demonstrations of Centri. Phase I radiation testing has been successfully completed. Approval for human testing and the sale of Centri units was received from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality during the quarter ending September 30, 2016.

&#160;

Customers, Marketing and Contracting 

&#160;

Our medical devices and branded generics are to be marketed to a broad base of users and are ideal for home and institutional use. The market for our devices and branded generics include:

&#160;

&#167; Retail Pharmacies &#167; Hospitals &#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#167; Physicians&#8217; Offices &#167; Private and Public Healthcare Clinics &#167; Corrections Facilities &#167; Schools &#167; Veterinary Clinics &#167; Emergency Services &#167; Long Term Care Facilities &#160;

Safety and Quality Assurance &#160;

&#160; 

Our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials, including electronic and mechanical components, batteries, carry bags, and molded plastic components and other supplies. We rely on third- party manufacturers to supply several components of our medical devices. We typically enter into supply agreements for these components that specify quantity, quality requirements, and delivery terms, which, in certain cases, can be terminated by either party upon relatively short notice. For each medical device, we have elected to source certain key components from single sources of supply, including our batteries, molded plastic components. While alternative sources of supply are readily available for these components, we believe that maintaining a single source of supply allows us to control production costs and inventory levels, and to manage component quality. In order to mitigate against the risks related to a single source of supply, we qualify alternative suppliers and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions. If any single-source supplier were no longer able to supply a component, we believe we would be able to promptly and cost-effectively switch to an alternative supplier without a significant disruption to our business and operations. We have adopted additional contingency plans to protect against an immediate disruption in supply of our battery components, and any potential delay that may result from a switch to a new supplier. These contingency plans include our own inventory management, along with a requirement that certain suppliers maintain specified quantities of inventory in multiple locations, as well as requiring certain manufacturers to maintain redundant manufacturing sites. We believe that these contingency plans would limit any disruption to our business in the event of an immediate termination of either our battery supply. 

&#160;

Governmental Regulations 

&#160; 

Our medical devices and generic pharmaceuticals are subject to a wide variety of stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations. We believe we have acquired all of the necessary permits and licenses necessary to manufacture, sell and safely distribute our products.

&#160;

Medical Devices. Government authorities in the United States, Canada, and other countries in the Americas regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of medical devices at the federal, state and local levels. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.

&#160;

In the United States, thermometers for human clinical use are classified as medical devices and require (i) an establishment license and (ii) depending on the class of device sought to be marketed, pre-market approval (PMA) or the less rigorous pre-market clearance.

&#160;

Establishment License. Owners or operators of places of business (also called establishments or facilities) that are involved in both the production and distribution of medical devices intended for use in the United States (U.S.) are required to register annually with the FDA. This process is known as establishment registration. Most establishments that are required to register with the FDA are also required to list the devices that are made there and the activities that are performed on those devices. As domestic distributors of medical devices in the United States, we will not be required to obtain an establishment license, although the owner/operator of the products we distribute will be so required. Certain countries do not require an establishment license.

&#160;

Depending on the class designation of the device sought to be marketed, the owner/operator of the product must also obtain pre-market approval (PMA) or pre-market notification clearance before marketing in the U.S.

&#160;

U.S. Medical Device Class Designations . The FDA has established classifications for different generic types of devices and grouped them into medical specialties. Each of these devices is assigned to one of three regulatory classes based on the level of control the FDA deems necessary to assure the safety and effectiveness of the device.

&#160;

Class I includes products of which several examples are already approved and marketed in Canada or the U.S. As long as the basic science remains the same, the application for approval of a new product is straightforward. Examples of products in this category include pregnancy tests or regular needles/syringes.

&#160;

Class II products are those which are non-invasive, meaning they are not injected or inserted into the patient. Often these products are approved and sold throughout the world. The products which we are currently focusing on distributing all belong to Class II. In order to secure the necessary license for these products, we are required to submit all the documentation which led to the approval of the products in other countries. In our case, our products are already approved in Europe and Korea. We are required to submit to the FDA all the scientific data, results, approval process and certificates of good quality management, ISO 13485. Usually, products that have the ISO accreditation will satisfy FDA requirements.

&#160;

Class III and IV include medical devices that use invasive techniques. If the medical device has been approved in another region, it is considered Class III. If it is new, it is considered Class IV. Invasive testing equipment such as colonoscopy, endoscopy, body lesion removal devices etc., are all considered Class III or IV. None of our products fall within Class III or IV.

&#160;

Premarket Clearance. We intend to focus our medical device distribution business on Class I or II devices. Electronic Clinical Thermometers such as the Thermofinder are classified as Class II devices by the FDA are not subject to Premarket Approval (PMA).

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Each person who wants to market in the U.S., a Class I or II device intended for human use, for which a Premarket Approval (PMA) is not required, must submit a 510(k) application to the FDA unless the device is exempt from the Section 510(k) requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act).

&#160;

A 510(k) application is a pre-market submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is at least as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device that is not subject to PMA. Submitters must compare their device to one or more similar legally marketed devices and make and support their substantial equivalency claims. A legally marketed device is a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, for which a PMA is not required, or a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device which has been found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The legally marketed device(s) to which equivalence is drawn is commonly known as the &#34;predicate.&#34; Although devices recently cleared under 510(k) are often selected as the predicate to which equivalence is claimed, any legally marketed device may be used as a predicate. Legally marketed also means that the predicate cannot be one that is in violation of the Act.

&#160;

Before marketing a device, each submitter must receive an order, in the form of a letter, from the FDA which finds the device to be substantially equivalent and states that the device can be marketed in the U.S. This order &#34;clears&#34; the device for commercial distribution.

&#160;

Until the submitter receives an order declaring a device substantially equivalent, the submitter may not proceed to market the device. Once the device is determined to be substantially equivalent, it can then be marketed in the U.S. The substantially equivalent determination is usually made within 90 days and is made based on the information submitted by the submitter.

&#160;

Substantial Equivalence. A 510(k) clearance requires demonstration of substantial equivalence to another legally U.S. marketed device. Substantial equivalence means that the new device is at least as safe and effective as the predicate.

&#160;

A device is substantially equivalent if, in comparison to a predicate it:

&#160;

&#167; has the same intended use as the predicate; and &#167; has the same technological characteristics as the predicate; &#160;

or

&#160;

&#167; has the same intended use as the predicate; &#167; has different technological characteristics and the information submitted to the FDA; &#167; does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness; and &#167; demonstrates that the device is at least as safe and effective as the legally marketed device. A claim of substantial equivalence does not mean the new and predicate devices must be identical. Substantial equivalence is established with respect to intended use, design, energy used or delivered, materials, chemical composition, manufacturing process, performance, safety, effectiveness, labeling, biocompatibility, standards, and other characteristics, as applicable.

&#160;

A device may not be marketed in the U.S. until the submitter receives a letter declaring the device substantially equivalent. If the FDA determines that a device is not substantially equivalent, the applicant may:

Future Business Opportunities. The Company&#8217;s board of directors is currently evaluating our future strategy for marketing the Thermofinder FS-700 and FS-700 Pro non-contact thermometers. Under consideration is possibly contracting with third parties for the distribution of the Thermofinder FS-700 Pro to hospitals, doctors, schools, home health care providers, etc. The Company is considering engaging an independent marketing representative to offer its consumer version of the digital non-contact thermometer, Thermofinder FS-700, through retail chains. No decision has yet been made on the future marketing strategies.

&#160;

Our board of directors is evaluating whether to seek opportunities related to the distribution of other medical devices besides the Thermofinder.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s board of directors is also considering entry into other lines of business including, but not necessarily limited to, commercial and hospitality real estate, specialized financial services and equipment rental services. No decision has yet been made on entering these or other future lines of business.

Insurance 

&#160;

Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals. Our operations and products are subject to inherent risks of personal safety and injury and, as such, we maintain insurance policies to protect us in the event of a loss. We believe our insurance coverages for these risks are adequate. Historically, we have not experienced a loss in excess of our policy limits; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider to be commercially reasonable, nor can there be any assurance such coverage will be adequate to all of the claims that may arise.

&#160;

Property and Casualty. We also maintain insurance against property damage, flood and other catastrophic events that may result in physical damage or destruction to our real estate. All policies are subject to deductibles and other coverage limitations. While we believe over coverage limits are adequate to protect against loss, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider to be commercially reasonable, nor can there be any assurance such coverage will be adequate to all of the claims that may arise.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The medical device and branded generic pharmaceutical distribution industries are highly competitive. We are a development stage company without established operations in our industry and have a weak competitive position. We aim to compete with junior and senior medical device and branded generic pharmaceutical manufacturers or distributors who are actively seeking to develop or acquire and sell devices competitive with our own. Competition for the medical device and branded generic pharmaceutical assets is intense and we may lack the technological information, human resources, infrastructure, expertise, and financial resources available to our competitors. Such competition could adversely impact our ability to attain the financing necessary for us to develop our current assets, generate revenues, or obtain and develop future assets.

&#160;

Many of the companies with which we aim to compete for financing and for the acquisition of medical device and branded generic pharmaceutical assets have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on assets of merit or on developing and distributing their own technologies.

&#160;

General competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of regulation introduced from time to time by the governments of the United States and other countries, as well as factors beyond our control, including overall levels of supply and demand for the product types which we seek to distribute.

&#160;

In the face of competition, we may not be successful in acquiring or successfully exploiting any distribution rights which we have acquired or may acquire in the future. Despite this, we hope to compete successfully in the medical device industry by:

&#160;

&#167; maintaining low operating costs; &#167; relying on the strength of our management&#8217;s and future sales team&#8217;s contacts; &#167; utilizing our team's previous product and sales and support experience in the specific device area; and &#167; using our size and experience to our advantage by adapting quickly to changing market conditions or responding swiftly to potential opportunities. &#160;

Employees 

&#160;

Currently, we do not have any employees. Our officers are providing their services to us on an independent consultant basis, but, at this time, we have not entered into any consulting or employment agreements with them. Our directors, executive officers and certain contracted individuals play an important role in the running of the Company. We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next 12 month period. We intend to engage contractors from time to time to consult with us on specific corporate affairs or to perform specific tasks in connection with our anticipated sales and marketing programs.

&#160;

&#160; Available Information
