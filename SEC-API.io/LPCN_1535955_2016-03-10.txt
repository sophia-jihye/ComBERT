Testosterone Background 

&#160; 

Testosterone, or T, is the primary circulating sex hormone in males and is critical to the development and maturation of reproductive tissues as well as other secondary male characteristics such as muscle growth and bone density. Synthesized in the gonads of both males (testis) and females (ovaries), testosterone circulates bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG, ~60%), loosely bound to albumin, a protein in the blood that binds to testosterone, (~40%), or as a free molecule (~1%). Once circulating, testosterone enters cells directly and activates a network of proteins that ultimately result in metabolic conversions, which in turn produce observable effects. The concentration of circulating testosterone can vary drastically over time or between individuals and can be dependent on genetic factors, other medical conditions, lifestyle behaviors, and/or concurrent medication administration. Although large variability exists, the effects of testosterone are also determined by a number of factors including the amount of steroid penetration, sensitivity of enzymes and cellular proteins to the hormone, and the action of genomic receptors at the cellular level. As a result, assessing clinically low, or potentially high, levels of naturally occurring testosterone often requires a number of quantitative tests in conjunction with clinical evaluations.

&#160; 

Hypogonadism Overview 

&#160; 

Low serum testosterone causes significant clinical impact and can result in erectile dysfunction, low libido, decreased muscle mass and strength, increased body fat, decreased bone density, decreased vitality and depressed mood. Furthermore, low serum testosterone concentrations have been found to be an independent predictor of a number of cardiovascular risk factors including obesity, abnormal lipid levels, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and systemic inflammation. Well-designed, prospective clinical trials have determined that low testosterone levels are also independently associated with mortality risk. These findings have generated interest amongst the medical community and general public regarding the importance of maintaining appropriate serum testosterone levels, which has stimulated growth of the testosterone replacement therapy market which peaked in 2013. The testosterone therapy market has contracted since 2013 due to a number of factors including the withdrawal of direct to consumer advertising mid-2014.

&#160;

Hypogonadism typically refers to a permanent deficiency of sex hormones rather than a temporary deficiency that may be related to acute/chronic illnesses or other medical, personal, or environmental factors. Primary hypogonadism describes disease states that intrinsically affect the gonads. Examples of these include the genetic disorders, Turner syndrome and Kleinfelter syndrome. Secondary hypogonadism refers to disease states that affect gonadal-related structures such as the hypothalamus and pituitary gland that directly impact the development of gonads and as such the release of testosterone and other sexual hormones. Kallmann syndrome, in which patients fail to undergo all of the changes associated with puberty, is a type of secondary hypogonadism. Although a number of inherited diseases are known to affect the gonads either directly or indirectly, it is generally believed that the majority of individuals with hypogonadism develop the condition as a result of age-related declines in testosterone or other acquired conditions.

&#160;

Diagnosis and Treatment of Hypogonadism 

&#160; 

Epidemiological studies have determined that total testosterone follows an age-related decline with mean serum concentration at the age of 75 years approximately two thirds that at 25 years. Because naturally occurring testosterone exists at low concentrations, with normal testosterone levels in the range of 300 to 1140ng/dL, automated platform-based assays have been found to lack specificity and are prone to inter-lab variability. The lack of reliable laboratory tests is complicated further by the inter-individual variability seen in an unaffected population. Thus, in order to accurately diagnose hypogonadism in a male, multiple morning serum testosterone levels are performed in conjunction with a clinical assessment of patient symptoms. Patients can only be diagnosed when they present with symptoms that are directly related to more than one low morning serum testosterone level.

&#160;

Treatment for male hypogonadism (both primary and secondary) is testosterone replacement therapy. Some of the reported benefits of testosterone replacement therapy include improved libido, sexual function, increased bone density, muscle development, and cognition, as well as a reduction in other risk factors caused by low testosterone.

&#160; 

Testosterone Replacement Market 

&#160; 

Due to the wide variability in therapeutic range, difficulty of diagnosis, and other medical conditions that may confound an accurate diagnosis, there is a consensus that male hypogonadism is significantly undertreated. A large study of 2,162 men over the age of 45 visiting primary care practices in the United States revealed that the prevalence of hypogonadism is about 39%. Based on this prevalence rate and the U.S. Census Bureau&#8217;s 2009 estimate that there are 48 million men between 45 and 75 years old, approximately 19 million men in the U.S. may have low testosterone. In the study, fewer than 4% of patients were receiving treatment for hypogonadism.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Testosterone replacement therapies have been commercially available in the United States for over 70 years and have followed a progression of delivery systems that included subcutaneous, or under-the-skin, intramuscular, transdermal patch, and finally topical gels, which initially surfaced in 2000. In 2014, a long acting intramuscular injection and an intranasal delivery system for testosterone was approved. The difficulty in creating an easy to use/administer and clinically effective testosterone therapy is related to the molecule&#8217;s complex pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetics, or PK, describe how the body affects a specific drug after administration through the mechanism of absorption and distribution, as well as the chemical changes of the substance in the body. For example, oral therapies, which would ideally be the most popular route of delivery, require multiple, high daily doses due to low bioavailability. Bioavailability is the fraction of a drug dose that is actually absorbed into the bloodstream. Additionally, the few oral therapies that were used in the United States quickly went out of favor after significant side effects were revealed, most notably liver toxicity.

&#160;

Currently, the U.S. testosterone replacement market consists of therapies that exist in four forms:

&#160;

&#8226; gel/patch; &#160;

&#8226; injectable; &#160;

&#8226; intranasal; and &#160;

&#8226; buccal tablet, which is a tablet shaped patch applied to the upper gums. &#160;

Although transdermal patches were previously the most desirable application type, gel-based testosterone replacement therapies have gained increasing popularity due to improved skin tolerability. Despite becoming a popular approach to male hypogonadism treatment, topical gels are not without limitations. Topical gels place women and children at risk of testosterone transference (secondary exposure to gels), which has prompted the FDA, to add black box warnings relating to testosterone transference in the label of approved topical products. Despite these limitations, gels have continued to demonstrate significant market penetration.

&#160;

The male testosterone market was $2 billion in 2015 according to IMS Health data. Additionally testosterone replacement prescriptions were approximately 6.2 million in 2015 according to IMS Health data. Injectables are the predominant dosage form in this market in terms of annual prescriptions written although topical gels also have a significant share of total annual prescriptions. The historical growth in the market was driven by increasing recognition by both patients and providers of the prevalence of hypogonadism and its far-reaching medical consequences. Top treatments are marketed by AbbVie, Eli-Lilly, and Endo.

These products are based on our proprietary Lip&#8217;ral promicellar drug delivery technology platform. Lip&#8217;ral promicellar technology is a patented technology based on lipidic compositions which form an optimal dispersed phase in the gastrointestinal environment for improved absorption of insoluble drugs. The drug loaded dispersed phase presents the solubilized drug efficiently at the absorption site (gastrointestinal tract membrane) thus improving the absorption process and making the drug less dependent on physiological variables such as dilution, gastro-intestinal pH and food effects for absorption. Lip&#8217;ral based formulation enables improved solubilization and higher drug-loading capacity, which can lead to improved bioavailability, reduced dose, faster and more consistent absorption, reduced variability, reduced sensitivity to food effects, improved patient compliance, and targeted lymphatic delivery where appropriate.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

LPCN 1021: An Oral Product Candidate for Testosterone Replacement Therapy 

&#160;

Our lead product, LPCN 1021, is an oral formulation of the chemical testosterone undecanoate (&#34;TU&#34;), an eleven carbon side chain attached to testosterone. TU is an ester prodrug of testosterone. An ester is chemically formed by bonding an acid and an alcohol. Upon the cleavage, or breaking, of the ester bond, testosterone is formed. TU has been approved for use outside the United States for many years for delivery via intra-muscular injection and in oral dosage form and TU has received regulatory approval in the United States for delivery via intra-muscular injection. We are using our Lip&#8217;ral technology to facilitate steady gastrointestinal solubilization and absorption of TU for twice daily oral dosing of TU. Proof of concept was initially established in 2006, and subsequently LPCN 1021 was licensed in 2009 to Solvay Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#34;Solvay&#34;) which was then acquired by Abbott Products, Inc. (&#34;Abbott&#34;). Following a portfolio review associated with the spin-off of AbbVie by Abbott in 2011, the rights to LPCN 1021 were reacquired by us. All obligations under the prior license agreement have been completed except that Lipocine will owe Abbott a perpetual 1% royalty on net sales. Such royalties are limited to $1 million in the first two calendar years following product launch, after which period there is not a cap on royalties and no maximum aggregate amount. If generic versions of any such product are introduced, then royalties are reduced by 50%.

&#160; 

Results From SOAR 

&#160;

We have completed our Study of Oral Androgen Replacement (&#34;SOAR&#34;) pivotal Phase 3 clinical study evaluating efficacy and safety of LPCN 1021 and have received efficacy results and 52-week safety results. SOAR was a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, active-controlled, Phase 3 clinical study of LPCN-1021 in hypogonadal males with low testosterone (&#60; 300 ng/dL). In total, 315 subjects at 40 active sites were assigned, such that 210 were randomized to LPCN 1021 and 105 were randomized to the active control, Androgel 1.62%&#174;, for 52 weeks of treatment. The active control is included for safety assessment. LPCN 1021 subjects were started at 225 mg TU (equivalent to ~ 142 mg of T) twice daily (&#8220;BID&#8221;) with a standard meal and then dose titrated, if needed, up to 300 mg TU BID or down to 150 mg TU BID based on serum testosterone measured at weeks 3 and 7. The mean age of the subjects in the trial was ~53 yrs with ~91% of the patients &#60; 65 yrs of age.

&#160;

Primary statistical analysis was conducted using the Efficacy Population Set (&#34;EPS&#34;). The EPS is defined as subjects randomized into the study with at least one PK profile and no significant protocol deviations and includes imputed missing data by last observation carried forward, N=151. Further analysis was performed using the full analysis set (&#34;FAS&#34;) (any subject randomized into the study with at least one post-baseline efficacy variable response, N=193) and the safety set (&#8220;SS&#8221;) (any subject that was randomized into the study and took at least one dose, N=210).

&#160; 

Efficacy 

&#160;

The primary efficacy end point is the percentage of subjects with an average 24 hour serum testosterone concentration (&#8220;Cavg&#8221;) within the normal range, which is defined as 300-1140 ng/dL, after 13 weeks of treatment. The FDA guidelines for primary efficacy success is that at least 75% of the subjects on active treatment achieve a testosterone Cavg within the normal range; and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (&#8220;CI&#8221;) must be greater than or equal to 65%.

&#160;

LPCN 1021 met the FDA primary efficacy guideline. In the EPS analysis, 87% of the subjects on active treatment achieved testosterone Cavg within the normal range with lower bound CI of 82%. Additionally, sensitivity analysis using the FAS and SS reaffirmed the finding that LPCN 1021 met the FDA primary efficacy guideline as 87% and 80%, respectively, of the subjects on active treatment achieved testosterone Cavg within the normal range with lower bound CI of 82% and 74%, respectively.

&#160;

Other highlights from the efficacy results include:

&#160;

&#183; Mean Cavg was 446 ng/dL with coefficient of variance of 38%; &#160;

&#183; Less than 13% of the subjects were outside the tesosterone Cavg normal range at final dose; &#160;

&#183; 89% of subjects arrived at final dose with no more than one titration; and &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 51% of subjects were on final dose of 225 mg BID which was also the starting dose. &#160;

In the EPS analysis, Cmax &#8804;1500 ng/dL was 83%, Cmax between 1800 and 2500 ng/dL was 4.6% and Cmax &#62; 2500 ng/dL was 2%. Three patients had a Cmax &#62;2500 ng/dL which were transient, isolated and sporadic. Moreover, none of these subjects reported any adverse events (&#34;AEs&#34;) through the efficacy readout at week 13. Results were generally consistent with those of approved TRT products.

&#160; 

Safety 

&#160;

The safety component of the SOAR trial was completed the last week of April 2015. The safety extension phase was designed to assess safety based on information such as metabolites, biomarkers, laboratory values, serious adverse events (&#34;SAEs&#34;) and adverse events (&#8220;AEs&#8221;), with subjects on their stable dose regimen in both the treatment arm and the active control arm. LPCN 1021 treatment was well tolerated in that there were no hepatic, cardiac or drug related SAEs.

&#160;

LPCN 1021 safety highlights include:

&#160;

&#183; LPCN 1021 was well tolerated during 52 weeks of dosing; &#183; Overall AE profile for LPCN 1021 was comparable to the active control; &#183; Cardiac AE profiles were consistent between treatment groups and none of the observed cardiac AEs occurred in greater than 1.0% of the subjects in the LPCN 1021 arm and none were classified as severe; and &#183; All observed adverse drug reactions (&#8220;ADRs&#8221;) were classified as mild or moderate in severity and no serious ADRs occurred during the 52-week treatment period. &#160;

We also completed our labeling &#34;food effect&#34; study in May 2015. Results from the labeling &#34;food effect&#34; study indicate that bioavailability of testosterone from LPCN 1021 is not affected by changes in meal fat content. The results demonstrate comparable testosterone levels between the standard fat meal (similar to the meal instruction provided in the Phase 3 clinical study) and both the low and high fat meals. The labeling &#8220;food effect&#8221; study was conducted per the FDA requirement and we submitted preliminary results from this study to the FDA in the second quarter of 2015 prior to submitting the NDA. Based on our pre-NDA meeting with the FDA, we do not expect to be required to conduct a heart attack and stroke risk study or any additional safety studies prior to the approval of our NDA for LPCN 1021. We may, however, be required to conduct a heart attack and stroke risk study on our own or with a consortium of sponsors that have an approved TRT product post approval of LPCN 1021.

&#160;

The FDA accepted our NDA in October 2015 and has assigned a PDUFA goal date of June 28, 2016 for completion of the review. Additionally, the 74-day filing communication letter did not mention a need to convene an Advisory Committee for advice on the NDA for LPCN 1021. We also expect to file a New Drug Submission in Canada during the second half of 2016 for LPCN 1021.

&#160;

LPCN 1111: A Next-Generation Oral Product Candidate for TRT 

&#160; 

LPCN 1111 is a next-generation, novel ester prodrug of testosterone which uses the Lip&#8217;ral technology to enhance solubility and improve systemic absorption. We initiated a Phase 2b dose finding study in hypogonadal men in the fourth quarter of 2015 and anticipate results from that study in the second quarter of 2016. The primary objectives of the Phase 2b clinical study are to determine the optimal dose of LPCN 1111 along with safety and tolerability of LPCN 1111 and its metabolites following oral administration of single and multiple doses of LPCN 1111 in hypogonadal men. The Phase 2b clinical study is an open label, two-period, multiple dose PK study in 36 hypogonadal males. The 2b clinical study has three dose levels of LPCN 1111 in Period 1 and two dose levels of LPCN 1111 in Period 2 in which 12 subjects at each dose level will receive treatment for 14 days. In October 2014, we successfully completed a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study in hypogonadal men. The Phase 2a open-label, dose-escalating single and multiple dose study enrolled 12 males. These subjects had serum total testosterone &#60; 300 ng/dL based on two blood draws on two separate days. Subjects received doses of LPCN 1111 as a single dose of 330 mg, 550 mg, 770 mg, followed by once daily administration of 550 mg for 28 days in 10 subjects, and once daily administration of 770 mg for 28 days in eight subjects. Results from the Phase 2a clinical study demonstrated the feasibility of a once daily dosing with LPCN 1111 in hypogonadal men and a good dose response. Additionally, the study confirmed that steady state is achieved by day 14 with consistent inter-day performance observed on day 14, 21 and 28. No subjects exceeded Cmax of 1500 ng/dL at any time during the 28-day dosing period on multi-dose exposure. Overall, LPCN 1111 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

LPCN 1107: An Oral Product Candidate for the Prevention of Preterm Birth 

&#160;

We believe LPCN 1107 has the potential to become the first oral hydroxyprogesterone caproate (&#8220;HPC&#8221;) product indicated for the reduction of risk of preterm birth in women with a prior history of at least one preterm birth. We have successfully completed a multi-dose PK dose selection study in pregnant women. The objective of the multi-dose PK selection study was to assess HPC blood levels in order to identify the appropriate LPCN 1107 Phase 3 dose. The multi-dose PK dose selection study was an open-label, four-period, four-treatment, randomized, single and multiple dose, PK study in pregnant women of three dose levels of LPCN 1107 and the injectable HPC (Makena&#174;). The study enrolled 12 healthy pregnant women (average age of 27 years) with a gestational age of approximately 16 to 19 weeks. Subjects received three dose levels of LPCN 1107 (400 mg BID, 600 mg BID, or 800 mg BID) in a randomized, crossover manner during the first three treatment periods and then received five weekly injections of HPC during the fourth treatment period. During each of the LPCN 1107 treatment periods, subjects received a single dose of LPCN 1107 on Day 1 followed by twice daily administration from Day 2 to Day 8. Following completion of the three LPCN 1107 treatment periods and a washout period, all subjects received five weekly injections of HPC. Results from this study demonstrated that average steady state HPC levels (C avg 0-24) were comparable or higher for all three LPCN 1107 doses than for injectable HPC. Additionally, HPC levels as a function of daily dose were linear for the three LPCN 1107 doses. Also unlike the injectable HPC, steady state exposure was achieved for all three LPCN 1107 doses within seven days. The approved HPC injectable product is a single fixed dose product that does not allow for dose adjustments. We have also successfully completed a proof-of-concept Phase 1b clinical study of LPCN 1107 in healthy pregnant women in January 2015 and a proof-of-concept Phase 1a clinical study of LPCN 1107 in healthy non-pregnant women in May 2014. These studies were designed to determine the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of LPCN 1107 relative to the injectable HPC, as well as safety and tolerability. A traditional pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (&#8220;PK/PD&#8221;) based Phase 2 clinical study in the intended patient population may not be required prior to entering into Phase 3. Therefore; based on the results of our multi-dose PK study results, we plan to request an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the second quarter of 2016 to agree on a Phase 3 development plan for LPCN 1107. There are multiple potential development plans for LPCN 1107 with no assurances which, if any, will be acceptable to the FDA. Each potential development plan has a different timeline, cost and risk profile.

&#160;

The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to LPCN 1107 based on a major contribution to patient care. Orphan designation qualifies Lipocine for various development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, and a waiver of the prescription drug user fee when we file our NDA.

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160;

We currently have three products in our development pipeline (LPCN 1021, LPCN 1111 and LPCN 1107) and we continue to conceptualize and discuss new indications for current products as well as new development opportunities. In 2015 and 2014, we spent $12.6 million and $15.5 million, respectively, on research and development.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Testosterone Market Overview 

&#160; 

The gel-based testosterone replacement products that are currently available include AndroGel, marketed by AbbVie, Endo &#8217; s Testim&#174; and Fortesta&#174; and their respective authorized generics and Eli Lilly &#8217; s Axiron. Transdermal patches include Actavis&#8217;s Androderm&#174;. Intramuscular forms of testosterone also exist although commercialized mostly in generic forms by multiple companies and in branded form as Aveed&#174; by Endo. Additionally, Endo markets the buccal testosterone replacement therapy Striant and the Testopel implantable testosterone pellets, which it acquired from Auxillium in 2015 and an intranasal testosterone therapy Natesto, which it licensed from Acerus Pharmaceuticals in 2014. Endo terminated its agreement with Acerus Pharmaceuticals and will stop promoting Natesto June 30, 2016.

&#160;

Testosterone gels dominate the testosterone replacement therapy market in terms of sales dollars while intramuscular injections have the highest market share in the testosterone replacement market in terms of annual prescriptions. While gels are the a widely used form of testosterone replacement therapy, there is a risk of transference; additionally, the gels are messy to apply and have significant compliance issues leading to high rates of discontinuance among patients. Additionally, intramuscular injections have the potential to cause pulmonary embolisms as well as cause injection site reactions, scarring, pain and risk of infection in patients. We believe, a safe and effective oral therapy would increase patient convenience and compliance, while eliminating the testosterone transference risk associated with gels.

&#160;

The FDA recently granted a therapeutic equivalence (&#34;TE&#34;) rating of AB to &#8220;generic&#8221; versions of approved products which have been approved via a 505(b)(2) NDA. In July 2014, FDA granted the AB rating to Perrigo&#8217;s 1% testosterone gel drug product (NDA 203098) approved in January 2013, and a BX rating to Teva&#8217;s 1% gel drug product (NDA 202763) approved in February 2012. Each are versions of AbbVie&#8217;s Androgel 1.0% and employed 505(b)(2) submissions citing AndroGel as their reference listed drugs (&#34;RLD&#34;). Teva&#8217;s version was found to be bioinequivalent to AndroGel&#174;, hence the BX rating. Upsher-Smith Laboratories also received approval for a version of Auxilium&#8217;s Testim (Vogelxo&#8482;; NDA 204399) in June 2014 using the same pathway. In January of 2015, the FDA determined that Vogelxo&#8482; is therapeutically equivalent to Testim and received an AB rating. In August 2015, the FDA granted AB rating to Perrigo&#8217;s 1.62% testosterone gel drug product (NDA 204268) which also received FDA approval in August 2015.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Other Therapies in Development 

&#160;

Recently there has been increased interest in developing oral testosterone replacement therapies as well as testosterone therapies which are not considered testosterone replacement and as such will need to achieve efficacy endpoints in addition to endpoints related to serum testosterone levels that are required for replacement therapies.

&#160;

Clarus Therapeutics, Inc. has completed Phase 3 and subsequently filed an NDA in early 2014 with Rextoro&#174; (formerly CLR-610), a twice-daily oral softgel capsule of TU, as a testosterone replacement therapy for the treatment of hypogonadism in men. On September 18, 2014, Clarus and the FDA had an Advisory Committee meeting to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Rextoro. 18 of the 21 members of the Advisory Committee voted that the overall benefit/risk profile of Rextoro is not acceptable to support approval for T-replacement therapy. The reported PDUFA date for the Rextoro NDA was November of 2014. To our knowledge, an approval of Rextoro has not been reported by the FDA in their list of approval announcements.

&#160;

Antares Pharma, Inc. is developing a testosterone enanthate auto-injector administered subcutaneously once each week. The product candidate completed a double-blind, multiple-dose, Phase 3 study in October 2015. Anteras is now conducting a dose-blinded, multiple-dose, concentration controlled 28-week safety and pharmacokinetic study with a reported estimated completion date of June 2016.

&#160;

SOV Therapeutics, Inc. is developing a twice-daily oral testosterone undecanoate as a testosterone replacement therapy for the treatment of hypogonadism in men and in the treatment of Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty in adolescent boys (14-17 years of age). The product candidate has completed Phase 2 clinical trials in hypogonadal males and an end of Phase 2 meeting has been requested of the FDA. The FDA has approved SOV&#8217;s Phase 2 clinical study design in adolescent boys.

&#160;

Repros Therapeutics Inc. filed an NDA in the first quarter of 2015 with Androxal&#174; (enclomiphene citrate), an orally-bioavailable isomer of the selective estrogen receptor modulator clomifene citrate, as a testosterone therapy for the treatment of male secondary hypogonadism. The FDA cancelled the scheduled November 3, 2015 Advisory Committee meeting and subsequently Androxal received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA in November 2015.

&#160;

Novartis is currently developing BGS649, an aromatase inhibitor, as a testosterone therapy for the treatment of obese, hypogonadotropic hypogonadal men.

&#160;

TesoRx Pharma LLC is developing a twice-daily oral bio-identical testosterone as a testosterone replacement therapy for the treatment of hypoganadism in men. Phase 2 clinical studies have been completed.

&#160;

Apricus Biosciences, Inc. is developing Fispemifene, a once-daily orally administered selective estrogen receptor modulator for multiple urological conditions, including secondary hypogonadism. A Phase 2b clinical study has been initiated and Apricus plans to complete the Phase 2b clinical trial and report top-line data in the first quarter of 2016.

&#160;

Hydroxyprogesterone caproate, or HPC, Preterm Birth, or PTB, Market Overview 

&#160;

PTB is defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. The only approved therapy for prevention of PTB in women with a prior history of at least one preterm birth (~180,000 pregnancies annually) is a weekly intramuscular injection of hydroxyprogesterone caproate, marketed by AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc. under the brand name Makena&#174;. The FDA granted a 7-year orphan drug exclusivity to Makena in February 2011 because the product is intended to treat &#8220;rare diseases or conditions&#8221; defined as a condition that affects fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States. Treatment with Makena is initiated in pregnant women between week 16 and week 20 of pregnancy and is continued until up to delivery or week 37, whichever is earlier. The intramuscular injection is administered by a healthcare provider using a 21-gauge needle into the gluteus muscle, alternating sides each week. The intramuscular injections are associated with significant pain, discomfort and associated injection site reactions.

&#160;

AMAG Pharmaceuticals acquired Makena from Lumara Health Inc. in November 2014 for an upfront consideration of $675.0 million ($600.0 million in cash and $75.0 million in AMAG Pharmaceuticals stock) and additional contingent consideration of up to $350.0 million based on achievement of certain sales milestones. Net sales of Makena in 2015 were approximately $251.62 million with 2016 projected Makena net sales of between $310.0 and $340.0 million.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe LPCN 1107 has the potential to become the first oral HPC product for the prevention of preterm birth in women with a prior history of at least one preterm birth. Potential benefits of our oral product candidate relative to the current injectable product include the following:

&#160;

&#8226; Elimination of pain and site reactions associated with weekly injections; &#8226; Elimination of weekly doctor visits or visits from the nurse; and &#8226; Elimination of interference/disruption of personal, family or professional activities associated with weekly visits. &#160;

We have successfully completed a multi-dose PK dose selection study in pregnant women. The objective of the multi-dose PK selection study was to assess HPC blood levels in order to identify the appropriate LPCN 1107 Phase 3 dose. The multi-dose PK dose selection study was an open-label, four-period, four-treatment, randomized, single and multiple dose, PK study in pregnant women of three dose levels of LPCN 1107 and the injectable HPC (Makena). Results from this study demonstrated that average steady state HPC levels (C avg 0-24) were comparable or higher for all three LPCN 1107 doses than for injectable HPC. Additionally, HPC levels as a function of daily dose were linear for the three LPCN 1107 doses. Also unlike the injectable HPC, steady state exposure was achieved for all three LPCN 1107 doses within seven days. The approved HPC injectable product is a single fixed dose product that does not allow for dose adjustments. Additionally, LPCN 1107 has completed a proof-of-concept PK study in healthy pregnant women as well as a proof-of-concept PK study in healthy non-pregnant women. The studies were designed to determine the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of LPCN 1107 relative to an IM HPC, as well as safety and tolerability, in healthy pregnant and non-pregnant female volunteers. Results of these studies confirmed our pre-clinical data and suggest meaningful drug levels of HPC can be obtained after oral administration. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report in the literature showing HPC oral bioavailability comparable to intramuscular injection. LPCN 1107 has also completed a 28-day repeated dose toxicity and toxicokinetics study in dogs. We plan to request an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the second quarter of 2016.

&#160;

The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to LPCN 1107 based on a major contribution to patient care. Orphan designation qualifies Lipocine for various development incentives, including tax credits for qualified clinical testing, and a waiver of the prescription drug user fee when we file our NDA.

&#160; 

Manufacturing Agreement 

&#160; 

On March 3, 2016, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing Services and Supply Agreement (the &#8220;Manufacturing Agreement&#8221;) with M.W. Encap Ltd. (&#8220;Encap&#8221;), a United Kingdom based contract manufacturer, a division of Capsugel Dosage Form Solutions. Pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement, Encap has agreed to manufacture and supply bulk commercial quantities of LPCN 1021. From the effective date of the Manufacturing Agreement through the fifth anniversary of the date that FDA approval is obtained for the sale and marketing of LPCN 1021 in the United States unless earlier terminated, we have agreed to purchase a minimum of LPCN 1021 on an annual basis from Encap on the basis of a 12 month rolling commercial forecast in which the first 3 months of each rolling forecast are binding on us. Such forecast may be subsequently increased or decreased by us pursuant to the terms of the Manufacturing Agreement.

&#160;

In general, we may terminate the agreement for any reason prior to production of a defined minimum amount of LPCN 1021 upon payment of a cancellation fee. Thereafter, we may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement without incurring any fees or costs upon 90 days written notice or immediately if Encap is not able to meet our reasonable requirements of LPCN 1021. We and Encap may each terminate the Manufacturing Agreement upon a material breach of the Manufacturing Agreement by the other party, so long as the other party has not cured such breach within a defined period after written notice of the breach by the non-breaching party or in the event the other party becomes insolvent or goes into bankruptcy, liquidation or receivership. Encap may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement if we have not placed a firm order for LPCN 1021 within a defined period of time from the date of FDA approval of LPCN 1021. Additionally, Encap may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement without cause upon the provision of written notice within a defined period of time advance written notice.

&#160;

Additionally we entered into an Agreement for the Manufacture of Testosterone Undecanoate Liquid Fill Capsules and the Conduct of an ICH Stability Study in Support of Product Registration with Encap pursuant to which Encap manufactured and supplied to us a total of six lots of LPCN 1021 capsules under current good manufacturing practices. These lots were used in Lipocine&#8217;s Phase 3 study for LPCN 1021. Under the agreement, Encap is also conducting an International Conference on Harmonisation stability program on all six capsule lots in support of our NDA filing for LPCN 1021. If Encap is unable to produce sufficient capsules for our future clinical trials or to support demand for LPCN 1021 if it becomes commercially available, our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected.

Drug Delivery Technologies for Lipophilic Drug Substances 

&#160; 

LPCN 1021 is an oral formulation of the lipophilic prodrug testosterone undecanoate for convenient twice daily dosing, utilizing our proprietary technology for improved delivery of lipophilic therapeutic agents. Our patent portfolio is directed to various types of compositions and methods for delivery of lipophilic drugs, which are drugs that are soluble in lipids. As of March 9, 2016, we otherwise own or control 11 issued U.S. patents, 37 pending U.S. patent applications, 18 issued foreign patents, 43 pending foreign patent applications and 5 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#8220;PCT&#8221;) applications. Of the above, we have 7 issued U.S. patents, 24 pending U.S. patent applications, 14 issued foreign patents, 6 pending foreign patent applications and 2 PCT applications relating to various aspects of LPCN 1021.

&#160;

We also hold license rights in fields other than cough and cold, to 2 U.S. patents and 2 U.S. applications (and related foreign patents and applications) that we previously assigned to Spriaso LLC, which could be possibly used with future product candidates.

&#160;

Our issued U.S. Patent No. 6,267,985 covers pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutic agent solubilized in a triglyceride, and it is expected to expire in 2019. We have corresponding patents in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. These corresponding foreign patents are all expected to expire in 2020. Our issued U.S. Patents No. 6,569,463 and 6,923,988 cover various aspects of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a hydrophobic active ingredient admixed with a hydrophilic surfactant and other components (for example, a lipophilic additive). These issued patents are expected to expire in 2019 and 2020, respectively, and if pending U.S. applications were to issue as patents, their expected expiration would be in 2019. We have corresponding patents in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, which are expected to expire in 2020.

&#160;

We have 2 issued US patents (U.S. Patent No. 8,865,695 and U.S. Patent No. 8,778,922), 2 pending U.S. patent applications, one issued patent in each of Canada, Japan and Mexico and 6 corresponding foreign patent applications (one each in Europe, Hong Kong, Australia, Brazil, India and Japan) directed to oral pharmaceutical compositions comprising a testosterone ester and methods of their use. These patents and applications, if they issue, are expected to expire in 2029 in the U.S. and 2030 in foreign jurisdictions. The Australian application was being opposed by Clarus, Inc. Clarus and Lipocine have reached a settlement with regards to the Australian opposition.

&#160;

We have 2 pending U.S. patent applications, 3 foreign patents (one each in Australia, Canada and New Zealand) directed to oral dosage forms comprising a drug, a solubilizer, and a release modulator. The pending U.S. patent applications, if they issue, are expected to expire as early as 2023, and the foreign patents are expected to expire in 2026.

&#160;

We have pending U.S. patent applications directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a sex hormone with corresponding foreign patents in Australia, Canada and Japan. These applications, if they issue, are expected to expire in 2019, while the foreign patents are expected to expire in 2024.

&#160;

We have 2 issued patents and 5 pending U.S. applications directed to high strength capsule formulations of testosterone undecanoate and methods of their use. These patents and applications, if they issue, are expected to expire in 2030.

&#160;

We have 3 pending U.S. patent applications related to solid dosage forms that have testosterone undecanoate. These applications, if they issue, are expected to expire in 2030.

&#160;

We currently do not have patent protection for LPCN 1021 in many countries, including large territories such as India, Russia, and China, and we will be unable to prevent patent infringement in those countries unless we can file patent applications and obtain patents in those countries that cover LPCN 1021. We currently have 2 PCT applications pending which can be entered into the national phase of such countries to protect LPCN 1021. Additionally, the 7 U.S. patents that could be listed in the FDA Orange Book for LPCN 1021 are expected to expire in 2019, 2020, 2029 and 2030. If we are marketing the LPCN 1021 product at the time the patents expire and have no other issued U.S. patents covering the product, then we will lose certain advantages that come with FDA Orange Book listing of patents and will no longer be able to prevent others in the U.S. from practicing the inventions claimed by the three patents.

&#160;

US Patent No. 8,951,996 and 3 pending U.S. patent applications with corresponding counterpart applications filed in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Africa (granted) and South Korea are related to our LPOCN 1107 product candidate.

The U.S. patent applications, if they issue, are expected to expire as early as 2029, and the foreign patent applications if they issue, are expected to expire as early as 2034.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We expect to file new patent applications in the future in an attempt to further cover to various aspects of our products and product development.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

The Regulatory Process for Drug Development 

&#160; 

The production and manufacture of our product candidates and our research and development activities are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities around the world. In the United States, drugs and products are subject to regulation by the FDA. There are other comparable agencies in Europe and other parts of the world. Regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products. Applicable legislation requires licensing of manufacturing and contract research facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, governmental review and/or approval of results prior to marketing therapeutic products. Additionally, adherence to good laboratory practices, or GLP, good clinical practices, or GCP, during clinical testing and good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, during production is required. The system of new drug approval in the United States is generally considered to be the most rigorous in the world and is described in further detail below under &#8220;United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process.&#8221;

&#160; 

United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process 

&#160; 

In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. The testing, production, sale, and promotion of pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

&#160;

It takes many years for a typical experimental drug to go from concept to approval. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:

&#160;

&#8226; Completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies. The latter often conducted according to GLPs or other applicable regulations, as well as synthesis and drug formulation development leading ultimately to clinical drug supplies manufactured according to current cGMPs;

&#160;

&#8226; Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (&#8220;IND&#8221;), which must be submitted to the FDA and become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the United States;

&#160;

&#8226; Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA&#8217;s current GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;

&#160;

&#8226; Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) for a new pharmaceutical product;

&#160;

&#8226; Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity;

&#160;

&#8226; Potential FDA audit of the preclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and

&#160;

&#8226; FDA review and approval of the NDA.

&#160;

The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and FDA approval is inherently uncertain.

&#160; 

Preclinical Studies : Prior to preclinical studies, a research phase takes place which involves demonstration of target and function, design, screening and synthesis of agonists or antagonists. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to evaluate efficacy and activity, toxic effects, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the pharmaceutical product candidate and to provide evidence of the safety, bioavailability and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate in animals. The conduct of the preclinical safety evaluations must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The results of the formal IND-enabling preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature as well as the comprehensive descriptions of proposed human clinical studies, are then submitted as part of the IND application to the FDA.

&#160;

&#160;

The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the IND on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be certain that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such clinical trial.

&#160; 

Clinical Trials : Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA if conducted under a U.S. IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA&#8217;s GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.

&#160;

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

Phase 1 Clinical Trials : Phase 1 clinical trials are usually first-in-man trials, take approximately one to two years to complete and are generally conducted on a small number of healthy human subjects to evaluate the drug&#8217;s activity, schedule and dose, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. However, in the case of life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, the initial Phase 1 testing may be done in patients with the disease. These trials typically take longer to complete and may provide insights into drug activity.

&#160; 

Phase 2 Clinical Trials : Phase 2 clinical trials can take approximately one to three years to complete and are carried out on a relatively small to moderate number of patients (as compared to Phase 3) in a specific indication. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated to preliminarily assess efficacy, to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to determine optimal dose, regimens, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and dose response relationships. This phase also provides additional safety data and serves to identify possible common short-term side effects and risks in a larger group of patients. Phase 2 clinical trials sometimes include randomization of patients.

&#160; 

Phase 3 Clinical Trials : Phase 3 clinical trials take approximately two to five years to complete and involve tests on a much larger population of patients (several hundred to several thousand patients) suffering from the targeted condition or disease. These studies usually include randomization of patients and blinding of both patients and investigators at geographically dispersed test sites (multi-center trials). These trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety and are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications.

&#160;

Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval.

&#160;

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or for any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety and monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s or ethics committee&#8217;s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

&#160;

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

U.S. Pharmaceutical Review and Approval Process 

&#160; 

New Drug Application : Upon completion of pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, the sponsor assembles all the product development, preclinical and clinical data along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, and submits it to the FDA as part of an NDA. The submission or application is then reviewed by the regulatory body for approval to market the product. This process takes eight months to one year to complete. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160; 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

&#160;

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor&#8217;s product for the same indication or disease.

&#160;

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160; 

Any pharmaceutical products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with the FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product&#8217;s approved labeling (known as &#8220;off-label use&#8221;), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with the FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties.

&#160;

The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.

&#160; 

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

&#160; 

In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including, but not limited, to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other divisions of the United States government, including the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, if a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal or state healthcare programs, our company, including our sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, among others, must comply with federal healthcare laws, including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, false claims laws, civil monetary penalties laws, healthcare fraud and false statement provisions and data privacy and security provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and any analogous state laws. If a drug product is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, or OBRA, and the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA. Among other things, OBRA requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates on prescription drugs to state Medicaid programs and empowers states to negotiate rebates on pharmaceutical prices, which may result in prices for our future products that will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, PPACA, substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, PPACA establishes: an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. There may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, in the future, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of drug products. If drug products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements may apply.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including fraud and abuse, privacy and transparency laws.

&#160; 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payers often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such treatments. Third-party payers are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which has resulted in lower average selling prices. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of insurers and managed care organizations, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third party reimbursement may not be available for our products to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.

&#160;

The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payers&#8217; drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them.

The United States Orphan Drug Act encourages the development of orphan drugs, which are intended to treat &#8220;rare diseases or conditions&#8221; within the meaning of this Act (i.e., those that affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States). The provisions of the Act are intended to stimulate the research, development and approval of products that treat rare diseases. Orphan Drug Designation provides a sponsor with several potential benefits: (1) sponsors may be granted seven years of marketing exclusivity after approval of the orphan-designated indication for the drug product; (2) sponsors are granted U.S. tax incentives for clinical research; (3) the FDA&#8217;s office of orphan products development co-ordinates research study design assistance for sponsors of drugs for rare diseases; and (4) grant funding can be obtained to defray costs of qualified clinical testing.

Priority Review 

&#160; 

Priority Review is a designation for an NDA after it has been submitted to the FDA for review. Reviews for NDAs are designated as either &#8220;Standard&#8221; or &#8220;Priority.&#8221; A Standard designation sets the target date for completing all aspects of a review and the FDA taking an action on 90% of applications (i.e., approve or not approve) at 12 months after the date it was submitted for drugs considered new molecular entities and at 10 months after the date it was submitted for drugs considered non new molecular entities. A Priority designation sets the target date for the FDA action on 90% of applications at eight months after submission submitted for drugs considered new molecular entities and at 6 months after submission for drugs considered non new molecular entities. A Priority designation is intended for those products that address unmet medical needs.

&#160;

Accelerated Approval 

&#160; 

Accelerated Approval or Subpart H Approval is a program described in the NDA regulations that is intended to make promising products for life threatening diseases available on the basis of evidence of effect on a surrogate endpoint prior to formal demonstration of patient benefit. A surrogate marker is a measurement intended to substitute for the clinical measurement of interest, usually prolongation of survival in oncology that is considered likely to predict patient benefit. The approval that is granted may be considered a provisional approval with a written commitment to complete clinical studies that formally demonstrate patient benefit.
