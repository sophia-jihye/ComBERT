 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Appliance Recycling Centers of America, Inc. and Subsidiaries (&#8220;we,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;ARCA&#8221;) are in the business of selling and recycling major household appliances in North America. We sell new major household appliances in the United States though our chain of eighteen Company-owned retail stores operating under the name ApplianceSmart &#174; . We also provide turnkey appliance recycling and replacement services for utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs through our subsidiaries ARCA Recycling, Inc. and ARCA Canada Inc. In addition, we have a 50% interest in a joint venture, ARCA Advanced Processing, LLC (&#8220;AAP&#8221;), which recycles appliances generated from twelve states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States principally for General Electric Company (&#8220;GE&#8221;) acting through its GE Appliances business component. 

&#160; 

As a leading retailer and recycler of major household appliances, we generate revenues from: 

&#160; 

1. 

Retail sales of appliances at our ApplianceSmart stores. 

2. 

Fees charged for collecting and recycling appliances for utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs. 

3. 

Fees charged for recycling and replacing old appliances with new ENERGY STAR &#174; appliances for energy efficiency programs sponsored by electric and gas utilities. 

4. 

Sale of byproduct materials, such as metals, from appliances we recycle, including appliances processed at our joint venture, AAP, and collected through our ApplianceSmart stores. 

5. 

Sale of carbon offsets created by the destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants acquired through various recycling programs. 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Minnesota in 1983, although through our predecessors we began our appliance retail and recycling business in 1976. Our principal office is located at 175 Jackson Avenue North, Suite 102, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55343-4565. References herein to our Company include our operating subsidiaries. (See &#8220;Exhibits.&#8221;) 

&#160; 

Industry Background 

&#160; 

In the United States, more than 850 million major household appliances are currently in use. These appliances include: 

Refrigerators 

&#160; 

Clothes washers 

Freezers 

&#160; 

Clothes dryers 

Ranges/ovens 

&#160; 

Room air conditioners 

Dishwashers 

&#160; 

Dehumidifiers 

Microwave ovens 

&#160; 

Humidifiers 

&#160; 

Improper disposal of old appliances threatens air, ground and water resources because many types of major appliances contain substances that can damage the environment. These harmful materials include: 

&#160; 

1. 

Polychlorinated biphenyls (&#8220;PCBs&#8221;), which have toxic effects on humans and animals. Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) banned production of PCBs in 1979, it allowed manufacturers to use their remaining inventories of PCB-containing components. Consequently, some old room air conditioners and microwave ovens have capacitors that contain PCBs, which can contaminate groundwater when released. 

2. 

Mercury, which easily enters the body through absorption, inhalation or ingestion, potentially causing neurological damage. Mercury-containing components may be found in freezers, washers and ranges. 

3. 

Chlorofluorocarbon ("CFC"), hydrochlorofluorocarbon, and hydrofluorocarbon refrigerants (collectively, &#8220;Refrigerants&#8221;), which cause long-term damage to the earth&#8217;s ozone layer and may contribute to global climate change. Refrigerators, freezers, room air conditioners and dehumidifiers commonly contain Refrigerants. 

4. 

CFCs having a very high ozone-depletion potential that may also be used as blowing agents in the polyurethane foam insulation of refrigerators and freezers. 

5. 

Other materials, such as oil, that are harmful when released into the environment. 

The U.S. federal government requires the recovery of Refrigerants upon appliance disposal and also regulates the management of hazardous materials found in appliances. Most state and local governments have also enacted laws affecting how their residents dispose of unwanted appliances. For example, many areas restrict landfills and scrap metal processors from accepting appliances 

unless the units have been processed to remove environmentally harmful materials. As a result, old appliances usually cannot be discarded directly through ordinary solid waste systems. 

&#160; 

In addition to these solid waste management and environmental issues, energy conservation is another compelling reason for proper disposal of old appliances. The U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s updated appliance energy efficiency standards that took effect in September 2014 require new refrigerators to be 25 to 30 percent more efficient than those manufactured only one year earlier. Refrigerators manufactured today use about one-fifth as much electricity as units made in the mid-1970s. 

While new refrigerators can save a significant amount of energy in the home, more than 25 percent of all U.S. households have a second refrigerator in the basement or garage. These units are typically 15-25 years old and consume about 750 to 1500 kilowatt-hours per year, driving electric bills up by more than $150 annually per household. 

&#160; 

Utilities have become important participants in dealing with energy inefficient appliances as a way of reducing peak demand on their systems and avoiding the capital and environmental costs of adding new generating capacity. To encourage the permanent removal of energy inefficient appliances from use, many electric utility companies sponsor programs through which their residential customers can retire working refrigerators, freezers and room air conditioners. Utility companies often provide assistance and incentives for consumers to discontinue use of a surplus appliance or to replace their old, inefficient appliances with newer, more efficient models. To help accomplish this, some utilities offer appliance replacement programs for some segments of their customers, through which older model kitchen and laundry appliances are recycled and new highly efficient ENERGY STAR &#174; units are installed. 

&#160; 

The EPA has been supportive of efforts by electric utilities and other entities that sponsor appliance recycling programs to ensure that the collected units are managed in an environmentally sound manner. In October 2006, the EPA launched the Responsible Appliance Disposal (&#8220;RAD&#8221;) Program, a voluntary partnership program designed to help protect the ozone layer and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Through the program, RAD partners use best practices to recover ozone-depleting chemicals and other harmful materials from old refrigerators, freezers, room air conditioners and dehumidifiers. In 2010, ApplianceSmart became the first independent retailer in the country to become a RAD partner. Because of our appliance recycling expertise, we were active participants in helping to design the RAD program and currently submit annual reports to the EPA to document the environmental benefits of our utility customers that are RAD partners have achieved through their recycling programs. 

Company Background 

&#160; 

We started our business in 1976 as a used appliance retailer that reconditioned old appliances to sell in our stores. Under contracts with national and regional retailers of new appliances, such as Sears and Montgomery Ward, we collected the replaced appliance from the retailer's customer&#8217;s residence when one of their stores delivered a new appliance in the Minneapolis/St. Paul, Miami or Atlanta market. Any old appliances that we could not sell in our stores were sold to scrap metal processors. 

&#160; 

In the late 1980s, stricter environmental regulations began to affect the disposal of unwanted appliances, and we were no longer able to take appliances that contained hazardous components to a scrap metal processor. At that time, we began to develop systems and equipment to remove the harmful materials so that metal processors would accept the appliance shells for processing. We then offered our services for disposing of appliances in an environmentally sound manner to appliance manufacturers and retailers, waste hauling companies, rental property managers, local governments and the public. 

&#160; 

Appliance Recycling for Energy Efficiency Programs 

&#160; 

In 1989, we began contracting with electric utility companies to provide turnkey appliance recycling services to support their energy conservation efforts. Since that time, we have provided our services to more than 325 utilities throughout North America. 

We currently have contracts to recycle, or to replace and recycle, appliances for approximately 144 utilities across North America. 

&#160; 

In the past several years, we have seen continued interest from sponsors of energy efficiency initiatives that recognize the effectiveness of recycling and replacing energy inefficient appliances. We are aggressively pursuing electric and gas utilities, public housing authorities and energy efficiency management companies going forward and expect that we will continue to submit proposals for various new appliance recycling and replacement programs accordingly. However, for a variety of reasons, we still have a limited ability to project revenues from utility programs. We cannot predict recycling volumes or if we will be successful in obtaining new contracts in 2016. 

&#160; 

ApplianceSmart 

&#160; 

ApplianceSmart operates eighteen stores: six in the Minneapolis/St. Paul market; one in Rochester, Minn.; one in St. Cloud, Minn.; four in the Columbus, Ohio market; four in the Atlanta, Georgia market; and two in the San Antonio, Texas market. We are a major household appliance retailer with two product categories: One consists of typical and commonly available, innovative appliances. The other consists of affordable value-priced, niche offerings such as close-outs, factory overruns, discontinued models and special-buy appliances, including out-of-carton merchandise and others. One example of a special-buy appliance may be due to manufacturer product redesign, in which a current model is updated to include a few new features and is then assigned a new model number. Because the major manufacturers&#8212;primarily Whirlpool, General Electric and Electrolux&#8212;ship only the latest models to retailers, a large quantity of the previous models often remain in the manufacturers' inventories. Special-buy appliances typically are not integrated into the manufacturers&#8217; normal distribution channels and require a different method of management, which we provide. 

&#160; 

For many years, manufacturers relied on small appliance dealers to buy these specialty products to sell in their stores. However, today small retailers are struggling to compete with large appliance chains as the ten largest retailers of major appliances account for more than 75% of the sales volume. At the same time, expansion of big-box retailers that sell appliances has created an increase in the number of special-buy units, further straining the traditional outlet system for these appliances. Because these special-buy appliances have value, manufacturers and retailers need an efficient management system to recover their worth. 

Manufacturer Supply 

&#160; 

We have entered into contracts for purchasing appliances that we sell in our ApplianceSmart stores or provide for utility appliance replacement programs. These contracts, which have been extended through 2016, are with the following six major manufacturers: 

&#160; 

1. 

Bosch 

2. 

Electrolux 

3. 

General Electric 

4. 

LG 

5. 

Samsung 

6. 

Whirlpool 

&#160; 

There are no guarantees on the number of units any of the manufacturers will sell us. However, we believe purchases from these six manufacturers will provide an adequate supply of high-quality appliances for our ApplianceSmart stores and our appliance replacement programs. 

&#160; 

Key components of our current agreements include: 

&#160; 

1. 

We have no guarantees for the number or type of appliances that we have to purchase. 

2. 

The agreements may be terminated by either party with 30 days&#8217; prior written notice. 

3. 

We have agreed to indemnify certain manufacturers for certain claims, allegations or losses concerning the appliances we sell. 

Regional Processing Centers 

&#160; 

On October 21, 2009, we entered into an Appliance Sales and Recycling Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with GE acting through its GE Consumer &#38; Industrial business (now referred to as GE Appliances). Under the Agreement, GE sells all of its recyclable appliances generated from twelve states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States to us, and we collect, process and recycle such recyclable appliances. The Agreement requires that we will only recycle, and will not sell for re-use or resale, the recyclable appliances purchased from GE. We established a regional processing center (&#8220;RPC&#8221;) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at which the recyclable appliances are processed. The term of the Agreement is for a period of six years from the first date of collection of recyclable appliances, which was March 31, 2010. The contract with GE will expire on April 30, 2016 and is subject to a 90 day renewal option at the option of GE. If at any renewal date GE communicates that they do not intend to exercise their renewal option, the contract with GE will only continue for 30 days. 

&#160; 

In connection with the Agreement mentioned above, we entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with 4301 Operations, LLC, (&#8220;4301&#8221;) to establish and operate an RPC. 4301 has significant experience in the recycling of major household appliances and they contributed their existing business to the joint venture. Under the Joint Venture Agreement, the parties formed a new entity known as ARCA Advanced Processing, LLC (&#8220;AAP&#8221;) and each party has a 50% interest in AAP. We contributed $2.0 million to 

the joint venture and 4301 contributed their equipment and existing business to the joint venture. The joint venture commenced operations on February 8, 2010. 

&#160; 

The Agreement required us to purchase and install a UNTHA Recycling Technology ("URT") materials recovery system, for which we are the exclusive North American distributor, to enhance the capabilities of the RPC in Philadelphia. We completed the installation of the URT materials recovery system in the third quarter of 2011. The URT materials recovery system recovers approximately 95 percent of the foam insulation from refrigerators; reduces typical landfill waste of the refrigerator by 83 percent by weight; lowers greenhouse gas and ozone-depleting substance emissions recovered from insulating foam compared with what typically happens in the industry today; and recovers high-quality plastics, aluminum, copper, steel and pelletized foam from refrigerators that can be used to make new products or for other beneficial use. 

In February 2015, AAP was awarded the highly respected and internationally recognized Recycling Industry Operating Standard&#174; (&#8220;RIOS&#8221;) certification. RIOS is a third-party accredited certification program that integrates quality, environmental, health and safety requirements from ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 into one comprehensive management system. RIOS certification is a rigorous undertaking, and it is recognized as an international mark of excellence for recycling companies. Our AAP operation in Philadelphia, where we recycle 500,000 to 600,000 appliances annually using the latest state-of-the-art recycling processes and techniques, has demonstrated a powerful commitment to recycling processes that achieve measurable and continual improvement in quality, environmental, health and safety performance. AAP is the first appliance recycling facility in the United States to attain the coveted RIOS certification. 

&#160; 

Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

ApplianceSmart, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary formed through a corporate reorganization in July 2011 to hold our business of selling new major household appliances through a chain of Company-owned retail stores. ARCA Canada Inc., a Canadian corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary formed in September 2006 to provide turnkey recycling and replacement services for electric utility energy efficiency programs. ARCA Recycling, Inc., a California corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary formed in November 1991 to provide turnkey recycling and appliance replacement services for energy efficiency programs. 

&#160; 

ARCA Advanced Processing, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, is a variable interest entity that we consolidate in our financial statements. AAP was formed in October 2009 to operate a regional processing and recycling center and commenced operations on February 8, 2010. 

&#160; 

Growth Strategy 

&#160; 

In November 2015, JACO Environmental, our largest competitor in the utility energy efficiency space went into receivership. This was a surprise within the industry and resulted in a considerable spike in call volume from former and prospective customers that desired to respond to their ratepayers' concerns related to open orders and from utility appliance recycling program managers that desired to restart their programs. We have been responding to requests for proposal and entering into new contracts with utility customers. We have also been working with our existing customers to adjust pricing on programs to address the loss in revenues that we have experienced and continue to experience as a result of the significant declines and low values of the byproducts we sell, including ferrous and non-ferrous metals. 

We continue to see interest from sponsors of energy efficiency programs across the country that recognize the effectiveness of recycling energy inefficient appliances, and in some cases, replacing inefficient appliances with new, highly efficient ENERGY STAR &#174; models. We believe appliance replacement programs will continue to expand, and we are continuing to aggressively pursue this segment of customers in 2016. We expect that we will continue to meet with sponsors of appliance recycling and replacement programs and submit proposals highlighting our comprehensive service options. 

We are also tracking a growth opportunity in the rollout of state plans to cut carbon emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. In June 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under President Obama&#8217;s Climate Action Plan and Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act, released state-specific goals to reduce nationwide carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. Each state has the flexibility to choose how to meet the goal through a variety of measures that include demand-side energy efficiency programs, improved power plant operations and zero- and low-emitting power sources. Our appliance recycling and replacement programs have proven effective in reducing residential energy consumption while protecting the environment from greenhouse gases emitted through improper appliance disposal. 

&#160; 

AAP continues to focus on refining and improving our business with GE at our Philadelphia recycling facility in order to position AAP to respond to what we believe will be strong opportunities for expansion in future years with GE and other potential partners. 

We completed the installation of the URT materials recovery system during the third quarter of 2011. We continue to make additional improvements at AAP to improve operational efficiency and plan to continue to evaluate opportunities to increase labor efficiencies and further streamline operations in 2016. The current market conditions for the commodities that we sell have caused us to re-evaluate the volume of activity that we are processing with GE. We continue to adjust our relationship with GE and other suppliers of materials to ensure that we are operating the AAP facility in the most cost effective manner. In the event that commodity prices recover, we are poised to expand our volume of business that we process for these suppliers when the benefits of processing appliances exceed the freight costs to AAP. 

&#160; 

We may consider opening new ApplianceSmart stores in markets in which we currently have operations to benefit from operational and marketing efficiencies of scale. Although we are not currently considering expansion to new markets in the United States, we would evaluate demographic, economic and financial information as well as the facility and proposed lease terms when considering any new store location. 

Customers and Source of Supply 

&#160; 

We offer reverse logistics services to manufacturers and retailers needing an efficient way to manage appliances that fall outside their normal distribution and sales channels. We also provide services for electric utility companies and other sponsors of energy efficiency initiatives that offer their customers appliance recycling and replacement programs as energy conservation measures. 

&#160; 

Appliance Manufacturers : &#160; We work with appliance manufacturers, including Bosch, Electrolux, General Electric, LG, Samsung and Whirlpool, to acquire the appliances we sell in our ApplianceSmart stores. We purchase new, special-buy appliances, such as discontinued models, out-of-carton units and factory overruns, and sell them at a significant discount to full retail prices. In addition, our participation in a national buying cooperative enables us to purchase the latest models of new appliances to fill out our product mix. 

&#160; 

Although we believe our current sources for appliances are adequate to supply our retail stores and allow us to grow our sales, we face the risk that one or more of these sources could be lost. 

Utility Companies : &#160; We contract with utility companies and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs to provide a full range of appliance recycling and replacement services to help them achieve their energy savings goals. The contracts usually have terms of one to three years, with provisions for renewal at the option of the utility. Under some contracts, we manage all aspects, including advertising of the appliance recycling or replacement program. Under other contracts, we provide only specified services, such as collection and recycling. 

&#160; 

Our contracts with utility customers prohibit us from repairing and selling appliances or appliance parts we receive through their programs. Because the intent of these programs is to conserve electricity, we have instituted tracking and auditing procedures to assure our customers that those appliances do not return to use. 

&#160; 

Our pricing for energy efficiency program contracts is on a per-appliance basis and depends upon several factors, including: 

&#160; 

1. 

Total number of appliances expected to be processed and/or replaced. 

2. 

Length of the contract term. 

3. 

Specific services the utility requires us to provide. 

4. 

Market factors, including labor rates and transportation costs. 

5. 

Anticipated revenue associated with the sale of recycled appliance byproducts. 

6. 

Competitive bidding scenarios. 

&#160; 

Company Operations 

&#160; 

We provide a full range of appliance recycling support services for energy efficiency programs in North America. We also purchase major appliances, primarily from appliance manufacturers, to sell through our ApplianceSmart stores. 

&#160; 

Many of the appliances we receive from manufacturers are still in the factory carton and ready to sell. Other appliances need repair or cosmetic work before we deliver them to our ApplianceSmart stores. All appliances we sell are new, under factory warranty and covered by a 100% money-back guarantee. We also offer extended warranties, appliance delivery, factory-trained technician service and free recycling of customers&#8217; replaced appliances. 

&#160; 

Appliances that do not meet our quality standards for sale at our ApplianceSmart stores and appliances collected through utility customers&#8217; energy conservation programs or GE must be recycled to prevent re-use. We process and recycle these units using environmentally sound systems and techniques. 

&#160; 

In our recycling operations, our Company-trained technicians first inspect and categorize each appliance to identify the types of hazardous materials, if any, it contains. We then process the appliances to remove and manage the environmentally hazardous substances according to federal, state and local regulations. Plastics and other recyclable components are managed by materials recyclers, and we deliver the processed appliance shells to local scrap processing facilities, where they shred and recycle the metals. 

At our Philadelphia recycling center, which is operated through the joint venture AAP, we recycle appliances for GE and other customers including certain utility customers with proximity to AAP. We process the appliances according to the procedures described above to remove environmentally damaging components and substances. In the third quarter of 2011, we began processing refrigerators and freezers with our URT system to recover the CFCs in polyurethane foam insulation that cause global warming and ozone depletion. 

&#160; 

We are aggressively pursuing additional utility customers, but have a limited ability to project revenues from new utility programs in 2016 and thereafter. We cannot predict recycling or replacement volumes. However, we have been successful to date in obtaining new contracts in 2016 with new and former customers across the country. 

Principal Products and Services 

&#160; 

We generate revenues from three sources: retail, recycling and byproduct, including carbon offsets. Retail revenues are generated through the sale of appliances at our ApplianceSmart stores. Recycling revenues are generated by charging fees for collecting and recycling appliances for utilities and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs and through the sale of new ENERGY STAR &#174; appliances to utility companies for installation in the homes of a specific segment of their customers. Byproduct revenues are generated by selling scrap materials, such as metal and plastics, from appliances we collect and recycle, including those from our ApplianceSmart stores and those processed at AAP. Carbon offset revenues are created by the destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants acquired through various recycling programs, from our ApplianceSmart stores and through processing of refrigerators and freezers at AAP. 

The table below reflects the percentage of total revenues from each source for the past two fiscal years. See also &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221;

During fiscal years 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we operated two reportable segments: retail and recycling. The retail segment is comprised of sales generated through our ApplianceSmart stores. Our recycling segment includes all fees charged for collecting, recycling and installing appliances for utilities and other customers and includes byproduct revenue, which is generated primarily through the recycling of appliances. In 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we consolidated AAP in our financial statements. Sales generated by AAP are included in byproduct revenues in our recycling segment. Financial information about our segments is included in &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Note 13 of &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.&#8221; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We use a variety of methods to promote awareness of our products and services. We believe that we are recognized as a leader in the recycling industry and in special-buy appliance retailing. 

&#160; 

Our ApplianceSmart concept includes establishing large showrooms in metropolitan locations where we offer consumers a selection of hundreds of appliances at each of our stores. Our visual branding consists of ample display of product, manufacturers&#8217; signage and custom-designed ApplianceSmart materials. We advertise our stores through television, radio, print media, social media and direct mail. Through www.ApplianceSmart.com, consumers can also search our inventory and purchase appliances online. 

&#160; 

We market our appliance recycling and replacement services to utility companies and other sponsors of energy efficiency programs by contacting prospective end user customers directly, delivering educational presentations at conferences for energy efficiency professionals, participating in utility industry trade shows, networking with key affiliates of electric power and environmental associations, and promoting on our corporate website at www.ARCAInc.com. We submit sales proposals for our services to interested parties and in response to requests for bid. 

&#160; 

Seasonality &#160; 

We experience some seasonality in retail revenues, with revenues in the second and third calendar quarters being slightly higher than revenues in the first and fourth calendar quarters. 

&#160; 

Promotional activities for programs in which the utility sponsor conducts all advertising are generally strong during the second and third calendar quarters, leading to higher customer demand for services during that time period. As a result, we experience a surge in business during the second and third calendar quarters, which generally declines through the fourth and first calendar quarters until advertising activities resume. 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our retail competition comes mainly from new-appliance and other special-buy retailers. Each ApplianceSmart store competes with local and national retail appliance chains, as well as with independently owned retailers. Many of these retailers have been in business longer than us and may have significantly greater assets. 

&#160; 

Many factors, including obtaining adequate resources to create and support the infrastructure required to operate large-scale appliance recycling and replacement programs, affect competition in the industry. We generally compete for contracts with several other appliance recycling businesses, energy services management companies and new-appliance retailers. We also compete with small hauling or recycling companies based in the program&#8217;s service territory. Many of these companies, including used-appliance dealers that call themselves &#8220;appliance recyclers,&#8221; resell in the secondary market a percentage of the used appliances they accept for recycling. The unsalable units may not be properly processed to remove environmentally harmful materials because these companies do not have the capability to offer the full range of services we provide. 

&#160; 

We expect our primary competition for appliance recycling and replacement contracts with existing and new customers to come from a variety of sources, including: 

&#160; 

1. 

Existing recycling companies. 

2. 

Entrepreneurs entering the appliance recycling business. 

3. 

Management consultants. 

4. 

Major waste hauling companies. 

5. 

Scrap metal processors. 

6. 

National and regional new appliance retailers. 

&#160; 

In addition, utility companies and other customers may choose to provide all or some of the services required to operate their appliance recycling and replacement programs internally rather than contracting with outside vendors. We have no assurance that we will be able to compete profitably in any of our chosen markets. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Federal, state and local governments regulate appliance collection, recycling and sales activities. While some requirements apply nationwide, others vary by market. The many laws and regulations that affect appliance recycling include landfill disposal restrictions, hazardous waste management requirements and air quality standards. For example, the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act prohibit the venting of all Refrigerants while servicing or disposing of appliances. 

&#160; 

Each of our recycling facilities maintains the appropriate registrations, permits and licenses for operating at its location. We register our recycling centers as hazardous waste generators with the EPA and obtain all appropriate regional and local licenses for managing hazardous wastes. Licensed hazardous waste companies transport and recycle or dispose of the hazardous materials we generate. Our collection vehicles and our transportation employees are required to comply with all U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) licensing requirements. 

&#160; 

We have been recognized for our work in protecting the environment from the harmful effects of improper appliance disposal. In 2004, the EPA awarded us, along with our customer Southern California Edison Company (&#8220;SCE&#8221;), the Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award for the environmentally responsible manner in which we collect and dispose of appliances. In 2007, we were again recognized by the EPA with a Best of the Best Stratospheric Ozone Protection Award as part of an appliance recycling team responsible for &#8220;the most exceptional global contributions in the first two decades of the Montreal Protocol.&#8221; We were recognized by SCE as the sole recipient of the 2010 Environmental Excellence Award for our &#8220;exemplary support and service of SCE&#8217;s Appliance Recycling Program&#8221; and commitment to providing &#8220;the highest levels of performance and service to SCE and program participants while maintaining the strong values and ethics that exemplify a value-added supplier.&#8221; ARCA has provided services for SCE since 1994. 

&#160; 

In 2007, we became a founding reporter of The Climate Registry, an organization that provides information regarding the measurement and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions to various governmental and private agencies and businesses. 

In 2009, our then President and Chief Executive Officer, Edward R. (Jack) Cameron, was selected to represent the appliance recycling industry in the Climate Action Reserve&#8217;s 23-member workgroup that was tasked with developing the U.S. Ozone-Depleting Substances Project Protocol for the Destruction of Domestic High Global Warming Potential Ozone-Depleting Substances. The Climate Action Reserve is a national offsets program working to ensure integrity, transparency and financial value in the U.S. carbon market. The protocol was issued on February 3, 2010, and provides guidance to account for, report and verify greenhouse gas emission reductions associated with destruction of high global warming potential ozone-depleting substances that would have otherwise been released to the atmosphere, including those used in both foam and refrigerant applications. 

In January 2013, through the authority of the California Air Resources Board, California launched a greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) cap-and-trade program that will encompass 85% of the state&#8217;s emissions and affect all businesses operating in California by 2020. The first compliance period enforcing the GHG emissions limits for capped business sectors began January 1, 2013. Entities may meet up to eight percent of their compliance obligations with freely sold or traded offset credits, such as those created through the voluntary destruction of ozone-depleting refrigerants. We have been an active participant in California&#8217;s developing carbon offset market and anticipate increased involvement as the program expands.

Our retail stores obtain business licenses, sales tax licenses and permits required for their locations. Our delivery and service vehicles comply with all DOT licensing requirements. In addition, in 2010, ApplianceSmart became the first independent retailer in the country to partner with the EPA in the Responsible Appliance Disposal (&#8220;RAD&#8221;) Program. Through RAD, partners commit to employing best environmental practices to reduce emissions of ozone-depleting substances and greenhouse gases through the proper disposal of refrigeration appliances at end of life. RAD partners report program results to the EPA annually to help quantify climate protection efforts.

Although we believe that further governmental regulation of the appliance recycling industry could have a positive effect on us, we cannot predict the direction of future legislation. Under some circumstances, for example, further regulation could materially increase our operational costs. In addition, under some circumstances we may be subject to contingent liabilities because we handle hazardous materials. We believe we are in compliance with all government regulations regarding the handling of hazardous materials, and we have environmental insurance to mitigate the impact of any potential contingent liability.
