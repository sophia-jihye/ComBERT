&#8220; prospect &#8221; &#160; A property on which indications of oil or gas have been identified based on available seismic and geological information . 

&#8220;proved developed reserves&#8221; &#160; &#160; Pr oved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. 

&#8220;proved reserves&#8221; &#160; Those reserves which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible &#8212;from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations&#8212;prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced, or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project, within a reasonable time. 

The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes all of the following: 

a. 

The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any , and 

b. 

Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data. 

Reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when both of the following occur: 

a. 

Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based , and 

b. 

The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities. 

Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period before the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions. 

&#8220;proved undeveloped reserves&#8221; &#160; or &#8220;PUDs&#8221; &#160; Proved r eserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances. Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are schedule d to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time. Under no circumstances shall estimates of proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty. 

&#8220;reasonable certainty &#8221; I f deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90 percent probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of geoscience (geological, geophysical and geochemical) engineering, and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery with time, reasonably certain estimated ultimate recovery is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease. 

&#8220;recompletion&#8221; An o peration whereby a completion in one zone is abandoned in order to attempt a completion in a different zone within the existing wellbore. 

&#8220;reserves&#8221; Estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing required to implement the project. 

&#160;

&#8220;reservoir &#8221; A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible crude oil and/or natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs. 

&#8220;resource play &#8221; &#160; Ref ers to drilling programs targeted at regionally distributed oil or natural gas accumulations. Successful exploitation of these reservoirs is dependent upon new technologies such as horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracture stimulation to access large rock volumes in order to produce economic quantities of oil or natural gas. 

&#8220;royalty&#8221; The amount or fee paid to the owner of mineral rights, expressed as a percentage or fraction of gross income from crude oil or natural gas produced and sold , unencumbered by expenses relating to the drilling, completing or operating of the affected well. 

&#8220;royalty interest&#8221; An interest in an oil or natural gas property entitling the owner to shares of the crude oil or natural gas production free of costs of exploration, development and production operations.

Overview 

We are an independent oil and gas company engaged in development, production , acquisition and exploration activities primarily in the Rocky Mountains and Permian Basin regions of the United States. We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2003 in connection with our initial public offering. 

Since our inception in 1980, we have built a strong asset base and achieved steady growth through a combination of property acquisitions, development of proved reserves and exploration activities. Since 2006, however , we have increased our focus on organic drilling activity and on the development of previously acquired properties, specifically on projects that we believe provide an opportunity for repeatable successes and production growth, while continuing to selectively pursue acquisitions that complement our existing core properties , such as the acquisition of Kodiak Oil &#38; Gas Corp. (the &#8220;Kodiak Acquisition&#8221;) discussed below under &#8220;Acquisitions and Divestitures&#8221; . As a result of the sustained decline in crude oil prices during 2015 and continuing into 2016, we have significantly reduced our level of capital spending to more closely align with our cash flows generated from operations. We have also focused our drilling activity on projects that provide the highest rate of return. In addition, w e continually evaluate our portfolio and sell properties when we believe that the sales price realized will provide an above average rate of return for the property or when the property no longer matches the profile of properties we desire to own , such as the asset sales discussed below under &#8220;Acquisition s and Divestiture s &#8221;. We are currently exploring additional asset sales of non-core properties and anticipate further sales during 2016. 

As of December 31, 2015 , our estimated proved reserves totaled 820.6 MMBOE, representing a 5 % increase in our proved reserves since December 31, 2014 . Our 2015 average daily production was 163.2 MBOE/d and results in an average reserve life of approximately 13.8 years. 

The following table summarizes by core area, our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 , their corresponding pre-tax PV10% values, and our fourth quarter 2015 average daily production rates, as well as our company&#8217;s total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of December 31, 2015 :

_____________________ 

(1) 

Oil and gas reserve quantities and related discounted future net cash flows have been derived from an oil price of $50.28 per Bbl and a gas price of $2.58 per Mcf, which were calculated by using an average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month within the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 as required by current SEC and FASB guidelines. 

(2) 

Pre-tax PV10% may be considered a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC and is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Pre-tax PV10% is computed on the same basis as the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows but without deducting future income taxes. We believe pre-tax PV10% is a useful measure for investors for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. We further believe investors may utilize our pre-tax PV10% as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our proved reserves to other companies because many factors that are unique to each individual company impact the amount of future income taxes to be paid. Our management uses this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and gas properties and acquisitions. However, pre-tax PV10% is not a substitute for the standardized 

&#160;

measure of discounted future net cash flows. Our pre-tax PV10% and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of our proved oil, NGL and natural gas reserves. 

(3) 

Includes oil and gas properties located in Colorado, Montana and North Dakota. 

(4) 

Other primarily includes non-core oil and gas properties located in Colorado, Mississippi , North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming . 

During 2015 , we incurred $ 2.3 &#160; b illion in exploration and development (&#8220;E&#38;D&#8221;) expenditures , &#160; including $2.1 billion for the drilling of 540 gross ( 267.8 net) wells. Of these new wells, 265.8 (net) resulted in productive completions and 2.0 (net) were unsuccessful, yielding a 99 % success rate. 

As a result of the sustained decline in crude oil prices during 2015 and continuing into 2016, o ur 201 6 E&#38;D budget is $ 500 m illion , which represents a substantial decrease from 2015 . This E&#38;D budget also reflects the Company&#8217;s current plan to suspend completion operations beginning in the second quarter of 2016. We plan to incur the majority of our budgeted E&#38;D expenditures during the first half of 2016 as we complete projects that were initiated in 2015 and wind down our completion operations. We currently anticipate that our E&#38;D expenditures will total approximately $80 million per quarter during the second half of 2016. We expect to fund substantially all of our 201 6 E&#38;D budget using net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from property divestitures, cash on hand and, if necessary, borrowings under our credit facility. To the extent net cash provided by operating activities is higher or lower than currently anticipated, we would adjust our E&#38;D budget accordingly , enter into agreements with industry partners, divest certain oil and gas property interests or adjust borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as necessary. 

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

O ur significant acquisitions and divestitures during the last two years are summarized below . See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on these acquisitions and divestitures. 

201 5 Acquisitions. There were no significant acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

201 5 Divestitures. In December 2015, we completed the sale of a fresh water delivery system, a produced water gathering system and four saltwater disposal wells located in Weld County, Colorado, effective December 16, 2015, for a purchase price of $75 million (before closing adjustments). 

In June 2015, we completed the sale of our interests in certain non-core oil and gas wells, effective June 1, 2015, for a purchase price of $150 million (before closing adjustments) and resulting in a pre-tax loss on sale of $118 million. The properties included over 2,000 gross wells in 132 fields across 10 states. The properties had estimated proved reserves of 20.9 MMBOE as of December 31, 2014, representing 3% of our proved reserves as of that date, and generated 5.3 MBOE/d (or 3%) of our May 2015 average daily production. 

In April 2015, we completed the sale of our interests in certain non-core oil and gas wells, effective May 1, 2015, for a purchase price of $108 million (before closing adjustments) and resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $29 million. The properties are located in 187 fields across 14 states, and predominately consisted of assets that were previously included in the underlying properties of Whiting USA Trust I. The properties had estimated proved reserves of 8.9 MMBOE as of December 31, 2014, representing 1% of our total proved reserves as of that date, and generated 2.7 MBOE/d (or 2%) of our March 2015 average daily net production. 

Also during the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed several immaterial divestiture transactions for the sale of our interests in certain non-core oil and gas wells and undeveloped acreage, for a total purchase price of $176 million (before closing adjustments) and resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $28 million. These properties had estimated proved reserves of 23.4 MMBOE as of December 31, 2014, representing 3% of our total proved reserves as of that date. The properties generated a combined total of approximately 4.4 MBOE/d of average daily net production, based on production rates at each of the respective closing dates. 

2014 Acquisitions. On December 8, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Kodiak Oil &#38; Gas Corp. ( now known as Whiting Canadian Holding Company ULC, &#8220;Kodiak&#8221;) , &#160; whereby we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Kodiak. Pursuant to the terms of the Kodiak Acquisition agreement, Kodiak shareholders received 0.177 of a share of Whiting common stock in exchange for each share of Kodiak common stock they own ed. Total consideration for the Kodiak Acquisition was $1.8 billion, consisting of the 47,546,139 Whiting common shares issued at the market price of $37.25 per share on the date of issuance plus the fair value of Kodiak&#8217;s outstanding equity awards assumed by Whiting. The aggregate purchase price of the transaction was $4.3 billion, which includes the assumption of Kodiak&#8217;s outstanding debt of $2.5 billion as of December 8, 2014 and the net cash acquired of $19 million. 

As a result of the Kodiak Acquisition, Whiting acquired approximately 327,000 gross (178,000 net) acres located primarily in North Dakota, including interests in 778 producing oil and gas wells and undeveloped acreage. Approximately 10,000 of the net acres 

&#160;

acquired were located in Wyoming and Colorado. The producing properties had estimated proved reserves of 191.8 MMBOE as of the acquisition date, 86% of which were crude oil and NGLs. 

The acquisition significantly expanded our presence in the Williston Basin, adding undeveloped acreage, oil and natural gas reserves and production that were complementary to our existing asset base and operations in this area. As a result of this acquisition, we became the largest Bakken/Three Forks producer in the Williston Basin as of the acquisition date. 

2014 Divestitures. In March &#160; 2014, we completed the sale of approximately 49,900 gross (41,000 net) acres &#160; in our Big Tex prospect, which consisted mainly of undeveloped acreage as well as our interests in certain producing oil and gas wells, located in the Delaware Basin of Texas for a cash purchase price of $76 million resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of $12 million. 

Business Strategy 

Our goal is to generate meaningful growth in our net asset value of proved reserves per share through the development , acquisition and exploration of oil and gas projects with attractive rates of return on capital employed. To date, we have pursued this goal through continued field development in our core areas and the acquisition of reserves. Specifically, we have focused, and plan to continue to focus, on the following: 

Pursuing High-Return Organic Reserve Additions . The development of large resource plays such as our Williston Basin and our Denver Julesburg Basin (&#8220;DJ Basin&#8221;) project s has become one of our central objectives. As of December 31, 2015 , we have assembled approximately 778,900 gross ( 454,800 net) developed and undeveloped acres in the Williston Basin located in Montana and North Dakota. As of December 31, 2015 , we had five drilling rigs operating in this area . As a result of the sustained decline in crude oil prices, we plan to decrease the number of rigs operating in this area to two for most of 2016, while suspending our completion activity beginning in the second quarter. Additionally, Whiting owns a 50% ownership interest in two gas processing plants located in the Williston Basin. The Robinson Lake plant located in our Sanish field has a current processing capacity of approximately 130 MMcf/d. Our Belfield p lant located near the Pronghorn field currently has inlet compression in place to process 35 MMcf/d. Both plants have fractionation capability to convert NGLs into propane and butane, which end products can then be sold locally for higher realized prices. 

At our Red tail field in the DJ Basin in Weld County, Colorado , we have assembled approximately 154,300 gross ( 126,400 net) developed and undeveloped acres where we have the potential to drill over 1,200 gross wells targeting several intervals in the Niobrara formation. As of December 31, 2015 , we had two drilling rigs operating in the DJ Basin, and we plan to maintain a two-rig drilling program in this area during 2016, while suspending our completion activity beginning in the second quarter . In April 2014, we brought online the Redtail gas plant to process the associated gas produced from our wells in this area. &#160; The plant&#8217;s current inlet capacity is 50 MMcf/d . 

Developing Existing Properties . Our current property base provides us with numerous low-risk opportunities for exploration and development drilling. As of December 31, 2015 , we have identified a drilling inventory of over 3,000 gross wells that we believe will add production over the next five years. Our drilling inventory consists of the development of our proved and unproved reserves. Additionally, we have opportunities to apply and expand enhanced recovery techniques that we expect will increase proved reserves and extend the productive lives of our mature fields. Since we acquired the North Ward Estes field located in the Permian Basin of West Texas in 2005, w e have experienced significant production increases through the use of secondary and tertiary recovery techniques. We are currently injecting approximately 370 MMcf/d of CO 2 into this field, over half of which is recycled. 

Disciplined Financial Approach. Our goal is to remain financially strong, yet flexible, through the prudent management of our balance sheet and active management of our exposure to commodity price volatility. We have historically funded our acquisition and growth activity through a combination of equity and debt issuances, bank borrowings, internally generated cash flow and certain oil and gas property divestitures, as appropriate, to maintain our financial position. As a result of the sustained decline in crude oil prices during 2015 and continuing into 2016, we have significantly reduced our level of capital spending to more closely align with our cash flows generated from operations, and have focused our drilling activity on projects that provide the highest rate of return. From time to time, we monetize non-core properties and use the net proceeds from these asset sales to repay debt under our credit agreement or fund our E&#38;D expenditures. For example, during 2015 we sold a large number of non-core oil and gas properties that were primarily operated by third parties and no longer matched the profile of properties we desire to own . Divesting of these non-operated properties allows us to better control the timing and amount of capital spending as well as our operating costs. In addition, t o support cash flow generation on our existing properties and help ensure expected cash flows from newly acquired properties, we periodically enter into derivative contracts. Typically, we use costless collars , swaps and crude oil sales and delivery contracts to provide an attractive base commodity price level. As of January 1, 2016, we had derivative contracts covering the sale of approximately 54% of our forecasted 2016 oil production. 

Growing Through Accretive Acquisitions . Since 2003 , we have completed 21 separate significant acquisitions of producing properties for total estimated proved reserves of 445.2 MMBOE, as of the effective dates of the acquisitions. Our experienced team of 

&#160;

management, land, engineering and geoscience professionals has developed and refined an acquisition program designed to increase reserves and complement our existing properties, including identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities, closing purchases and effectively managing the properties we acquire. We intend to selectively pursue the acquisition of properties that are complementary to our core operating areas , as demonstrated by the Kodiak Acquisition, which closed on December 8, 2014 and expanded our presence in the Williston Basin . 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe that our key competitive strengths lie in our balanced asset portfolio, our experienced management and technical team and our commitment to the effective application of new technologies. 

Focused , Long-Lived Asset Base . As of December 31, 2015 , we had interests in 5,889 gross ( 3,177 net) productive wells on approximately 948,600 gross ( 593,900 net) developed acres across all our geographical areas. We believe this geographic mix of properties and organic drilling locations presents us with multiple opportunities to successfully execute our business strategy. Our proved reserve life is approximately 13.8 years based on year-end 2015 proved reserves and 2015 production. 

Experienced Management Team . Our management team averages 29 years of experience in the oil and gas industry. Our personnel have extensive experience in each of our core geographical areas and in all of our operational disciplines. In addition, each of our acquisition professionals has at least 31 years of experience in the evaluation, acquisition and operational assimilation of oil and gas properties. 

Commitment to Technology . In each of our core operating areas, we have accumulated extensive geologic and geophysical knowledge and have developed significant technical and operational expertise. In recent years, we have developed considerable expertise in conventional and 3-D seismic imaging and interpretation. In 2011, we completed the build-out and installation of an in-house, state-of-the-art rock analysis laboratory. We continue to utilize the data from this rock lab to support real-time drilling and completion decisions , and to help us to further understand unconventional oil plays . Our technical team has access to approximately 9,200 square miles of 3-D seismic data, digital well logs and other subsurface information. This data is analyzed with advanced geophysical and geological computer resources dedicated to the accurate and efficient characterization of the subsurface oil and gas reservoirs that comprise our asset base. In addition, our information systems enable us to update our production databases through daily uploads from hand-held computers in the field. We have a team of 10 professionals averaging over 27 years of experience managing CO 2 &#160; floods. This commitment to technology has increased the productivity and efficiency of our field operations and development activities. 

As a result of our successful testing of cemented liner and plug-and-perf completion designs across all of our prospect areas, in January 2014 we began using this technique for all of our completions in the Williston Basin, resulting in a significant improvement in initial production rates. During 2015, we continued to advance our completion techniques, including significantly increasing proppant volumes, utilizing diverting agents to better distribute fluid and proppant across individual zones, varying t he number of completion stages, and employing new fracture stimulation fluids , including slickwater. In 201 6 , we plan to continue use of these state-of-the-art completion design s on wells we drill in the Williston Basin and the DJ Basin, while also testing new diversion technology and more efficient placement and drillout of down-hole plugs .

The estimated future capital expenditures in the table above incorporate numerous assumptions and are subject to many uncertainties, including oil and natural gas prices, costs of oil field goods and services, drilling results and several other factors. 

Marketing and Major Customers 

We principally sell our oil and gas production to end users, marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline facilities. In areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is trucked or transported by rail to terminals, market hubs, refineries or storage facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2015, no individual purchaser accounted for 10% or more of our total oil, NGL and natural gas sales. The table below presents percentages by purchaser that accounted for 10% or more of our total oil, NGL and natural gas sales for the years ended December 31, 201 4 and 201 3 . We believe that the loss of any individual purchaser would not have a long-term material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Title to Properties 

Our properties are subject to customary royalty interests, liens securing indebtedness, liens incident to operating agreements, liens for current taxes and other burdens, including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions. Our credit agreement is also secured by a first lien on substantially all of our assets. We do not believe that any of these burdens materially interfere with the use of our properties or the operation of our business. 

We believe that we have satisfactory rights or title to all of our producing properties. As is customary in the oil and gas industry, limited investigation of title is made at the time of acquisition of undeveloped properties. In most cases, we investigate title and obtain title opinions from counsel only when we acquire producing properties or before commencement of drilling operations. 

Competition 

The oil and gas industry is a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties , obtaining investment capital, securing oil field goods and services , marketing oil and natural gas products and attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs or other equipment and services could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations. Our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. 

Regulation 

Regulation of Production 

The production of oil and gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and periodic report submittals during operations. All of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and gas wells, the regulation of well spacing and the plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations that we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production or sale of oil, NGLs and natural gas within its jurisdiction. 

Currently, none of our total production volumes are produced from offshore leases , however, &#160; s ome of our prior offshore operations were conducted on federal leases that are administered by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (the &#8220;BOEM&#8221;). T he present value of our future abandonment obligations associated with offshore properties was $ 29 million as of December 31, 201 5 . Whiting is therefore required to comply with the regulations and orders issued by the BOEM under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Among other things, we are required to obtain prior BOEM approval for any exploration plans we pursue and for our lease development and production plans. BOEM regulations also establish construction requirements for production facilities located on our federal offshore leases and govern the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal of production facilities from these leases. 

The BOEM also establishes the basis for royalty payments due under federal oil and gas leases through regulations issued under applicable statutory authority. State regulatory authorities establish similar standards for royalty payments due under state oil and gas leases. The basis for royalty payments established by the BOEM and the state regulatory authorities is generally applicable to all federal and state oil and gas lessees. Accordingly, we believe that the impact of royalty regulation on our operations should generally be the same as the impact on our competitors. 

Regulation of Transportation and Sale of Oil 

Sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices , however , Congress could reenact price controls or enact other legislation in the future. 

Our crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the &#8220;FERC&#8221;) regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system (based on inflation) for crude oil transportation 

&#160;

rates that allowed for an increase or decrease in the cost of transporting oil to the purchaser. The FERC&#8217;s regulations include a methodology for oil pipelines to change their rates through the use of an index system that establishes ceiling levels for such rates. The most recent mandatory five-year review period resulted in an order from the FERC for the index to be based on Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (the &#8220;PPI-FG&#8221;) plus a 1.23 % adjustment for the five-year period from July 1, 201 6 through June 30, 20 21 . This represents a de crease from the PPI-FG plus 2.65 % adjustment from the prior five-year period. The FERC determined that it would now use a calculation based on what it determined to be a superior data source, reflecting actual cost-of-service data as opposed to the accounting data historically used as a proxy for such information under the prior index methodology. The regulations provide that each year the Commission will publish the oil pipeline index after the PPI-FG becomes available. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. 

Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing provisions set forth in the pipelines&#8217; published tariffs. In addition, the FERC has emergency authority under the Interstate Commerce Act to intervene and direct priority use of oil pipeline transportation capacity, and the FERC exercised this authority over a specific pipeline in February 2014 in response to significant disruptions in the supply of propane. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors. 

Transportation and safety of oil and hazardous liquid is subject to regulation by the Department of Transportation (the &#8220;DOT&#8221;) under the Pipeline Integrity, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2012. The Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) , &#160; an agency within the DOT, enforces regulations on all interstate liquids transportation and some intrastate liquids transportation. PHMSA does not enforce the regulations in states that are capable of enforcing the same regulations themselves. The effect of regulatory changes under the DOT and their effect on interstate and intrastate oil and hazardous liquid transportation will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. 

A portion of our crude oil production may be shipped to market centers using rail transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties. The DOT and PHMSA establish safety regulations relating to crude-by-rail transportation. In addition, third-party rail operators are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board of the DOT, the Federal Railroad Administration (the &#8220;FRA&#8221;) of the DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other federal regulatory agencies. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law. 

In response to rail accidents occurring between 2002 and 2008, the U.S. Congress passed the Rail Safety and Improvement Act of 2008, which implemented regulations governing different areas related to railroad safety. In response to train derailments occurring in the United States and Canada in 2013 and 2014, U.S. regulators have taken a number of actions to address the safety risks of transporting crude oil by rail. 

On February 25, 2014, the DOT issued an emergency order requiring all persons to ensure crude oil is properly tested and classed prior to offering such product into transportation, and to assure all shipments by rail of crude oil be handled as a Packing Group I or II hazardous material. Also in February 2014, the Association of American Railroads entered into a voluntary agreement with the DOT to implement certain restrictions around the movement of crude oil by rail. In May 2014, the DOT issued an Emergency Restriction/Prohibition Order requiring each railroad carrier operating trains transporting 1,000,000 gallons or more of Bakken crude oil to provide notice to state officials regarding the expected movement of the trains through the counties in each state. The PHMSA and FRA have also issued safety advisories and alerts regarding oil transportation and have issued a report focused on the increased volatility and flammability of Bakken crude oil as compared with other crudes in the U.S. In May 2015, PHMSA issued new rules applicable to &#8220;high-hazard flammable trains&#8221;, defined as a continuous block of 20 or more tank cars loaded with a flammable liquid or 35 or more tank cars loaded with a flammable liquid dispersed throughout a train. Among other requirements, the new rules require enhanced braking systems, enhanced standards for newly constructed tank cars and retrofitting of existing tank cars, restricted operating speeds, a documented testing and sampling program, and routine assessments that evaluate 27 safety and security factors. Also in May 2015, the DOT issued an Emergency Restriction/Prohibition Order obligating certain railroad carriers operating trains transporting 1,000,000 gallons or more of Bakken crude oil to provide certain route information to state emergency authorities. 

We do not currently own or operate rail transportation facilities or rail cars. However, the adoption of any regulations that impact the testing or rail transportation of crude oil could increase our costs of doing business and limit our ability to transport and sell our crude oil at favorable prices at market centers throughout the U.S., the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The effect of any such regulatory changes will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. 

&#160;

Regulation of Transportation, Storage, Sale and Gathering of Natural Gas 

The FERC regulates the transportation, and to a lesser extent, the sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and regulations issued under those Acts. In 1989, however, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at unregulated market prices, in the future Congress could reenact price controls or enact other legislation with detrimental impact on many aspects of our business. 

Our natural gas sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The price and terms of access to pipeline transportation and underground storage are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. From 1985 to the present, several major regulatory changes have been implemented by Congress and the FERC that affect the economics of natural gas production, transportation and sales. In addition, the FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry that remain subject to the FERC's jurisdiction, most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies and certain underground storage facilities. These initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry by making natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. 

The FERC implement s The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act pertaining to transportation and pipeline issues, which requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf provide open access and non-discriminatory transportation service. One of the FERC&#8217;s principal goals in carrying out this Act&#8217;s mandate is to increase transparency in the market to provide producers and shippers on the outer continental shelf with greater assurance of open access services on pipelines located on the outer continental shelf and non-discriminatory rates and conditions of service on such pipelines. 

We cannot accurately predict whether the FERC&#8217;s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in the markets in which our natural gas is sold. In addition, many aspects of these regulatory developments have not become final but are still pending judicial and final FERC decisions. Regulations implemented by the FERC in recent years could result in an increase in the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum product pipelines. In addition, the natural gas industry historically has always been heavily regulated. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers. 

Transportation and safety of natural gas is subject to regulation by the DOT under the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2012. In addition, intrastate natural gas transportation is subject to enforcement by state regulatory agencies, and PHMSA enforces regulations on interstate natural gas transportation. State regulatory agencies can also create their own transportation and safety regulations as long as they meet PHMSA&#8217;s minimum requirements. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any of the states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Likewise, the effect of regulatory changes by the DOT and their effect on interstate natural gas transportation will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. We use the latest tools and technologies to remain compliant with current pipeline safety regulations. 

The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. 

In October 2015, a failure at an underground natural gas storage facility in Southern California prompted PHMSA to issue an advisory bulletin reminding owners and operators of underground storage facilities to review operations, identify the potential for facility leaks and failures, and to review and update emergency plans. The State of California proclaimed the underground natural gas storage facility an emergency situation in January 2016. Increased attention to and requirements for underground storage safety and infrastructure by state and federal regulators that may result from this incident will not affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers. 

Environmental Regulations 

General . Our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge or release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;EPA&#8221;) , issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties or that may result in injunctive relief for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition 

&#160;

of a permit before drilling or facility construction commences; restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various materials that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities; limit or prohibit project siting, construction or drilling activities on certain lands located within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas; require remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits; and impose substantial liabilities for unauthorized pollution resulting from our operations. The EPA and analogous state agencies may delay or refuse the issuance of required permits or otherwise include onerous or limiting permit conditions that may have a significant adverse impact on our ability to conduct operations. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability. 

Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly material handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general. While we believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this trend will continue in the future. 

The environmental laws and regulations which have the most significant impact on the oil and gas exploration and production industry are as follows: 

Superfund . The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221; or &#8220;Superfund&#8221;), and comparable state laws impose strict joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where a release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we may generate material that may be regulated as &#8220;hazardous substances&#8221; . Consequently, we may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA or comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these materials have been disposed or released. 

We currently own or lease, and in the past have owned or leased, properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas. Although we and our predecessors have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, under or from other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, many of these owned and leased properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons was not under our control. Similarly, the disposal facilities where discarded materials are sent are also often operated by third parties whose waste treatment and disposal practices may not be adequate. While we only use what we consider to be reputable disposal facilities, we might not know of a potential problem if the disposal occurred before we acquired the property or business, and if the problem itself is not discovered until years later. Our properties, adjacent affected properties, the offsite disposal facilities and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required: 

&#183; 

to remove or remediate previously disposed materials, including materials disposed or released by prior owners or operators or other third parties; 

&#183; 

to clean up contaminated property, including contaminated groundwater; 

&#183; 

to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination, including the plugging and abandonment of wells drilled and left inactive by prior owners and operators; or 

&#183; 

to pay some or all of the costs of any such action. 

&#160; 

At this time, we do not believe that we are a potentially responsible party with respect to any Superfund site and we have not been notified of any claim, liability or damages under CERCLA. 

Oil Pollution Act . The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA&#8221;) and regulations issued under OPA impose strict, joint and several liability on &#8220;responsible parties&#8221; for removal costs and damages resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A &#8220;responsible party&#8221; includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility and the lessee, permittee or holder of a right of use and easement of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities of $350 million per spill, while the liability limit for offshore facilities is the payment of all removal costs plus $75 million per spill damages. These limits do not apply if the spill is caused by a responsible party&#8217;s gross negligence or willful misconduct; the spill resulted from a responsible party&#8217;s violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation; a responsible party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a cleanup; or a responsible party fails to comply with an order issued under the authority of the Intervention on the High Seas Act. OPA also requires the lessee or permittee of the offshore 

&#160;

area in which a covered offshore facility is located to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of $35 million to cover liabilities related to an oil spill for which such responsible party is statutorily responsible. The President may increase the amount of financial responsibility required under OPA by up to $150 million, depending on the risk represented by the quantity or quality of oil that is handled by the facility. Any failure to comply with OPA&#8217;s requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill response action may subject a responsible party to administrative penalties up to $25,000 per day per violation. We believe we are in compliance with all applicable OPA financial responsibility obligations. Moreover, we are not aware of any action or event that would subject us to liability under OPA, and we believe that compliance with OPA&#8217;s financial responsibility and other operating requirements will not have a material adverse effect on us. 

Resource Conservation Recovery Act . The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements. We generate solid and hazardous wastes that are subject to RCRA and comparable state laws. Drilling fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA&#8217;s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous waste in the future. In September 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a petition with the EPA, requesting them to reconsider the RCRA exemption for exploration, production and development wastes but, to date, the agency has not taken any action on the petition. The EPA has not formally responded to this petition yet. Any such change in the current RCRA exemption and comparable state laws could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes. Additionally, these exploration and production wastes may be regulated by state agencies as solid waste. Also, ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our materials constituting wastes (as they are presently classified) to be significant, any repeal or modification of the oil and gas exploration and production exemption by administrative, legislative or judicial process, or modification of similar exemptions in analogous state statutes would increase the volume of hazardous waste we are required to manage and dispose of and would cause us, as well as our competitors, to incur increased operating expenses. 

Clean Water Act . The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, as amended (&#8220;CWA&#8221;), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into state waters or other waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. 

The EPA had regulations under the authority of CWA that required certain oil and gas exploration and production projects to obtain permits for construction projects with storm water discharges. However, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 nullified most of the EPA regulations that required storm water permitting of oil and gas construction projects. There are still some state and federal rules that regulate the discharge of storm water from some oil and gas construction projects. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater and/or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. In Section 40 CFR 112 of the regulations, the EPA promulgated the Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure regulations, which require certain oil containing facilities to prepare plans and meet construction and operating standards. 

Air Emissions. The Federal Clean Air Act, as amended (the &#8220;CAA&#8221;), and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants from various industrial sources through air emissions permitting programs and also impose other monitoring and reporting requirements. We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining pre-construction and operating permits and approvals for air emissions. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. For example, in 2012, the EPA finalized rules establishing new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production operations. Specifically, the EPA&#8217;s rule includes New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. Among other things, these standards require the application of reduced emission completion techniques associated with the completion of newly drilled and fractured wells in addition to existing wells that are refractured. The rules also establish specific requirements regarding emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. These rules could require a number of modifications to operations at certain of our oil and gas properties including the installation of new equipment. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, which may adversely impact our business. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. 

&#160;

The EPA announced in 2015 that it would directly regulate methane emissions from oil and natural gas wells for the first time as part of President Obama&#8217;s Climate Action Plan. As part of this strategy, on August 18, 2015, the EPA proposed requirements relating to methane and volatile organic compound (&#8220;VOC&#8221;) emissions from the oil and natural gas industry. These include: (i) proposed updates to the New Source Performance Standards and Draft Control Techniques Guidelines for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry, (ii) Draft Control Techniques Guidelines for reducing VOC emissions from existing oil and gas sources in certain ozone nonattainment areas and states in the Ozone Transport Region, (iii) a proposed Source Determination Rule to clarify the EPA&#8217;s air permitting rules as they apply to the oil and natural gas industry, and (iv) a proposed Federal Implementation Plan for the EPA&#8217;s Indian Country Minor New Source Review program for oil and gas production sources. In July 2015, the EPA also finalized two updates to the 2012 New Source Performance Standards for the oil and natural gas industry to address the definition of low-pressure wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another. In November 2015, the EPA also issued a request for additional data and information on emissions of hazardous air pollutants that were not available in 2012 when the EPA updated its major source air toxics standards for oil and natural gas production facilities and natural gas transmission and storage facilities. The final rule is expected in 2016 . 

After the closing of the Kodiak Acquisition, the EPA contacted us to discuss Kodiak&#8217;s responses to a June 2014 information request from the EPA under Section 114(a) of the CAA. In addition, in July 2015, we received an information request from the EPA under Section 114(a) of the CAA. The information requests relate to tank batteries used in our Williston Basin operations and our compliance with certain regulatory requirements at those locations, including the control of air pollutant emissions from those facilities. We have responded to the EPA&#8217;s information requests and are in settlement discussions with the EPA and the North Dakota Department of Health (the &#8220;NDDoH&#8221;) regarding potential noncompliance with the federal CAA at our Williston Basin facilities, as implemented by the EPA and the NDDoH. To date, no formal federal or state enforcement action has been commenced in connection with this matter beyond receipt of the noted letters. We anticipate that resolution of this matter will result in civil penalties of an undetermined amount and may require us to undertake corrective actions which may increase our development and/or operating costs. Given the uncertainty in matters such as these, we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter at this time. However, we do not believe that any penalties or corrective action expenditures that may result from this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Hydraulic Fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight rock formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing has been utilized to complete wells in our most active areas located in the states of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota and Texas, and we expect it will also be used in the future. Should our exploration and production activities expand to other states, it is likely that we will utilize hydraulic fracturing to complete or recomplete wells in those areas. The process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, the EPA recently issued guidance, which was published in the Federal Register on February 12, 2014, for permitting authorities and the industry regarding the process for obtaining a permit for hydraulic fracturing involving diesel. 

In June 2015, the EPA released for public comment and peer review a draft assessment of the potential impacts of oil and gas fracturing activities on the quality and quantity of drinking water resources in the United States. In addition, the EPA is currently studying wast ewater and stormwater discharges from hydraulic fracturing facilities. In April 2015, the EPA issued a proposed rule to amend the Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the oil and gas extraction categor y which would address discharges of wastewater pollutants from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly-owned treatment works . The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. Additionally, the EPA is collecting data and information regarding the extent to which these facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of the facilities, the environmental impacts of discharges and other information. 

Other federal agencies are also examining hydraulic fracturing, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the White House Council for Environmental Quality. In March 2015, the U.S. Department of the Interior released a final rule addressing (i) hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian oil and natural gas leases to require validation of well integrity and strong cement barriers between the wellbore and water zones through which the wellbore passes, (ii) disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing to the Bureau of Land Management, (iii) higher standards for interim storage of recovered waste fluids from hydraulic fracturing and (iv) measures to lower the risk of cross-well contamination with chemicals and fluids used in fracturing operations. In addition, legislation has been introduced in Congress from time to time to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. Also, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could ban, restrict or impose additional requirements on activities relating to hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. For example, on June 17, 2011, Texas enacted a law that requires the disclosure of information regarding the substances used in the hydraulic fracturing process to the Railroad Commission of Texas (the entity that regulates oil and natural gas production in Texas) and the public. Such federal or state legislation could require the disclosure of chemical constituents used in the fracturing process to state or federal regulatory authorities who could then make such information publicly available. Disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing hydraulic fracturing to pursue legal proceedings against producers and service providers based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the 

&#160;

fracturing process could adversely affect human health or the environment, including groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the federal level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays, litigation risk and potential increases in costs. Further, local governments may seek to adopt, and some have adopted, ordinances within their jurisdictions restricting the use of or regulating the time, place and manner of drilling or hydraulic fracturing. No assurance can be given as to whether or not similar measures might be considered or implemented in the jurisdictions in which our properties are located. If new laws, regulations or ordinances that significantly restrict or otherwise impact hydraulic fracturing are passed by Congress or adopted in the states or local municipalities where our properties are located, such legal requirements could prohibit or make it more difficult or costly for us to perform hydraulic fracturing activities and thereby could affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable. In addition, restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we are ultimately able to produce in commercially paying quantities and the calculation of our reserves . 

In addition, on July 3, 2014, a major university and U.S. Geological Survey researchers published a study purporting to find a causal connection between the deep well injection of hydraulic fracturing wastewater and a sharp increase in seismic activity in Oklahoma since 2008. Such studies may trigger new legislation or regulations that would limit or ban the disposal of hydraulic fracturing wastewater in deep injection wells. If such new laws or rules are adopted, our operations may be curtailed while alternative treatment and disposal methods are developed and approved. 

Further, on May 19, 2014, the EPA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to the disclosure of chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production. Depending on the precise disclosure requirements the EPA elects to impose, if any, we may be obliged to disclose valuable proprietary information, and failure to do so may subject us to penalties. 

Global Warming and Climate Change. On December 15, 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climate changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations that restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the CAA, including one rule that limits emissions of GHG from motor vehicles beginning with the 2012 model year. The EPA has asserted that these final motor vehicle GHG emission standards trigger the CAA construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources, commencing when the motor vehicle standards took effect on January 2, 2011. On June 3, 2010, the EPA published its final rule to address the permitting of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration ( the &#8220;PSD&#8221;) and Title V permitting programs. This rule &#8220;tailors&#8221; these permitting programs to apply to certain stationary sources of GHG emissions in a multi-step process, with the largest sources first becoming subject to permitting. Further, facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions are required to reduce those emissions consistent with guidance for determining &#8220;best available control technology&#8221; standards for GHG, which guidance was published by the EPA in November 2010. Also in November 2010, the EPA expanded its existing GHG reporting rule to include onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. This rule requires reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities on an annual basis with reporting beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. We believe that we are in compliance with all substantial applicable emissions requirements. 

In June 2014, the Supreme Court upheld most of the EPA&#8217;s GHG permitting requirements, allowing the agency to regulate the emission of GHG from stationary sources already subject to the PSD and Title V requirements. Certain of our equipment and installations may currently be subject to PSD and Title V requirements and hence, under the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling, may also be subject to the installation of controls to capture GHG. For any equipment or installation so subject, we may have to incur increased compliance costs to capture related GHG emissions. 

In accordance with President Obama&#8217;s Climate Action Plan, on August 3, 2015, the EPA issued a rule to reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units. The rule, commonly called the &#8220;Clean Power Plan&#8221;, requires states to develop plans to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel-fired generating units commencing in 2022, with the reductions to be fully phased in by 2030. Each state is given a different carbon reduction target, but the EPA expects that, in the aggregate, the overall proposal will reduce carbon emissions from electric generating units by 32% from 2005 levels. States are given substantial flexibility in meeting their emission reduction targets and can generally choose to lower carbon emissions by replacing higher carbon generation, such as coal or natural gas, with lower carbon generation, such as efficient natural gas units or renewable energy alternatives. Several industry groups and states have challenged the Clean Power Plan in the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while it is being challenged in court. 

In addition, both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHG, and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHG, primarily through the development of GHG inventories, GHG permitting and/or regional GHG &#8220;cap and trade&#8221; programs. Most of these &#8220;cap and trade&#8221; programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. In the absence of new legislation, the EPA is issuing 

&#160;

new regulations that limit emissions of GHG associated with our operations, which will require us to incur costs to inventory and reduce emissions of GHG associated with our operations and which could adversely affect demand for the oil , NGLs and natural gas that we produce. Finally, it should be noted that many scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. 

Consideration of Environmental Issues in Connection with Governmental Approvals . Our operations frequently require licenses, permits and/or other governmental approvals. Several federal statutes, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (&#8220;OCSLA&#8221;), the National Environmental Policy Act (&#8220;NEPA&#8221;) and the Coastal Zone Management Act (&#8220;CZMA&#8221;) require federal agencies to evaluate environmental issues in connection with granting such approvals and/or taking other major agency actions. OCSLA, for instance, requires the U.S. Department of Interior to evaluate whether certain proposed activities would cause serious harm or damage to the marine, coastal or human environment. Similarly, NEPA requires the Department of Interior and other federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency would have to prepare an environmental assessment and potentially an environmental impact statement. The CZMA, on the other hand, aids states in developing a coastal management program to protect the coastal environment from growing demands associated with various uses, including offshore oil and gas development. In obtaining various approvals from the Department of Interior, we must certify that we will conduct our activities in a manner consistent with all applicable regulations. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 201 5 , we had approximately 1,200 full-time employees, including approximately 40 senior level geoscientists and 80 petroleum engineers. Our employees are not represented by any labor unions. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory and have never experienced a work stoppage or strike.
