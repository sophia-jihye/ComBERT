Company Overview 

&#160;

Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, GrowOp Technology Ltd., a Nevada corporation ("GrowOp Technology"), we engage in the design, marketing, and sale of hydroponic equipment with proprietary technology to create sustainable solutions for the cultivation of indoor agriculture. We are also a retail seller of locally grown hydroponic produce, herbs, and floral products through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Edible Garden Corp., a Nevada corporation ("Edible Garden"). Through MediFarm, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ("MediFarm"), MediFarm I, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ("MediFarm I"), and MediFarm II, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ("MediFarm II"), subsidiaries in which we own interests, we plan to operate medical marijuana cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in Nevada. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, IVXX, Inc., a Nevada limited liability company ("IVXX"), we produce and sell a line of cannabis flowers and cigarettes, as well as a line of cannabis pure concentrates. Most recently, we formed another subsidiary, MediFarm I Real Estate, LLC a Nevada limited liability company ("MediFarm I RE"), in which we own 50% of its membership interests, which will own the real property on which a medical marijuana dispensary will be constructed. We anticipate that the dispensary will be operated by MediFarm I.

&#160;

We were incorporated in Nevada on July 22, 2008, under the name Private Secretary, Inc. We changed our name to Terra Tech Corp. on January 27, 2012. Our corporate headquarters is located at 4700 Von Karman, Suite 110, Newport Beach, California 92660 and our telephone number is (855) 447-6967. Our website addresses are as follows: www.terratechcorp.com, www.ediblegarden.com, and www.ivxx.com. Our common stock, par value $0.001 (the "Common Stock"), is quoted on the OTC Markets Group, Inc.'s OTCQX tier under the symbol "TRTC."

&#160;

History and Background 

&#160;

Our original business was developing a software program that would allow for automatic call processing through voice-over-Internet protocol, or "VoIP", technology. Our operations were limited to capital formation, organization, and development of our business plan and target customer market. We generated no revenue.

&#160;

On February 9, 2012, we completed a reverse-triangular merger with GrowOp Technology, whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of GrowOp Technology and in exchange we issued: (i) 33,998,520 shares of our Common Stock, (ii) 100 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, convertible into shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis, and (iii) 14,750,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, with each share convertible into 5.384235537 shares of Common Stock. The issuances represented approximately 50.3% of our total shares of Common Stock outstanding, assuming the conversion of all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, immediately following the closing of the merger. As a result of the merger, GrowOp Technology became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Following the merger, Terra Tech ceased its prior operations and is now solely a holding company.

&#160;

We acquired our second wholly-owned subsidiary, Edible Garden, in 2013. Edible Garden is a retail seller of locally grown hydroponic produce, herbs, and floral products which is distributed throughout the Midwest and the Northeast United States. We entered into a Share Exchange Agreement, dated March 23, 2013 (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), by and among the Company, Edible Garden , and the stockholders of Edible Garden. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, we offered and sold 1,250,000 shares of our Common Stock in consideration for all the issued and outstanding shares in Edible Garden. Separately, Amy Almsteier, one of our stockholders and directors (and, at the time, an executive officer), offered and sold 7,650,000 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock to Kenneth Vande Vrede, Michael Vande Vrede, Steven Vande Vrede, Dan Vande Vrede, Beverly Willekes, and David Vande Vrede (collectively, the "Former EG Principal Stockholders"). The 7,650,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible at any time into 36,344,198 shares of Common Stock and have voting power equal to 765,000,000 shares of Common Stock.

&#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; &#160;

The effects of the issuance of the 1,250,000 shares of Common Stock and the sale of the 7,650,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock by Ms. Almsteier were that the Former EG Principal Stockholders held approximately 25.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company and approximately 43.3% of the voting power of the Company as of March 23, 2013. Articles of Exchange, consummating the share exchange, were filed with the Secretary of the State of Nevada on April 24, 2013.

&#160;

On March 19, 2014, we formed MediFarm, a subsidiary. On July 18, 2014, we formed MediFarm I, a subsidiary. On July 30, 2014, we formed MediFarm II, a subsidiary. Through MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II, we plan to operate medical marijuana cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in Nevada.

&#160;

On September 16, 2014, we formed IVXX for the purpose of producing a line of cannabis flowers and cigarettes, as well as a complete line of cannabis pure concentrates including: oils, waxes, shatters, and clears. We currently offer these products to approximately 200 select dispensaries in California. As discussed in more detail below, we are using our supercritical Co 2 extraction lab located in Oakland, California to manufacture these products. IVXX also sells clothing, apparel, and other various branded products.

&#160;

On October 14, 2015, we formed MediFarm I RE. MediFarm I RE is a real estate holding company that owns the real property and a building, which is situated on the real property, at which a medical marijuana dispensary facility will be located. It is our intention that MediFarm I will operate the medical marijuana dispensary. We own 50% of the membership interests in MediFarm I RE. The remaining membership interests are owned by Forever Young Investments, LLC (50%), an otherwise unaffiliated entity.

&#160;

On March 31, 2016, we expect to close on the acquisition of Black Oak Gallery, a California corporation that operates a medical marijuana dispensary in Oakland, California under the name, Bl&#252;m ("Black Oak"), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 23, 2015 (the "Merger Agreement"), with Generic Merger Sub, Inc., a California corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary ("Merger Sub"), and Black Oak. The Merger Agreement was amended by a First Amendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated February 29, 2016 (the "First Amendment"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Black Oak, with Black Oak as the surviving corporation, and become our wholly-owned subsidiary (the "Merger"). The Merger is intended to qualify for federal income tax purposes as a tax-free reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

&#160;

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger, the outstanding shares of common stock of Black Oak held by (i) three of the current shareholders of Black Oak (the "Group A Shareholders") will be converted into the right to receive approximately 8,172 shares of our Series Z Preferred Stock, of which approximately 1,178 shares of Series Z Preferred Stock will be issued and paid at closing, and approximately 8,668,703 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, of which approximately 1,248,302 shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be issued and paid at closing and (ii) the remaining shareholders of Black Oak (the "Group B Shareholders") will be converted into the right to receive approximately 21,395 shares of our Series Q Preferred Stock, of which approximately 3,700 shares of Series Q Preferred Stock will be issued and paid at closing. The shares of Series Z Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, and Series Q Preferred Stock that are issued but not paid to the Black Oak shareholders at closing will be subject to certain holdback and lock-up provisions, and held in an escrow account as security for the satisfaction of any post-closing adjustments or indemnification claims, as provided for in the Merger Agreement. Each share of Series Q Preferred Stock is to be converted into 5,000 shares of our Common Stock and each share of Series Z Preferred Stock is to be converted into 1,857 shares of our Series B Preferred Stock, in each case immediately upon our filing with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada an Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized capital for, among other reasons, satisfaction of the terms of this potential transaction. Accordingly, the approximately 21,395 shares of Series Q Preferred Stock to be issued to the Group B Shareholders is convertible into approximately 106,975,000 shares of Common Stock and the approximately 8,172 shares of Series Z Preferred Stock to be issued to the Group A Shareholders is convertible into approximately 15,175,404 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock remains convertible into 5.384325537 shares of Common Stock. Immediately following the effectiveness of the Merger, the current Black Oak shareholders (both the Group A Shareholders and the Group B Shareholders) are expected to own approximately 33.37% of our Common Stock on a fully "as-converted basis," which percentage does not include certain shares of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock that may be converted into shares of Common Stock, or Series B Preferred Stock that may be converted into shares of Common Stock, as applicable, each as currently held by the Group A Shareholders. Derek Peterson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is one of the Group A Shareholders. The Group B Shareholders may also receive cash consideration equal to approximately $2,088,000.

&#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; &#160;

The securities paid to the Group A Shareholders and the Group B Shareholders are subject to certain post-closing adjustments that are based on certain performance indicators as of the first anniversary of the closing date of the Merger. The first indicator is based on the performance of the volume-weighted average price of our Common Stock on the first anniversary of the closing date of the Merger compared to the price of our Common Stock on the date of the Merger Agreement. The second indicator is based on our revenues for the twelve-month period following the closing date of the Merger. A portion of the securities that the Group A Shareholders and the Group B Shareholders are entitled to receive at closing of the Merger will be held in an escrow until the first anniversary of the closing date of the Merger and the post-closing adjustments are complete.

&#160;

Black Oak committed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us in our preparation of Black Oak's financial statements, which statements are to be reasonably capable of being audited under GAAP and which audit is to be completed not later than June 8, 2016 (75 days after March 25, 2016). We will file a Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose these financial statements not later than June 8, 2016.

&#160;

Our Business 

&#160;

We are a vertically integrated cannabis-focused agriculture company that is committed to cultivating and providing the highest quality medical cannabis, as well as other agricultural products, such as herbs and leafy greens that are grown using classic Dutch hydroponic farming methods. We have three wholly-owned subsidiaries, GrowOp Technology, Edible Garden, and IVXX, as well as ownership interests in MediFarm, MediFarm I, MediFarm II, and MediFarm I RE.

&#160;

We have a "rollup" growth strategy:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Fragmented market consists of smaller scale inefficient manufacturers and distribution companies. With our brand recognition and experienced management team we can maximize productivity, provide economies of scale, and increase profitability through our public market vehicle;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Acquire unique products and niche players where barriers to entry are high and margins are robust providing them with a broader outlet for their products; and

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Second stage-acquire multiple production facilities to capture the market vertical from manufacturing to production up to retail.

&#160;

GrowOp Technology 

&#160;

GrowOp Technology was incorporated on March 16, 2010. GrowOp Technology is currently headquartered in Newport Beach, California and has operations in Newport Beach, California.

&#160;

GrowOp Technology integrates high quality hydroponic equipment with proprietary technology to create sustainable solutions for the cultivation of indoor agriculture. Our products are utilized by companies, horticulture enthusiasts, local urban farmers, and greenhouse growers.

&#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; &#160;

GrowOp Technology's principal products include:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Portable Hydroponic Trailers &#8211; Our portable hydroponic trailers, The Big Bud and Little Bud, are custom fabricated proprietary cultivation systems.

&#160; We operate in two distinct markets: commercial agriculture and retail agriculture.

&#160;

In the retail agriculture market, three main manufacturers and distributors currently dominate the market in which GrowOp Technology competes: Sunlight Supply, Hydrofarm, and BWGS. These companies have been in business for several years, and we estimate they collectively make up over 50% of the market. In addition, there are several smaller distribution companies competing for market share. We believe that pricing is a primary driver in capturing market share, and that offering similar products at discounted pricing helps reduce the barriers to entry. Sunlight Supply, Hydrofarm, and BWGS have both the size and scope to create significant barriers to entry for smaller companies like GrowOp Technology. In the commercial market there are several companies that provide agricultural hydroponic equipment to large-scale farmers. These companies are relatively fragmented and generally focus on a few core proprietary items.

&#160;

GrowOp Technology's products are sold at a few specialty retailers throughout the United States. In the case of commercial sales, which are approximately 1% of GrowOp Technology's total sales, GrowOp Technology sells its products directly to customers. With the exception of the portable hydroponic units, all of our products are manufactured by third parties in China. There are numerous manufacturers that are available to us, and therefore, we are not limited in the number of suppliers available nor are we dependent on any one supplier.

&#160;

GrowOp Technology relies on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions, and other contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights, which are primarily its brand names, product designs, and marks. GrowOp Technology does not own any patents.

&#160;

GrowOp Technology's products are interchangeable for all agriculture, including medical marijuana. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia currently have some form of medical marijuana legalization/decriminalization laws, and it is anticipated that another handful of states will have some form of voting regarding legislation of medical marijuana legalization/decriminalization laws in the near future. Hydroponic equipment, including GrowOp Technology's products, can be used to cultivate marijuana. GrowOp Technology believes that some of its customers are medical marijuana growers. However, we do not believe that federal law or any state laws prohibit GrowOp Technology from selling its products to medical marijuana growers.

&#160;

It is possible that the sale of products to medical marijuana growers may be deemed facilitating the selling or distribution of marijuana in violation of the Controlled Substance Act (the "CSA"), or may constitute the aiding or abetting, or being an accessory to, a violation under the CSA. If such application were to occur, or if rules and regulations are promulgated in the future that has the effect of prohibiting the sale of GrowOp Technology's products to medical marijuana growers, GrowOp Technology's business would be adversely affected.

&#160;

Edible Garden 

&#160;

Edible Garden was incorporated on April 9, 2013. Edible Garden is a retail seller of locally grown hydroponic produce, herbs, and floral products which are distributed throughout the Northeast and Midwest United States. Currently, Edible Garden's products are sold at approximately 1,800 retailers throughout these markets. Our target customers are those individuals seeking fresh produce locally grown using environmentally sustainable methods.

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; &#160;

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated December 2, 2013 with Heartland Growers Inc. ("Heartland"), Heartland agreed to cultivate the full line of Edible Garden produce to be sold throughout the Midwestern United States. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Edible Garden will manage the marketing and sales, while Heartland will be responsible for the cultivation, packaging, and shipping of the product for retail sale under the Edible Garden brand. The term of the agreement was one year and expired on December 2, 2014. The term of the agreement is now month-to-month.

&#160;

Pursuant to a letter agreement dated May 7, 2013 with Gro-Rite Inc., a New Jersey corporation ("Gro-Rite"), Edible Garden has the right to purchase and distribute a majority of Gro-Rite's plant products from Gro-Rite for marketing, sale, and distribution. Under the agreement, Edible Garden will receive a sales commission of up to 10%. The term of the agreement was one year and expired on May 7, 2014. The term of the agreement is now month-to-month.

&#160;

On May 7, 2013, Edible Garden entered into a letter agreement with Naturally Beautiful Plant Products LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company ("NB Plants"), whereby Edible Garden has the right to purchase and distribute a majority of NB Plants' plant products. Under the agreement, Edible Garden will receive a sales commission of 10%. The term of this agreement was one year and expired May 7, 2014. The term of the agreement is now month-to-month.

&#160;

There are numerous growers that are available to us, and therefore, we are not limited in the number of growers available nor are we dependent on any one grower. We completed construction of a greenhouse structure in 2014, which can be used to grow plants to satisfy selling demands; however, we may incur additional freight costs to distribute these plants until growers are replaced.

&#160;

Edible Garden's main competitors are Shenandoah Growers and Sun Aqua Farms. To a lesser extent, Edible Garden competes with Green Giant, Del Monte, Rock Hedge Herbs, and Infinite Herbs. Edible Garden is an up and coming brand that has increased its retailers to approximately 1,800 retail sellers since we acquired Edible Gardens in March 2013. Edible Garden believes the following three reasons sets it apart from its competitors: (1) its branding and marketing displays, which are predominately placed in high traffic areas on its proprietary racks; (2) it uses proprietary strands and seeds for its produce and its methodology for growing such produce; and (3) all of its produce are hydroponically grown and are sold "alive" ( i.e., the produce is sold "rooted").

&#160;

Edible Garden is dependent on one major customer. During fiscal 2015, approximately 74% of its sales were derived from one customer, NB Plants. The loss of this customer would not have a material adverse effect on Edible Garden's business, our financial condition, and results of operation.

&#160;

Edible Garden relies on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions, and other contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights, which are primarily its brand names, marks, and proprietary pods and seeds. Edible Garden owns trademarks but does not own any patents.

&#160;

Edible Garden's produce is GFSI (Global Food Safety Initiative) certified. Edible Garden also obtained certain organic certifications for its products. No other governmental regulations or approvals are needed or affect its business.

&#160;

Edible Garden's research and development activities have primarily focused on developing and testing new pods and seeds, as well as different fertilizers, nutrient blends, and lighting.

&#160;

MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II 

&#160;

We formed three subsidiaries for the purposes of cultivation or production of medical marijuana and/or operation of dispensary facilities in various locations in Nevada. As discussed in further detail below, MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II have received eight provisional licenses from the State of Nevada, and we have received preliminary approval from local authorities with respect to all eight of such licenses. The receipt of both the provisional licenses from the State of Nevada and preliminary approval from local authorities are necessary to commence the final permitting process. The receipt of final permits and licenses, as to which there can be no assurance, is necessary to commence the proposed businesses of MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II. Effectuation of the proposed business of each of (i) MediFarm, (ii) MediFarm I, and (iii) MediFarm II is also dependent upon the continued legislative authorization of medical marijuana at the state level.

&#160;

&#160; 8 

&#160; &#160;

Each subsidiary was formed with different investors, thus necessitating the need for multiple entities with different strategic partners and advisory board members. In addition, we anticipate each subsidiary will service a different geographical market in Nevada. We expect to allocate future business opportunities among MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II based on the locations of such opportunities.

&#160;

We formed MediFarm on March 19, 2014. We own 60% of the membership interests in MediFarm. The remaining membership interests are owned by Camden Goorjian (20%) and by Richard Vonfeldt (20%), two otherwise unaffiliated individuals. Upon receipt of the necessary governmental approvals and permitting, we expect MediFarm to operate medical marijuana cultivation, production, and/or dispensary facilities in Clark County, Nevada and a medical marijuana dispensary facility in the City of Las Vegas.

&#160;

We formed MediFarm I on July 18, 2014. We own 50% of the membership interests in MediFarm I. The remaining membership interests are owned by Forever Green NV, LLC (50%), an otherwise unaffiliated entity that also owns certain membership interests in MediFarm II. Upon receipt of the necessary governmental approvals and permitting, we expect MediFarm I to operate a medical marijuana dispensary in Reno, Nevada.

&#160;

We formed MediFarm II on July 30, 2014. We own 55% of the membership interests in MediFarm II. The remaining membership interests are owned by Nevada MF, LLC (30%) and by Forever Green NV, LLC (15%), two otherwise unaffiliated entities. Forever Green NV, LLC also owns certain membership interests in MediFarm I. Upon receipt of the necessary governmental approval and permitting, we expect MediFarm II to operate a medical marijuana cultivation and production facility in Spanish Springs, Nevada.

&#160;

A number of states, including Nevada, have enacted laws that allow their citizens to use medical marijuana and operate medical marijuana cultivation, production, or dispensary facilities. Although cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical use is permitted in Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with the business plans of MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II, even if they successfully procure one or more licenses for the cultivation, production, and/or distribution of medical marijuana in Nevada, and could expose MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II to potential criminal liability and subject their properties to civil forfeiture. Though the cultivation and distribution of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent certain states, including Nevada, from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.

&#160;

To date, MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II, have obtained eight provisional licenses from the State of Nevada to operate their respective businesses. With respect to MediFarm, it obtained provisional licenses from the State of Nevada for the proposed dispensary in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the production, cultivation, and dispensary facilities in Clark County, Nevada. With respect to MediFarm I, it obtained a provisional license from the State of Nevada for its proposed dispensary in Reno, Nevada. With respect to MediFarm II, it obtained provisional licenses from the State of Nevada for its proposed production and cultivation facilities in Spanish Springs, Nevada.

&#160;

MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II, have also received preliminary approval from their respective local jurisdictions in connection with the proposed production, cultivation, and/or dispensary facilities. With provisional licenses from the State of Nevada and preliminary approval from the respective local jurisdictions, MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II have begun securing additional business licenses, construction permits, and final operational permits and certificates from the local and state jurisdictions in which they propose to operate. MediFarm, MediFarm I, or MediFarm II may not be able to obtain or maintain the necessary final licenses, permits, authorizations, or accreditations. Even if MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II are able to obtain the necessary final licenses, permits, authorizations, or accreditations, we will require substantial capital to commence their proposed business operations, as to which there can be no assurance. We currently anticipate commencing operations at MediFarm's proposed cultivation and production facilities in Clark County, Nevada on or around the third quarter of 2016, as to which there can be no assurance. We currently anticipate commencing operations at MediFarm's proposed dispensary in Las Vegas, Nevada on or around the second quarter of 2016, as to which there can be no assurance. We currently anticipate commencing operations at MediFarm's I proposed dispensary in Reno, Nevada on or around the second quarter of 2016, as to which there can be no assurance. We currently anticipate commencing operations at MediFarm's II proposed cultivation and production facility in Spanish Springs, Nevada on or around the fourth quarter of 2016, as to which there can be no assurance.

&#160;

&#160; 9 

&#160; &#160;

If and when MediFarm, MediFarm I, or MediFarm II receives the necessary licenses, permits, authorizations, or accreditations, MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II may face substantial competition in the operation of cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in Nevada. Numerous other companies were also granted provisional licenses, and, therefore, we anticipate that we will face competition with these other companies if such companies operate cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in and around the locations at which we plan to operate our facilities. Our management has extensive experience in successfully developing, implementing, and operating all facets of equivalent businesses in other markets. We believe this experience will provide MediFarm, MediFarm I, MediFarm II with a competitive advantage over these other companies.

&#160;

MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions, and other contractual provisions to protect their proprietary rights. MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II do not own any patents.

&#160;

IVXX 

&#160;

On September 16, 2014, we formed IVXX for the purposes of producing a line of cannabis flowers and cigarettes, as well as a complete line of cannabis pure concentrates including: oils, waxes, shatters, and clears. The science of cannabis concentrate extraction functions on the solubility of the cannabinoids and other active ingredients in the cannabis plant. Cannabinoids are not water soluble, so to extract them properly, the cannabinoids must be dissolved in a solvent. Co 2 functions as a solvent when it is heated or cooled and pushed through the flower at high (supercritical) or low (subcritical) pressures. Many argue that Co 2 extraction is the least-toxic form of cannabis concentrate extraction because of its low environmental impact and nonexistent toxicity. IVXX has chosen the Co 2 extraction method and uses its supercritical Co 2 extractor, as well as other proprietary processes, to produce its concentrates in its lab located in Oakland, California. Essentially, our supercritical Co 2 extractor processes raw cannabis plants and separates the chemical cannabinoids from the cannabis plant material, producing a concentrate. IVXX also sells clothing, apparel, and other various branded products.

&#160;

IVXX currently sells its products at wholesale to approximately 200 select dispensaries in California. None of IVXX's products crosses state lines. IVXX continues actively to seek opportunities to sell its products to other retailers located throughout the State of California. IVXX anticipates expanding its business into other states in which the sale of marijuana is legally permitted. In order for such expansion to occur, IVXX must secure the necessary licenses and permits required to operate in any given state, the timing and occurrence of which there can be no assurance. Initially, IVXX anticipates selling its products in Nevada in the dispensaries to be operated by MediFarm, MediFarm I, and/or MediFarm II once they are issued final permits and commence operations, as to the occurrence of which there can be no assurance. The projected timeline for the commencement of the dispensaries operated by MediFarm, MediFarm I, and/or MediFarm II is set forth above.

&#160;

IVXX's target markets are those individuals located in the areas surrounding the dispensaries that sell IVXX's products and that qualify as "patients" under state and local rules and regulations.

&#160;

The market for cannabis and medical marijuana products is rapidly evolving. IVXX competes with independent medical marijuana producers. There are significant barriers to entry, such as the time and cost in applying for operational licenses and permits. The location of a dispensary is also relevant, and, therefore, the monthly lease amount is often significant. Finally, the growing of medical marijuana requires expertise and the operating costs are often high. Many of our competitors have and will have greater financial and human resources, and longer operating histories, than we do. IVXX expects to be able to compete based on the cost, safety, and efficacy of its products. IVXX is consistently engaged in research and development with respect to increasing the efficiency of the processes used to produce its products, as well as improving the quality of its products for the benefit of its patients.

&#160;

&#160; 10 

&#160; &#160;

Although distributing medical marijuana is legally permitted in California, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely affect the ability to proceed with IVXX's business, could expose IVXX to potential criminal liability, and subject its properties to civil forfeiture. Though the cultivation and distribution of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent certain states, including California, from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.

&#160;

MediFarm I RE 

&#160;

On October 14, 2015, we formed MediFarm I RE. MediFarm I RE is a real estate holding company that owns the real property and a building, which is situated on such real property, at which a medical marijuana dispensary facility is expected to be located. It is our intention that MediFarm I will operate the medical marijuana dispensary. We own 50% of the membership interests in MediFarm I RE. The remaining membership interests are owned by Forever Young Investments, LLC (50%), an otherwise unaffiliated entity.

&#160;

Bl&#252;m 

&#160;

On March 31, 2016, we expect to close on the Merger of Black Oak, a California corporation that operates a medical marijuana dispensary in Oakland, California under the name, Bl&#252;m. Black Oak dispenses a wide variety of medical marijuana flowers, edibles, and concentrates, as well as unsweetened topical and ingestible medications, to patients that are located in and around its dispensary. Black Oak obtains its products from several suppliers, including IVXX.

Black Oak's target markets are those individuals located in the areas surrounding its dispensary and qualify as "patients" under state and local rules and regulations.

&#160;

The market for cannabis and medical marijuana products is rapidly evolving. Black Oak competes with other medical marijuana dispensaries that are located in and around Oakland, California. There are significant barriers to entry, such as the time and cost in complying with state and local rules and regulations. The location of a dispensary is also relevant, and, therefore, the monthly lease amount is often significant. Many of Black Oak's competitors have and will have greater financial and human resources, and longer operating histories then we do.

Although distributing medical marijuana is legally permitted in California, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely affect the ability to proceed with Black Oak's business, could expose Black Oak to potential criminal liability, and subject its properties to civil forfeiture. Though the cultivation and distribution of marijuana remains illegal under federal law, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent certain states, including California, from implementing their own laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.
