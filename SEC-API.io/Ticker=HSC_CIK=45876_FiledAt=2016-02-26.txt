General Development of Business 

Harsco Corporation (the "Company") is a diversified, multinational provider of industrial services and engineered products serving global industries that are fundamental to worldwide economic growth and infrastructure development. The Company's operations fall into three reportable segments: Harsco Metals &#38; Minerals, Harsco Industrial and Harsco Rail. The Company has locations in approximately 30 &#32;countries, including the U.S. The Company was incorporated in 1956. 

The Company's operations previously included the Harsco Infrastructure Segment. In November 2013, the Company consummated the sale of the Company's Harsco Infrastructure Segment into a strategic venture with Clayton, Dubilier &#38; Rice ("CD&#38;R") as part of a transaction that combined the Harsco Infrastructure Segment with Brand Energy &#38; Infrastructure Services, Inc., which CD&#38;R simultaneously acquired (the "Infrastructure Transaction"). The Company contributed substantially all of the Company&#8217;s equity interests in, and the net assets of, the Harsco Infrastructure Segment to the strategic venture in exchange for approximately $300 million in cash, subject to working capital and other adjustments, and an approximate 29% equity interest in the Infrastructure strategic venture. The Company&#8217;s approximate 29% equity interest in the Infrastructure strategic venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. See Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information on the Infrastructure Transaction. 

The Company's executive offices are located at 350 Poplar Church Road, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania 17011 and the Company's main telephone number is (717) 763-7064.

Narrative Description of Business 

(1) A narrative description of the businesses by reportable segment is as follows: 

Harsco Metals &#38; Minerals Segment&#8212; 64% &#32;of consolidated revenues for 2015 

The Harsco Metals &#38; Minerals Segment is one of the world's largest providers of on-site services of material logistics, product quality improvement and resource recovery for iron, steel and metals manufacturing. There are no significant metals services contracts for which the estimated costs to complete the contract currently exceed the estimated revenue to be realized included in the below estimated future revenues though certain contracts may have lower near-term operating margins due to continued reduced steel production and weaker commodity prices. The Metals business's multi-year contracts had estimated future revenues of $3.2 billion &#32;at expected production levels at December 31, 2015 . This provides the Company with a substantial base of long-term revenues. Approximately 22% &#32;of these revenues are expected to be recognized by December 31, 2016; approximately 43% &#32;of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2019; approximately 15% &#32;of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2022; and the remaining revenues are expected to be recognized thereafter. 

The Minerals business extracts high-value metallic content from stainless steel by-products and also specializes in the development of minerals technologies for commercial applications, including agriculture fertilizers. The Minerals business also produces industrial abrasives and roofing granules from power-plant utility coal slag at a number of locations throughout the U.S. Harsco Minerals' BLACK BEAUTY&#174; abrasives are used for industrial surface preparation, such as rust removal and cleaning of bridges, ship hulls and various structures. Roofing granules are sold to residential roofing shingle manufacturers in the U.S., primarily for the replacement roofing market. This business is one of the largest U.S. producers of slag abrasives and residential roofing granules. 

As part of the Harsco Metals &#38; Minerals Segment's initiatives to develop new products and services, in particular environmental solutions, the Segment is involved with several initiatives and technology alliances focused on developing greater environmental sustainability through the recovery of resources from production by-products and waste streams. 

The Harsco Metals &#38; Minerals Segment operates in approximately 30 &#32;countries. In 2015 &#32;and 2014 , this Segment's revenues were generated in the following regions:

For 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the Harsco Metals &#38; Minerals Segment's percentage of the Company's consolidated revenues were 64% , 67% &#32;and 47% , respectively. 

The Company has announced its intention to pursue strategic options for the separation of the Harsco Metals &#38; Minerals Segment from the rest of the Company. There is no specific timetable related to this initiative and there can be no assurance that a sale, spin-off or any other transaction will take place. 

Harsco Industrial Segment&#8212; 21% &#32;of consolidated revenues for 2015 &#32; 

The Harsco Industrial Segment includes the Harsco Industrial Air-X-Changers, Harsco Industrial IKG and Harsco Industrial Patterson-Kelley businesses. Approximately 93% &#32;of this Segment's revenues originate in North America. 

Harsco Industrial Air-X-Changers is a leading supplier of custom-engineered and manufactured air-cooled heat exchangers for the natural gas, natural gas processing and petrochemical industries in the U.S. Harsco Industrial Air-X-Changers' heat exchangers are the primary apparatus used to condition natural gas during recovery, compression and transportation from underground reserves through the major pipeline distribution channels. In January 2014, the Company acquired Hammco Corporation ("Hammco"), a U.S. manufacturer of high specification air-cooled heat exchangers for the natural gas and petrochemical processing markets. 

Harsco Industrial IKG manufactures a varied line of industrial grating products at several plants in the U.S. and international plants located in Mexico and China. These products include a full range of metal bar grating configurations, which are used mainly in industrial flooring, as well as safety and security applications in the energy, paper, chemical, refining and processing industries. Harsco Industrial IKG recently introduced GrateGuard TM , a fencing solution for first-line physical security. 

Harsco Industrial Patterson-Kelley is a leading manufacturer of energy-efficient heat transfer products such as boilers and water heaters for commercial and institutional applications. 

For 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , this Segment's percentage of the Company's consolidated revenues were 21% , 20% &#32;and 13% , respectively. 

Harsco Rail Segment&#8212; 15% &#32;of consolidated revenues for 2015 &#32; 

The Harsco Rail Segment is a global provider of equipment, after-market parts and services for the maintenance, repair and construction of railway track. The Segment's equipment and services support private and government-owned railroads and urban transit systems worldwide. In March 2015, the Company acquired Protran Technology ("Protran"), a U.S. designer and producer of safety systems for transportation and industrial applications; and in April 2015, the Company acquired JK Rail Products, LLC ("JK Rail"), a provider of after-market parts for railroad track maintenance. 

The Harsco Rail Segment's products are produced in three countries and products and services are provided worldwide. In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , export product sales from the U.S. for the Harsco Rail Segment were $67.1 million , $104.9 million &#32;and $109.3 million , respectively. 

For 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the Harsco Rail Segment's percentage of the Company's consolidated revenues were 15% , 13% &#32;and 10% , respectively. 

(1)(i) The products and services of the Company are generated through a number of product groups. These product groups are more fully discussed in Note 16, Information by Segment and Geographic Area, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." The product groups that contributed 10% or more as a percentage of consolidated revenues in any of the last three fiscal years are set forth in the following table:

(a) The Engineered scaffolding, concrete forming and shoring, and other access-related services, rentals and sales product group is associated with the Harsco Infrastructure Segment, which was disposed of as part of the Infrastructure Transaction. See Note 3, Acquisitions and Dispositions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for additional information on the Infrastructure Transaction. 

(1)(ii) New products and services are added from time to time; however, in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;none required the investment of a material amount of the Company's assets. 

(1)(iii) The manufacturing requirements of the Company's operations are such that no unusual sources of supply for raw materials are required. The raw materials used by the Company for its product manufacturing principally include steel and, to a lesser extent, aluminum, which are usually readily available. The profitability of the Company's manufactured products is affected by changing purchase prices of steel and other materials and commodities. 

(1)(iv) While the Company has a number of trademarks, patents and patent applications, it does not consider that any material part of its business is dependent upon them. 

(1)(v) The Company's Harsco Metals &#38; Minerals Segment provides services which are usually subject to volume reductions at certain points of the year and the Company furnishes products within the Harsco Industrial Segment that are seasonal in nature. As a result, the Company's revenues and results of operations for the first quarter ending March 31 and the fourth quarter ending December 31 may be lower than the second and third quarters. Additionally, the Company has historically generated the majority of its cash flows in the second half of the year. This is a result of normally higher income during the latter part of the year. The Company's historical revenue patterns and cash provided by operating activities are as follows:

(1)(vi) The practices of the Company relating to working capital are similar to those of other industrial service providers or manufacturers servicing both domestic and international industrial customers and commercial markets. These practices include the following: 

&#8226; 

Standard accounts receivable payment terms of 30 to 60 days, with progress or advance payments required for certain long-lead-time or large orders. Payment terms are slightly longer in certain international markets. 

&#8226; 

Standard accounts payable payment terms of 30 to 90 days. 

&#8226; 

Inventories are maintained in sufficient quantities to meet forecasted demand. Due to the time required to manufacture certain railway track maintenance equipment to customer specifications, inventory levels of this business tend to increase for an extended period of time during the production phase and decline when the equipment is sold. 

(1)(vii) In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Harsco Metals &#38; Minerals Segment had two &#32;customers that each provided in excess of 10% of this Segment's revenues under multiple long-term contracts at several mill sites. The loss of any one of the contracts would not have a material adverse effect upon the Company's financial position or cash flows; however, it could have a significant effect on quarterly or annual results of operations. Additionally, a decline in economic conditions may further impact the ability of the Company's customers to meet their obligations to the Company on a timely basis and could result in bankruptcy or receivership filings by any of such customers. If customers are unable to meet their obligations on a timely basis, or if the Company is unable to collect amounts due from customers for any reason, it could adversely impact the realizability of receivables, the valuation of inventories and the valuation of long-lived assets across the Company's businesses. As part of its credit risk management practices, the Company closely monitors the credit standing and accounts receivable position of its customer base. 

As previously disclosed, during the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded a bad debt reserve of $2.6 million on receivables with a large steel mill customer who filed for protection under the Italian receivership procedures (the "Marzano Law"). During the second quarter of 2014, the customer terminated its contract with the Company under the provisions of the Marzano Law. As a result, during the second quarter of 2014, the Company recorded an additional bad debt reserve of $3.9 million on the remaining pre-receivership receivables with this customer. 

Additionally, the Company recorded a bad debt reserve of $2.6 million during 2014 for one of its Canadian steel mill customers that filed for receivership protection during the course of the year, as the Company has previously disclosed. The amount of the bad debt reserve for this customer represents the full pre-receivership balance. 

One of the Company's steel mill customers in Europe ceased operations and began the formal process of liquidation in late 2015. The Company previously recorded bad debt reserves of approximately $3 million related to this customer and as a result of these events, recorded an additional bad debt reserve related to the remaining receivables balance of $9.9 million during 2015. 

The Harsco Industrial Segment had two customers in 2015 , and one customer in 2014 &#32;and 2013 , that provided in excess of 10% of the Segment's revenues. The loss of any of these customers would not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial positions or cash flows; however, it could have a material effect on quarterly or annual results of operations. 

The Harsco Rail Segment had two customers in 2015, one customer in 2014, and two &#32;customers in 2013 that provided in excess of 10% of the Segment's revenues. The loss of any of these customers would not have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial positions or cash flows; however, it could have a material effect on quarterly or annual results of operations. 

(1)(viii) At December 31, 2015 , the Company's metals services contracts had estimated future revenues of $3.2 billion &#32;at expected production levels, compared with $4.5 billion &#32;at December 31, 2014 . This decrease is primarily due to exited contracts associated with strategic actions from the Harsco Metals &#38; Minerals Improvement Plan ("Project Orion") related to the focus on underperforming contracts and the impact of foreign currency translation. At December 31, 2015 , the Company had an estimated order backlog of $72.9 million &#32;in its Harsco Industrial Segment, compared with $146.9 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 . This decrease is primarily due to low oil prices impacting capital expenditures and overall spending by customers in the natural gas, natural gas processing and petrochemical industries. In addition, at December 31, 2015 , the Harsco Rail Segment had an estimated order backlog of $292.1 million , compared with $348.8 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 . This decrease is primarily due to shipments which were not replaced due to decreased demand, primarily in the U.S., during 2015 . 

At December 31, 2015 , $223.4 million &#32;or 61% &#32;of the Company's manufactured products order backlog is not expected to be filled in 2016 . The remainder of this backlog is expected to be filled in 2017 and 2018. This is exclusive of long-term metals industry services contracts, roofing granules and industrial abrasives products, and minerals and metal recovery technologies services. 

(1)(ix) At December 31, 2015 , the Company had no material contracts that were subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the U.S. Government. 

(1)(x) The Company's competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of services and products provided and the global breadth and depth of markets served. No single service provider or manufacturer competes with the Company with respect to all services provided or products manufactured and sold. In general, on a global basis, the Company's segments are among the market leaders in their respective sectors and compete with a range of global, regional and local businesses of varying size and scope. 

Harsco Metals &#38; Minerals Segment &#8212;This Segment provides outsourced on-site services to the global metals industries in approximately 30 &#32;countries, with the largest operations focused in the U.S., the U.K., France and Brazil. This Segment is one of the world's largest providers of these services. This Segment's key competitive factors are innovative resource recovery solutions, significant industry experience, technology, safety performance, service and value. This Segment competes principally with a number of privately-held businesses for services outsourced by customers. Additionally, due to the nature of this Segment's services, it encounters a certain degree of "competition" from customers' desire to perform similar services themselves instead of using an outsourced solution. 

Harsco Industrial Segment &#8212;This Segment includes manufacturing businesses located principally in the U.S. with an increasing focus on international growth. Key competitive factors include quality, value, technology and energy-efficiency. Primary competitors are U.S.-based manufacturers of similar products. In January 2014, the Company acquired Hammco, a provider of process coolers for the natural gas, natural gas processing and petrochemical industries. 

Harsco Rail Segment &#8212;This Segment manufactures and sells highly-engineered railway track maintenance equipment produced primarily in the U.S. for customers throughout the world. Additionally, this Segment provides railway track maintenance services principally in the U.S. and the U.K. This Segment's key competitive factors are quality, technology, customer service and value. Primary competitors for both products and services are privately-held global businesses as well as certain regional competitors. In March 2015, the Company acquired Protran, a U.S. designer and producer of safety systems for transportation and industrial applications; and in April 2015, the Company acquired JK Rail, a provider of after-market parts for railroad track maintenance. 

(1)(xi) The Company's expense for research and development activities was $4.5 million , $5.5 million &#32;and $10.2 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. This excludes technology development and engineering costs classified in cost of services and products sold or selling, general and administrative expense. For additional information regarding research and development activities, see the Research and Development section included under Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

(1)(xii) The Company has become subject to, as have others, stringent air and water quality control legislation. In general, the Company has not experienced substantial difficulty complying with these environmental regulations, and does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. While the Company expects that environmental regulations may expand, and that its expenditures for air and water quality control will continue, it cannot predict the effect on its business of such expanded regulations. For additional information regarding environmental matters see Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

(1)(xiii) At December 31, 2015 , the Company had approximately 10,800 &#32;employees.

Financial Information about Geographic Areas 

Financial information concerning international and domestic operations is included in Note 16, Information by Segment and Geographic Area, to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," which information is incorporated herein by reference. Export sales from the U.S. totaled $80.8 million , $134.0 million &#32;and $143.7 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. The decrease in export sales from the U.S. is primarily attributable to decreased volumes in the Harsco Rail Segment and the air-cooled heat exchangers business.
