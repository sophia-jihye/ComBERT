Corporate History 

&#160;

Prior to April 1, 2004, Sandston Corporation was named Nematron Corporation (&#8220;Nematron&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), which was incorporated in Michigan in October 1983. In 1986, Nematron became a wholly owned subsidiary of Interface Systems, Inc. (&#34;Interface&#34;). The former business of Nematron was the design, manufacture and marketing of factory automation products, including computer hardware and software products. On March 31, 2004 Nematron sold to NC Acquisition Corp. (&#34;NCAC&#34;) all of its tangible and intangible assets, including its real estate, accounts, equipment, intellectual property, inventory, goodwill and other intangibles, and all subsidiaries except for $30,000 in cash, (the &#34;Net Asset Sale&#34;). NCAC also assumed all of Nematron&#8217;s liabilities pursuant to the Net Asset Sale. Following the Net Asset Sale, Nematron&#8217;s only remaining assets were $30,000 in cash; it retained no liabilities. Pursuant to the Net Asset Sale, and effective April 1, 2004 the Company has no subsidiaries. On April 1, 2004 Nematron amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Sandston Corporation (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) and implemented a shareholder-approved one-for-five reverse stock split of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Also, on April 1, 2004 Nematron sold a total of 5,248,257 post-split shares to Dorman Industries, LLC (&#8220;Dorman Industries&#8221;) for $50,000. Dorman Industries is a Michigan limited liability company wholly owned by Mr. Daniel J. Dorman, who became the Company&#8217;s Chairman of the Board, CEO, and President following such stock purchase. By virtue of its purchase of common stock, Dorman Industries became the owner of 62.50% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, and currently is the beneficial owner of 62.16% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock. Patricia A. Dorman, Mr. Dorman&#8217;s wife, is the beneficial owner of an additional 4.09% of the Company&#8217;s outstanding common stock.
