&#160; 

Restaurants/Sports Bars 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2016, we operated four restaurants/sports bar as &#8220;Bombshells&#8221; in Dallas, Austin and Houston, Texas. In 2015, our subsidiary, BMB Franchising Services, Inc. (&#8220;BMB&#8221;), announced that it was beginning a nationwide franchising program for Bombshells. As of March 2016, BMB has received approval to sell franchises in all 50 states. The restaurant sets itself apart with d&#233;cor that pays homage to all branches of the U.S. military. Locations feature local DJs, large outdoor patios, and more than 75 state of the art flat screen TVs for watching your favorite sports. All food and drink menu items have military names. Bombshell Girls, with their military-inspired uniforms, are a key attraction. Their mission, in addition to waitressing, is to interact with guests and generate a fun atmosphere. 

&#160; 

We opened the first Bombshells in March 2013 in Dallas, quickly becoming one of the most popular restaurant destinations in the area. Within a year, four more opened in the Austin and Houston, Texas areas. Of the five, three are freestanding pad sites and two are inline locations. In September 2016, we closed one Bombshells location in Webster, Texas. In addition, we currently operate a bar in Fort Worth, Texas as Vee Lounge (reconcepted in October 2016 as Studio 80). 

&#160; 

Media Group 

&#160; 

The Media Group, made up of wholly owned subsidiaries, is the leading business communications company serving the multi-billion-dollar adult nightclubs industry. It owns a national industry convention and tradeshow; two national industry trade publications; two national industry award shows; and more than 25 industry websites. Included in the Media Group is ED Publications, publishers of the bimonthly ED Club Bulletin, the only national business magazine serving the 3,500-plus adult nightclubs in North America, which have annual revenues in excess of $5 billion, according to the Association of Club Executives. ED Publications, founded in 1991, also publishes the Annual VIP Guide of adult nightclubs, touring entertainers and industry vendors; produces the Annual Gentlemen&#8217;s Club Owners EXPO, a national convention and tradeshow; and offers the exclusive ED VIP Club Card, honored at more than 850 adult nightclubs. Also in the Media Group is Storerotica, founded in 2004, which publishes the bimonthly Storerotica Magazine, the industry trade publication for the multi-billion-dollar erotic apparel and adult novelty retail sales industries. The Media Group produces two nationally recognized industry award shows for the readers of both ED Club Bulletin and Storerotica magazines, and maintains a number of B-to-B and consumer websites for both industries. 

&#160; 

Energy Drinks 

&#160; 

In October 2014, we acquired 51% of a company with exclusive distribution rights to Robust brand energy drinks in North America. Robust targets the on-premises bar and mixer market in eight states. The company&#8217;s exclusive rights are for 10 years, with rights to renew, with Sun Mark Limited of the UK, which has been manufacturing and distributing the drink under the Bullet brand there since 2008. Robust comes in standard 8.4-ounce energy drink cans and in four flavors: regular, sugar free, cranberry and lemon mint, which mixes particularly well with whiskey and tequila. 

&#160; 

In September 2016, we sold a 31% interest in Robust to its former owner for a $2.0 million note from him, retaining a 20% interest in the business. We recorded a $641,000 gain on the sale, including deferred tax credits released on the sale of the business, and recognized an impairment charge of $825,000 on the residual interest owned. Beginning as of the date of sale, we have begun to account for Robust as a cost method investment as we do not have significant influence.

&#160; 

OUR STRATEGY 

&#160; 

Our overall objective is to create value for our shareholders by developing and operating profitable businesses in the hospitality and related space. We strive to achieve that by providing an attractive price-value entertainment and dining experience; by attracting and retaining quality personnel; and by focusing on unit-level operating performance. Aside from our operating strategy, we employ a capital allocation strategy. 

&#160; 

Capital Allocation Strategy 

&#160; 

Our capital allocation strategy provides us with disciplined guidelines on how we should use our free cash flows; provided, however, that we may deviate from this strategy if the circumstances warrant. We calculate free cash flow as net cash flows from operating activities minus maintenance capital expenditures. Using the after-tax yield of buying our own stock, or other strategic rationale in management&#8217;s opinion, as baseline, we believe we are able to make better investment decisions. 

&#160; 

Based on our capital allocation strategy: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; We believe that buying back our own stock provides risk-free returns on our free cash flows since we are buying our own assets that we know very well; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We consider acquiring or developing our own clubs or restaurants that we believe have the potential to provide two times the after-tax yield of buying our own stock, absent an otherwise strategic rationale; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We consider paying down our debt when our stock price increases to a level where the after-tax yield of buying back our own stock is equal or lower than the after-tax yield of paying down our debt. &#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The adult entertainment and the restaurant/sports bar businesses are highly competitive with respect to price, service and location. All of our nightclubs compete with a number of locally owned adult clubs, some of whose brands may have name recognition that equals that of ours. The names &#8220;Rick&#8217;s&#8221; and &#8220;Rick&#8217;s Cabaret,&#8221; &#8220;Tootsie&#8217;s Cabaret,&#8221; &#8220;XTC Cabaret,&#8221; &#8220;Silver City,&#8221; &#8220;Club Onyx,&#8221; &#8220;Downtown Cabaret,&#8221; &#8220;Temptations,&#8221; &#8220;The Seville,&#8221; &#8220;Jaguars,&#8221; &#8220;Hoops Cabaret,&#8221; and &#8220;Foxy&#8217;s Cabaret&#8221; are proprietary. In the restaurant/sports bar business, &#8220;Bombshells&#8221; is also proprietary. We believe that the combination of our existing brand name recognition and the distinctive entertainment environment that we have created will allow us to compete effectively in the industry and within the cities where we operate. Although we believe that we are well positioned to compete successfully, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our high level of name recognition and prestige within the marketplace. 

&#160; 

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS 

&#160; 

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business activities. Particularly in Texas, the authority to issue a permit to sell alcoholic beverages is governed by the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (&#8220;TABC&#8221;), which has the authority, in its discretion, to issue the appropriate permits. We presently hold a Mixed Beverage Permit and a Late Hour Permit at numerous Texas locations. Minnesota, North Carolina, Indiana, Louisiana, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Florida, and New York have similar laws that may limit the availability of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages or that may provide for suspension or revocation of a permit to sell alcoholic beverages in certain circumstances. It is our policy, prior to expanding into any new market, to take steps to ensure compliance with all licensing and regulatory requirements for the sale of alcoholic beverages as well as the sale of food. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

In addition to various regulatory requirements affecting the sale of alcoholic beverages, in many cities where we operate, the location of an adult entertainment cabaret is subject to restriction by city, county or other governmental ordinance. The prohibitions deal generally with distance from schools, churches, and other sexually oriented businesses and contain restrictions based on the percentage of residences within the immediate vicinity of the sexually oriented business. The granting of a sexually oriented business permit is not subject to discretion; the permit must be granted if the proposed operation satisfies the requirements of the ordinance. In all states where we operate, management believes we are in compliance with applicable city, county, state or other local laws governing the sale of alcohol and sexually oriented businesses. 

&#160; 

TRADEMARKS 

&#160; 

Our rights to the trade names &#8220;RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc.,&#8221; &#8220;Rick&#8217;s,&#8221; &#8220;Rick&#8217;s Cabaret,&#8221; &#8220;Tootsie&#8217;s Cabaret,&#8221; &#8220;Club Onyx,&#8221; &#8220;XTC Cabaret,&#8221; &#8220;Temptations,&#8221; &#8220;Jaguars,&#8221; &#8220;Downtown Cabaret,&#8221; &#8220;Cabaret East,&#8221; &#8220;Bombshells Restaurant &#38; Bar,&#8221; &#8220;Vee Lounge,&#8221; &#8220;The Seville Club,&#8221; &#8220;Down In Texas Saloon,&#8221; &#8220;Silver City Cabaret,&#8221; and &#8220;Exotic Dancer&#8221; are established under common law based upon our substantial and continuous use of these trade names in interstate commerce, some of which have been in use at least as early as 1987. We have registered our service mark, &#8220;RICK&#8217;S AND STARS DESIGN,&#8221; and the &#8220;BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT &#38; BAR&#8221; logo design with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also obtained service mark registrations from the Patent and Trademark Office for the &#8220;RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.,&#8221; &#8220;RICK&#8217;S,&#8221; &#8220;RICK&#8217;S CABARET,&#8221; &#8220;CLUB ONYX,&#8221; &#8220;XTC CABARET,&#8221; &#8220;SILVER CITY CABARET,&#8221; &#8220;BOMBSHELLS RESTAURANT &#38; BAR,&#8221; &#8220;THE SEVILLE CLUB,&#8221; &#8220;DOWN IN TEXAS SALOON,&#8221; and &#8220;EXOTIC DANCER&#8221; service marks. As of this date, we have pending registration applications for the names &#8220;CLUB DULCE,&#8221; &#8220;FOXY&#8217;S CABARET,&#8221; and &#8220;HOOPS CABARET.&#8221; We also own the rights to numerous trade names associated with our media division. There can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our service marks will be adequate to deter misappropriation. 

&#160; 

EMPLOYEES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS 

&#160; 

As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately 2,000 employees, of which approximately 160 are in management positions, including corporate and administrative operations, and approximately 1,840 are engaged in entertainment, food and beverage service, including bartenders, waitresses, and certain entertainers. None of our employees are represented by a union. We consider our employee relations to be good. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016, we had independent contractor entertainers, who are self-employed and conduct business at our locations on a non-exclusive basis. Our entertainers at Rick&#8217;s Cabaret in Minneapolis, Minnesota act as commissioned employees. Also, as of October 2016, our entertainers at Jaguars Club in Phoenix, Arizona are now classified as commissioned employees. All employees and independent contractors sign arbitration non-class action participation agreements. 

&#160; 

We believe that the adult entertainment industry standard of treating entertainers as independent contractors provides us with safe harbor protection to preclude payroll tax assessment for prior years. We have prepared plans that we believe will protect our profitability in the event that the sexually oriented business industry is required in all states to convert entertainers, who are now independent contractors, into employees.
