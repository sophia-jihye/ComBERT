 Item 1. BUSINESS. &#160;

Company Overview 

&#160;

We are a biotechnology company developing novel adult stem cell therapies for debilitating neurodegenerative disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (&#8220;ALS&#8221;, also known as Lou Gehrig&#8217;s disease), Multiple Sclerosis (&#8220;MS&#8221;), and Parkinson&#8217;s disease (&#8220;PD&#8221;) among others. These diseases for the most part have no or limited treatment options and as such represent unmet medical needs. We believe that NurOwn&#174;, our proprietary process for the propagation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (&#8220;MSC&#8221;) and their differentiation into neurotrophic factor-(&#8220;NTF&#8221;) secreting cells (&#8220;MSC-NTF&#8221;), and their transplantation at, or near, the site of damage, offers the hope of more effectively treating neurodegenerative diseases. Our core technology was developed in collaboration with Prof. Daniel Offen of the Felsenstein Medical Research Center of Tel Aviv University and the late Prof. Eldad Melamed, who passed away in October 2015, and was former head of Neurology of the Rabin Medical Center and former member of the Scientific Committee of the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research . Our wholly-owned Israeli subsidiary, Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd. (the &#8220;Israeli Subsidiary&#8221;), holds rights to commercialize the technology, through a licensing agreement with Ramot at Tel Aviv University Ltd. (&#8220;Ramot&#8221;), the technology transfer company of Tel Aviv University, Israel. We currently employ17 employees in Israel and 3 in the United States.

&#160;

Our Proprietary Technology 

&#160; 

Our NurOwn&#174; technology is based on a novel differentiation protocol which induces differentiation of the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into neuron-supporting cells, MSC-NTF cells, capable of releasing several neurotrophic factors, including Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (&#8220;GDNF&#8221;), Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (&#8220;BDNF&#8221;), Vascular endothelial growth factor (&#8220;VEGF&#8221;) and Hepatocyte growth factor (&#8220;HGF&#8221;) which are critical for the growth, survival and differentiation of developing neurons. GDNF is one of the most potent survival factors known for peripheral neurons. VEGF and HGF have been reported to have important neuro-protective effects in ALS.

&#160;

Our approach to treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with autologous adult stem cells includes a multi-step process beginning with harvesting of undifferentiated stem cells from the patient's own bone marrow, and concluding with transplantation of differentiated, neurotrophic factor-secreting mesenchymal stem cells (MSC-NTF) into the same patient &#8211; intrathecally and/or intramuscularly. Intrathecal (injection into the cerebrospinal fluid) transplantation consists of injection by a standard lumbar puncture; there is no need for a laminectomy, which is an invasive, orthopedic spine operation to remove a portion of the vertebral bone, as required by technologies in which cells are implanted directly into the spinal cord. Intramuscular (injection directly into muscle) transplantation is performed via a standard injection procedure as well.

&#160;

3&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Our proprietary, production process for induction of differentiation of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells into differentiated cells that produce NTF (MSC-NTF) for clinical use is conducted in full compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;).

&#160;

Our proprietary technology is licensed to and developed by our Israeli Subsidiary.

&#160;

The NurOwn &#174; Transplantation Process 

&#160; 

&#160; &#183; Bone marrow aspiration from patient; &#160; &#183; Isolation and propagation of the mesenchymal stem cells; &#160; &#183; Differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells into neurotrophic-factor secreting (MSC-NTF) cells; and &#160; &#183; Autologous transplantation into the patient&#8217;s spinal cord and/or muscle tissue. &#160;

Differentiation before Transplantation 

&#160; 

The ability to induce differentiation of autologous adult mesenchymal stem cells into MSC-NTF cells before transplantation is unique to NurOwn&#174;, making it the first-of-its-kind for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

&#160;

The specialized cells secrete neurotrophic factors that may lead to:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Protection of existing motor neurons; &#160; &#183; Promotion of motor neuron growth; and &#160; &#183; Re-establishment of nerve-muscle interaction. &#160;

Autologous (Self-transplantation) 

&#160; 

The NurOwn&#174; approach is autologous, or self-transplanted, using the patient&#8217;s own stem cells. In autologous transplantation there is no risk of rejection and no need for treatment with immunosuppressive agents, which can cause severe and/or long-term side effects. In addition, the use of adult stem cells is free of controversy associated with the use of embryonic stem cells in some countries.

&#160;

The ALS Program 

&#160;

NurOwn&#174; is in clinical development for the treatment of ALS. It has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the &#8220;FDA&#8221;) for this indication, and has been granted Orphan Status in both the United States and in Europe. We have completed two clinical trials of NurOwn&#174; in patients with ALS at Hadassah Medical Center (&#8220;Hadassah&#8221;) in collaboration with Professor Dimitrios Karussis, who served as the principal investigator on these studies. We also have an agreement with Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Ltd., a subsidiary of the Hadassah Medical Organization, pursuant to which Hadassah provides the Israeli Subsidiary with lab services relating to studies of NurOwn&#174;. The first study, a Phase 1/2 safety and efficacy study of NurOwn&#174; in ALS patients administered either intramuscularly or intrathecally, was initiated in June 2011 after receiving approval from the Israeli Ministry of Health (&#8220;MoH&#8221;). In March 2013, Professor Karussis presented some of the data from this trial at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting. The trial results demonstrated the safety of NurOwn&#174; as well as signs of efficacy on both the ALS Functional Rating Score (&#8220;ALSFRS-R&#8221;) and Forced Vital Capacity (&#8220;FVC&#8221;).

&#160;

In January 2013, the Israeli MoH approved the second study, a Phase 2a combined (intramuscular and intrathecal) treatment, dose-escalating trial, which we also conducted at Hadassah in collaboration with Prof. Karussis. On September 27, 2013, we announced that we had completed treatment of 12 patients in our ALS Phase 2a NurOwn&#174; dose-escalating clinical trial. An interim safety summary for the first 12 patients in the study was submitted to the Hadassah Medical Center Ethical Committee about two month after transplantation of the 12th patient. On December 10, 2013, we announced that Prof. Karussis presented some of his preliminary findings from this trial at the 24 th International Symposium on ALS/MND in Milan, Italy. In June 2014, Professor Karussis presented interim data from this study at the Joint Congress of European Neurology in Istanbul, Turkey. The last follow-up visits in this study occurred in September 2014. On January 5, 2015, the Company presented final top line data from this study in a press release and investor conference call. The results of this study confirmed the safety profile observed in the earlier Phase 1/2 trial, with the vast majority of adverse events being low-grade. There were two deaths and two serious adverse events, all of which were deemed by the investigators to be unrelated to treatment. Subjects in this study showed a meaningful reduction in the rate of disease progression for the three and six months after treatment, compared to the three months prior to treatment.

&#160;

In January 2016, the Company announced that the results of the two completed studies were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Neurology medical journal. The results of these studies show that NurOwn &#174; can slow disease progression in ALS

&#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In December 2013, the Company submitted an Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) application to the FDA for NurOwn&#174; in ALS, and on April 28, 2014, the FDA approved commencement of the Company&#8217;s randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multi-center Phase 2 clinical trial of NurOwn&#174; in ALS patients. On June 6, 2014, the Company announced that this clinical trial began, with the enrollment of the first patient at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. The trial is also being conducted at the University of Massachusetts Memorial Hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts and the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. For this study, NurOwn&#174; production occurs at the Connell and O&#8217;Reilly Cell Manipulation Core Facility at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts and at the Human Cellular Therapy Lab at the Mayo Clinic. This study is designed to enroll 48 patients randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive NurOwn&#174; or placebo.

&#160;

In February 2015, the Company announced that the Data Safety Monitoring Board (&#8220;DSMB&#8221;) for the multi-center U.S. Phase 2 clinical trial reviewed the safety data collected through a cutoff date in January 2015, and did not find any lab abnormalities, adverse events or significant protocol deviations that would be cause for concern and therefore approved continuation of the trial as planned.

&#160;

On August 11, 2015, the Company announced that it had completed enrollment achieving the target of 48 subjects to be enrolled in its ongoing randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial of NurOwn&#174; in ALS. In November 2015, the Company announced that the DSMB for the multi-center U.S. Phase 2 clinical trial reviewed the safety data collected through a cutoff date in October 2015, which included 47 of the 48 patients enrolled in the study. No treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported for the study. Furthermore, the DSMB did not identify any adverse events, lab abnormalities or significant protocol deviations that would be cause for concern. 

Results from this trial are not expected until the middle of 2016.

&#160;

In January 2016, the Company entered into a collaborative agreement with Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem, Israel, to conduct the planned multi dose Phase 2 trial with NurOwn&#174; in ALS. &#160; 

&#160;

This Phase 2 multi dose study will be BrainStorm's third clinical trial conducted at Hadassah and is designed to provide guidance in preparing a Phase 3 program for NurOwn &#174; stem cell based therapy in ALS. The trial is expected to enroll up to 24 patients who will receive three consecutive stem cell transplantations in order to explore the safety and efficacy of a multi dose treatment. The trial has been approved by the Hadassah's Helsinki Committee and is now awaiting the approval of the Israeli MoH.

&#160;

The agreement was signed with Hadassah, through its technology transfer company Hadasit Medical Research Services and Development Co. Ltd. The Principal Investigator will be Professor Dimitrios Karussis, MD, PhD, head of the Unit of Neuroimmunology and Cell Therapies at Hadassah's Department of Neurology, who served as Principal Investigator in Brainstorm&#8217;s prior ALS studies. 

&#160;

Future development of NurOwn&#174; in ALS will require additional clinical trials, including a Phase 3 FDA-approved multi dose trial. 

&#160;

Future Development Plans 

&#160;

In addition to its active clinical program in ALS, the Company is reviewing the potential clinical development of NurOwn&#174; in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson&#8217;s disease, Huntington&#8217;s disease, and multiple sclerosis. The Company has conducted preclinical research in additional neurologic disease areas, including autism. In January 2015, the Company announced positive results from preclinical studies of NurOwn&#8482; in the BTBR mouse model of autism. The BTBR mouse exhibits several stereotypical behavioral characteristics that resemble behaviors seen in autism spectrum disorders, including repetitive behaviors, altered social interactions, cognitive rigidity and impaired adaption to environment. The Company is planning a possible Phase 1 study for autism in 2016.

&#160;

In addition, the Company is engaged in a number of research initiatives to improve the scale and efficiency of NurOwn&#174; production and to improve the stability of NurOwn&#174;, which is currently produced in clean room facilities close to the clinical trial sites, where the cells are administered to patients. In January 2013, we announced the development of a proprietary method for cryopreservation, or freezing, of cells, which will enable long-term storage, and production of repeat patient doses of NurOwn&#174; without the need for additional bone marrow aspirations. We believe that cryopreservation will enable us to create a personalized NurOwn&#174; stem cell bank for each patient, for ongoing, repeated treatments. We are planning to use cryopreserved cells in the upcoming Phase 2 clinical trial that will involve administration of multiple doses of NurOwn&#174;.

&#160;

We are also engaged in collaboration with Octane Biotech Inc. (&#8220;Octane&#8221;), a Canadian firm that focuses on culture systems for cell and tissue therapy, to develop a NurOwn&#174; bioreactor. On June 27, 2014, the Company announced that this collaboration has successfully developed a sophisticated Alpha prototype of the NurOwn&#174; Bioreactor, utilizing a customized disposable cartridge that is dedicated to the intricacies of the Company's NurOwn&#174; process. Based on this first working prototype, the Company and Octane are advancing to the next stage of development with a goal of eventually qualifying a bioreactor for full clinical use. In December 2015, the Company and Octane announced that they have made significant progress toward the development of a novel bioreactor for industrial-scale manufacture of NurOwn&#174; and had completed key development activities related to the customization of specific features of Octane&#8217;s Cocoon&#8482; instrumentation platform to enable efficient delivery of NurOwn&#174; stem cell therapy.

History 

&#160;

The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Washington on September 22, 2000, under the name Wizbang Technologies, Inc. and acquired the right to market and sell a digital data recorder product line in certain states in the U.S. Subsequently, the Company changed its name to Golden Hand Resources Inc. On July 12, 2004, the Company entered into a research and license agreement with Ramot to acquire certain stem cell technology and decided to discontinue all activities related to the sales of the digital data recorder product. In November 2004, the Company changed its name from Golden Hand Resources Inc. to Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. to better reflect its new line of business in development of novel cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. In October 2004, the Company formed its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Ltd. in Israel. On December 18, 2006, the stockholders of the Company approved a proposal to change the state of incorporation of the Company from the State of Washington to the State of Delaware. The reincorporation was completed on December 21, 2006 through the merger of the Company into a newly formed, wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of Brainstorm, also named Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics Inc. On February 19, 2013, the Israeli Subsidiary formed its wholly-owned subsidiary, Brainstorm Cell Therapeutics UK Ltd. in the United Kingdom (the &#8220;UK Subsidiary&#8221;). A reverse stock split of the Company&#8217;s shares of Common Stock by a ratio of 1-for-15 was effected on September 15, 2014 at 11:59 p.m. pursuant to an amendment to the Company&#8217;s Certificate of Incorporation approved by the stockholders of the Company on August 14, 2014. Unless otherwise indicated, all share numbers and exercise prices in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are split-adjusted.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s shares of Common Stock were approved for uplisting to the NASDAQ Capital Market, and commenced trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market when trading began on September 30, 2014. The Company&#8217;s Common Stock trades under the ticker symbol &#8220;BCLI.&#8221;

&#160;

Securities Offerings 

&#160;

On June 19, 2014, the Company, pursuant to a June 13, 2014 securities purchase agreement entered into with a group of investors, including several healthcare-focused funds (the &#8220;Investors&#8221;), effected a private placement of Common Stock and warrants to purchase Common Stock. The Company received gross proceeds of $10.5 million, resulting from the issuance and sale of 2.8 million shares of Common Stock at a price per share of $3.75. The Investors received warrants to purchase up to 2.8 million shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $5.22 per share (the &#8220;2014 Warrants&#8221;). The shares of Common Stock issued in the private placement and underlying the 2014 Warrants were registered with the SEC effective July 24, 2014.

&#160;

On January 8, 2015, holders of 2014 Warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately 2.5 million shares of our Common Stock exercised their warrants which resulted in approximately $13 million in proceeds to the Company. As part of this exercise of warrants, we issued new warrants to the holders to purchase up to an aggregate of 3.8 million shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $6.50.

&#160;

Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation to Decrease Authorized Shares 

&#160;

On August 31, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation (the &#8220;Certificate of Amendment&#8221;) with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to reduce the number of authorized shares of the Company&#8217;s Common Stock from 800,000,000 to 100,000,000. The Certificate of Amendment had been approved by the Board of Directors on August 28, 2015 and by the Company&#8217;s stockholders at the Company&#8217;s 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on August 26, 2015.

Governmental Grants 

&#160;

In February 2015, we received non-dilutive grants amounting to approximately $1.76 million, from the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist (&#8220;OCS&#8221;) bringing the cumulative amount of grants received as of December 31, 2015 to approximately $5.82 million. As of December 31, 2015, we recorded an additional grants receivable of $418,000 relating to expenses incurred by us as of that date and, in December 2015 we submitted a request for additional grants relating to our expected 2016 expenses amounting to approximately $1.8 million. This request in now under consideration of the OCS and we expect to obtain approval of our request before June 30, 2016.

Company Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our business strategy is to develop and commercialize NurOwn&#174; as a treatment for one or more neurodegenerative diseases. To this end, our efforts are currently directed to several areas in research, development and manufacturing. The ALS program represents our lead indication and is the most advanced in development, hence much of the Company&#8217;s focus is on this program. Important tasks include the continued execution of the US randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase 2 study, for which we completed enrollment in 2015. In January 2016, we published the results of our Phase 1/2 and Phase 2a studies in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Neurology medical journal. Finally, we are making preparations to begin a multi-dose study in ALS patients in Israel in 2016. Beyond ALS, we are seeking to move additional programs into clinical development. To that end, we are reviewing our existing preclinical data, initiating research in new areas like autism, and engaging with regulatory and scientific experts to determine the most attractive clinical opportunities. With regard to manufacturing, as noted above, several ongoing research projects and our collaboration with Octane have a goal of increasing the scale and efficiency of NurOwn&#174; production. Our current strategy is designed to allow the Company to be in a position to run larger, registration studies in the most efficient time frame possible. We may choose to seek a strategic partnership with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to support the execution of a registration clinical program.

&#160;

Our business model calls for significant investments in research and development. Our research and development expenditures (i) in 2015 (before participation by the OCS) were $6,335,000 which included $130,000 in stock-based compensation and (ii) in 2014 (before participation by the OCS) were $6,116,000 which included $176,000 in stock-based compensation. 

&#160; 

Stem Cell Therapy 

&#160;

Our activities are within the stem cell therapy field. Stem cells are non-specialized cells with a potential for both self-renewal and differentiation into cell types with a specialized function, such as muscle, blood or brain cells. The cells have the ability to undergo asymmetric division such that one of the two daughter cells retains the properties of the stem cell, while the other begins to differentiate into a more specialized cell type. Stem cells are therefore central to normal human growth and development, and also are a potential source of new cells for the regeneration of diseased and damaged tissue. Stem cell therapy aims to restore diseased tissue function by the replacement and/or addition of healthy cells by stem cell transplants.

&#160;

Mesenchymal stem cells (&#8220;MSCs&#8221;) are a type of stem cell that can be obtained easily from adults and used for both autologous (cells administered back to the same person from whom they were harvested) and allogeneic (cells administered to a person different than the person from whom the cells were harvested) approaches. MSCs are &#8220;multipotent&#8221; cells that can produce more than one type of specialized cell of the body, such as bone, fat, cartilage, and other types of cells. They secrete factors that promote tissue repair, and decrease inflammatory and immune reactions. The bone marrow is an invaluable source of MSCs and can be accessed through a simple procedure of aspiration. We believe that human MSCs, which are capable of in vitro growth and expansion and multipotent differentiation, are a preferable source of therapeutic stem cells.

&#160;

Neurodegenerative Diseases 

&#160;

Studies of neurodegenerative diseases suggest that symptoms that arise in afflicted individuals are secondary to defects in neuron cell function and neural circuitry. To date, systemic drug delivery approaches have not been effective in the treatment of these diseases possibly due to the blood-brain-barrier. Consequently, alternative approaches for treating neurodegenerative diseases have been attempted, such as transplantation of cells capable of replacing or supplementing the function of damaged neurons at the site of damage. For such cell replacement therapy to work, implanted cells must survive and integrate, both functionally and structurally, within the damaged tissue.

&#160;

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) 

&#160;

ALS, often referred to as &#8220;Lou Gehrig's disease,&#8221; is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS leads to progressive weakness, respiratory failure and eventually, to death, with a median survival for ALS patients is just 3-4 years from the onset of symptoms. Across the world, the prevalence of ALS is approximately 4-7 per 100,000. It is estimated that as many as 30,000 Americans have the disease at any given time, with a similar number afflicted in Europe. Estimated annual treatment costs for advanced stage patients can be as high as $200,000 (Source: Alliance for Regenerative Medicine).

&#160;

Treatment decisions are typically determined by the patient's symptoms and the stage of the disease. Some medications used for ALS patients include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Riluzole &#8211; the only medication approved by the FDA to treat ALS. Riluzole extends the time to death or ventilation by several months; however it has not been shown to improve the daily functioning of ALS patients; &#160;

&#160; &#183; Neurodex &#8211; approved by the FDA for the treatment of pseudo-bulbar affect, a type of emotional lability that sometimes develops in ALS patients, as well as in patients with other neurological diseases. &#160;

9&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Baclofen or diazepam &#8211; not FDA-approved for ALS but sometimes used to control muscle spasms, stiffness or tightening (spasticity) that interfere with daily activities; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; Trihexyphenidyl or amitriptyline &#8211; not FDA-approved for ALS but sometimes used to treat patients who have excess saliva or secretions, and emotional changes. &#160;

Other medications may be prescribed to help reduce such symptoms as fatigue, pain, sleep disturbances, constipation, and excess saliva and phlegm.

&#160;

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) 

&#160;

MS is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. Nerve cells are normally insulated with a protective layer called myelin, which allows nerve signals to travel properly. In MS, the myelin is destroyed (demyelination), causing loss of function of the nerve cells and disrupting transmission of brain messages to various parts of the body. While generally thought to be an autoimmune disease, the exact cause of MS is unknown.

&#160;

MS can cause blurred vision, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, and problems with memory and concentration. Most MS patients experience muscle weakness in their extremities and difficulty with coordination and balance. These symptoms may be severe enough to impair walking or even standing. In the worst cases, MS can produce partial or complete paralysis. Most commonly, the course of MS is waxes and wanes (&#8220;relapsing-remitting MS&#8221;), with progressive forms of the disease somewhat less common.

&#160;

There are currently over 2.5 million people with MS worldwide, with roughly 800,000 of these in the U.S. and Europe. Over 10,000 new cases are diagnosed annually in the U.S., with the majority of these in women between the ages of 20 and 50. Annual treatment costs for MS can be as much as $34,000 a year per patient.

&#160;

Treatment of MS focuses on symptom management, treatment of attacks, and reduction of disease progression. There are a variety of disease-modifying treatments FDA-approved for relapsing-remitting MS; however, patients with progressive forms of MS have limited treatment options.

&#160; 

Parkinson&#8217;s Disease (PD) 

&#160; 

PD is a chronic, progressive disorder in which dopamine-producing neurons residing in the Substantia Nigra region of the brain undergo degeneration and eventually die, resulting in progressive impairment in movement and gait and eventually, leading to dementia. The cause of the disease is unknown.

&#160;

Over 6.3 million people worldwide suffer from PD, of whom about one million are in the United States. Most people are diagnosed with the disease between the ages of 55 and 65 and about 85% of people with PD are over the age of 65. Prevalence of PD is increasing in line with the general aging of the population. The total economic burden of the disease has been estimated by the National Parkinson Foundation to exceed $14 billion annually in the U.S. alone.

&#160;

Treatment of PD primarily comprises dopamine replacement, either directly (levodopa), with dopamine mimetics or by inhibition of its breakdown. These treatments focus on treating the symptoms of the disease and are not a cure for PD. Levodopa has a propensity to cause serious motor response complications with long-term use. Moreover, effective drug dosage often requires gradual increase, leading to more adverse side effects and eventual resistance to its therapeutic action. This greatly limits patient benefit. Therefore, physicians and researchers have sought levodopa-sparing strategies in patients with early-stage disease to delay the need for levodopa.

&#160;

PD is also treated by Deep Brain Stimulation (&#8220;DBS&#8221;), which consists of implanting electrodes deep into the brain to provide permanent electrical stimulation to specific areas of the brain and to cause a delay in the activity in those areas. However, DBS is problematic as it can cause uncontrollable and severe side effects such as bleeding in the brain, infection and depression. In addition, like drug therapy, DBS focuses on treating the symptoms of PD and does not provide a cure.

&#160;

There is a greatly unsatisfied need for novel approaches towards management of PD, primarily to control levodopa-induced adverse side effects and motor dysfunction, as well as to delay the onset of disease-related dementia.

&#160;

In addition to the symptomatic drug development approaches, there is an intense effort to develop cell and gene therapeutic &#8220;curative&#8221; approaches to restore the neural function in patients with PD, by (i) replacing the dysfunctional cells with dopamine producing cell transplant, or by (ii) providing growth factors and proteins, such as GDNF, that can maintain or preserve the patient&#8217;s remaining dopaminergic cells, protecting them from further degeneration. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Autism Spectrum Disorder 

&#160;

Autism spectrum disorder is a complicated and poorly understood disorder of brain development characterized by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication and repetitive behaviors. Approximately 1% of the world population falls on the spectrum and while behavioral therapy can produce meaningful benefits in autism patients, there are no drugs approved to treat the disorder. We have studied MSC-NTF cells in the BTBR mouse strain, which exhibits several behaviors that resemble behaviors seen in autism spectrum disorders, including repetitive behaviors, altered social interactions, cognitive rigidity and impaired adaption to environment. Across a variety of measures, including assessments of repeated self-grooming, social interaction and cognitive rigidity, MSC-NTF cells caused behavioral and cognitive benefits in BTBR mice after a single treatment compared to control mice.

&#160;

&#160;

Research and License Agreement with Ramot 

&#160;

On July 12, 2004, we entered into a Research and License Agreement (the &#8220;Original Ramot Agreement&#8221;) with Ramot, the technology licensing company of Tel Aviv University, which agreement was amended on March 30, 2006 by the Amended Research and License Agreement (described below). Under the terms of the Original Ramot Agreement, Ramot granted to us a license to (i) the inventions, know-how and results made with respect to the above-mentioned stem cell technology developed by the team led by Prof. Melamed and Prof. Offen in the course of the performance of the research, and the patents and pending patent applications owned by Ramot, and (ii) the results of further research to be performed by the same team on the development of the stem cell technology. Simultaneously with the execution of the Original Ramot Agreement, we entered into individual consulting agreements with Prof. Melamed and Prof. Offen pursuant to which all intellectual property developed by Prof. Melamed or Prof. Offen in the performance of services thereunder will be owned by Ramot and licensed to us under the Original Ramot Agreement.

&#160;

Under the Original Ramot Agreement, we agreed to fund further research relating to the licensed technology in an amount of $570,000 per year for an initial period of two years, and for an additional two-year period if certain research milestones were met.

&#160;

In consideration for the license, we originally agreed to pay Ramot:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; An up-front license fee payment of $100,000; &#160; &#8226; An amount equal to 5% of all net sales of products; and &#160; &#8226; An amount equal to 30% of all sublicense receipts. &#160;

On March 30, 2006 and on May 23, 2006, we entered into an Amended Research and License Agreement and an Amendment Agreement to the Amended Research and License Agreement, respectively (collectively, the &#8220;Amended Research and License Agreement&#8221;) with Ramot. Under the Amended Research and License Agreement, the funding of further research relating to the licensed technology in an amount of $570,000 per year was reduced to $380,000 per year. Moreover, under the Amended Research and License Agreement, the initial period of time that we agreed to fund the research was extended from an initial period of two (2) years to an initial period of three (3) years. The Amended Research and License Agreement also extended the additional two-year period in the Original Ramot Agreement to an additional three-year period, if certain research milestones were met.

&#160;

We entered into a Second Amended and Restated Research and License Agreement with Ramot on July 26, 2007, effective July 12, 2004 (the &#8220;Second Ramot Agreement&#8221;), which amended and replaced the Amended Research and License Agreement. The Second Ramot Agreement imposed on us development and commercialization obligations, milestone and other obligations. The license was granted in consideration for (i) royalty payments ranging from three percent (3%) to five percent (5%) of all net sales and (ii) potential payments concerning sublicenses ranging from twenty percent (20%) to twenty-five percent (25%) of sublicense receipts. In addition, in the event that the research period was extended for an additional three year period in accordance with the terms of the Second Ramot Agreement, then we had to make payments to Ramot for each year of the extended research period in the amount of $380,000. As of June 30, 2007, we owed Ramot an aggregate amount of $513,249 in overdue payments and patent fees under the Amended Research and License Agreement.

&#160;

On August 1, 2007, we obtained a waiver and release from Ramot pursuant to which Ramot agreed to an amended payment schedule regarding our payment obligations under the Second Ramot Agreement and waived all claims against us resulting from our previous breaches, defaults and non-payment under the Amended Research and License Agreement.

&#160;

After our failure to meet the amended payment schedule and subsequent negotiations, on December 24, 2009, we entered into a Letter Agreement and an amended agreement to the Second Ramot Agreement (collectively, the &#8220;Letter Agreement&#8221;) with Ramot, pursuant to which, among other things, Ramot agreed to: (i) release us from our obligation to fund three years of additional research (which would have totaled $1,140,000) and (ii) accept conversion of certain research payments due in the amount of $272,000 into 74,666 shares of our Common Stock. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, we agreed, among other things, to: (i) reimburse Ramot for outstanding patent-related expenses; and (ii) abandon our rights in certain joint patent rights and patents of Ramot in certain countries.

&#160;

As of February 2011, Ramot had sold the 74,666 shares of Common Stock of the Company for approximately $235,000 and we paid the remaining $5,000 due to Ramot. To date there is no additional debt to Ramot.

&#160;

On December 20, 2011, we entered into an Assignment Agreement with our Israeli Subsidiary (the &#8220;Assignment Agreement&#8221;), with the consent of Ramot. Under the Assignment Agreement, we assigned and transferred all of our rights, interests, titles, liabilities and obligations (the &#8220;Rights&#8221;) under the Second Ramot Agreement to our Israeli Subsidiary, effective as of January 1, 2007 and our Israeli Subsidiary agreed to assume all such Rights. We agreed to be a guarantor of all obligations of our Israeli Subsidiary under the Second Ramot Agreement and Ramot can look to us to demand compliance with the Second Ramot Agreement.

&#160;

In May 2012, we, the Israeli Subsidiary and Prof. Offen entered into a Consulting Agreement, effective as of January 1, 2012, which replaced the previous consulting agreement, dated July 31, 2004, pursuant to which all work product resulting from the provision of services will vest solely with the Israeli Subsidiary and if any work product resulting from the provision of services results in the creation or development of intellectual property it will be deemed a joint invention, and will be jointly owned by Ramot and the Israeli Subsidiary.

&#160;

On April 30, 2014 our Israeli Subsidiary and Ramot entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Second Ramot Agreement, pursuant to which a new research period from April 30, 2014 to October 30, 2014 was created.

&#160;

13&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

On March 1, 2016, our Israeli Subsidiary and Ramot entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Second Ramot Agreement, pursuant to which Ramot agreed to assign to the Israeli Subsidiary, effective February 18, 2016, all of its worldwide right, title and interest in and to the results of the research conducted under the Agreement and performed during the research period from April 30, 2014 to October 30, 2014. This change of status from exclusive licensee of these patents, to owner these patents, did not materially change the ability of the Company to exclude others from practicing the invention claimed therein.

&#160;

Government Regulations and Supervision 

&#160;

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#160;

Once fully developed, we intend to market our bone marrow derived differentiated neurothrophic-factor secreting cell products, NurOwn&#174;, for autologous transplantation in patients by neurosurgeons in medical facilities in the U.S., Europe, Japan and the Pacific Rim. We plan to submit a biologics license application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) in the United States from the development of NurOwn&#174; for the treatment of ALS patients. We initiated the regulatory process with a Pre-IND meeting with the FDA in September 2012, and submitted our IND application in December 2013. We have retained expert regulatory consultants to assist us in our approaches to the FDA.

&#160;

In January 2013, the EMA Committee for Advanced Therapies classified NurOwn&#174; as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product.

&#160;

Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must receive final approval from the FDA before they may legally be marketed in the United States or by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before it may be legally marketed in foreign countries.

&#160;

U.S. Drug Development Process 

&#160;

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Biologics are subject to regulation by the FDA under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and related regulations and other federal, state and local laws and regulations. Biological products are therapies used to treat disease and health conditions. They include a wide variety of products including vaccines, blood and blood components, gene therapies, tissue and proteins. Unlike most prescription products made through chemical processes, biological products generally are made from human and/or animal materials. To be lawfully marketed in interstate commerce, a biologic product must be the subject of a BLA, issued by the FDA on the basis of a demonstration that the product is safe, pure and potent, and that the facility in which the product is manufactured meets standards to assure that it continues to be safe, pure and potent. The FDA has developed and is continuously updating the requirements with respect to cell and gene therapy products and has issued documents concerning the regulation of cellular and tissue-based products. Manufacturers of cell and tissue-based products must comply with the FDA&#8217;s current good tissue practices, or cGTP, which are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of such products. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease.

&#160;

The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, product detention, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biological product or drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices or other regulations; &#160; &#183; Submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; &#160; &#183; Performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product or drug for its intended use; &#160; &#183; Submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a new drug; or a biologic license application for a new biological product; &#160; &#183; Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s or biologic&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and &#160; &#183; FDA review and approval of the BLA or NDA. &#160;

14&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The testing and approval process require substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

&#160;

Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing phase. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin or, once begun, issues will not arise that result in the suspension or termination of such trial.

&#160;

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Once an IND is in effect, each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval.

&#160;

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients having the specific disease. &#160; &#183; Phase 2. Phase 2 trials involve investigations in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and the optimal dosage and schedule. &#160; &#183; Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for regulatory approval and product labeling. &#160;

Post-approval studies, also called Phase 4 trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approvals. These studies are used to obtain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process.

&#160;

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected side effects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

&#160;

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

&#160;

During the development of a new drug or biologic, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. An SPA is intended to provide assurance that if the agreed upon clinical trial protocol is followed, the clinical trial endpoints are achieved, and there is a favorable risk-benefit profile, the data may serve as the primary basis for an efficacy claim in support of a BLA or an NDA. However, an SPA is not a guarantee of an approval of a product candidate or any permissible claims about the product candidate. In particular, SPAs are not binding on the FDA if previously unrecognized public health concerns arise during the performance of the clinical trial, other new scientific concerns regarding the product candidate&#8217;s safety or efficacy arise, or if the sponsoring company fails to comply with the agreed upon clinical trial protocol.

&#160;

15&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the biologic or drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees which may be waived under certain limited circumstances.

&#160;

FDA Review of Biologics License Applications and New Drug Applications 

&#160;

The FDA reviews all BLAs and NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA or an NDA for filing. In this event, the BLA or NDA must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has ten months in which to complete the initial review of a standard BLA or NDA and respond to the applicant and six months for a priority BLA or NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs or NDAs. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe, pure, and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, purity and potency. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements, and additionally, in the case of biologics in accordance with cGTP guidelines, and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may refer the NDA or BLA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee.

&#160;

The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve a BLA or NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information.

&#160;

Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA or NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the BLA or NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the BLA or NDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to conform the application to a condition suitable for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA or NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or request an opportunity for a hearing.

&#160;

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug&#8217;s or biologic&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after BLA or NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

&#160;

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160; 

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. However, orphan product designation does provide the potential for a period of exclusivity and we may be eligible for grant funding of up to $400,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee.

&#160;

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug&#8217;s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant&#8217;s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our drug or biological candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor's product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar but not identical benefits in the European Union.

&#160;

16&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In February 2011, we received Orphan Drug Designation for NurOwn&#174; for the treatment of ALS in the United States. In July 2013, we received Orphan Medicinal Product Designation for NurOwn&#174; for the treatment of ALS from the European Commission. Orphan designation grants a 10-year marketing exclusivity in the EU for the designated indication, as well as several other regulatory incentives.

&#160;

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

&#160; 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between (a) the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or an NDA plus (b) the time between the submission date of a BLA or an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent and within 60 days of approval of the drug or biologic. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.

&#160; 

Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 

&#160;

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to create a new licensure framework for biosimilar products, which could ultimately subject our biological product candidates to competition. Under the BPCIA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biological product that is &#34;biosimilar to&#34; or &#34;interchangeable with&#34; a referenced, branded biologic product. Previously, there had been no licensure pathway for such biosimilar or interchangeable products. For purposes of the BPCIA, a reference product is defined as the single biological product licensed under a full BLA against which a biological product is evaluated in an application submitted under a follow-on BLA.

&#160;

The BPCIA also created a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity, which can be extended to 12.5 years with pediatric exclusivity. The 12-year exclusivity period begins on the date of first licensure of the reference product under the PHSA and during which the licensure of a follow-on application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product cannot be made effective. During the first four years (or four and one-half years with pediatric exclusivity) of the 12-year period, an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable version of the reference product cannot be submitted to the FDA. Under budget proposals submitted by President Obama, the Administration has requested that reference product exclusivity would decrease from twelve to seven years. Congress has not yet enacted such a change in the BPCIA, but could move to enact such a decrease in the reference product exclusivity period.

&#160;

The BPCIA includes limits on obtaining 12-year reference product exclusivity for certain changes or modifications to the reference product. A separate 12-year reference product exclusivity period does not apply to:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; a BLA supplement for the product that is the reference product; &#160; &#183; a subsequent BLA filed by the same reference product sponsor or manufacturer (or a licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength; or &#160; &#183; a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. &#160;

In February 2012, the FDA issued three draft guidance documents on biosimilar product development. The FDA is soliciting comments on the draft guidance documents which are described by the FDA as follows: (1) Scientific Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product, which is intended to assist companies in demonstrating that a proposed therapeutic protein product is biosimilar to a reference product for the purpose of submitting an application, called a &#34;351(k)&#34; application, to the FDA. This draft guidance describes a risk-based &#34;totality-of-the-evidence&#34; approach that the FDA intends to use to evaluate the data and information submitted in support of a determination of biosimilarity of the proposed product to the reference product; (2) Quality Considerations in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Protein Product, which provides an overview of analytical factors to consider when assessing biosimilarity between a proposed therapeutic protein product and a reference product for the purpose of submitting a 351(k) application; and (3) Biosimilars: Questions and Answers Regarding Implementation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which provides answers to common questions from people interested in developing biosimilar products. We cannot predict when or whether these draft guidance documents will ever be finalized or what changes the agency may make in its approach to implementation of the BPCIA.

&#160;

17&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to creating a 12-year period of reference product exclusivity, the BPCIA clarifies the interaction of that exclusivity with orphan drug exclusivity, such that, if a reference product has been designated for a rare disease or condition the licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable version of a reference product for such disease or condition may only occur after the later of the expiration of any applicable seven-year orphan drug exclusivity or the 12-year reference product exclusivity (or seven and one-half years and 12.5 years with pediatric exclusivity).

&#160;

Our biological product candidates, if approved, could be considered reference products entitled to 12-year exclusivity. Even if our products are considered to be reference products eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of any of our biological products if the FDA approves a full BLA for such product containing the sponsor's own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product.

&#160;

The BPCIA also sets forth a complex mechanism for resolving patent disputes that involves a step-wise exchange of information prior to the initiation of a patent infringement lawsuit against a biosimilar or interchangeable product sponsor. Unlike the Hatch-Waxman Act, the BPCIA provides no automatic stay on approval of a biosimilar product application, except an interchangeable product receives the lesser of one year of exclusivity after the date of first commercial marketing or 18 months of exclusivity after a final court decision or dismissal of a patent challenge or, if the applicant has not been sued, after approval. The BPCIA does not prevent a competitor from conducting its own clinical trials and submitting a full BLA on the same or similar product.

&#160;

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160; 

Any drugs for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects with the product, reporting of changes in distributed products which would require field alert reports (FARs) for drugs and biological product deviation reports (BPDRs), providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. In September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted, giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority, including the authority to require postmarketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies, or REMS, approved by the FDA. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs and biologics may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers of drugs and biologics must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

&#160;

Drug and biologic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, GTP applicable to biologics, and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release.

&#160;

The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product subsequent to its approval may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties.

&#160;

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.

&#160;

Foreign Regulation 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to clinically evaluate or sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States.

&#160;

18&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Third Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any of our biologic or drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In both the United States and foreign markets, our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully, and to attract commercialization partners for our product candidates, depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including, in the United States, governmental payors such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, managed care organizations, and private health insurers. Medicare is a federally funded program managed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, through local fiscal intermediaries and carriers that administer coverage and reimbursement for certain healthcare items and services furnished to the elderly and disabled. Medicaid is an insurance program for certain categories of patients whose income and assets fall below state defined levels and who are otherwise uninsured that is both federally and state funded and managed by each state. The federal government sets general guidelines for Medicaid and each state creates specific regulations that govern its individual program. Each payor has its own process and standards for determining whether it will cover and reimburse a procedure or particular product. Private payors often rely on the lead of the governmental payors in rendering coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable CMS coverage and reimbursement is usually a significant gating issue for successful introduction of a new product. The competitive position of some of our products will depend, in part, upon the extent of coverage and adequate reimbursement for such products and for the procedures in which such products are used. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by the government and other payors.

&#160;

The U.S. Congress and state legislatures may, from time to time, propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost containment, which could impact our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. For example, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revises the definition of &#8220;average manufacturer price&#8221; for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective. Further, the law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law.

&#160;

Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Moreover, in the coming years, additional changes could be made to governmental healthcare programs that could significantly impact the success of our product candidates.

&#160;

The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by current and future healthcare reforms.

&#160;

Some third party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices, biologics or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers that use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our product candidates and operate profitably.

&#160;

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug or biological candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and biologics, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

&#160;

19&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

&#160; 

In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. These regulations include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; &#160; &#183; federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government reimbursement programs that are false or fraudulent; &#160; &#183; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; &#160; &#183; the federal transparency requirements under the Health Care Reform Law requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to physician payments and other transfers of value and physician ownership and investment interests; &#160; &#183; the FDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug and biologic product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug or biologic products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; and &#160; &#183; state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. &#160;

Compliance with Environmental, Health and Safety Laws 

&#160;

In addition to FDA regulations, we are also subject to evolving federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In the past, compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures. We believe that we comply in all material respects with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to us. Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the future may require additional capital expenditures.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We intend to establish and maintain fully-equipped cGMP-certified Cell-Processing Centers in strategic locations to conduct NurOwn&#174; production and distribution over the broadest geographic area. Each Cell-Processing Center would receive an initial bone marrow sample of the patient, harvested at a medical center. The patient&#8217;s MSC cells would be isolated and expanded, in order to produce an initial dose of NurOwn&#174; cells. A master cell bank for each individual patient would be cryopreserved and maintained for production of subsequent, future NurOwn&#174; doses on a long-term basis for future treatments. These doses would be produced as needed and transported to the medical centers, where they would then be transplanted back into the patient.

&#160;

We intend to seek partnering opportunities with a strategic partner as we progress towards advanced clinical development and commercialization.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

There are a number of clinical trials underway for potential treatments for ALS, of which only two are stem cell-based trials being conducted by other commercial entities: (i) US-based Neuralstem (CUR) is currently conducting a Phase 2 trial for its allogeneic, human (fetal) spinal cord derived neural stem cells; and (ii) Q Therapeutics has gained FDA approval for a Phase 1/2 study with its Q-Cells &#174; , purified human glial progenitor cells isolated from brain tissue. Corestem, a Korean company, recently completed a Phase 1 trial in ALS showing that repeated intrathecal administration of autologous, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells was safe. No significant clinical benefit was reported. There is little public information available about Corestem. Five non-stem cell-based companies are undergoing Phase 1/2, Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials for ALS. Cytokinetics is a late stage biopharmaceutical company running a Phase 3 clinical trial with Tirasemtiv, a chemical compound developed to enhance the signals between motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). A number of academic institutions are also developing treatment candidates for ALS.
