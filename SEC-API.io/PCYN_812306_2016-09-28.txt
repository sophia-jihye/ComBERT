 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

History and Organization 

&#160; 

Procyon Corporation (&#34;Procyon&#34; or the &#34;Company&#34;) consolidates the operations of Procyon with Amerx Health Care Corporation &#174; (&#34;Amerx&#34;) and Sirius Medical Supply, Inc. (&#34;Sirius&#34;), its wholly-owned subsidiaries, for financial purposes. Collectively throughout this report, Procyon, Amerx and Sirius may be referred to as the &#34;Company,&#34; &#34;us,&#34; or &#34;we&#34; or &#34;our.&#34; 

&#160; 

&#160; Procyon, a Colorado corporation, was incorporated on March 19, 1987, and was deemed a development stage company until May 1996, when we acquired Amerx, a corporation based in Clearwater, Florida, which was wholly owned by John C. Anderson, our deceased Chief Executive Officer. Amerx develops and markets proprietary medical products used in the treatment of pressure ulcers, stasis ulcers, wounds, dermatitis, inflammation and other skin problems. Historically, Amerx's products are sold through distributors to healthcare institutions including hospitals, wound care clinics, nursing homes and home health care agencies and to retailers including national and regional chain stores and pharmacies and to healthcare practitioners who treat wounds. Sirius no longer has any material operations.

Products 

&#160; 

Major product lines - AMERX, AMERIGEL &#174; , HELIX3 Bioactive Collagen &#174; 

&#160; 

Amerx markets a proprietary line of AMERIGEL &#174; advanced skin and wound care products made with Oakin &#174; , proven to promote healing in wound and problematic skin conditions including the AMERIGEL &#174; Hydrogel Wound Dressing, AMERIGEL &#174; Hydrogel Gauze Dressing, AMERIGEL &#174; Post Op Surgical Kits, AMERIGEL &#174; Saline Wound Wash, AMERIGEL &#174; Care Lotion and AMERIGEL &#174; Barrier Lotion. These products have become the core for building the foundation for Amerx to grow. In the second half of fiscal 2015, Amerx expanded their product brands by introducing the HELIX3 Bioactive Collagen &#174; . HELIX3 is available in two forms, Collagen Powder (HELIX3 CP &#174; ) and Collagen Matrix (HELIX3 CM &#174; ) developed to address markets segments previously unavailable to Amerx. In fiscal 2016, Amerx continued its brand expansion by introducing the AMERX branded wound care product line. The new line consists of: AMERX Calcium Alginate Dressing, AMERX Foam Dressing, AMERX Gauze Dressing, AMERX Hyrdocolloid Dressing, and Amerx Wound Care Kits including AMERX Calcium Alginate Wound Care Kit, AMERX Collagen Matrix Wound Care Kit, AMERX Collagen Powder Wound Care Kit, AMERX Foam Wound Care Kit and AMERX Hydrogel Wound Care Kit. The new products have demonstrated early success and product expansions have made it possible for Amerx to have success in providing treatments outside its historical niche. Amerx looks to continue this new product trend in fiscal 2017. 

&#160; 

Amerx wound care products sold under the brand names AMERIGEL, HELIX3 and AMERX have received approval for Medicare reimbursement, assigned by the Pricing, Data Analysis and Coding contractor for Medicare and Medicaid (&#34;PDAC&#34;). We believe that this reimbursement code is beneficial to Amerx's business, allowing customers on Medicare to seek coverage for use of these products. 

&#160; 

Amerx spent approximately $20,000 towards research and development efforts over the past fiscal year. These efforts were directed towards additional studies aimed at proving product safety and efficacy and expanding existing markets and new products, as well as correcting FDA and manufacturing compliance issues. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The AMERIGEL &#174; product line with OAKIN is based on proprietary formulations which are protected as trade secret information and with registered trademarks. HELIX3 &#174; , HELIX3 CP &#174; , HELIX3 CM &#174; and HELIX3 Bioactive Collagen &#174; , OAKIN &#174; are registered trademarks of Amerx Health Care. All products are registered with the Food and Drug Administration (&#34;FDA&#34;). 

&#160; 

Amerx product lines continue to gain acceptance within the health care community. Amerx owns and operates three different websites. The sites can be viewed at www.amerigel.com, www.amerxhc.com, and www.amerxstore.com. These websites provide viewer-focused information about Amerx's products to consumers (amerigel.com) and health care providers (amerxhc.com). Amerxstore.com is equipped to handle direct sales to the public. 

&#160; 

Market for Products 

&#160; 

The market for Amerx's skin and wound care products is primarily comprised of hospitals, wound care centers, nursing homes, home health care agencies and health care practioners. We believe that Amerx products offer quality, moderately priced, efficacious treatment options for acute and chronic wounds/ulcers and reoccurring skin conditions most often treated by health care professionals. We have expanded our product line to cover more issues revolving around wound care treatment. We are continuing our efforts to penetrate new and existing sectors within the health care market, including sales to government agencies. 

&#160; 

The retail market for Amerx's skin care and wound care products is comprised mainly of national and regional chain stores as well as independent retail pharmacies. 

&#160; 

Distribution and Sales 

&#160; 

Amerx&#8217;s traditional method of distribution has been through retail and institutional distributors. We expect to continue increasing our distributor base, particularly with distributors capable of introducing Amerx&#8217;s products in new medical specialty markets, in new geographical areas and to new retail chains. Distributors typically purchase products from Amerx on standard credit terms (2%10, Net 30). Amerx supports its distributors through product literature, advertising and participation at industry trade shows. All existing distributors sell Amerx products on a non-exclusive basis. 

&#160; 

We periodically receive inquiries about international market distribution for the AMERIGEL &#174; product line. These inquiries have been generated by our advertising, market presence and web sites (www.amerxhc.com and www.amerigel.com). We respond to and pursue all such inquiries, while complying with applicable international 

regulatory guidelines. 

&#160; 

In fiscal 2016, Amerx generated all of our net sales of approximately $3,449,000. 

&#160; 

Significant Customer 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016, two customers accounted for approximately 21% of Amerx&#8217;s sales. The loss of these customers could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and the results of our operations. The Company has been able to maintain relationships with its distributors and has been able to establish relationships with new distributors each year. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016, the majority of manufacturing of Amerx&#8217;s products was completed by non-affiliated manufacturing facilities. Amerx has written contracts with its manufacturers (and there are no minimum purchase requirements). The agreements / arrangements made with manufacturers reduces the potential risk associated with relying on a single manufacturer. Amerx believes there are additional companies that could manufacture Amerx products according to specifications, if necessary. 

&#160; 

Amerx&#8217;s manufacturing and packaging activities are performed pursuant to Current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;CGMP&#8221;) as defined under the United States Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the &#8220;FFDC Act&#8221;) and the regulations promulgated under the FFDC Act. All manufacturing activities are required to comply with the product specifications, supplies and test methods developed by Amerx specifically for its products, as well as the CGMP. 

&#160; 

A single source currently furnishes a proprietary ingredient contained in the AMERIGEL &#174; products. Amerx does not have a written contract with this supplier, however, management believes that, if necessary, an alternative supplier could be secured within a reasonable period of time. The manufacturer generally provides other raw materials and ingredients and we believe there are numerous other sources for these materials and ingredients. However, there can be no assurance that Amerx would be able to timely secure an alternative supplier and the failure to replace this supplier in a timely manner could materially harm Amerx's results of operations. 

&#160; 

Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

In January 1999, the United States Patent and Trademark Office registered the Company's AMERIGEL &#174; trademark. Amerx also holds a registered Trademark for the principal proprietary ingredient used in AMERIGEL &#174; products, Oakin &#174; . In fiscal 2016, Amerx received registered trademark approval for the HELIX3 CP &#174; name and HELIX3 CM &#174; name, HELIX3 Logo and new Oakin logo. Amerx relies on a combination of trademark and trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The market for skin and wound care treatment products in which Amerx operates is highly competitive. Competition is based on product efficacy, brand recognition, loyalty, quality, price and availability of shelf space in the retail market. Amerx competes against several well-capitalized companies offering a range of skin treatment products as well as small competitors having a limited number of products. Amerx has successfully established its products efficacy and value within specialized health care markets and expects to continue to expand this marketplace. 

&#160; 

Order Placement and Backlog 

&#160; 

There were no back orders as of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. 

Governmental Approvals and Regulations 

&#160;

The production and marketing of our products are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the United States. Amerx's advertising and sales practices are subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the &#8220;FTC&#8221;), the FDA and state agencies. The FFDC Act, as amended, the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of Amerx's products. The FDA regulates the contents, labeling and advertising of Amerx's products. Amerx may be required to obtain FDA approval for proposed nonprescription products. This procedure involves extensive clinical research, and separate FDA approvals are required at various stages of product development. The approval process requires, among other things, presentation of substantial evidence to the FDA, based on clinical studies, as to the safety and efficacy of the proposed product. After approval, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in production and quality control to assure continual compliance with the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) regulations.

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We believe that, as of June 30, 2016 we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to our operations in all material respects. Compliance with the various provisions of national, state and local laws and regulations has had a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, financial position, liquidity and competitive position of the Company. We have incurred and will continue to incur costs in order to remain compliant with the latest regulations of the SEC and the FDA. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;
