 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

SCYNEXIS is a pharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of novel anti-infectives to address significant unmet therapeutic needs. We are developing our lead product candidate, SCY-078, as a novel oral and intravenous (IV) drug for the treatment of several fungal infections, including serious and life-threatening invasive fungal infections. SCY-078 is a novel and structurally distinct glucan synthase inhibitor that has been shown to be effective in vitro &#32;and in vivo &#32;in animal studies against a broad range of Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;species, including drug-resistant strains, and we are continuing to conduct additional in vitro &#32;and in vivo &#32;studies to further characterize the spectrum of activity of SCY-078. Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;species are the fungi responsible for approximately 85% of all invasive fungal infections in the United States and Europe. We have completed multiple Phase 1 studies with the oral formulation of SCY-078 and we are currently conducting our first Phase 1 study with the IV formulation of SCY-078. We are also conducting two Phase 2 studies with the oral formulation of SCY-078: 

&#8226; 

the first study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of SCY-078 as oral step-down treatment in patients initially treated with IV echinocandin therapy for invasive Candida &#32;infections and; 

&#8226; 

the second study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of orally administered SCY-078 for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). 

SCY-078 holds both Fast Track and Qualified Infections Disease Product (QIDP) designations for the IV and oral formulations for the indications of invasive candidiasis (including candidemia) and invasive aspergillosis. We expect to complete and report top line data associated with our two Phase 2 studies, our Phase 1 study and our additional in vitro &#32;and in vivo &#32;studies by the end of the second quarter of 2016. &#32; 

As a spinout from Aventis S.A., or Aventis in 2000, we began as a chemistry and animal health services company, providing contract research services to third parties. Through the provision of these contract research and development services, we built significant expertise in parasitic infections and drug discovery, including expanded animal health capabilities. This contract research and development services business, which we refer to as our &#8220;Services Business,&#8221; generated substantially all of our revenue until we completed the sale of the Services Business to Accuratus Lab Services, Inc. in July 2015, as described further in the &#8220;Recent Developments&#8221; section of Item 7 of this Annual Report. Since our formation, in addition to SCY-078 and related antifungal compounds, we have discovered a number of proprietary compounds, including those within our cyclophilin inhibitor platform. We are currently focusing our resources on the development of SCY-078. In the future, we may develop other assets within our proprietary portfolio of antifungal or cyclophilin inhibitor compounds either in-house or through collaborations with strategic development partners. Additionally, we may assess external opportunities to expand our clinical pipeline. &#32;

Market Opportunity 

We estimate that, each year, there are over 600,000 cases of invasive fungal infections caused by various species of Candida &#32;and Aspergillus , the two most common invasive fungal pathogens, globally. The estimated incidence in the U.S. for these conditions is approximately 98,000 and 46,000 for invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis, respectively. The rapid progression of disease and high mortality rates associated with documented invasive fungal infections often result in antifungal therapy being administered in suspected (unconfirmed) cases or as a preventative measure in patients at high risk. For example, we estimate the total number of patients treated for suspected invasive Candida &#32;infections to be approximately three to four times the number of confirmed cases. Also, the increasingly widespread use of immune suppressive drugs as cancer chemotherapy or for organ transplantation or treatment of autoimmune disease has resulted in an increasing population of patients at risk for invasive fungal infections. Furthermore, the limited number of antifungal drug classes, consisting of azoles, echinocandins and polyenes, and their widespread use, has led to increased numbers of infections with drug-resistant strains. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has listed fluconazole-resistant Candida as a serious threat requiring prompt and sustained action. 

Among the antifungal classes available for the treatment of invasive fungal infections, only the azoles can be administered orally, imposing the need to use IV antifungal agents for the treatment of infections caused or suspected to be caused by azole-resistant Candida &#32;or Aspergillus &#32;strains. Current treatment guidelines in the U.S. and in Europe recommend the use of echinocandins (the only glucan synthase inhibitor currently commercially available) as the initial therapy for invasive candidiasis. The main limitation of the echinocandin class is that only IV administration is available, limiting the flexibility of stepping down to an oral therapy in the same treatment class. The ability to step down to an oral therapy is important because it allows the patient to be discharged from the hospital, as intravenous administration generally must occur in the hospital. The only option currently available to step down to an oral therapy after initial IV echinocandin are the azoles, which have a different mechanism of action from echinocandins ( i.e. , not glucan synthesis inhibitors), and have reported an increased frequency of resistant isolates, thus creating a gap in optimal treatment options for patients able to tolerate oral therapies. 

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis, commonly known as a "yeast infection," is usually caused by Candida albicans &#32;but non-albicans species of Candida , such as Candida glabrata , have increasingly been identified as a cause of VVC. The estimated annual incidence in the U.S. for this condition is approximately six million cases and approximately 7-9% of these cases are considered recurrent and among the most difficult to treat. Current treatments for acute VVC include topical antifungals and the use of prescription oral antifungals such as fluconazole, which has a therapeutic cure rate of 55% as reported in its label. There are no products currently approved for the treatment of recurrent VVC. 

SCY-078 represents a new chemical class of glucan synthase inhibitors designed to block an established target in infectious fungi. SCY-078 is being developed as oral and IV formulations and has demonstrated potent in in vitro &#32;activity against a large collection of medically relevant strains of Candida &#32;and Aspergillus , including multi-drug resistant strains that have been isolated from infected patients. We have conducted studies of SCY-078 using animal models that were used in the development of previously approved antifungal drugs, where these models were proven to be predictive of efficacy in humans. Using these well-established animal models, SCY-078 was shown to be highly active against Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;species . SCY-078 blood concentrations were measured in a subset of the studies in the murine (i.e., mouse) model of candidiasis to determine levels required for efficacy. In subsequent Phase 1 studies, in healthy human volunteers receiving the oral formulation of SCY-078, the blood concentrations of SCY-078 achieved and met the levels predicted to be effective in treating invasive Candida &#32;infections in the animal models and, at these exposures, SCY-078 orally administered was well tolerated. 

SCY-078 has unique attributes that define its potential to address significant unmet medical needs and market opportunities, including: 

&#8226; 

only glucan synthase inhibitor with both oral and IV formulations in clinical development, allowing first-line treatment and oral step down in the same class; 

&#8226; 

distinct chemical structure from other glucan synthase inhibitors, allowing unique spectrum of activity and pharmacokinetic profile; 

&#8226; 

fungicidal (i.e., killing the fungi) capabilities against Candida &#32;species compared to azoles, which are fungistatic (i.e., inhibiting the growth of fungi); 

&#8226; 

activity against azole- and most echinocandin-resistant Candida &#32;strains; and 

&#8226; 

activity against azole-resistant Aspergillus &#32;strains. 

Based on SCY-078&#8217;s attributes and limitations of current approved therapies, we believe, if approved, our product can address therapeutic needs in three primary indications: 

&#32;5 

&#8226; 

invasive candidiasis 

&#8226; 

recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, or recurrent VVC (commonly known as a "yeast infection") 

&#8226; 

invasive aspergillosis 

In the future we may also consider other indications for SCY-078, including prophylaxis and use for chronic invasive fungal infections. 

If approved for the indications of invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis, we intend to market SCY-078 to hospitals and major medical centers, where critical care physicians, infectious disease specialists, and physicians treating immune-compromised patients, such as oncologists and those performing solid organ transplants and stem cell transplants, are likely to be found and where invasive fungal infections are more prevalent. If approved for the indication of vulvovaginal candidiasis, we intend to market SCY-078 to physicians specializing in women's health. 

Our positioning strategies are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Fluconazole-resistant Candida. &#32;&#32; C. albicans &#32;is the predominant cause of fungal infections and represents a serious public health threat with significant medical and economic importance due to high mortality and increased costs of care and duration of hospitalizations. Azoles, primarily fluconazole, are the primary drugs utilized for these infections today, especially for invasive candidiasis and VVC, including recurrent VVC. However, medical guidelines are recommending that echinocandins be used for invasive candidiasis due to increasing resistance of azoles, especially fluconazole. In invasive candidiasis, VVC and recurrent VVC, infections due to non-albicans are increasing and are more likely in patients reporting current antibiotic use and coinciding with routine use of oral fluconazole. C. glabrata &#32;is intrinsically more resistant to fluconazole. Studies have reported as high as 50% of Candida &#32;species are non-albican for invasive candidiasis and as low as 10-20% for VVC. There is a need for alternative therapies, especially oral agents, given these growing statistics. SCY-078 is active against azole-resistant strains of Candida &#32;and by virtue of its fungicidal activity against Candida, &#32;it may provide a benefit in the treatment of invasive candidiasis, VVC and recurrent VVC. If approved, we believe SCY-078 would be positioned as the first and only oral and IV non-azole alternative for the treatment of fungal infections in hospital and outpatient settings. SCY-078 would particularly address the need of an oral agent for those patients infected with azole-resistant strains. Considering its activity against multidrug-resistant strains, SCY-078 is targeted for positioning as a safer and effective therapy for multidrug-resistant Candida &#32;strains with the flexibility of oral and IV administration. 

&#8226; 

Alternative and complementary to echinocandin regimens. &#32;Echinocandins are currently the recommended initial therapy for invasive candidiasis, but echinocandins can only be administered intravenously. Discharge from hospital with step-down to an oral azole risks relapse of an azole-resistant infection if the original pathogen was not identified and susceptibility determined. This leads some physicians to keep patients on IV echinocandins for the full course of therapy. If approved, SCY-078 would be positioned as the optimal step-down option after initial IV echinocandin therapy in patients with invasive candidiasis, allowing them to complete the full treatment with a glucan synthase inhibitor rather than switching to azoles. The IV-to-oral step-down within a single therapeutic class may allow earlier patient discharge from the hospital, resulting in reduced exposure to the risk of hospital-acquired infections and reduced costs of care. &#32;&#32; The IV formulation of SCY-078 would be positioned as an alternative treatment option to echinocandins, particularly relevant for those patients with infections due to echinocandin-resistant Candida . 

&#8226; 

Alternative to second generation azoles for Aspergillus. &#32;The IV and oral formulations of SCY-078 would be positioned as an alternative to currently available treatment options, such as voriconazole or isavuconazole, when treating azole-resistant Aspergillus &#32;infections or when the treatment with a glucan synthase inhibitor with fewer drug-drug interactions than azoles would be desirable. 

&#8226; 

Alternative to polyenes for treatment of multi-drug-resistant Candida. The only antifungal alternative currently available to treat invasive Candida &#32;spp. infections due to suspected or known azole- and echinocandin-resistant strains are the polyenes, such as Amphoteracin B, which are only available intravenously and have significant toxicities associated with their use. The IV and oral formulations of SCY-078 would be positioned as a safer alternative to Amphoteracin B when treating multi-drug-resistant strains. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;SCY-078 Development 

&#32;We are developing both IV and oral formulations of SCY-078. Patients with invasive &#32; fungal &#32; infections are typically prescribed IV treatment in hospitals and then are switched, or &#8220;stepped down,&#8221; to oral formulations to complete their antifungal treatment after they have shown sufficient improvement. The duration of the entire antifungal regimen (IV plus oral) varies depending on the response to the antifungal treatment and the type of infection. Invasive candidiasis should be treated for at 

&#32;6 

least 2 weeks after negative cultures are obtained and invasive aspergillosis is typically treated for six to 12 weeks. The availability of SCY-078 in both oral and IV formulations would allow for maximum flexibility in the administration of the same agent during the entire antifungal regimen. The IV formulation would allow initiation of treatment in critically ill patients for whom IV therapy is preferred. The oral formulation would allow initiation of therapy in outpatient settings for those conditions that do not require hospitalization, such as VVC and recurrent VVC, as well as step-down from the initial IV antifungal agent (either SCY-078 or other glucan synthase inhibitor such as echinocandins), to complete the antifungal regimen, as indicated. 

SCY-078&#8217;s clinical development program to date includes: 

&#8226; 

Eight completed Phase 1 studies with the oral formulation. 

&#9702; 

SCY-078 was shown to be sufficiently safe and well-tolerated in eight completed Phase 1 studies supporting the progression of the development program. In a recently completed Phase 1 study the citrate salt of SCY-078 was shown to be well tolerated and resulted in a comparable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile to the phosphate salt, used in our previous clinical investigations. The citrate salt offers potential formulation development advantages and is being used in the IV formulation. Further development activities for both the oral and IV formulations of SCY-078 are planned with the citrate salt. 

&#8226; 

Two ongoing Phase 2 studies with the oral formulation. 

&#9702; 

We are currently conducting a multicenter Phase 2 study with primary endpoints of safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the oral formulation of SCY-078 as step-down treatment in patients initially treated with echinocandin therapy for invasive Candida &#32;infections, which are serious and life-threatening infections. We have opened new investigational sites in the U.S. and in Latin America and we are in the process of opening more sites in these regions and in Europe. Based on the data collected on the enrolled patients, together with the data from our recently completed Phase 1 biocomparison study, we expect to achieve the primary objectives of the study with fewer patients than originally planned and to report top line data by the end of the second quarter of 2016. &#32; 

&#9702; 

We are also conducting a multicenter Phase 2 study with primary endpoints of safety and efficacy of the oral formulation of SCY-078 in patients with VVC. We expect to complete the study and to report top line data by the end of the second quarter of 2016. We expect the data from this study to provide a confirmation of the potential therapeutic effect of orally administered SCY-078 in a clinical condition caused by Candida spp. and, along with the other clinical and nonclinical data from ongoing and planned activities, will contribute to the package of information that will support subsequent phases of development. 

&#8226; 

One ongoing Phase 1 study with an intravenous formulation of SCY-078. 

&#9702; 

We are conducting a single-rising-dose Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SCY-078 administered as an intravenous infusion in healthy subjects. We expect to complete the study and to report results by the end of the second quarter of 2016. 

&#32;&#32;Our Corporate Strategy 

&#32;&#32;Key elements of our strategy include: 

&#8226; 

to further develop SCY-078 and obtain regulatory approval in major commercial markets for our three key indications: invasive candidiasis, recurrent VVC and invasive aspergillosis; 

&#8226; 

to commercialize SCY-078 for selected indications in the U.S. through a dedicated sales force; 

&#8226; 

to contract with commercial partners to develop and commercialize SCY-078 outside of the U.S.; 

&#8226; 

to assess external opportunities to expand our clinical pipeline; and 

&#8226; 

to leverage our strong scientific team to pursue the development of other proprietary compounds. 

&#32;&#32;Overview of the Antifungal Market 

&#32;&#32;&#32;Background of Invasive Fungal Diseases 

&#32;&#32;&#32;Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;species are responsible for approximately 85% of all invasive fungal infections in the United States and Europe. Infections caused by Candida &#32;rank as the fourth most common hospital-acquired bloodstream infection in the United States. There are approximately 400,000 cases of invasive Candida &#32;infections annually worldwide, including approximately 98,000 cases in the U.S. Invasive Candida &#32;infections result in a mortality rate ranging from 20% to 40% 

&#32;7 

depending on the immune status of the patient. Globally, an estimated 200,000 patients develop invasive Aspergillus &#32;infections annually, including approximately 46,000 in the U.S., and the mortality rate ranges from approximately 40 to 50%, even with treatment. 

&#32;&#32;Hospital-acquired fungal infections due to Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;species are becoming an increasing problem for the healthcare system. The increases in invasive fungal infections are due to the increased use of immune-suppressing chemotherapies and transplant drugs, and in-dwelling catheters, among other factors. Confirmed cases of invasive Candida &#32;infections rose in the United States by 52% between 2000 and 2005. In addition, the increase in use of broad spectrum antibiotics has been shown to contribute significantly to the risk of developing invasive fungal infections. Confirmed cases of invasive Aspergillus &#32;infections nearly doubled in the United States among patients receiving hematopoetic stem cell transplants between 2002 and 2005. 

We believe confirmed cases of Candida &#32;blood infections account for only approximately one-quarter to one-third of Candida &#32;treatments. We further believe initiation of therapy prior to diagnosis, based on the presence of symptoms, represents a majority of the non-confirmed Candida &#32;treatments. This &#8220;empiric&#8221; therapy is clinically warranted because invasive Candida &#32;infections can be difficult to diagnose and the treatment outcome could be compromised by delaying initiation of therapy until the diagnosis is confirmed. Initiation of therapy within the first 12 hours following suspicion of fungal infection reduces the risk of death threefold. In addition, increased numbers of patients are undergoing procedures, such as chemotherapy,or solid organ or stem cell transplants, that cause or result in immune-suppression and therefore put patients at high risk of invasive Candida &#32;infections. As a result, the market opportunity for the treatment of invasive candidiasis is estimated to be greater than the number of confirmed cases reported for this condition. 

The typical duration of antifungal treatment in cases of invasive candidiasis is around three weeks, and during the first 5-7 days an IV agent is recommended. If the condition of the patient improves, a step-down to oral treatment is considered after the initial IV therapy for the remainder of the antifungal regimen. 

The recommended duration of antifungal treatment in cases of invasive aspergillosis varies with the response to antifungal therapy, ranging from six to 12 weeks in most cases. Typically, the antifungal agent is initiated intravenously and stepped down to an oral administration to complete the antifungal regimen. Because of the long duration of the antifungal regimen in aspergillosis and the fact that only azoles have oral formulations available, there are significant limitations in terms of flexibility of treatment options, particularly important for the treatment of azole-resistant cases. 

&#32;&#32;Background of Vulvovaginal Candidiasis 

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis , commonly known as a "yeast infection," is usually caused by Candida &#32; albicans &#32;and typical symptoms include pruritus, vaginal soreness, irritation and abnormal vaginal discharge. An estimated 75% of women of reproductive age will have at least one episode of VVC during their lifetime and 40-45% will experience two or more episodes. As many as 7-9% of these patients suffer from recurrent VVC, defined as experiencing at least four episodes during a 12-month period. Current treatments for VVC include topical antifungals and the use of prescription oral antifungals such as fluconazole, which has a therapeutic cure rate of 55% as reported in its label. We estimate there are approximately 370,000 recurrent VVC cases annually in the U.S. There are no products currently approved for the treatment of recurrent VVC. &#32; 

&#32;&#32;Current Therapeutic Options 

Fungal infections are currently treated using three main classes of antifungal drugs that target fungal cell membranes or cell walls. Each of these antifungal drugs has its own limitations that reduce its clinical usefulness. 

Polyenes . Polyenes disrupt fungal cell membranes. The primary commercial polyene, amphotericin B, is used to treat a wide variety of fungi, including rare and difficult-to-treat species. However, polyenes have serious side effects including acute, potentially fatal kidney and heart injury, and they are only available intravenously. As a result, polyenes are typically used as a drug of last resort for treating invasive Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;infections. Despite its toxicity, worldwide peak annual sales of lipid amphotericin B alone were approximately $379 million. 

Azoles. &#32;Azoles, which block biosynthesis of a fungal cell membrane component, are the most frequently used class for treatment of invasive fungal infections and are the only class available in both IV and oral formulations. Azoles are used extensively for prevention and in unconfirmed cases. Fluconazole is recommended as the first-line therapy for acute uncomplicated VVC. However, while azole-sensitive species have been well-treated, this has permitted azole-resistant infections, with species such as Candida glabrata, &#32;to become more prevalent. Further, cross resistance among the azoles exists, which means that once an azole has been tried and failed, another azole may not be effective. Despite these limitations, fluconazole, the most commonly used azole, had worldwide peak annual sales of $1.1 billion and voriconazole, which is used for treatment of invasive aspergillosis, had worldwide peak annual sales of $685 million. The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of invasive candidiasis have recently changed their recommendations and no longer recommend azoles as the initial treatment for most cases of invasive candidiasis. Azoles with activity against molds, such as voriconazole, are recommended as the first-line therapy for most cases of aspergillosis, but it should be noted that the 

&#32;8 

reports of azole-resistant Aspergillus &#32;strains have increased over the past years, mostly due to extensive use of azoles across medical settings, and in agricultural where they are used to protect crops against fungi. 

Echinocandins. &#32;Echinocandins block biosynthesis of fungal cell walls by inhibiting a glucan synthase enzyme, an enzyme not found in human cells. The clinical success of echinocandins, particularly in azole-resistant infections, combined with their good tolerability profile, has resulted in these compounds being increasingly used in the treatment of invasive Candida &#32;infections. They are currently the recommended antifungal class for treatment of most cases of invasive candidiasis by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA). However, echinocandins are only available in IV formulation. To allow for discharge from the hospital as quickly as possible, preferred medical practice is to transition eligible patients from IV to oral therapy. Without the availability of an oral echinocandin, physicians need to choose between administering oral azoles as a step down therapy, or keeping patients on an IV echinocandin therapy, which may require continued hospitalization. In addition, there are indications that resistance to echinocandins is emerging and being reported. Despite the limitations from being an IV-only therapy and having a special warning in Europe, Micafungin had worldwide peak annual sales of $326 million. &#32;&#32; Caspofungin, an IV-only therapy and the leading echinocandin, had worldwide peak sales of $530 million. 

&#32;&#32;Antifungal Drug Resistance 

Broad use of azole drugs has resulted in an increasing incidence of drug resistant Candida &#32;infections. At hospitals performing medically intensive procedures such as transplantation, rates of reduced azole susceptibility have reached 15-20%. We believe the rising level of azole resistance is driven by the reduction in prevalence of susceptible species such as Candida albicans &#32;and the resultant increase in prominence of infections caused by species inherently resistant to azoles, such as Candida glabrata &#32;and Candida krusei . Declining azole efficacy in Candida &#32;infections has led to echinocandins emerging as the drugs of first choice for treatment of most patients with invasive Candida &#32;infections. However, a recent study reported echinocandin resistance for Candida glabrata &#32;at an incidence rate exceeding 10%. Of the echinocandin resistant strains, the majority are also resistant to azoles, making these strains multi-drug resistant. Invasive Candida &#32;spp. infections due to suspected or known azole-resistant strains are typically treated with echinocandins for the entire duration of the treatment regimen. Because these agents are only available for IV administration, there is no opportunity for an effective step down strategy that would minimize hospital stays, hospital-acquired infections and associated costs to the healthcare system. The only antifungal alternative to treat invasive Candida &#32;spp. infections due to suspected or known azole- and echinocandin-resistant strains are the polyenes, which are only available intravenously and have significant toxicities associated with their use. 

Broad use of azole drugs in the medical setting as well as in the agricultural setting has also fostered selection for azole resistance in Aspergillus &#32;species. Acquired resistance to azoles in Aspergillus fumigatus &#32;(the most common species associated with human infections) has become a public health concern. The frequency of azole-resistance in Aspergillus &#32;species has been reported ranging from 4% to 50% at different institutions. 

A recent surveillance study that investigated the prevalence of azole-resistance in clinical Aspergillus isolates in an in-ternational network of centers indicated that azole-resistance is widely spread across most countries. Approximately 5% of the isolates from invasive aspergillosis cases showed resistance to azoles. 

Our Product Candidate: SCY-078 

SCY-078 Overview 

We discovered and developed SCY-078 through a research collaboration with Merck Sharp &#38; Dohme Corp., or Merck, a subsidiary of Merck &#38; Co., Inc., and in May 2013 we acquired worldwide rights to SCY-078 in the field of human health. The compound is derived, by chemical modification, from enfumafungin, a natural product, and shows antifungal activity against Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;through inhibition of glucan synthesis, similar to the echinocandin class. SCY-078 was shown to exhibit fungicidal activity against Candida albicans , the most common cause of invasive fungal infections among the Candida &#32;species. In addition, SCY-078 has shown potent in vitro &#32;activity against approximately 650 laboratory and clinically important strains of Candida &#32;and Aspergillus , including strains that are resistant to azoles and echinocandins. Activity against the majority of echinocandin-resistant strains suggests that SCY-078 represents a new class of antifungal agents (a novel glucan synthase inhibitor) that acts on a validated antifungal target in a manner distinct from the echinocandins. 

In animal models of invasive fungal infections used to test other drugs that have proven to be effective in humans, SCY-078 was shown to be highly active against Candida &#32;spp. These studies allowed for the determination of the drug concentrations in blood required to achieve efficacy. These correlations of drug exposure to drug activity, or PK/PD, have been used to identify the predicted human exposure of SCY-078 believed to be required to achieve efficacy. 

In Phase 1 studies, the oral formulation of SCY-078 has been shown to be sufficiently safe and well-tolerated in approximately 124 healthy human subjects at initial single oral doses of up to 1600mg in one day and doses of up to 800mg per day for 28 consecutive days to support progression into Phase 2 studies. Furthermore, oral dosing of the compound results in sustained blood concentrations in the range predicted from preclinical PK/PD studies to be required for efficacy. 

&#32;9 

We are currently conducting two Phase 2 studies with our oral SCY-078 formulation. The first study is evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of the orally administered SCY-078 as step-down treatment in patients initially treated with IV echinocandin therapy for invasive Candida &#32;infections. The second study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of orally administered SCY-078 for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. 

We have also developed an IV formulation of SCY-078 that is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 program. 

In connection with our acquisition of the worldwide rights to SCY-078 in May 2013, Merck transferred to us responsibility for the investigational new drug application, or IND, for SCY-078, including all related technical documents, preclinical data, data from the seven Phase 1 trials conducted by Merck, and drug product and drug substance. 

The Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act, or GAIN Act, was enacted in July 2012 to encourage the development of novel anti-infective drugs in the face of increasing drug resistance. Before the passage of the GAIN Act, the FDA traditionally required sponsors of novel antifungal drugs to use non-life threatening fungal infections, such as esophageal Candida &#32;infections, for a proof-of-concept study in preparation for Phase 3 studies in invasive diseases. This approach added time and cost to the process of developing novel drugs for invasive fungal infections. In order to encourage the development of treatments for serious or life-threatening infections, the GAIN Act required the FDA to review and ensure clear guidelines for clinical development of antibacterial and antifungal drugs. In September 2013 we met with the FDA to discuss our development program. In response, the FDA recommended we proceed with a smaller scale Phase 2 study directly in patients with invasive Candida &#32;infections, our intended patient population, without first conducting studies of esophageal Candida &#32;infections. These changes, we believe, may significantly reduce the time and expense associated with progressing SCY-078 through Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. 

The FDA has designated both the oral tablet formulation and IV formulation of SCY-078 as Qualified Infectious Disease Products, or QIDPs, under the GAIN Act and has also granted Fast Track designation to both formulations for their respective indications. The FDA&#8217;s Fast Track drug development program is a process designed to facilitate the development and expeditious review of drugs to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. This designation allows companies to interact with the FDA review team frequently to discuss critical development issues such as study design, required safety data necessary to support approval, and structure and content of an NDA. Additionally, should the FDA determine that a Fast Track product may be effective after their preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by a sponsor, the FDA may also consider reviewing portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application, known as a &#8220;rolling&#8221; NDA. If SCY-078 is approved for its proposed use and awarded five years of exclusivity as a new chemical entity, it will be eligible for a ten-year period of data exclusivity, comprising five years of new chemical entity exclusivity plus an additional five years as a designated QIDP. This exclusivity period should protect SCY-078 from being subject to a competing abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, for a generic drug, or from a competing 505(b)(2) new drug application for a follow-on product until the expiration of the exclusivity period. 

SCY-078 is protected by an issued composition of matter patent in the United States, which expires in 2030. An additional composition of matter patent related to SCY-078 salt composition and polymorphs has been filed and is pending issuance. If granted, the new patent will extend the patent protection of SCY-078 salts, including the citrate salt currently under development, up to 2035. We have licensed rights to develop and commercialize SCY-078 in the field of human health in Russia and certain smaller non-core markets to R-Pharm, CJSC, or R-Pharm, a leading supplier of hospital drugs in Russia, in exchange for an upfront payment, royalties, and their expertise and financial assistance in developing the compound, as more completely described under the heading &#8220;Collaborations and Licensing Agreements&#8221; as set forth below. 

In summary, SCY-078 has unique attributes that define its potential to address significant unmet medical needs and market opportunities including: 

&#8226; 

only glucan synthase inhibitor (GSI) with both oral and IV formulations in clinical development, allowing first-line treatment and oral step down in the same class. 

&#8226; 

distinct chemical structure from other GSIs, allowing unique spectrum of activity and pharmacokinetic profile. 

&#8226; 

fungicidal capabilities against Candida &#32;species compared to azoles, which are fungistatic 

&#8226; 

activity against azole- and most echinocandin-resistant Candida &#32;strains; potentially providing a safer alternative to amphotericin B for multi-drug-resistant Candida &#32;infections. 

&#8226; 

activity against azole-resistant Aspergillus &#32;strains. 

&#32;&#32; SCY-078 Target Product Profile 

We believe that there are significant commercial opportunities for a new antifungal drug that has potent activity against azole and echinocandin susceptible and resistant Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;strains, is available in both oral and IV formulations, 

&#32;10 

and has a favorable safety and tolerability profile. If approved, SCY-078 has the potential to address significant gaps with commercially available therapies and could be used as follows: 

Treatment of invasive Candida infections . If SCY-078 is approved for the treatment of invasive Candida &#32;infections, we believe it could replace echinocandins as the drug of choice for these infections because it would be available in both IV and oral forms. An orally effective non-azole antifungal with the preferred mechanism of glucan synthase inhibition would allow patients to be transitioned more easily from a hospital-based care to outpatient care, which may reduce, or eliminate, expensive hospital stays and risks of hospital-acquired infections. Additionally, SCY-078 could be used as the step-down therapy from any echinocandin, replacing fluconazole and providing the advantage of continuing the antifungal treatment with an oral glucan synthase inhibitor. 

Treatment of infections due to drug-resistant Candida . SCY-078 has been shown to be effective preclinically against Candida &#32;species resistant to azoles, including Candida albicans, &#32; Candida glabrata &#32;and Candida krusei . In addition, SCY-078 has been shown to be effective in vitro &#32;against the majority of echinocandin-resistant Candida &#32;strains tested. SCY-078 has the potential to provide a first-line treatment against invasive Candida &#32;infections, including those known or suspected to be resistant to currently available azoles and echinocandins. 

Treatment of invasive Aspergillus infections . If SCY-078 is approved for the treatment of invasive Aspergillus &#32;infections, we believe it could offer significant advantages over the current first-line azole therapy of voriconazole due to the numerous drug interactions and adverse events associated with the use of voriconazole. Furthermore, SCY-078 has been shown to be effective in vitro &#32;against all azole-resistant strains of Aspergillus &#32;tested. SCY-078 could provide a first-line treatment against invasive Aspergillus &#32;infections known to be resistant to currently available azoles. 

Prevention of Candida and Aspergillus infections. &#32;If SCY-078 is approved for use as a preventative treatment for Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;infections, SCY-078 has the potential to offer advantages over current prophylactic drugs because of its activity against fungal strains that are resistant to azoles. 

Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC): &#32;If SCY-078 is approved, it could provide a first-line therapy for recurrent VVC, for which there is no treatment currently approved. Fluconazole administered for up to six months is recommended for recurrent VVC, but recurrences are observed rapidly after stopping fluconazole due to the persistence of the fungi in the vaginal reservoir. In contrast with fluconazole that is fungistatic against Candida spp., SCY-078 is fungicidal against most Candida &#32;isolates. We believe this &#8220;cidal&#8221; activity (i.e., killing the pathogen) would provide an advantage in preventing recurrences. SCY-078, with its activity against azole-resistance strains, may also be adequate to treat VVC episodes caused by azole-resistant isolates. 

Preclinical Characterization of SCY-078 

&#32;&#32;SCY-078 has broad antifungal activity based on a proven mechanism of action 

SCY-078 is a potent inhibitor of the synthesis of the polymer beta 1,3 D glucan, an essential component of the fungal cell wall of &#32;Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;species. Glucan synthesis inhibition is a clinically proven antifungal mechanism, as demonstrated by the echinocandin class of antifungal agents. Activity of SCY-078 observed against the majority of echinocandin-resistant strains suggests that SCY-078 acts in a manner distinct from the echinocandins. 

&#32;&#32;SCY-078 is active in vitro against a broad spectrum of Candida and Aspergillus species 

SCY-078 has been shown to have potent activity in vitro &#32;against over 500 strains from eleven Candida &#32;species and 150 strains from four Aspergillus &#32;species. The charts below summarize the in vitro &#32;activity of SCY-078 against a collection of &#8220;wild-type&#8221; strains (i.e., those having no known drug resistance) of Candida &#32;and Aspergillus . Drug activity was measured as the minimum concentration of drug that inhibits replication of Candida &#32;or growth of Aspergillus &#32;by more than 50% relative to untreated cultures (MIC50 and MEC50, respectively). Each data point represents the average activity value for all strains tested at a single laboratory. Four laboratories were used for evaluation of Candida &#32;and three laboratories were used for evaluation of Aspergillus &#32;to confirm reproducibility of results among independent test sites. The potency of SCY-078 against these Candida and Aspergillus &#32;strains is comparable, within assay variability, to that of Caspofungin, the current leading echinocandin. 

&#32;11 

&#32;&#32; &#32; 

&#32;SCY-078 is active in vitro against azole-resistant Candida and Aspergillus strains 

Widespread use of azole drugs has resulted in azole-resistant strains of Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;becoming increasingly prevalent, leading to treatment failures. Cross resistance among azoles means that once an azole has been tried and failed, another azole may not be effective. SCY-078 was active against all azole-resistant Candida &#32;strains tested, with activity comparable to that observed against wild-type strains. As shown in the graph below, the in vitro &#32;activity of SCY-078 was comparable to that of Caspofungin, the leading echinocandin, against Candida albicans &#32;resistant to fluconazole, a leading azole. 

SCY-078 was also active against all azole-resistant Aspergillus &#32;strains tested, with the range of MEC 50 &#32;values comparable to those observed against wild-type strains. 

&#32;&#32;SCY-078 is active in vitro against a majority of echinocandin-resistant Candida species 

Echinocandin resistance is increasing in prevalence, particularly among azole-resistant species such as Candida glabrata . As illustrated in the figure below, SCY-078 retained in vitro &#32;activity against a majority of echinocandin-resistant Candida glabrata &#32;strains tested when defined as minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) similar to those determined for wild type Candida . Similar results were observed for echinocandin-resistant strains of other Candida &#32;species. Thus, SCY-078 may offer a therapeutic option against multi-drug resistant strains such as those that have emerged in Candida glabrata. 

&#32;12 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

&#32;&#32;Nonclinical toxicology studies determined safety parameters to monitor in SCY-078 in clinical studies 

The preclinical safety of SCY-078 has been evaluated in multiple exploratory and GLP, or Good Laboratory Practice, studies in rats, dogs, rabbits, and non-human primates. The longest duration of oral dosing has been 28 days and the longest duration of IV dosing has been 14 days. 

In these studies, at the highest tested doses, at exposures seven-fold the targeted efficacious exposure, very slight to moderate toxicities were observed in two animal species. The two major organs impacted were the stomach (degeneration of the stomach lining) and the liver (single cell necrosis). In rats, the degeneration of the stomach lining was reversible after cessation of dosing. Degeneration of the stomach lining observed in preclinical toxicology studies was not seen in healthy subjects in the Phase 1 multiple dose study where individuals who received 800mg SCY-078 daily for 28 days had pre- and post-treatment endoscopy with gastric biopsy. The results from the completed 14-day toxicity studies in rats and dogs conducted with an IV formulation of SCY-078 demonstrate that the toxicity profile of an IV formulation of SCY-078 is similar to the toxicity profile previously observed in the non-clinical safety program for the oral formulation. Infusion site reactions were observed after IV administration of SCY-078. These reactions more prominent at the highest dose tested in rats and rarely reported in dogs. Considering the overall tolerability of the IV formulation in both species, the toxicology program was considered adequate by the FDA to support the initiation of the first Phase 1 study with an IV formulation of SCY-078. In preliminary developmental and reproductive toxicity studies, SCY-078 did not cause any developmental toxicity in two animal species up to the maximum tolerated dose. In safety pharmacology studies, there were no clinically significant effects of SCY-078 on markers of cardiovascular, respiratory or central nervous system function. 

Toxicology studies are planned to enable oral dosing for up to 90 days and IV administration for up to 28 days. Additional reproductive toxicity studies are also planned to support subsequent stages of development. 

Should additional optimization be needed for the IV formulation, additional toxicology studies will be conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of any potential changes in the IV formulation. 

&#32;&#32;Preclinical pharmacokinetic and drug metabolism properties of SCY-078 support effective oral administration and limited drug-drug interactions 

SCY-078 has been evaluated broadly in preclinical pharmacokinetic and drug metabolism studies at exposure levels that were higher than those expected to be required to effectively treat infections in humans. SCY-078 was orally bioavailable in all four animal species studied. 

Many patients with, or at risk of, invasive fungal infections are taking other medications, making it important to consider drug-drug interactions. The leading azoles have significant effects on the metabolism of many medications, which can lead to over-dosing or toxicity from co-administration of drugs. In vitro , SCY-078 interacts with few drug metabolizing enzymes, and does not induce CYP3A4 (the major drug metabolizing enzyme), thus it may cause fewer clinically relevant drug-drug interactions. The propensity for SCY-078 to be involved in drug-drug interactions will be studied in Phase 1 clinical studies. 

&#32;&#32;In vivo animal studies predict that SCY-078 can be effective in treating invasive fungal infections 

Mouse models of Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;infections have been predictive of clinical efficacy for the approved glucan synthesis inhibitors. SCY-078 was evaluated in multiple studies in Candida albicans- infected mice. In these studies, SCY-078 treated animals had no measurable Candida &#32;in organs tested following doses which resulted in drug levels in the blood similar 

&#32;13 

to those that have been safely achieved in humans. Comparable results were observed in mice infected with other Candida &#32;species, including Candida glabrata . 

The in vivo &#32;efficacy of SCY-078 was also evaluated against Aspergillus fumigatus &#32;in multiple studies. When infected with Aspergillus, &#32;mice with partially deficient immune defenses develop aggressive infections that generally result in death. However, SCY-078-treated mice exhibited dose-dependent increases in survival rates up to 90%, as measured in the first 21 days after infection. 

In summary, SCY-078 demonstrated potent in vivo &#32;antifungal activity in mouse models of Candida &#32;and Aspergillus &#32;infection studied, supporting our expectation of clinical efficacy for SCY-078. 

Clinical Experience with SCY-078 

To date, eight Phase 1 safety and pharmacokinetic studies have been completed using the oral formulation of SCY-078. Four of the eight studies evaluated a single oral dose while four evaluated multiple oral doses of SCY-078. 

SCY-078 consistently showed sufficient safety and tolerability in Phase 1 studies to support progression into Phase 2 studies. 

Approximately 124 healthy subjects have received at least one dose of oral SCY-078 in Phase 1 studies. SCY-078 was generally well tolerated at initial single oral doses of up to 1600mg in one day and doses of up to 800mg per day for 28 consecutive days. The majority of reported adverse events have been generally transient and primarily mild to moderate in intensity. 

The preliminary safety and PK data from the completed Phase 1 studies are summarized in the following table:

A Phase 1, 3-Period, Open-Label, Oral Biocomparison Study of 2 Formulations of SCY-078 with a Food Effect Period in Healthy Subjects 

&#160; 

Bioavailability comparison of 2 oral formulations and investigation of food effect. 

&#160; 

24 healthy males (18-50 years) 

&#160; 

Treatment A = Oral doses of 500-mg SCY-078 phosphate salt 

formulation in the fasted state. Treatment B = Oral doses of 500-mg SCY 078 citrate salt &#160; formulation in the fasted state. Treatment C = Oral doses of 500-mg SCY 078 citrate salt formulation in 

the fed state (following a high-fat breakfast) 

&#160; 

Safety: SCY-078 was generally well tolerated. No SAEs were reported. One subject was discontinued due to increased ALT/AST; the event was considered non serious by the investigator and resolved without intervention. The most common AEs were mild or moderate nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea. 

Analysis indicated that the overall PK profiles for the phosphate and citrate tablet formulations were very similar. Food increased the average Cmax for the citrate formulation by approximately 37% and average AUC by approximately 51%. 

The most frequently reported adverse events have been gastrointestinal. In multiple dose studies, these included diarrhea, abdominal pain or discomfort, and vomiting. These gastrointestinal side effects were not considered serious in nature and only one subject discontinued dosing with SCY-078 when he withdrew consent due to gastrointestinal adverse events. In one study six subjects who received 800mg SCY-078 daily for 28 days underwent pre-treatment and end-of-treatment gastric endoscopy 

&#32;15 

with biopsy, with no evidence of stomach lining degeneration or other significant clinical finding observed. None of the 66 subjects receiving SCY-078 in the four Phase 1 studies in which serum gastrin levels were monitored exhibited levels outside the normal range. 

Two subjects have experienced significant liver function test increases in the Phase 1 studies. The first subject was a 27-year old man who had elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (which are indicators of liver function and integrity that can be detected in typical laboratory tests), after a 500mg single dose of SCY-078. The event was deemed by the investigator as serious and to be study drug related. Other markers of liver injury remained within the normal range. ALT/AST levels decreased over the 48-hour period post-dose and this subject&#8217;s liver function tests returned to the normal range without intervention. A second subject, in a different study, was a 22-year old female who had an elevation of ALT and AST after a second dose of 500mg of SCY-078. The event was deemed by the investigator not be serious but to be study-drug related. The subject admitted alcohol drinking and acetaminophen intake at the time of enzyme elevation. Other markers of liver injury remained within the normal range. The elevated enzymes returned to normal without intervention. 

No other serious adverse events deemed related to study drug have been reported in any of the Phase 1 studies completed to date. 

&#32;&#32;SCY-078 exhibits favorable pharmacokinetic properties in humans 

As a result of Phase 1 studies of SCY-078, we believe that SCY-078 can be sufficiently well absorbed as an oral medication to achieve the drug levels necessary to be effective in treating patients. The half-life of approximately 20 hours supports once daily dosing and a loading dose on day 1 should result in therapeutic concentrations being achieved on the first day of treatment. Drug exposure increased proportionally and in a predictable manner with doses up to the maximum dose tested (1600mg in single dose studies). There were no major differences in the pharmacokinetics or safety of SCY-078 in healthy elderly subjects relative to younger adults, an important consideration since many patients experiencing invasive fungal infections are elderly. 

Results from clinical studies conducted thus far to determine the potential for clinical drug-drug interactions confirmed that SCY-078 can likely be used, with suitable dose adjustments, in combination with moderate inhibitors of the most common drug metabolizing enzyme (CYP3A). The drug interaction studies were performed with ketoconazole (strong inhibitor of CYP3A4) and diltiazem (moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4). Results of these studies indicate that a dose reduction of SCY-078 will be required with moderate CYP3A inhibitors and co-administration with strong inhibitors will not be recommended. 

A drug interaction study was also conducted with pantoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor. In this study, SCY-078 concentrations with pantoprazole were ~25% lower than SCY-078 alone; the results met the hypothesis that exposures of SCY-078 with or without a proton pump inhibitor were similar. Other studies to evaluate the potential of drug-drug interactions with SCY-078 are planned. 

A biocomparison study was conducted between drug filled capsules that were used in early Phase 1 studies and compressed tablets which will be used in future studies. Compressed tablets had concentrations that were ~20% higher than capsules. The effect of a high fat meal on SCY-078 when dosed as compressed tablets indicated exposures that were ~50 to 60% higher than when administered in a fasted state. 

&#32;&#32;Our clinical data, together with mouse efficacy data, support therapeutic activity for SCY-078 

Correlations of circulating drug levels to drug efficacy in preclinical mouse infection models can be translated into human patients and are an established tool in the development of antifungal drugs. The efficacious drug levels determined for SCY-078 in the mouse models indicate that the levels achieved in the human Phase 1 clinical trials are predictive of efficacy in infected patients. Specifically, in human subjects who received SCY-078 as a loading oral dose of 600mg three times per day (1800mg/day) followed by a maintenance daily dose of 500mg, the circulating levels of SCY-078 exceeded those that cured the infection in the mouse models of invasive Candida &#32;infections. These results indicate that SCY-078 can be administered to patients with invasive Candida &#32;infections at doses that are predicted to be effective and are generally well tolerated.

Based on results from studies to date, we believe that SCY-078 has the potential to offer a new therapeutic option to treat several fungal infections, including serious and invasive fungal infections. The goal of the clinical development plan for SCY-078 is to provide sufficient safety and efficacy data for submission and FDA approval of an NDA. 

We anticipate that our initial NDA submission would seek approval for an indication for oral and IV formulations of SCY-078 for the treatment of invasive Candida &#32;infections (or invasive candidiasis). We expect additional Phase 3 and post-market studies, and supplemental NDAs, to expand the list of indications to include treatment of invasive Aspergillus &#32;infections, recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis and prevention of invasive fungal infections. 

&#32;16 

Phase 1 studies of the Intravenous Formulation of SCY-078 

We have initiated our first Phase 1 study with the IV formulation of SCY-078. The study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, alternating panel, rising single intravenous dose study in healthy male subjects. It is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single ascending doses of intravenously administered SCY-078 in healthy volunteers. The results from this study are expected by the end of the second quarter of 2016 and will be used to guide the design of subsequent studies with the IV formulation. 

SCY-078 Phase 2 studies with the oral formulation of SCY-078 

SCY-078 as an Oral Step-Down in the Treatment of Invasive Candida Infections: &#32;A Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of oral SCY-078 as step-down therapy after IV echinocandin in patients with invasive Candida infections, is ongoing. This is a three-arm study comparing step-down oral therapy with two doses of SCY-078 to current standard of care based on current Infectious Disease Society of America Practice Guidelines. All patients will receive initial therapy with an IV echinocandin for three to 10 days. Based on clinical and microbiological response, patients will be switched to randomized therapy as illustrated in the figure below. Patients in arm one will switch to oral SCY-078 dosed at 1000mg on day one followed by once daily dosing of SCY-078 500mg. Patients in arm two will switch to oral SCY-078 dosed at 1250mg on day one followed by once daily dosing of SCY-078 750mg. Patients in arm three will receive standard of care. Current standard of care calls for a switch to oral therapy with fluconazole 400mg/day after loading dose of 800mg on day 1, unless the patient is infected with a Candida &#32;strain that is not susceptible to fluconazole, in which case the patient will be maintained on IV micafungin for the remainder of therapy. Antifungal treatment will be continued for at least 14 days after the first negative culture for Candida and resolution of signs and symptoms of infection. 

We have opened new investigational sites in the U.S. and in Latin America and we are in the process of opening more sites in these regions and in Europe. Based on the data collected on the enrolled patients, together with the data from our recently completed Phase 1 biocomparison study, we expect to achieve the primary objectives of the study with fewer patients than originally planned and to report top line data by the end of the second quarter of 2016. The study&#8217;s identification number on www.ClinicalTrials.gov is NCT02244606. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

SCY-078 as an oral therapy for Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC): &#32;We are also investigating the potential clinical utility of SCY-078 in other areas of unmet medical need such as vulvovaginal candidiasis, or VVC, caused by Candida spp. VVC is a highly prevalent condition with limited therapeutic options for infections caused by azole-resistant Candida spp. We initiated a Phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of orally administered SCY-078 in this indication in the fourth quarter of 2015. This is a randomized, evaluator-blinded study that will enroll approximately 90 patients with an acute episode of moderate to severe VVC and a history of previous recurrences. The study will evaluate two dose regimens of oral SCY-078 and includes oral fluconazole as the active comparator arm. Under this study patients are randomized to receive either 1250mg of SCY-078 on day one followed by 750mg QD for two or four days or 150mg of fluconazole on day 1 (i.e., currently approved dose of fluconazole for this indication). The enrollment is progressing and we expect top line results by the end of the second quarter of 2016. We also expect the data from this study to provide a confirmation of the potential therapeutic effect of orally administered SCY-078 in a clinical condition caused by Candida spp. and, along with the other clinical and nonclinical data from ongoing and planned activities, to contribute to the package of information that will support subsequent phases of development. The study's identification number on www.ClinicalTrials.gov is NCT02679456. 

Planned SCY-078 Clinical Development Activities 

The following clinical studies are planned: 

&#32;&#32; Phase 1 drug-drug interaction studies of SCY-078: &#32; Two additional drug-drug interaction studies are planned during 2016. The studies are intended to better define the potential effect of co-administration of SCY-078 with other drugs. The 

&#32;17 

design of these studies is currently under evaluation and will include drugs that are either often administered in the intended patient population or a representative of a particular metabolic pathway. 

&#32;&#32; Phase 1 studies of the Intravenous Formulation of SCY-078: &#32; We are planning to conduct a multiple dose rising study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of an IV formulation of SCY-078 when administered to healthy volunteers for up to 14 days. If additional formulation optimization is deemed necessary, further single and/or multiple dose Phase 1 studies with an IV formulation may be needed. 

SCY-078 (IV and Oral) for the Treatment of Invasive Candida Infections: &#32;The next study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SCY-078 in patients with invasive Candida infections will include both the IV and oral formulations of SCY-078. We expect it to be a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, active comparator, non-inferiority study evaluating the safety and efficacy of SCY-078 compared to standard of care. The current standard of care, per the Infectious Disease Society of America, is the initiation of antifungal therapy with an echinocandin (IV) and step-down to oral fluconazole for completion of the antifungal regimen. For infections caused by an azole-resistant Candida &#32;strain the standard of care is to administer an echinocandin (IV) for the entire duration of the antifungal treatment. The final design from this study will be informed by the results from our ongoing clinical investigations and subsequent discussions with relevant regulatory agencies such as the FDA. We are planning to initiate this study in the first half of 2017. 

SCY-078 (IV and Oral) for the Treatment of Invasive Fungal Infections that are Refractory to or Intolerant of standard Antifungal agents : &#32;This study will evaluate SCY-078 in infections where there is unmet need and the potential to show differentiation from available therapies for invasive fungal infections for which SCY-078 may show potential clinical utility, including invasive candidiasis. This will be an open-label study in which SCY-078 will be administered to patients bearing invasive fungal infections that are refractory to, or the patients are intolerant of, standard therapy (azoles, echinocandins or polyenes). The final design of this study will be informed by our ongoing clinical and non-clinical investigations and subsequent discussions with relevant regulatory agencies such as the FDA. We are planning to initiate this study in the fourth quarter of 2016. It is possible that compelling data in this study could result in streamlined development to an initial NDA for a restricted indication. 

SCY-078 (Oral) for the Treatment of Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC ): Subsequent stages of the development program for the VVC indication will be informed by the results from our ongoing Phase 2 study and will likely include a Phase 2b dose ranging study and two Phase 3 studies in the selected population. 

Planned SCY-078 Non-Clinical Development Activities 

We are planning additional non-clinical development activities to support our SCY-078 development program, including further characterization of the antifungal spectrum of activity and toxicology assessments to enable long term treatment durations. 

Clinical Development Activities in Invasive Aspergillosis 

We are encouraged by our existing in vitro and in vivo data indicating activity against a broad range of Aspergillus &#32;species, including drug-resistant strains. In the future, we expect to prepare a clinical development plan for SCY-078 as a therapy for invasive aspergillosis. 

Commercialization, Marketing and Sales of SCY-078 

Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. 

We expect that prescribing physicians for the treatment of invasive fungal infections will be located at major medical centers, where physicians specializing in critical care, infectious disease specialists, and physicians treating immune-compromised or immune-suppressed patients, such as oncologists and those performing solid organ transplants and stem cell transplants, are likely to be found. 

We intend to form our own focused hospital-based sales and marketing force to target physicians in the United States. Outside of the United States, subject to obtaining necessary marketing approvals, we likely will seek to commercialize SCY-078 through distribution or other collaboration arrangements. We have already entered into an agreement pursuant to which we licensed to R-Pharm rights to develop and commercialize SCY-078 in the field of human health in Russia and certain smaller non-core markets. 

For VVC, we anticipate that prescribing physicians will mostly be obstetricians and gynecologists and likely a number of primary care physicians and, we believe, it will require a specific sales and marketing force with a women's health focus. We will assess our commercial strategy for VVC in the future. 

&#32;18 

Competition for SCY-078 

Our competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. The three leading branded antifungal drugs representing one from each main class are as follows: 

Azoles. V-fend&#174; (voriconazole), a product marketed by Pfizer (peak worldwide sales of $685 million). Merck also markets the azole Noxafil&#174; (posaconazole) and Astellas has the marketing rights to isavuconazole, recently approved in the U.S. and other global markets; 

Echinocandins. Cancidas&#174; (Caspofungin), a product marketed by Merck (peak worldwide sales of $530 million). Pfizer also markets the echinocandin Eraxis&#174; (anidulafungin) and Astellas markets the echinocandin Mycamine&#174; (micafungin); and 

Polyenes. AmBisome&#174; (liposomal amphotericerin B), a product sold by Gilead in Europe, by Astellas in the U.S. and by Dainippon-Sumitomo in Japan (peak worldwide sales of $379 million). 

Pfizer, Merck and Astellas are all large pharmaceutical companies with significant experience and financial resources in the marketing and sale of specialty pharmaceuticals. Various other producers market and sell generic oral voriconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole. 

Further, we expect that product candidates currently in clinical development, or that could enter clinical development in the near future, may represent significant competition, if approved. These include the triazole VT-1161 being developed by Viamet Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the echinocandin CD101 being developed by Cidara Therapeutics, Inc., and the polyene MAT2203 developed by Matinas BioPharma Holdings Inc. In addition, several compounds that have novel methods of action are currently in various stages of development, including T-2307 developed by Toyana, F901318 developed by F2G Limited and VL-2397 being developed by Vical Inc. These companies may have significantly greater resources than ours. 

The key competitive factors affecting the success of SCY-078, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, price, use in outpatient settings, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. If approved, we believe that SCY-078&#8217;s features, including its oral dosing and efficacy against resistant strains, will differentiate it from competing products. We believe that SCY-078 will compete favorably against competing products in efficacy, safety, convenience and use in out-patient settings, allowing us to price SCY-078 at a premium to generics and other competing products. 

Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, or other regulatory, approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected because in many cases insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products. In the azole class, fluconazole, itraconazole, and oral voriconazole are generic. There is currently no generic echinocandin, but Caspofungin, the largest selling echinocandin, is expected to become available on a generic basis over the coming years and perhaps prior to the launch of SCY-078. If approved, we believe SCY-078 will be capable of delivering value supportive of premium pricing over competitive generic products. 

Manufacturing and Supply of SCY-078 

We have agreements with external vendors that are capable of supplying kilogram quantities of drug substance, and to produce drug product to support ongoing and planned clinical trials. However, we do not own or operate and do not intend to own or operate facilities for manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing of drug substance or drug product. We have relied on third-party contract manufacturers for synthesis of our clinical compounds and manufacture of drug product. We expect to continue to rely on either existing or alternative third-party manufacturers to supply SCY-078 for ongoing and planned clinical trials and for commercial production. 

SCY-078 is a semi-synthetic compound. Thus, the manufacturing process for SCY-078 involves fermentation and synthetic chemical steps. The process begins with fermentation to produce the natural product enfumafungin, which has been conducted by a third-party vendor on a scale sufficient to provide greater than 60kg of this starting material. Enfumafungin is then converted to SCY-078 via chemical modification in a series of chemical steps. Approximately 20 kg of drug substance has been manufactured. The overall process does not require any specialized equipment and uses readily sourced intermediates. At commercial launch, we expect cost of goods for SCY-078 to be similar to that of other small molecule drugs. We are negotiating agreements with large scale suppliers to produce both drug product and drug substance for our planned clinical trials. In the future, we plan to validate the process with selected vendors and secondary suppliers to establish a secure supply chain. 

&#32;19 

We estimate our supplies on hand for both oral and IV formulations to be sufficient to supply our ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. Existing supplies would also support additional Phase 1 studies planned during the first half of 2016, including up to two drug-drug interaction studies with the oral formulation and multiple escalating dose studies for the IV formulation. Existing supplies have shown good stability to enable the completion of the clinical investigations as planned. Manufacture of additional supplies of SCY-078 drug substance is planned to support any further optimization of either of the formulations if needed. Additional batches of both oral and IV SCY-078 drug product will be manufactured as needed to support the subsequent stages of the clinical development plan. 

A drug manufacturing program subject to extensive governmental regulations requires robust quality assurance systems and experienced personnel with the relevant technical and regulatory expertise as well as strong project management skills. We believe we have a team that is capable of managing these activities. The third-party vendors that currently manufacture clinical supplies to support our ongoing clinical studies have the necessary capabilities and are in compliance with cGMP appropriate for the current stage of development. 

The third-party vendors we will select to support our manufacturing and supply program both for future late-stage development and commercial readiness activities will have the required capabilities with respect to facilities, equipment and technical expertise, quality systems that meet global regulatory and compliance requirements, satisfactory regulatory inspection history from relevant health authorities and proven track records in supplying drug substance and drug product for late-stage clinical and commercial use. 

Our Cyclophilin Inhibitor Platform 

We have developed a proprietary platform for cyclophilin inhibitors. Cyclophilins are a family of enzymes found in all mammalian cells which play a key role in a number of important cellular functions. Inhibiting cyclophilins shows promise as treatments for a range of diseases. To date, our cyclophilin inhibitor platform has produced two clinical stage compounds, described below. 

SCY-635 is a novel, orally available cyclophilin inhibitor that has demonstrated clinical activity against HCV as a single agent and when dosed in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. In these clinical studies, SCY-635 modified patients&#8217; immune responses to HCV. These observations implicate cyclophilins in viral evasion of immune responses. HCV and Hepatitis B Virus are two of the most widespread global infections, with more than 170 million and 240 million chronic carriers respectively, and are leading causes of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver transplantation. In October 2014, we granted Waterstone Pharmaceutical HK Limited, or "Waterstone", an international pharmaceutical business, exclusive worldwide rights to development and commercialization of SCY-635, and two additional compounds at Waterstone&#8217;s option, for the treatment of viral diseases in humans, under which we are entitled to receive potential milestones and royalties. Under the terms of our SCY-635 license agreement with Waterstone, we agreed that during the term of the agreement, we would not develop or commercialize, or grant any right or license to any third party to develop or commercialize, in Asia (excluding Japan), any cyclophilin inhibitor for treatment of viral diseases in humans. 

SCY-641 is a novel cyclophilin inhibitor with activity similar to cyclosporine, the active ingredient in Restasis &#174; &#32;and Optimmune &#174; , products currently approved for dry eye disease in humans and dogs, respectively. The global human dry eye syndrome therapeutics market was valued at $1.8 billion in 2010 and the market value is expected to grow to $2.8 billion in 2017. Sales of Restasis &#174; &#32;in 2012 were $792 million. SCY-641 has significantly improved water solubility compared to cyclosporine, which we believe will lead to improved tolerability and ease of use for treatment of dry eye disease ( i.e. , does not sting when applied and with anticipated required dosing of no more than twice daily). In August 2012, we licensed worldwide animal health rights for SCY-641 to Dechra Ltd., while retaining rights for human health indications. In November 2015, Dechra notified us of its intention to terminate its license agreement for the development of SCY-641 effective May 2016, returning full global rights of this compound to us. We are currently assessing the data generated by Dechra before deciding next steps and potentially identifying a new development and commercial partner for the human and animal health uses of SCY-641. 

The key terms of our licensing agreements with Dechra and Waterstone are disclosed in the section below titled &#8220;Collaborations and Licensing Agreements.&#8221; 

Our Contract Research and Development Services 

As a spinout from Aventis in 2000, we began as a chemistry and animal health services company, providing contract research services to third parties through our Services Business. Through this Services Business, we built significant expertise in parasitic infections and drug discovery. Since our formation, we have expanded our animal health capabilities and have discovered a number of proprietary compounds. Through the provision of these contract research and development services, we built significant expertise in parasitic infections and drug discovery, including expanded animal health capabilities. The 

&#32;20 

Services Business generated substantially all of our revenues until we completed the sale of the Services Business to Accuratus Lab Services, Inc. in July 2015, as described further in the &#8220;Recent Developments&#8221; section of Item 7 of this Annual Report. 

Research and Development Expenses 

A significant portion of our operating expenses is related to research and development and we intend to maintain our strong commitment to research and development. In fiscal years 2015 and 2014 we spent $16.4 million &#32;and $8.3 million , respectively, on research and development expenses. See "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for costs and expenses related to research and development, and other financial information for each of the fiscal years 2015 and 2014. 

Collaborations and Licensing Agreements &#32; Associated with Our Core Drug Development Operations 

We have a number of licensing and collaboration agreements associated with our core drug development operations, including the following: 

Merck 

We discovered and developed SCY-078 through a research collaboration with Merck Sharp &#38; Dohme Corp., or "Merck", a subsidiary of Merck &#38; Co., Inc. In May 2013 Merck transferred to us all development and commercialization rights for SCY-078 (also known as MK-3118). This decision was made following a review and prioritization of Merck&#8217;s infectious disease portfolio. Under the terms of the agreement, we received all human health rights to SCY-078, including all related technical documents, preclinical data, data from the seven Phase 1 trials conducted by Merck, and drug product and drug substance. The agreement continues until expiration of all royalty obligations. The agreement may be terminated if either party is in material breach and fails to remedy the breach after receiving written notice. In January 2014, Merck assigned the patents to us related to SCY-078 that it had exclusively licensed to us. Under the terms of the patent assignment, Merck no longer has responsibility to maintain the patents. Merck is eligible to receive milestones upon initiation of a Phase 3 clinical study, NDA filing and marketing approvals in each of the U.S., major European markets and Japan that could total up to $19 million. In addition, Merck will receive tiered royalties based on worldwide sales of SCY-078. The aggregate royalties are in the single digit percentages of net sales, and we expect to pay royalties on net sales of SCY-078 to Merck for no more than ten years from first commercial launch, on a country-by-country basis. 

In December 2014, we entered into an amendment to the license agreement with Merck that defers the remittance of a milestone payment due to Merck, such that no amount will be due upon initiation of the first phase 2 clinical trial of a product containing the SCY-078 compound (the "Deferred Milestone"). The amendment also increased, in an amount equal to the Deferred Milestone, the milestone payment that will be due upon initiation of the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a product containing the SCY-078 compound. Except as described above, all other terms and provisions of the license agreement remain in full force and effect. 

R-Pharm 

In August 2013 we entered into an agreement with R-Pharm, CJSC, or "R-Pharm", a leading supplier of hospital drugs in Russia, granting them exclusive rights to develop and commercialize SCY-078 in the field of human health in Russia, Turkey, and certain Balkan, Central Asian, Middle Eastern and Northern African countries. We retained the right to commercialize SCY-078 in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. We received an upfront payment of $1.5 million and are entitled to receive up to $18 million in payments for development milestones and sales-based payments. We are also entitled to single digit percent royalty payments for products that do not fall under the patents and a royalty percentage in the teens for products that do fall under the patents. This agreement expires upon R-Pharm&#8217;s last royalty payment, which is the later of 12 years from the first registration of the product in the countries where R-Pharm&#8217;s license rights exist under this agreement, or the last to expire of the patents in such countries. Either party may terminate this agreement if the other party breaches, and fails to remedy the breach after receiving notice from the non-breaching party. We have the ability to terminate this agreement if we determine that R-Pharm fails to make reasonable progress in the development and commercialization of SCY-078. If we give R-Pharm notice of failure to make reasonable progress, R-Pharm will have the opportunity to correct the deficiencies. 

The original agreement also included terms whereby R-Pharm would reimburse us for certain research and development costs associated with Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of oral SCY-078 and the development of an IV formulation of SCY-078. However, these cost reimbursement terms required that the clinical trials and the IV formulation development follow a global development plan that was agreed upon by both parties in August 2013. Subsequent to August 2013, modifications were made to the global development plan that caused the clinical trial cost reimbursement terms in the original agreement to no longer be enforceable. Further, the IV formulation development cost reimbursement terms in the original agreement did not specify which IV formulation and development costs were reimbursable by R-Pharm. In November 2014, we entered into a supplemental arrangement with R-Pharm, whereby R-Pharm was informed of the modified IV formulation development plan and R-Pharm agreed to reimburse us for specifically identified IV formulation development and manufacturing costs incurred 

&#32;21 

by us. The specifically identified costs were defined as all costs incurred by us under a separate arrangement we have with a third-party service provider, whereby the third-party service provider is performing certain IV formulation and development services for us. We estimate that total reimbursable costs pursuant to the original agreement and supplemental arrangement with R-Pharm will be approximately $1.3 to $1.9 million. 

Dechra 

In August 2012 we signed an agreement with Dechra Ltd., or "Dechra", a UK listed international veterinary pharmaceutical business, granting Dechra rights to SCY-641 for use in the field of animal health, including the treatment of canine keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or dry eye in dogs. Dechra was granted worldwide animal health rights and is responsible for the remaining clinical development and commercialization of SCY-641 in the animal health field. We retained the human health rights to the compound, including the right to use preclinical data generated by Dechra to support further human clinical development. Under the agreement, Dechra must use reasonable efforts to commercialize SCY-641. We received an upfront fee and are eligible to receive potential milestone payments up to &#163;0.4 million as well as a royalty percentage in the low teens to the low twenties on the total net sales of product sales. Dechra&#8217;s obligations to pay royalties shall continue, on a product-by-product and country by country basis, until the later to expire of (i) all valid claims in such country and (ii) 12 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. This agreement expires when Dechra has completed all royalty payment obligations. If either party is in breach, and the breach continues after notice given by the non-breaching party, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement. If we terminate the agreement because Dechra is in breach, Dechra must return all information required to be returned under the license agreement, free of charge, to us. If Dechra reasonably believes it is impossible to carry out further development or marketing of animal health products, Dechra may terminate this agreement at any time by giving us at least six months prior written notice. In November 2013, we amended this license agreement with Dechra in which we agreed to perform certain services for Dechra. In November 2015, Dechra notified us of its intention to terminate its license agreement for the development of SCY-641 effective May 2016, returning full global rights of this compound to us. We are currently assessing the data generated by Dechra before deciding next steps and potentially identifying a new development and commercial partner for the human and animal health uses of SCY-641. &#32; 

Aventis 

In May 2005, we entered into a license agreement with Aventis Pharma S.A., or "Aventis", a leading global healthcare company, pursuant to which Aventis granted us a worldwide license (with a right to sub-license) to certain of Aventis&#8217;s know-how, compounds and patents concerning cyclosporine derivatives exclusively in the field of treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS and non-exclusively in all fields outside the treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS. Under the terms of the agreement, we are obligated to maintain reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a marketable product containing the subject compound and Aventis is responsible for maintaining and protecting the underlying patent rights. The agreement expires on a country by country basis at the end of the underlying intellectual property claims, and the expiration of the U.S. patent is December 23, 2017. We may terminate the agreement at any time, without cause, by giving Aventis 90 days notice. Aventis may terminate this agreement only if we commit a serious breach and fail to remedy the breach within 90 days of notice. Upon expiration of the agreement, we will have a fully paid-up, royalty free, worldwide, exclusive license in the field of treatment and prevention of HIV/AIDS and a non-exclusive license outside this field. We are obligated to pay Aventis up to an aggregate of $1.35 million in payments upon the achievement of certain milestones. In addition, on an annual basis, we will be obligated to pay a single digit percentage royalty on direct sales by us of all products developed under the agreement and we will pay a low single digit percentage of royalty on any sales by a sub-licensee of all products developed under the agreement. Pursuant to the terms of our October 2014 license agreement with Waterstone, Waterstone has agreed to reimburse us for any of these milestone payments that may become due to Aventis. 

C-Chem 

In June 2005, we entered into an assignment agreement with C-Chem AG, or "C-Chem", pursuant to which C-Chem assigned certain inventions, patents and know-how concerning cyclosporine derivatives for us to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize a product. Under the agreement, C-Chem has assigned to us all rights, title and interest in the subject patents as well as assigned all rights, title and interest to certain know-how with exclusive right to use and disclose the know-how for any purpose. Under the agreement, we must exercise reasonable commercial efforts to develop and commercialize a product using the licensed intellectual property and we are responsible for maintaining the licensed patents until the end of their lifetime. The U.S. patent on SCY-641 expires on June 10, 2019, and this agreement expires when no valid claim remains with respect to the underlying patents. C-Chem may terminate the agreement if an order by a court is made appointing a custodian, receiver, liquidator, assignee or trustee for us or if a court orders the winding up or liquidation of our affairs. We can terminate the agreement at any time by thirty (30) days written notice to C-Chem. If either party breaches any term or condition of the agreement, then the non-breaching party can terminate the agreement if notice is given to the breaching party and the breach is not remedied in sixty (60) days. Upon expiration of the agreement, we will have a fully paid-up, royalty free, worldwide exclusive license, and the right to grant sub-licenses, under the know-how and ancillary rights to commercialize and supply products. If the agreement is terminated by either party, we are obligated to reassign the patents, the 

&#32;22 

know-how and the ancillary rights to C-Chem, return any intellectual property to C-Chem, and cease all activities which would require a license under the subject patents. We paid C-Chem an initial payment of $0.3 million and a one-time $0.2 million milestone payment, and are obligated to pay C-Chem up to $0.95 million in payments upon the achievement of certain milestones. In addition, we will be obligated to pay a low single digit percentage royalty on direct sales by us of all products developed under the agreement and we will pay less than a 1% royalty on any sales by a licensee of all products developed under the agreement. 

Waterstone 

In October 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Waterstone, under which we granted Waterstone an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize SCY-635 for the treatment of viral diseases in humans. In addition, under the same agreement, we granted Waterstone an option for an exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize two additional compounds of ours, SCY-575 and SCY-116, for the treatment of viral diseases in humans. The option is exercisable for a period of 18 months from the date of the agreement. In addition, we agreed that during the term of the agreement, we would not develop or commercialize, or grant any right or license to any third party to develop or commercialize, in Asia (excluding Japan), any cyclophilin inhibitor for treatment of viral diseases in humans. 

The agreement expires upon Waterstone&#8217;s last royalty payment, which is the later of ten years from the last registration of the product, or the last to expire of the patents. Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party breaches and fails to remedy the breach after receiving notice from the nonbreaching party. Specifically, we have the ability to terminate the agreement if we determine that Waterstone failed to make reasonable progress in the development and commercialization of SCY-635 or the optioned compounds. If we give Waterstone notice of failure to make reasonable progress, Waterstone will have the opportunity to correct the deficiencies. If Waterstone fails to do so, we have the right to terminate the license. 

We received an upfront license fee payment of $1.0 million in November 2014 for SCY-635, and we may receive an additional upfront payment of $0.5 million if Waterstone exercises its option for the two additional compounds. We are also entitled to receive certain payments on contingent future events, including 1) a development milestone payment of $4.0 million upon the first registration of a product, and 2) royalties based on a specified percentage of net sales (which percentage is in the mid-single digits), varying based on whether the product contains SCY-635 or one of the two additional compounds. 

In January 2015, we entered into a patent assignment agreement with Waterstone under which a total of 18 patents and patent applications owned by us and relating to SCY-635 were assigned to Waterstone. Following this assignment, Waterstone assumed responsibility for maintenance, prosecution and enforcement of these patents and patent applications. We continue to remain the exclusive licensee of these Aventis Pharma patents, which continue to be exclusively sub-licensed to Waterstone, but were not assigned to Waterstone under the patent assignment agreement entered into in January 2015. 

Collaborations and Licensing Agreements &#32; Associated with Our Former Services Business 

We had a number of licensing and collaboration agreements associated with our former Services Business that were assigned to Accuratus in conjunction with the sale of the Services Business in July 2015, including the following: 

Merial 

Merial, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sanofi, is one of the largest animal health businesses in the world and had been a significant partner to our former Services Business since 2003. During 2015, we provided contract research and screening services in the field of animal health that primarily targeted parasites on a fee-for-service basis under an agreement effective December 2014. The Merial agreement was directly related to the Services Business and was assigned to Accuratus in conjunction with the sale of the Services Business in July 2015, including all future obligations and benefits. Revenue from the agreement is included in discontinued operations in the accompanying statements of operations. 

In the year ended December 31, 2015, we received $2.1 million &#32;from Merial under the research services agreement, which accounted for 29% &#32;of our revenues in discontinued operations. No other customer, except for Elanco Animal Health, accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in discontinued operations during 2015. 

Elanco Animal Health 

In December, 2013, we entered into a license, development, and commercialization agreement with Elanco Animal Health, or "Elanco", the animal health division of Eli Lilly Company, an American global pharmaceutical company, pursuant to which we performed research services and granted to Elanco a worldwide license (with a right to sub-license) to certain of our know-how, compounds, and patents exclusively for applications and uses of parasiticides for animals (companion or food), animal products, animal feed, human food, or the food chain. The agreement with Elanco Licensing Agreement was directly related to the Services Business and was assigned to Accuratus in conjunction with the sale of the Services Business in July 2015, including all future obligations and benefits. Revenue from the agreement is included in discontinued operations in the 

&#32;23 

accompanying statements of operations. As of July 17, 2015, when the agreement was assigned to Accuratus, we had recognized revenues of $4.24 million under the agreement. 

&#32;Government Regulation and Product Approval 

&#32;Government regulation 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

&#32;U.S. drug approval process 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recall requests, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#8226; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#8226; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication, subject to on-going IRB review; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current Good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, regulations and guidance, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and 

&#8226; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

&#32;Preclinical studies 

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 

&#32;Clinical trials 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols 

&#32;24 

detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which in some cases may overlap or be combined: 

Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 

Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population with the target disease to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population with the target disease, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials sometimes cannot be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 studies. 

In some circumstances, the FDA may also order a sponsor to conduct post-approval clinical trials if new safety information arises raising questions about the drug&#8217;s risk-benefit profile. Those clinical trials are typically referred to as Post-Marketing Requirements, or PMRs. 

&#32;Marketing approval 

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act guidelines that are currently in effect, for a drug considered to be a new molecular entity, the FDA has a goal of twelve months from the date of the receipt of a standard non-priority NDA to review and act on the submission, or eight months for a priority NDA for such a new molecular entity drug. 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 

The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets 

&#32;25 

standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, quality and purity. The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. 

If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the NDA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 

Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 

&#32;GAIN Act 

The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that meet certain qualifications. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 

The GAIN Act is intended to encourage development of new antibacterial and antifungal drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening infections by providing certain benefits to sponsors, including extended exclusivity periods, fast track and priority review. To be eligible for these benefits a product in development must seek and be awarded designation as a Qualifying Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP. 

To qualify as a QIDP according to the criteria established in the GAIN Act a product must be an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including, those: 

(1) 

caused by an antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens; or 

(2) 

qualifying pathogens listed by the FDA in accordance with the GAIN Act. 

&#32;Fast Track Designation 

The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor's request. 

If a submission is granted Fast Track designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of 

&#32;26 

the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 

&#32;Post-approval requirements 

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 

The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#8226; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#8226; 

warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#8226; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#8226; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#8226; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which regulate the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and set minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and, in conjunction with the DSCSA, impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 

Exclusivity and approval of competing products 

&#32;Hatch-Waxman exclusivity 

Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products, namely, abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, for proposed generic drugs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for products that rely at least in part on FDA&#8217;s prior approval of another drug product. Drugs approved through a Section 505(b)(2) NDA generally include a clinically significant change from the previously approved drug product. Section 505(b)(2) permits the applicant to rely upon FDA&#8217;s approval of certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA typically requires companies to perform additional, sometimes extensive, clinical studies and analyses to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label 

&#32;27 

indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 

The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety. The active moiety of a drug is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance, excluding any salts, esters or non-covalent derivatives that may be appended to the molecule or ion. During the exclusivity period for a new chemical entity, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 

The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

&#32;Pediatric exclusivity 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of regulatory protection to the term of any existing exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity periods described above, and to the regulatory term of any patent that has been submitted to FDA for the approved drug product. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study or studies in accordance with an FDA-issued &#8220;Written Request&#8221; for such a study or studies. 

&#32;Qualified Infectious Disease Product exclusivity 

If the NDA for a QIDP is approved by the FDA, the FDA will extend by an additional five years any non-patent marketing exclusivity period awarded, such as a five-year exclusivity period awarded for a new chemical entity. This extension is in addition to any pediatric exclusivity extension awarded. Eligibility for the extension will be denied if the product is approved for uses that would not meet the definition of a QIDP. 

&#32;Foreign regulation 

To market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 

&#32;Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our product candidates which may be ultimately approved, including SCY-078, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial health insurers. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product is separate from the process for determining the reimbursement rate for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication or may apply utilization management requirements such as prior authorization to restrict access to certain approved drugs for a particular indication. 

To secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved by the FDA for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective by government or private third-party payor decision makers. A payor&#8217;s 

&#32;28 

decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not mean that the product will be adequately reimbursed. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices of medical products and corresponding services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider products for which we may obtain regulatory approval to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not provide coverage for our products as a benefit under their health insurance plans or, if they do, the reimbursement rates may not be adequate to allow recovery of product development and production costs. 

The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug product candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results. 

Pricing and reimbursement requirements vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. 

The marketability and adoption of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and private third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party payment rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, together the Affordable Care Act, was adopted in the United States. This law substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Changes that may affect our business if we or our partners commercialize our products in the future include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, and fraud and abuse and enforcement. 

&#32;Healthcare law and regulation 

Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors often play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our future arrangements with third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following: 

&#8226; 

The federal healthcare anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federally funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the federal anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The Affordable Care Act clarified that a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of the federal anti-kickback statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended the federal civil False Claims Act to provide that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, however, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. 

&#8226; 

The federal civil False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment of government funds that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have faced enforcement actions 

&#32;29 

under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, federal anti-kickback statute violations and certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also implicate the federal civil False Claims Act. Federal civil False Claims Act violations may result in civil monetary damages and penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. There are also criminal penalties, including imprisonment and criminal fines, for making or presenting a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government. 

&#8226; 

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 

&#8226; 

The federal criminal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 

&#8226; 

The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires applicable pharmaceutical manufacturers of covered drugs to engage in extensive tracking of physician and teaching hospital payments, maintenance of a payments database, and public reporting of the payment data. Pharmaceutical manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program must perform such tracking and provide annual reports through the Open Payments Program. CMS posts such manufacturer disclosures on a searchable public website. Failure to comply with the reporting obligations may result in civil monetary penalties. 

&#8226; 

Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by Medicaid or other state programs or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Several state laws require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products in those states and to report gifts and payments to individual health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing related activities including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. 

Intellectual Property 

We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 

As of March 1, 2016, we are the owner of 12 issued U.S. patents and 102 issued non-U.S. patents with claims to novel compounds, compositions containing them, processes for their preparation, their uses as pharmaceutical agents and test methods, with terms expiring between 2017 and 2029. Of these patents, one U.S. patent relates to SCY-078. We are actively pursuing three U.S. patent applications (provisional and non-provisional), two international (PCT) patent applications and 39 non-U.S. patent applications in at least 28 jurisdictions. 

We are the exclusive licensee from Aventis Pharma of two issued U.S. patents and eight issued non-U.S. patents, with claims to novel compounds, compositions containing them, processes for their preparation, and their uses as pharmaceutical agents, with terms expiring between 2017 and 2019. These include patents covering our lead cyclophilin inhibitor compound, SCY-635, which, in October 2014 was exclusively licensed to Waterstone for the treatment of viral diseases in humans (as described in the section above titled &#8220;Collaborations and Licensing Arrangements&#8221;). The agreement granted Waterstone an exclusive license or sub-license for human viral diseases to certain patents and patent applications owned by or exclusively licensed to us relating to SCY&#8209;635. In January 2015, we entered into a patent assignment agreement with Waterstone under which a total of 18 patents and patent applications owned by us and relating to SCY-635 were assigned to Waterstone. Following this assignment, Waterstone assumed responsibility for maintenance, prosecution and enforcement of these patents and patent applications. We continue to remain the exclusive licensee of these Aventis Pharma patents, which continue to be 

&#32;30 

exclusively sub-licensed to Waterstone, but were not assigned to Waterstone under the patent assignment agreement entered into in January 2015. 

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of antifungal agents. 

We believe that we have a strong intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to the development and commercialization of SCY-078, including patents or patent applications covering inventions that we have co-invented with Merck. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 

Our objective is to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to SCY-078 or derivatives thereof. We intend to pursue, maintain, and defend patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, and to protect the technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. 

&#32;SCY-078 

The patent portfolio for SCY-078 is directed to cover compositions of matter, formulation, methods of use and precursors or intermediaries in its preparation. This patent portfolio includes an issued U.S. patent and corresponding foreign national and regional counterpart patents and patent applications. The patents and patent applications relating to SCY-078 include patents and patent applications that were initially assigned to us and Merck Sharp &#38; Dohme Corp, a subsidiary of Merck &#38; Co., Inc. Merck Sharp &#38; Dohme Corp. subsequently assigned to us all of its rights in these patents and patent applications relating to SCY-078. The issued composition of matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 8,188,085), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other governmental fees are paid, is expected to expire in 2030. Based on our current development plan, we believe that an additional term of up to five years for the SCY-078 U.S. patent may result from the patent term extension provision of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act). We expect that the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other governmental fees are paid, would expire between 2029 and 2035, including any additional term from patent term adjustment or patent term extension. The patent term calculation method and the provisions under the Hatch-Waxman Act are described in the &#8220;Patent Term&#8221; section below. We are not currently aware of any third-party patents (other than patents we have licensed) encompassing SCY-078. 

The terms of issued SCY-078 composition of matter patents in other jurisdictions (Algeria, Armenia, Australia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Colombia, Europe, Honduras, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Lebanon, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Moldova, Morocco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkmenistan and Ukraine), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other government fees are paid, are expected to expire in 2029. These patents and patent applications (if applicable), depending on the national laws, may benefit from extension of patent term in individual countries. In some European countries, for example, a supplementary protection certificate, if obtained, provides a maximum of five years of market exclusivity. The duration of the supplementary protection certificate may be extended to five and a half years when the supplementary protection certificate relates to a human medicinal product for which data from clinical trials conducted in accordance with an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, have been submitted. Likewise, in Japan, the term of a patent may be extended by a maximum of five years in certain circumstances. 

&#32;SCY-641 

The patent portfolio for SCY-641 is directed to cover compositions of matter, formulation, and methods of use. This patent portfolio includes issued U.S. patents and corresponding foreign national and regional counterpart patents and patent applications. The patents and patent applications relating to SCY-641 include patents and patent applications owned by us. The issued composition of matter patent (U.S. Patent No. 6,583,265), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other government fees are paid, is expected to expire in 2019. The issued methods of use patents (U.S. Patent Nos. 8,188,052 and 8,551,952), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other government fees are paid, are expected to expire in 2029 or 2027, respectively. We believe that the term for up to five years for one of the SCY-641 U.S. patents may be extended under the patent term extension provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act. We expect that the patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other governmental fees are paid, would expire between 2019 and 2034, including any additional term from patent term adjustment or patent term extension, assuming that five year extension is granted. The patent term calculation method and the provisions under the Hatch-Waxman Act are described in the &#8220;Patent Term&#8221; section below. 

&#32;31 

The term of issued SCY-641 composition of matter patents in other jurisdictions (Australia, Canada, China, Europe and Japan) and methods of use patents and patent applications (if applicable) relating to SCY-641 (in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan and South Africa), if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, and other government fees are paid, are expected to expire between 2019 and 2027. The patents and patent applications (if applicable), covering SCY-641, depending on the national laws, may also benefit from extension of patent term in individual countries. 

&#32;Other product candidates 

In addition to SCY-078, SCY-635 and SCY-641, we have a chemical library of more than 1,000 macrocyclic compounds generated by the research team at SCYNEXIS. This library includes compounds which are covered by patents or patent applications filed by us, but also includes novel chemical compounds which could form the basis for future patent applications. 

&#32;Patent Term 

The term of individual patents and patent applications will depend upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application (or earliest filed parent application, if applicable). 

Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that claims an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, or PTE. Eligibility for a PTE is based, in part, on whether the FDA approval of the drug represents the first permitted commercial marketing or use of the drug. Drugs that are considered to be new chemical entities under FDA&#8217;s regulations are generally eligible for PTE. 

PTE permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process, which includes both the testing period while the drug is being investigated under an IND and the approval period while FDA is reviewing a marketing application. The length of the patent term extension is half the testing period plus all of the approval period, with certain limitations. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent; however, a patent term extension cannot in any event extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval; only one patent that claims an approved drug may be extended; and the applicable approval must be the first approval of the product under the provision of law authorizing the approval. During the extension period, the patent holder&#8217;s rights under the patent are generally limited to approved uses of the product. Similar provisions may be available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of an NDA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering SCY-078 and its use in treating various diseases. As a specific example, if we are awarded the maximum length of PTE, our U.S. composition of matter patent relating to SCY-078 would have an expected expiration date of the earlier of 14 years from product approval or August 28, 2035. However, depending on any changes in our clinical path and the date of FDA approval, the PTE may not be granted, or may be less than the maximum. 

&#32;Proprietary rights and processes 

We may rely, in some circumstances, on proprietary technology and processes (including trade secrets) to protect our technology. However, these can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and collaborators. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our proprietary technology and processes may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology and processes, please see the section on &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221; 

Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings the outcome of which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or in the aggregate have a material effect on our business, operating results, financial condition or cash flows. 

Employees 

As of March 1, 2016, we had 11 employees, all of whom were employed on a full-time basis. Our employees are engaged in administration, accounting and finance, research, clinical development, manufacturing, and business development functions. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
