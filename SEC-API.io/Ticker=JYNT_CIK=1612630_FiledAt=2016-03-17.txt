Some of the important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy if we or our franchisees are unable to locate and secure appropriate sites for clinic locations, obtain favorable lease terms, and attract patients to our clinics; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; we have limited experience operating company-owned or managed clinics, and we may not be able to duplicate the success of some of our franchisees; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; we may not be able to acquire operating clinics from existing franchisees or develop company-owned or managed clinics on attractive terms; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; any acquisitions that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; we may not be able to continue to sell franchises to qualified franchisees; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; we may not be able to identify, recruit and train enough qualified chiropractors to staff our clinics; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; new clinics may not be profitable, and we may not be able to maintain or improve revenues and franchise fees from existing franchised clinics; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; the chiropractic industry is highly competitive, with many well-established competitors; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; recent administrative actions and rulings regarding the corporate practice of medicine and joint employer responsibility may jeopardize our business model; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; we may face negative publicity or damage to our reputation, which could arise from concerns expressed by opponents of chiropractic and by chiropractors operating under traditional service models; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; legislation and regulations, as well as new medical procedures and techniques could reduce or eliminate our competitive advantages; 

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; we face increased costs as a result of being a public company; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and our business and stock price may be adversely affected if we do not adequately address those weaknesses. 

&#160;

Additionally, there may be other risks that are otherwise described from time to time in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any forward-looking statements in this report should be considered in light of various important factors, including the risks and uncertainties listed above, as well as others. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160;

The principal business of The Joint Corp., a Delaware corporation, is to develop, own, operate, support and manage chiropractic clinics through direct ownership, management arrangements, franchising and the sale of regional developer rights throughout the United States.

&#160;

As used in this Form 10-K:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to The Joint Corp. &#160;

&#160; &#183; a &#8220;clinic&#8221; refers to a chiropractic clinic operating under our &#8220;Joint&#8221; brand, which may be (i) owned by a franchisee, (ii) owned by a professional corporation or limited liability company and managed by a franchisee; (iii) owned directly by us; or (iv) owned by a professional corporation or limited liability company and managed by us. &#160;

&#160; &#183; when we identify an &#8220;operator&#8221; of a clinic, a party that is &#8220;operating&#8221; a clinic, or a party by whom a clinic is &#8220;operated,&#8221; we are referring to the party that operates all aspects of the clinic in certain jurisdictions, and to the party that manages all aspects of the clinic other than the practice of chiropractic in certain other jurisdictions. &#160;

&#160; &#183; when we describe our acquisition or our opening of a clinic, we are referring to our acquisition or opening of the entity that operates all aspects of the clinic in certain jurisdictions, and to our acquisition or opening of the entity that manages aspects of the clinic other than the practice of chiropractic in certain other jurisdictions. &#160;

We are a rapidly growing franchisor and operator of chiropractic clinics that uses a private pay, non-insurance, cash-based model. We seek to be the leading provider of chiropractic care in the markets we serve and to become the most recognized brand in our industry through the rapid and focused expansion of chiropractic clinics in key markets throughout North America and abroad. Our mission is to improve the quality of life through routine chiropractic care. We strive to accomplish this by making quality care readily available and affordable. We have created a growing network of modern, consumer-friendly chiropractic clinics operated by franchisees and by us that employ only licensed chiropractors. We have priced our services below most competitors&#8217; pricing for similar services and below most insurance co-payment levels (i.e., below the patient co-payment required for an insurance-covered service).

&#160;

Since acquiring the predecessor to our company in March, 2010, we have grown our enterprise from eight to 312 clinics in operation as of December 31, 2015, with an additional 168 franchise licenses sold but not yet developed across our network. In the year ended December 31, 2015, our system registered 3.2 million patient visits and generated system-wide sales of $70.1 million. As of December 31, 2015, 265 of our clinics were operated by franchisees and 47 clinics were operated as company-owned or managed units. Our future growth strategy will focus on operating clinics owned or managed by us, while continuing to support and strategically grow our franchise base through the sale of additional franchises. We collect a royalty of 7.0% of revenues from directly franchised clinics. We remit a 3.0% royalty to our regional developers on the gross revenues of franchises opened under regional developer licenses. We also collect a national marketing fee of 2.0% of gross revenues of all franchised clinics. We receive a franchise sales fee of $39,900 for franchises we sell directly and a franchise fee ranging from $19,950 to $25,400 for franchises sold through our network of regional developers. 

&#160;

&#160;

On November 14, 2014, we completed our initial public offering, or the IPO, of 3,000,000 shares of common stock at an initial price to the public of $6.50 per share, and we received net proceeds of approximately $17.1 million. Our underwriters exercised their option to purchase 450,000 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments on November 18, 2014, pursuant to which we received net proceeds of approximately $2.7 million. Also, in conjunction with the IPO, we issued warrants to the underwriters for the purchase of 90,000 shares of common stock, which can be exercised between November 10, 2015 and November 10, 2018 at an exercise price of $8.125 per share.

&#160;

On November 25, 2015 we closed on our follow-on public offering of 2,272,727 shares of our common stock, offered and sold by the Company, at a price to the public of $5.50 per share. We granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 340,909 additional shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, if any. On December 30, 2015 the underwriters of our public offering of common stock exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 340,909 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $5.50 per share. After giving effect to the over-allotment exercise, the total number of shares offered and sold in our follow-on public offering increased to 2,613,636 shares. With the over-allotment option exercise, we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $13.0 million.

&#160;

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had net loss after taxes of $8,797,321 and $ 3,031,220, respectively.

&#160;

Over the past three calendar years, our system has achieved sustained increases in average monthly revenues and patient visits per clinic, which we believe demonstrates our ability to continue to increase revenues and to grow our brand equity. For the comparable group of 14 clinics that opened in 2011, we increased sales throughout our system from $650,170 in 2011 to $6,471,450 in 2015. We increased patient visits from 34,056 to 280,674 in 2015.

&#160;

As part of our branding strategy, we deliver convenient, appointment-free chiropractic adjustments in an inviting, consumer-oriented environment at prices that are approximately 67% lower than the average industry cost, according to 2014 industry data from Chiropractic Economics, for comparable procedures offered by traditional chiropractors. In support of our mission to offer affordable and convenient care and value for our patients, our clinics offer a variety of customizable membership and wellness treatment plans which offer additional value pricing even as compared with our single-visit pricing schedules. These flexible plans are designed to attract patients and encourage repeat visits and routine usage. &#160;

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 312 franchised or company-owned or managed clinics in operation in 27 states. The map below shows the states in which we or our franchisees operate clinics and the number of clinics open in each state as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

Our locations have been selected to be visible, accessible and convenient. We offer a welcoming, consumer-friendly experience that attempts to redefine the chiropractic doctor/patient relationship. Our clinics are open longer hours than many of our competitors and our patients do not need appointments. We accept cash or major credit cards in return for our services. We do not accept insurance and do not provide Medicare covered services. We believe that our approach, especially our commitment to affordable pricing and our ready service delivery model, will attract existing consumers of chiropractic services and will also appeal to the growing market of consumers who seek alternative or non-invasive wellness care, but have not yet tried chiropractic.

&#160;

Our patients arrive at our clinics without appointments at times convenient to their schedules. Once a patient has joined our system and is returning for treatment, they simply swipe their membership card at a card reader at the reception desk to announce their arrival. Typically, within three to five minutes (the average throughout our system), the patient is escorted to our open adjustment area, where they are required to remove only their outerwear to receive their adjustment. The adjustment process, administered by a licensed chiropractor, takes approximately 15 &#8211;20 minutes on average for a new patient and 5 &#8211; 7 minutes on average for a returning patient. Each patient&#8217;s records are digitally updated for ready retrieval in our proprietary data storage system by our chiropractors in compliance with all applicable medical records security and privacy regulations.

&#160;

Our consumer-focused service model targets the non-acute treatment market, which we believe to be the largest segment of the $11 billion chiropractic services market. As our model does not focus on the treatment of severe, acute injury, we do not provide expensive and invasive diagnostic tools such as MRIs and X-rays but instead we refer those with acute symptoms to alternate healthcare providers, including traditional chiropractors.

&#160;

&#160;

Our Industry 

&#160;

Chiropractic care is widely accepted among individuals with a variety of medical conditions, particularly back pain. A 2015 Gallup report commissioned by Palmer College of Chiropractic shows that 33.6 million U.S. adults (14% of the total population) now seek chiropractic care each year. This number represents a marked increase over the 2012 National Health Interview Survey that measured chiropractic use at 20.6 million U.S. adults, or 8% of the population. According to the American Chiropractic Association, 80% of Americans experience back pain at least once in their lifetime. According to Global Industry Analysts, chiropractic represents one of the most popular and cost effective alternative treatments for musculoskeletal disorders and is being used by more than 50% of American patients suffering from persistent back pain. The National Center for Complementary &#38; Alternative Medicine of the National Institutes of Health has stated that spinal manipulation appears to benefit some people with low-back pain and also may be helpful for headaches, neck pain, upper- and lower-extremity joint conditions and whiplash-associated disorders. The Mayo Clinic has recognized chiropractic as safe when performed by trained and licensed chiropractors, and the Cleveland Clinic has stated that chiropractors are established members of the mainstream medical team.

&#160;

The chiropractic industry in the United States is large, growing and highly fragmented. According to a report issued by First Research in August 2015, expenditures for chiropractic services in the U.S. were $11.0 billion in 2014 and are expected to grow at approximately 4% annually between 2015 and 2019. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics expects employment in chiropractic to grow faster than the average for all occupations. Some of the factors that the Bureau of Labor Statistics identified as driving this growth are healthcare cost pressures, an aging population requiring more health care and technological advances, all of which are expected to increasingly shift services from inpatient facilities and hospitals to outpatient settings. We believe that the demand for our chiropractic services will continue to grow as a result of several additional drivers, such as the increased awareness of the benefits of regular maintenance therapy coupled with an increasing awareness of the availability of our pricing at significant discount relative to the cost of traditional chiropractic adjustments and, in most cases, at or below the level of insurance co-payment amounts.

&#160;

Today, most chiropractic services are provided by sole practitioners, generally in medical office settings. The chiropractic industry differs from the broader healthcare services industry in that it is more heavily consumer-driven, market-responsive and price sensitive, in large measure a result of many treatment options falling outside the bounds of traditional insurance reimbursable services and fee schedules. According to First Research, the top 50 companies delivering chiropractic services in the United States generated less than 10% of all industry revenue. We believe these characteristics are evidence of an underserved market with potential consumer demand that is favorable for an efficient, low-cost, consumer-oriented provider.

&#160;

Most chiropractic practices are set up to accept and to process insurance-based reimbursement. While chiropractors typically accept cash payment in addition to insurance, Medicare and Medicaid, they continue to incur overhead expenses associated with maintaining the capability to process third-party reimbursement. We believe that most chiropractors who operate utilizing this third-party reimbursement model would find it economically difficult to discount the prices they charge for their services to levels comparable with our pricing.

&#160;

Accordingly, we believe these and certain other trends favor our business model. Among these are:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; individuals are increasingly practicing active lifestyles and people are living longer, requiring more medical, maintenance and preventative support; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; individuals are displaying an increasing openness to alternative, non-pharmacological types of care; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; utilization of more conveniently situated, local-sited urgent-care or &#8220;mini-care&#8221; alternatives to primary care is increasing; and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; popularity of health clubs, massage and other non-drug, non-invasive wellness maintenance providers is growing. 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

We believe the following competitive strengths have contributed to our initial success and will position us for future growth:

&#160;

Price and convenience. We believe that our strongest competitive advantages are our price and convenience. We offer a much less expensive alternative to traditional providers of chiropractic services by focusing on non-acute care and by not participating in insurance or Medicare reimbursement. We can do this because our clinics are not burdened with the operating expenses required to perform certain diagnostic procedures and the administrative requirements and expense to process reimbursement claims. Our model allows us to pass these savings on to our patients. According to Chiropractic Economics in 2015, the average price for a chiropractic adjustment involving spinal manipulation in the United States is approximately $66. By comparison, our average price as of December 31, 2015, was approximately $22 or approximately 67% lower than the industry average price.

&#160;

Our service offerings, pricing and growing number of conveniently sited locations encourage consumer trial, repeat visits and sustainable patient relationships. According to a 2013 survey conducted by Chiropractic Economics, the average for repeat patient visits generally in the chiropractic industry is two times per month. We believe our pricing and service offering structure helps us to generate a higher usage. The following table sets forth our average price per adjustment as of December 31, 2015, for patients who pay by single adjustment plans, multiple adjustment packages, and multiple adjustment membership plans. Our price per adjustment as of December 31, 2015 averaged approximately $22 across all three groups.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; The Joint Service Offering &#160; &#160; Single Visit &#160; Package(s) &#160; Membership(s) Price per adjustment &#160; $ 29 &#160; &#160; &#160; $17 &#8211; $23 &#160; &#160; &#160; $12 &#8211; $15 &#160; 

&#160;

We began a price increase test in select markets during November of 2015 which increased sales in the month prior to implementation. We plan to implement price increases in 2016 which reflect the higher cost of operations we incur in certain markets. However, we believe that our prices will remain significantly lower than our competitors&#8217; prices.

&#160;

We have attracted between 540 and 1,003 new patients per year to each of our clinics between 2010 and 2015, as compared to the 2015 chiropractic industry average of 322 new patients per year for non-multidisciplinary or integrated practices, according to a 2015 Chiropractic Economics survey.

&#160;

We offer our patients the opportunity to visit our clinics without an appointment and receive prompt attention. Additionally, we offer extended hours of operation, including weekends, which is not typical among our competitors.

&#160;

Retail, consumer-driven approach . To support our consumer focused model, we utilize strong, recognizable brand and retail approaches to stimulate awareness and attract patients to our clinics. We intend to continue to drive awareness of our brand by locating clinics principally at retail centers and convenience points, utilizing prominent signage and deploying consistent, proven and targeted marketing initiatives. We provide our patients with the flexibility to see a chiropractor when they want because we do not schedule appointments. Most of our clinics offer patient care six or seven days per week at locations people can get to easily and regularly.

&#160;

By limiting administrative burdens associated with insurance processing, our model helps chiropractors focus on patient service. We believe the time our chiropractors save by not having to attend to administrative duties related to insurance reimbursement allows more time to:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; see more patients, &#160;

&#160; &#8226; establish and reinforce chiropractor/patient relationships, and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; educate patients on the benefits of chiropractic maintenance therapy. &#160;

Our approach has made us an attractive alternative for chiropractic doctors who desire to spend more time treating patients than they typically do in traditional practices, which are burdened with greater overhead, personnel and administrative expense. We believe that our model will aid us in recruiting chiropractors who desire to focus their practice principally on patient care.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

Proven track record of opening clinics and growing revenue at the clinic level . We have grown our clinic revenue base every month since we acquired our predecessor in March 2010. From January 2012 through December 31, 2015, we have increased monthly sales from $369,296 to $6,609,926. During this period we increased the number of clinics in operation from 33 to 312.

&#160;

&#160;

Strong and proven management team. Our strategic vision and results-oriented culture are directed by our senior management team led by Chief Executive Officer John B. Richards, who previously served as president of Starbucks North America when it expanded from 500 to 3,000 units. Mr. Richards was also Chief Executive Officer of Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons. Our senior management team also includes David Orwasher, who is our Chief Development and Strategy Officer and who previously served as a vice president of Starbucks, working directly with Mr. Richards during the same significant growth period. Our senior management directs an additional team of dedicated leaders who are focused on executing our business plan and implementing our growth strategy. Messrs. Richards and Orwasher have had collective responsibility for building, opening or franchising a total of over 7,000 retail units. We believe that our management team&#8217;s experience and demonstrated success in building, developing and rapidly scaling operating systems, both company and franchised, will be a key driver of our growth and will position us well for achieving our long-term strategy.

&#160; 

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

Our Growth Strategy 

&#160;

Our goal is not only to capture a significant share of the existing market but also to expand the market for chiropractic care. We intend to accomplish this through the rapid and focused geographic expansion of our affordable service offering by the introduction of company-owned or managed clinics and the continued support and growth of our franchising program. We propose to employ a variety of growth tactics including:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; the continued growth of corporate-owned or managed, and franchise clinic revenue and royalty income; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; the development of company-owned clinics in clustered geographies; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; the opportunistic acquisition of existing franchises; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; the sale of additional franchises; &#160;

&#160; &#8226; acquiring regional developer licenses; and &#160;

&#160; &#8226; improving operational margins and leveraging infrastructure. &#160;

Our analysis of data from over 300,000 patients from 262 clinics across 27 states suggests that the United States market alone can support at least 1,650 of our clinics.

&#160;

Continued growth of system revenue. 

&#160; 

System wide comparable same-store sales growth, or &#8220;Comp Sales,&#8221; for 2015 was 34.1% for the full year of 2015. Comp Sales refers to the amount of sales a clinic generates in the most recent accounting period, relative to the amount of sales it generated in a similar period in the past. Comp Sales include the sales from both company-owned or managed clinics and franchised clinics that have been open at least 13 full months and exclude any clinics that have closed. We believe that the experience we have gained in developing and refining management systems, operating standards, training materials and marketing and customer acquisition activities has contributed to our system&#8217;s revenue growth. We believe that increasing awareness of our brand has contributed to revenue growth, particularly in markets where the number and density of our clinics has made cooperative and mass media advertising attractive. We believe that our ability to leverage aggregated and general media digital advertising and search tools will continue to grow as the number and density of our clinics increases.

&#160; 

Acquiring existing franchises. 

&#160;

We believe that we can accelerate the development of, and revenue generation from, company-owned or managed clinics through the further selective acquisition of existing franchised clinics. Our management has developed a template for the acquisition of existing franchised clinics, their conversion to company-owned or managed clinics and their integration into a company-owned or managed clinic system. Before completing our initial public offering, we began to develop a pipeline of franchisees whose franchises may be available for purchase. Following the completion of the IPO through December 31, 2015, we acquired a net of 26 existing franchises and now operate them as company-owned or managed clinics.

&#160; 

Revenue growth of company-owned or managed clinics 

&#160;

Revenue from company-owned or managed clinics increased from $387,453 in the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the first quarter since acquisitions began, to approximately $1.3 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2015. Total revenue from the 47 company-owned or managed clinics was approximately $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Through December 31, 2015, revenue from company-owned or managed clinics consisted of revenue earned from the 26 franchised clinic acquisitions we have completed as well as the opening of 21 units developed by the Company during the second half of 2015.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Note: Amounts in table above are presented as cumulative totals

&#160;

During the fourth quarter, we opened 17 Greenfield units, eight in the month of December alone. Greenfield units are new units, often in new markets and take several months to develop a revenue base. The revenues presented above represent GAAP revenues from company operated clinics and management fees from company managed clinics.

&#160; 

Development of company-owned or managed clinics. 

&#160; 

We will continue to focus on the development of company-owned or managed clinics in our growth plan, and we intend to use a significant portion of the proceeds from our securities offerings to pursue this strategy. We plan to open or purchase company-owned or managed clinics that meet our criteria for demographics, site attractiveness, proximity to other clinics and additional suitability factors.

&#160;

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

We believe we can leverage the experience we have gained in supporting our clinic growth and our senior management&#8217;s experience in rapidly and effectively growing other well-known high velocity specialty retail concepts to successfully develop and profitably operate company-owned or managed clinics. Since commencing operations as a franchisor of chiropractic clinics, we have gained significant experience in identifying and implementing the business systems and practices that are required to profitably operate our clinics, validate our model and demonstrate proof of concept. We have developed simple, repeatable operating standards which, when applied in a disciplined approach, result in an attractive opportunity for success at the clinic level.

&#160;

We believe that the direct control over company-owned or managed clinics will enable us to apply these operating standards even more effectively than in our franchised clinics. We intend to develop company-owned or managed clinics in geographic clusters where we are able to increase efficiencies through a consolidated real estate penetration strategy, leverage cooperative advertisement and marketing and attain general corporate and administrative operating efficiencies. Our senior management has done this before, and we believe that their experience in this area readily translates to our business model.

&#160;

We also believe that the development timeline for company-owned or managed clinics can be shorter than the timeline for franchised clinics, which is generally between nine and 14 months. Our estimated development timelines for company-owned or managed clinics is approximately five months. While there may be material variances among franchisees in customer acquisition and compliance with operating standards, these variances can be reduced at company-owned or managed clinics. In addition, we believe that our revenue from company-owned or managed clinics will exceed revenue that would be generated through royalty income from a franchise-only system.

&#160;

The more effective application of our operating standards that we believe will come from direct control over company-owned or managed clinics will enable us to collect more revenue per clinic than would otherwise be available to us solely through the collection of royalty fees, franchise sales fees, and regional developer fees. We intend to develop company-owned or managed clinics in geographic clusters where we are able to increase efficiencies through a consolidated real estate penetration strategy, leverage aggregated advertisement and marketing, and attain general corporate and administrative operating efficiencies. We believe that our management&#8217;s experience in this area readily translates to our business model.

&#160;

We believe that the application of a centralized process, driven by development, management, human resources and recruiting professionals, will enable us to develop and operate company-owned or managed clinics with greater consistency than if we relied solely on growth through franchising.

&#160;

Opening clinics in development. 

&#160; 

In addition to our 312 operating clinics, we have granted franchises either directly or through our regional developers for an additional 168 clinics as of December 31, 2015 that we believe will be developed in the future. We will continue to support our franchisees and regional developers to open these clinics and to achieve sustainable performance as soon as possible.

&#160;

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we terminated 33 franchise licenses that were in default of various obligations under their respective franchise agreements. In conjunction with these terminations, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $957,000 of revenue and $435,650 of costs, which were previously deferred.

&#160;

Selling additional franchises. 

&#160; 

We intend to continue to sell franchises. We believe that, to secure leadership in our industry and to maximize our opportunities and presence in identified markets, it is important to gain brand equity and consumer awareness as rapidly as possible, consistent with a disciplined approach to opening clinics. We believe that continued sales of franchises in selected markets complements our plan to open company-owned or managed clinics, particularly in specialized or unique operating environments, and that a growth strategy that includes both franchised and company-owned or managed clinics has advantages over either approach by itself.

&#160;

&#160;

Reacquiring regional developer licenses. 

&#160; 

We intend to selectively pursue the reacquisition of regional developer licenses. Following the completion of our IPO, we entered into several agreements to repurchase regional developer licenses, reacquiring rights in Los Angeles County, San Diego, and Orange County, all located in the state of California, Erie County, Monroe County, Nassau County, Suffolk County, and Albany County, all located in the state of New York, and the developer license in New Jersey. We believe that by repurchasing regional developer licenses, we can increase our profitability through capturing the regional developers&#8217; royalty streams from franchises within their regions. In addition, to the extent that we acquire a given regional developer license, we will have fewer limitations on, and less cost associated with, opening or acquiring clinics within that region.

&#160;

Continue to improve margins and leverage infrastructure. 

&#160; 

We believe our corporate infrastructure is positioned to support a clinic base greater than our existing footprint. As we continue to grow, we expect to drive greater efficiencies across our operations and development and marketing organizations and further leverage our technology and existing support infrastructure. We believe we will be able to control corporate costs over time to enhance margins as general and administrative expenses grow at a slower rate than our clinic base and revenues. We believe we can eventually introduce better and more visible professional marketing and patient acquisition practices that will promote brand recognition and drive revenue increases at a faster pace than marketing costs will increase. At the clinic level, we expect to drive margins and labor efficiencies through continued revenue growth and consistently applied operating standards as our clinic base matures and the average number of patient visits increases. In addition, we will consider introducing selected and complementary branded products such as nutraceuticals or dietary supplements and related additional services.

&#160;

Regulatory Environment 

&#160;

HIPAA 

&#160; 

In an effort to further combat healthcare fraud and protect patient confidentiality, Congress included several anti-fraud measures in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). HIPAA created a source of funding for fraud control to coordinate federal, state and local healthcare law enforcement programs, conduct investigations, provide guidance to the healthcare industry concerning fraudulent healthcare practices, and establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse actions. HIPAA also criminalized certain forms of healthcare fraud against all public and private payors. Additionally, HIPAA mandates the adoption of standards regarding the exchange of healthcare information in an effort to ensure the privacy and security of electronic patient information. Sanctions for failing to comply with HIPAA include criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In February 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) was enacted. Title XIII of ARRA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), includes substantial Medicare and Medicaid incentives for providers to adopt electronic health records (&#8220;EHR&#8221;) and grants for the development of health information exchange (&#8220;HIE&#8221;) systems. Recognizing that HIE and EHR systems will not be implemented unless the public can be assured that the privacy and security of patient information in such systems is protected, HITECH also significantly expands the scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Most notable are the new mandatory breach notification requirements and a heightened enforcement scheme that includes increased penalties, and which now apply to business associates as well as to covered entities. In addition to HIPAA, a number of states have adopted laws and/or regulations applicable in the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information that can be more stringent than comparable provisions under HIPAA and HITECH.

&#160;

We believe that our operations substantially comply with applicable standards for privacy and security of protected healthcare information. We cannot predict what negative effect, if any, HIPAA/HITECH or any applicable state law or regulation will have on our business.

&#160;

&#160;

State regulations on corporate practice of chiropractic. 

&#160;

In states that regulate the &#8220;corporate practice of chiropractic,&#8221; our chiropractic services are provided by legal entities organized under state laws as professional corporations, or PCs. Each of the PCs is wholly owned by one or more licensed chiropractors, and employs or contracts with chiropractors in one or more offices. We do not own any capital stock of (or have any other ownership interest in) any such PC. We and our franchisees that are not owned by chiropractors enter into management services agreements with PCs to provide the PCs on an exclusive basis with all non-clinical administrative services of the chiropractic practice. In November, 2015, the California Board of Chiropractic Examiners commenced an administrative proceeding to which we are not a party, in which it claimed that the doctor who owns the PC that we manage in southern California violated California&#8217;s prohibition on the corporate practice of chiropractic, among other claims, because our management of the clinics operated by his PC involved the exercise of control over certain clinical aspects of his practice. In June 2015, the New York Attorney General announced that it had entered into an Assurance of Discontinuance with a provider of business services to independently owned dental practices in New York, pursuant to which the provider paid a substantial fine and agreed to change its business and branding practices. While the effect of the proceeding before the California Board of Chiropractic Examiners and the New York Assurance of Discontinuance is that our business practices in California and New York may be under stricter scrutiny than elsewhere, we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws relating to the corporate practice of chiropractic.

&#160; 

Regulation relating to franchising 

&#160;

We are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The Federal Trade Commission and various state laws require that we furnish a Franchise Disclosure Document or FDD containing certain information to prospective franchisees, and a number of states require registration of the FDD at least annually with state authorities. Included in the information required to be disclosed in our FDD is our business experience, material litigation, all fees due to us from franchisees, a franchisee&#8217;s estimated initial investment, restrictions on sources of products and services we impose on franchisees, development and operating obligations of franchisees, whether we provide financing to franchisees, our training and support obligations and other terms and conditions of our franchise agreement. We are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on our qualifications for exemption as set forth in those states&#8217; laws. Substantive state laws regulating the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in many states. We believe that our FDD and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the Federal Trade Commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises. We have not elected to sell franchises in certain states where the time and cost associated with registering our FDD in that state is not, in our judgment, justified by current demand for franchises in that state. As of December 31, 2015, we were registered to sell franchises in 27 states.

&#160; 

Other federal, state and local regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to varied federal regulations affecting the operation of our business. We are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various other federal and state laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime, fringe benefits, workplace safety and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. A significant number of our clinic service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage, and increases in the minimum wage could increase our labor costs. We are continuing to assess the impact of recently-adopted federal health care legislation on our health care benefit costs. Many of our smaller franchisees will qualify for exemption from the mandatory requirement to provide health insurance benefits because of their small number of employees. The imposition of any requirement that we or our franchisees provide health insurance benefits to our or their employees that are more extensive than the health insurance benefits that we currently provide to our employees or that franchisees may or may not provide, or the imposition of additional employer paid employment taxes on income earned by our employees, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

In August 2015, the National Labor Relations Board (or &#8220;NLRB&#8221;) adopted a more expansive definition of what it means to be a &#8220;joint employer,&#8221; making it easier for employees of franchisees to organize and bargain collectively. This NLRB action, as well as a July 2014 NLRB action holding that McDonald&#8217;s Corporation could be held jointly liable for labor and wage violations by its franchisees, may also make it easier for a franchisor to be held responsible as employer for a franchisee&#8217;s misconduct.

&#160;

We are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and related federal and state statutes, which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability. We may in the future have to modify our clinics to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons. While these expenses could be material, our current expectation is that any such actions will not require us to expend substantial funds.

&#160;

We are subject to extensive and varied state and local government regulation affecting the operation of our business, as are our franchisees, including regulations relating to public and occupational health and safety, sanitation, fire prevention and franchise operation. Each franchised clinic is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, environmental, building and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the clinic is located. We require our franchisees to operate in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations. However, our or our franchisees&#8217; inability to obtain or retain health or other licenses would adversely affect operations at the impacted clinic or clinics. Although we have not experienced and do not anticipate any significant difficulties, delays or failures in obtaining required licenses, permits or approvals, any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of, or adversely impact the viability of, a particular clinic. In addition, in order to develop and construct our clinics, we need to comply with applicable zoning and land use regulations. Federal and state regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date, but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning and land use could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs of new clinics.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The chiropractic industry is highly fragmented. According to First Research&#8217;s August 2015 report, the top 50 providers of chiropractic services in the United States generate less than 10% of industry revenue. Our competitors include approximately 39,000 independent chiropractic offices currently open throughout the United States as well as certain multi-unit operators. We may also face competition from traditional medical practices, outpatient clinics, physical therapists, massage therapists and sellers of devices intended for home use to address back and joint discomfort. Our two largest multi-unit competitors are HealthSource Chiropractic and ChiroOne, both insurance-based franchised models.

&#160;

We have identified two competitors who are attempting to duplicate our cash-only, low cost, appointment-free model. Based on publicly available information, these competitors operate ten clinics and two clinics, respectively, as franchises. We anticipate that other direct competitors will join our industry as our visibility, reputation and perceived advantages become more widely known.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 11, 2016, we had 104 employees on a full-time basis. None of our employees are members of unions or participate in other collective bargaining arrangements.

&#160;

Facilities 

&#160;

We lease the property for our corporate headquarters and all of the properties on which we own or manage clinics. As of March 11, 2016, we leased 56 facilities in which we operate or intend to operate clinics.

&#160;

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

Our corporate headquarters are located at 16767 North Perimeter Drive, Suite 240, Scottsdale, Arizona 85260. The term of our lease for this location expires on July 31, 2019. The primary functions performed at our corporate headquarters are financial, accounting, treasury, marketing, operations, human resources, information systems support and legal.

&#160;

We are also obligated under non-cancellable leases for the clinics which we own or manage. Our clinics are on average 1,200 square feet. Our clinic leases generally have an initial term of five years, include one to two options to renew for terms of five years, and require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, common area maintenance charges and other operating costs.

&#160;

As of March 11, 2016, our franchisees operated 276 clinics in 28 states. All of our franchise locations are leased.
