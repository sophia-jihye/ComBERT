Business. 

Overview 

Quotient Technology Inc., formerly known as Coupons.com Incorporated, is a provider of digital promotions and media solutions driven by consumer-shopping insights. We connect consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands and retailers with shoppers by delivering digital promotions and media to shoppers through mobile, web and social channels. Leading brands, as well as leading retailers in the grocery, drug, dollar, club and mass merchandise channels, use our platform to engage shoppers at the critical moments when they are choosing what products to buy and where to shop. Our new corporate name, which became effective October 20, 2015, is designed to better reflect the breadth and sophistication of our business offerings, along with our deepening relationships with Fortune 500 CPGs and retailers. 

Our core promotions and media solutions, which we refer to as Quotient Promotions and Quotient Media, respectively, reach millions of shoppers every day through our extensive network. That network includes our flagship site and mobile app, Coupons.com, our publishing network of over 30,000 registered partner sites, which have distributed or may distribute our offers and media, as well the web and mobile properties of our CPG and retailer partners. We refer to our emerging solutions around our data and analytic capabilities as Quotient Insights.

Our network is made up of three constituencies: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Over 2,000 brands from approximately 700 CPGs; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Retailers across multiple classes of trade such as grocery, drug, dollar, club, and mass merchandise channels; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Consumers visiting our web, mobile properties, social channels, as well as those of our CPGs and retailers. 

The relationship between our CPGs, retailers, publishers and consumers, has resulted in a network effect, which we believe gives us a significant competitive advantage. We believe that as our shopper audience increases, our platform becomes more valuable to CPGs and retailers, which, in turn, rely more heavily on our platform for their digital promotions and media. In addition, the breadth of content offered from these leading brands enables us to attract and retain more retailers, publishers and shoppers. As our network expands, we generate more shopper insights, which improves our ability to create more relevant and personalized consumer experiences. 

Our CPG customers include many of the leading food, beverage, drug, personal and household product manufacturers. We primarily generate revenue from CPGs by offering promotions and media content to consumers across our network. Our retailers include leading grocery, drug, dollar, club and mass merchandise channel retailers. We also service a broad range of specialty retailers, including clothing, electronics, home improvement and many others, through which we generate revenue primarily from offering coupon codes through our platform.

Historically, the vast majority of promotional and media budgets from CPGs and retailers have been spent in offline channels such as free standing inserts in Sunday newspapers, direct mail and promoti onal trade. The effectiveness of these traditional channels has declined, particularly with the decline in newspaper readership. In contrast to traditional promotions, digital coupons are redeemed at higher rates and are more effective. According to an ann ual industry report by NCH, in 2014, digital coupons (including digital print and paperless coupons) represented less than 1% of total U.S. CPG coupon distribution volume, but accounted for over 10% of total U.S. CPG coupon redemptions. This illustrates th e effectiveness of digital coupons. We believe that the simplicity of digital coupons is broadening the demographic reach and driving usage of digital coupons. Further, by shifting traditional offline promotional and media budgets to our digital platform, CPGs are able to use data-driven metrics to better optimize and reach consumers when and how they want to be reached. 

We generate promotion revenues from digital transactions on our network. Each time a consumer activates a digital coupon on our platform by eith er printing it for physical redemption at a retailer or saving it to a retailer loyalty account for automatic digital redemption, or redeeming a coupon using a mobile device for cash back after taking a picture of a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase, we are generally paid a fee. As our business evolves, we will continue to experiment with different pricing models and fee arrangements with CPGs and retailers which may impact how we monetize transactions. For coupon codes, we are generally paid a fee when a consumer makes a purchase using a coupon code from our platform. We generally pay a distribution fee to retailers or publishers when a consumer activates a digital promotion on their website or mobile app. These distribution fees are included in our cost of revenues. We also generate media revenue through the placement of online advertisements from CPGs and retailers that are displayed on our websites and mobile apps, as well as those of our publishers, retailers and other third parties. See Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; &#8220;Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Key Operating Metrics&#8221; for more information. 

During 2015, we generated revenues of $237.3 million, representing 7% growth over 2014, and a net loss of $26.7 million as compared to $23.4 million in 2014. See our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for more information. 

Growth Strategy 

We intend to grow our platform and our business through the following key strategies:

Increase revenues from CPGs already on our platform . Based on our experience to date, we believe we have opportunities to continue increasing revenues from our existing CPG customer base through: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

increasing our share of CPG spending on overall coupons and trade promotions; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

increasing the number of brands that are using our platform within each CPG; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

increasing media and advertising spending on our platform; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

leveraging our data to provide more targeting and insights; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

maximizing lifetime value of consumers across all products. 

Expand our network through Retailer iQ, our digital paperless platform. By using our platform to aggregate and optimize data, CPGs and retailers are able to offer a personalized and targeted consumer experiences to more effectively engage consumers and drive sales. By bringing retailers onto Retailer iQ, we are able to grow our digital paperless offering and distribution reach, and further leverage consumer insights from the platform. We believe as we continue to expand our network through Retailer iQ, the value we provide to CPGs and retailers increases, as well as the opportunity to increase our share of CPG spending from promotions, trade spend and media budgets. We intend to continue to invest in technologies and product offerings that further integrate digital promotions and media into the retailer channel, and specifically within our Retailer iQ platform. 

Grow our current customer base and add new industry segments. We believe we have the opportunity to grow the number of brands and retailers that we serve, thereby increasing the value of our platform to all constituents. In addition, we intend to continue growing our business with other manufacturers and retailers in new industry segments such as convenience and specialty/franchise retail, restaurants and entertainment venues. 

Continue to grow consumer adoption and engagement of our digital offerings. We plan to continue to innovate and invest in Retailer iQ, mobile solutions and digital promo tion offerings for specialty/franchise retail, including coupon codes. We believe that CPG spending on digital promotions and marketing will continue to grow as point of sale, mobile channels and social media offer new opportunities to engage consumers fro m intent to purchase of their products. We also plan to leverage our reach to consumers and the strength of our platform to broaden the selection and use of coupon codes by consumers. 

Grow international operations . Many CPGs and retailers on our platform have global operations and we believe that we can opportunistically grow our operations and offerings in existing international markets and partner with our existing clients to enter new geographies in which they operate. We also plan to leverage our existing presence in France, through our acquisition of Shopmium, a receipt-scanning, cash-back mobile application program, to broaden our international opportunity beginning with the United Kingdom. 

Expand and grow Quotient Insights, our emerging products around data and analytics. &#160; As our network, content pool and shopper audience expands, resulting in greater data and insights, we believe that our platform will become more valuable. Today, we offer real-time shopper insights that are valuable to our CPGs and retailer partners. Our targeted promotion offering is just one example of how we intend to use the platform to drive more value across the network. We also have the growing capability to directly link digital campaigns and media to in-store purchase data. We believe we are in a unique position to deliver new products around data and analytics, and the opportunity to grow Quotient Insights increases as we continue to expand. 

Selectively pursue strategic acquisitions. We intend to continue pursuing selective acquisition and partnership opportunities that we believe can expand our business. 

Customers 

Our CPG customers include many of the leading food, beverage, drug, personal and household product manufacturers. Our retailers include leading grocery, drug, dollar, club and mass market retailers which distribute and accept our coupons. Our retailers also include a broad range of specialty stores, including clothing, electronics, home improvement and many others which offer coupon codes through our platform. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, total revenue from The Procter and Gamble Company accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2013, no single customer represented more than 10% of our total revenues. 

Our Platform and Solutions 

We offer a digital promotion, media, data and analytics platform to connect CPGs and retailers with consumers. Our platform distributes personalized and targeted content at scale across multiple channels enabling &#160; CPGs and retailers to deliver promotions and media to consumers at the point when they are most engaged and likely to make a purchasing decision. We distribute digital coupons, which includes both coupons and coupon codes. Our digital coupons can be distributed through digital print and/or digital paperless channels and redeemed at any retailer accepting coupons. Our coupon codes are discounts generally offered by retailers that consumers can use in connection with an online or mobile purchase. We also offer a breadth of media advertising offerings that leverages our data insights and extensive, highly valued consumer audience across our network. 

Quotient Promotions

We offer digital print and digital paperless promotions through our Quotient Promotions Network (also known as our Digital Free Standing Insert Network) . With digital print, shoppers select coupons and print them from their desktop or mobile device to redeem in store. With digital paperless, shoppers save coupons directly to retailer loyalty accounts for automatic digital redemption, or by redeeming coupons using a mobile device for cash back after taking a picture of a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase. 

Through our platform, CPGs and retailers are able to reach shoppers on the web and on mobile devices by offering digital coupons through our extensive network which includes:

&#160;

&#9679; 

the Coupons.com website and our Coupons.com, Grocery iQ and Shopmium a receipt-scanning, cash-back mobile application platform; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

CPG and retailer websites and mobile applications, either hosted by us or hosted by them using our APIs; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

the websites and mobile applications of over 30,000 registered partner sites included in our publisher network. 

We have designed and engineered o ur platform to support personalization, targeting and optimization in the delivery of digital coupons. We start with demographic and geography based personalization techniques to ensure that consumers see and can easily access the most relevant content. We personalize content based on which offers the consumer has clicked on and what searches the consumer may conduct on our network as well as the coupons that the consumer previously activated, and redeemed. We also offer targeted promotions based on the cri teria listed above, combined with data from our Retailer iQ integrations with retailers. We offer, through our new Shopmium a receipt-scanning, cash-back mobile application platform , coupons for direct cash back upon taking a picture of a retailer receipt with the appropriate purchase. 

Retailer iQ. Retailer iQ allows retailers to integrate our digital promotions with their loyalty programs and point of sale systems. Retailer iQ provides a unique consumer experience using personalized and targeted offers to help retailers and brands drive loyalty and engagement with their shoppers. By integrating with the retailer point-of-sale system, our solution leverages data available across various touchpoints including web, mobile and customer channels such as email, and point of sale purchase data. Using data, the platform provides real-time recommendations of digital coupons and products, real-time reporting, targeting and analytics, targeted media, and digital receipts, all of which help retailers and brands communicate with and influence their shoppers, primarily through their mobile phones.

Mobile . Our promotions and media solutions are designed for mobile channels to further drive consumer adoption and engagement across our platform. Retailer iQ, for instance, powers retailer mobile applications and websites to enable consumers to download coupons, create shopping lists, and search for offers while on the go. CPGs can target Retailer iQ consumers to personalize brand engagement or provide brand information. In addition, our Grocery iQ mobile application is a leading grocery shopping list application that automatically finds relevant coupon offers for consumers based on their grocery lists. Our Coupons.com mobile application allows consumers to access our digital coupons and coupon codes, and is designed to provide personalized and location-based content. Our Shopmium receipt-scanning, cash-back mobile application platform allows consumers to use a CPG promotion by taking a picture of a receipt and uploading it to Quotient, where we validate the purchase against the promotion, and pay the consumer directly to a bank or PayPal account. 

Quotient Media 

We offer media and advertising solutions that provide CPGs, retailers and other advertisers access to our audience. Brands buy media with us to reach shoppers before, during and after their shopping cycles. Furthermore, we allow CPGs and retailers to augment their digital promotion campaigns, and take advantage of special promotional opportunities to highlight their brands including special media and advertising placements on the site, promoted positions within our coupon galleries and premium placement in our marketing efforts.

We use shopper data and insights flowing through our platform to understand consumer intent and shopping behavior and intent, and use those insights for targeted advertising. Our data processing systems are able to provide consumer intent signals to various advertising networks to extend our reach, which effectively increases advertising sales. Our media solutions can reach shoppers throughout our network, including Retailer iQ, and across web, mobile and social channels. For example, we can target consumers on Facebook who have used a particular category of coupon with advertising for that category of product. The quality and real-time nature of our data network enables us to offer relevant and targeted media campaigns. As our platform, network and audience expands, the value of our data and analytics increases.

Publishing Channels

Our platform includes numerous tools we and our CPGs, retailers and publishers use to enhance the effectiveness of their promotions and ability to monetize the use of our platform.

Brandcaster. Our Brandcaster technology powers our affiliate program by enabling third-party publishers to easily display our promotions and media to visitors on their sites. Brandcaster&#8217;s easy-to-use self-service platform allows publishers to produce a look and feel customized to their brand and earn revenues for the coupons that are activated on their site and for media impressions. 

CLIP . Our Content Layout and Integration Platform, or CLIP, is a set of proprietary web services designed for publishers who want greater control and flexibility managing the presentation and application flow of coupons and content in their own website environment. CLIP provides more customization options than our Brandcaster program, and is designed to provide greater flexibility in developing rich and seamless user experiences that meet the growing needs of publisher web sites. We generally provide additional consulting and implementation services for publishers who use CLIP. 

Emails . We send emails to consumers, including registered users on our Coupons.com site and those of our Retailer iQ retailers, including coupon offers that can be customized based upon the user&#8217;s interaction with our site. 

Social . We enable CPGs to distribute coupons on their Facebook pages in a seamless and fully customizable solution through an API on our platform. They then can manage the look and feel of the experience for consumers. Typically, CPGs will use coupons as an incentive for consumers to &#8220;like&#8221; their Facebook pages and brands and our application handles the process and tracking. 

Bricks. Our Bricks services include coupons that operate just like the digital coupons that we distribute on Coupons.com and across the Quotient Promotions Network, but the CPG is responsible for setting up and driving distribution. For example, our Bricks service may enable a CPG to make available a specific coupon on their website. CPGs are able to leverage our technology to facilitate the printing and tracking of coupons in a secure manner, but the CPG distributes the coupon through its own distribution process such as an email campaign or as part of a special promotion on their site. 

Security 

Our platform includes a proprietary digital distribution management system to enable CPGs and retailers to securely control the number of coupons distributed by device. We have controls in place to limit the number of digital coupons that can be printed. Similar controls are in place for downloading coupons to loyalty cards and other paperless solutions, which allows us to limit the number of coupons distributed and activated. In addition, each printed coupon carries a unique ID that is encrypted, enabling us to trace each coupon from print to redemption. All of our digital print coupons can be authenticated and validated using this unique code. This unique ID also can be used to detect counterfeit or altered coupons. Our platform allows us to systematically identify and respond to fraudulent and prohibited activities by restricting a device from printing coupons. 

Sales and Marketing 

We have a team of dedicated, skilled specialists focused on CPGs and retailers. Based on our 17 years of execution for some of the world&#8217;s largest CPGs and retailers, we believe that our sales, integration, promotions management and customer support capabilities are difficult to replicate and a key reason for the growth of our business. Much of our sales activity is focused on expanding the number of brands within our existing CPG customers that offer digital promotions and media through our platform as well as expanding the volume of offers made by the brands currently using our platform. In addition to seeking new CPG and retailer customers, we are focused on continuing to increase the size and breadth of our publisher network. We are also seeking to partner with CPGs and other manufacturers and retailers in new industry segments such as convenience and specialty/franchise retail, restaurants and entertainment venues.

In addition to sales support during the campaign planning process, our sales representatives provide additional support to CPGs and retailers to ensure that their campaigns are launched and delivered within specified timeframes. Representatives assigned to specific customers review performance metrics and share feedback with the advertiser.

We are focused on managing our brand, increasing market awareness and generating new advertiser leads. In doing so, we often present at industry conferences, create custom events and invest in public relations. In addition, our marketing team advertises online, in print and in other forms of media, creates case studies, sponsors research, publishes marketing collateral and undertakes customer research studies.

Technology and Infrastructure 

Since inception, we have made significant investments and will continue to invest in developing our differentiated and proprietary solution, aimed at solving the problems of CPGs and retailers in ways that traditional solutions cannot. We are focused on offering a solution that provides measurable results. We have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers and computer scientists with deep expertise across a broad range of relevant disciplines. Key focus areas of our engineering team include : 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Scalable infrastructure . We use a combination of proprietary and open-source software to achieve a horizontally scalable, global, distributed and fault-tolerant architecture, with the goal of enabling us to ensure the continuity of our business, regardless of local disruptions. Our computational infrastructure currently processes millions of events per day and is designed in a way that enables us to add significant capacity to our platform as we scale our business without requiring any material design or architecture modifications. Our 

&#160;

private cloud technology infrastructure is hosted across four data centers in co-location facilities in California, Nevada, and Virginia. Two data centers support ou r current platform and two data centers support Retailer iQ. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Redundancy . Our production infrastructure utilizes a hot failover configuration which allows us to switch server loads, be it a single server or an entire data center, to the other data center within minutes. Data is continuously replicated between sites, and multiple copies at each site provide fast recovery whenever it is requested. Each data center has been designed to handle more than our entire server needs, which enables us to perform platform maintenance, business resumption and disaster recovery without any customer impact. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Reporting . Our user interface provides flexible reporting and interactive visualization of the key drivers of success for each media campaign. We use these reporting and visualization products internally to manage campaigns and provide advertisers with campaign insights. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Security . Our security policy adheres to established policies to ensure that all data, code, and production infrastructure are secure and protected. Our data centers are SSAE 16 Type II certified and we are PCI DSS compliant where required. We use our internal team and third parties to test, audit, and review our entire production environment to protect it. 

Our research and development expenses were $48.4 million, $49.6 million and $40.1 million during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We capitalized internal-use software development costs of $1.5 million, $3.6 million and $6.9 million during 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively . 

Competition 

We compete against a variety of different businesses with respect to different aspects of our business, including : 

&#160;

&#9679; 

traditional offline coupon and discount services, as well as newspapers, magazines and other traditional media companies that provide coupon promotions and discounts on products and services in free standing inserts or other forms, including Valassis Communications, Inc., News America Marketing Interactive, Inc. and Catalina Marketing Corporation; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

providers of digital coupons such as Valassis&#8217; Redplum.com, Catalina Marketing Corporation&#8217;s Cellfire, News America Marketing&#8217;s SmartSource, and companies that offer coupon codes such as RetailMeNot, Inc., Groupon Inc., Exponential Interactive Inc.&#8217;s TechBargains, Savings.com, Inc. and Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc., companies that offer cash back solutions such as iBotta, Inc., and companies providing other e-commerce based services that allow consumers to obtain direct or indirect discounts on purchases; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

internet sites that are focused on specific communities or interests that offer coupons or discount arrangements related to such communities or interests; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

companies offering online and marketing services to retailers and CPGs, such as MyWebGrocer, Inc. and Flipp Corporation; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

companies offering media services, such as Triad Media Inc. and RichRelevance, Inc.; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

retailers marketing and offering their own digital coupons directly to consumers using their own websites, email newsletters and alerts, mobile applications and social media channels. 

We believe the principal factors that generally determine a company&#8217;s competitive advantage in our market include the following: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

scale and effectiveness of reach in connecting CPGs and retailers to consumers in a digital manner, through web, mobile and other online properties; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

ability to attract consumers to use digital coupons; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

platform security, scalability, reliability and availability; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

number of channels by which a company engages with consumers; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

integration of products and solutions; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

rapid deployment of products and services for customers; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

breadth, quality and relevance of the company&#8217;s digital coupons; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

ability to deliver digital coupons that are widely available and easy to use in consumers&#8217; preferred form; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

integration with retailer applications; 

&#160;

&#9679; 

brand recognition; 

&#160;

&#9679;

quality of tools, reporting and analytics for planning, development and optimization of promotions; and 

&#160;

&#9679; 

breadth and expertise of the company&#8217;s sales organization. 

While we believe we compete effectively with respect to the factors identified above, we may face increasing competition from larger or more established companies that seek to enter our market or from smaller companies that launch new products and services that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance. 

Culture and Employees 

We are proud of our company culture and consider it to be one of our competitive strengths. Our culture helps drive our business and compete for talented employees in a highly competitive market. We seek to offer an environment that allows our employees to thrive and grow. We are proud to have been named one of the Top Work Places in the Bay Area for 2012, 2013 and 2014 by the Bay Area News Group.

As of December 31, 2015, we had 618 full-time employees, consisting of 533 employees in the United States and 85 employees internationally. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.

In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we hold or have exclusive rights to 23 issued patents in the United States and 10 patents that have been issued outside of the United States with terms expiring between 2016 and 2031. Additionally, we have 46 patent applications pending in the United States and as well as additional patent applications pending in Europe and other international jurisdictions.

Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time- consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.

Companies in Internet-related industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have been subject to in the past, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
