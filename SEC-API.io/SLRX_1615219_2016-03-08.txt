 Item 1. BUSINESS 

Overview 

We are a biotechnology company that is developing innovative and proprietary treatments for nocturnal leg cramps, muscle cramps and spasms associated with severe neuromuscular conditions, and exercise-associated muscle cramps. Our product candidates are based on the potential mechanism of action we describe as Chemical Neuro Stimulation, which is the process by which a small molecule chemical signal, acting topically, induces a neuronal sensory signal that produces a beneficial effect. Our product candidates activate certain receptors in primary sensory neurons, which then act via neuronal circuits to reduce the repetitive firing, or hyperexcitability, of alpha-motor neurons in the spinal cord, thereby preventing or reducing the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps and spasms. We believe that we are the only company developing both drug and consumer products based on this mechanism of muscle cramp inhibition. 

Muscle cramps and spasms are involuntary, often painful contractions producing tightness in muscles that can last several minutes and, in many instances, result in prolonged soreness. We believe that muscle cramps and spasms are driven by the hyperexcitability of alpha-motor neurons. Based on our scientific co-founders' novel insight regarding neuromuscular physiology, we developed an extract formulation that has shown statistical significance in reducing muscle cramps in our electrically induced cramp model as compared to a control. The extract formulation, and the product candidates we developed based on this extract formulation, activate the specific transient receptor potential, or TRP, ion channel receptors found on the surface of the mouth, esophagus and/or stomach, which trigger signals in sensory neurons that are relayed to the spinal cord. This sensory signaling is thought to increase the activity of inhibitory spinal interneurons, which reduce alpha-motor neuron hyperexcitability, thereby preventing muscle cramps and spasms. 

Based on independent third-party survey results, we estimate that approximately four million U.S. adults over the age of 65 suffer from nocturnal leg cramps on a daily basis. There is no drug product currently approved in the United States for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps. In February 2016, our extract formulation demonstrated efficacy in a randomized, controlled, blinded study of 50 healthy subjects who experienced nocturnal leg cramps at least three nights per week. In our nocturnal leg cramps study, statistically significant effects were demonstrated on key endpoints, including cramp frequency (p&#60;0.05); cramp-free days (p&#60;0.01), the physician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (p&#60;0.01), cramp pain measures (p&#60;0.05), and specific sleep disturbance measures (p&#60;0.05). We plan to initiate another nocturnal leg cramp study in 2016 with a single molecule, chemically synthesized, TRP ion channel activator. 

In 2016, we also expect to initiate two studies of our lead drug product candidate, FLX-787, in patients suffering from cramps, spasms and spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, or MS, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. FLX-787 was developed based on our extract formulation and is a single molecule, chemically synthesized, TRP ion channel activator that has demonstrated statistically significant efficacy in our electrically induced cramp model. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, between 250,000 and 350,000 people in the United States suffer from multiple sclerosis, or MS, approximately 84% of whom experience spasticity. Based on a report published by the Centers for Disease Control, we estimate that over 12,000 people in the United States suffer from ALS. Our randomized, blinded, controlled cross-over studies of MS and ALS patients will be conducted outside the United States. 

In the second quarter of 2016, we expect to launch a consumer brand and cornerstone product to prevent and treat exercise-associated muscle cramps, or EAMCs. We developed a consumer product based on our extract formulation that will be marketed primarily to endurance athletes experiencing EAMCs. Our consumer product will be a 50 milliliter beverage containing a proprietary formulation of organic TRP activators. We expect to launch our consumer brand and first consumer product in three select markets, Los Angeles, California, Boulder, Colorado and Boston, Massachusetts, and also expect a significant online presence. We have conducted pre-launch activities in each of these locations, which have included, among other things, attending athletic events, providing product 

samples, gathering feedback, educating potential consumers of our product and launching a print and digital media campaign.

Our Strategy 

Our strategy is to become a leading biotechnology company focused on treating nocturnal leg cramps, muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity associated with severe neuromuscular conditions and EAMCs. We are developing products using TRP activators, leveraging our experienced management team and our relationships with top scientific advisors to expedite our drug and consumer product development efforts. The key elements of our strategy are as follows: 

&#8226; 

Rapidly develop and advance product candidates for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps. We believe the nocturnal leg cramp market represents a significant opportunity that historically has been underserved. There is no drug currently approved in the United States for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps. Given the regulatory status of nocturnal leg cramps, we believe there may be an opportunity to develop both a drug product and a consumer product to address this attractive market. Our extract formulation demonstrated statistically significant efficacy in treating nocturnal leg cramps in a randomized, controlled, blinded study and, in 2016, we expect to initiate another nocturnal leg cramp study with a single molecule, chemically synthesized, TRP ion channel activator. 

&#8226; 

Develop and advance FLX-787 for the treatment of severe neuromuscular conditions of significant unmet need. &#32;We believe FLX-787 may relieve spasticity and abnormal muscle contractions affecting individuals suffering from severe neuromuscular conditions, including MS and ALS. In 2016, we expect to initiate randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over studies of FLX-787 in patients suffering from cramps, spasms and/or spasticity associated with MS and ALS outside the United States. We also intend to explore additional indications where Chemical Neuro Stimulation may be an effective treatment of these symptoms. 

&#8226; 

Develop and launch our consumer brand and products for the prevention of exercise associated muscle cramps. &#32;We are developing a consumer brand and products specifically formulated to treat athletes suffering from EAMCs. In the second quarter of 2016, we expect to begin selling the cornerstone product of our consumer brand. As our brand and target market evolves, we anticipate evaluating product line extension opportunities based on a variety of factors, including market opportunity, brand positioning, target audience and product formulation alternatives. In the future, we may consider partnering with established consumer brand companies to accelerate market acceptance and expand distribution of our consumer products. 

&#8226; 

Collaborate selectively to augment and accelerate our research, development and commercialization efforts. We may seek third-party collaborators for the development and eventual commercialization of any drug product candidate we develop. In particular, we may enter into third-party arrangements for targeted neuromuscular indications in which our potential collaborator has particular expertise or for which we need access to additional markets and research, development or commercialization resources. 

&#8226; 

Pursue the acquisition or in-licensing of product candidates. &#32;We may enhance our product pipeline through strategically acquiring or in-licensing pre-clinical or clinical stage product candidates. We 

believe that our management team and scientific advisory board's expertise in neuronal circuits experience may make us an attractive partner for companies seeking to out-license products or develop product candidates in this area of focus. 

Market Opportunity 

We are developing products for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps, muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity associated with severe neuromuscular conditions, and other conditions where patients and athletes experience abnormal muscle contractions. Muscle cramps and spasms are involuntary, often painful contractions producing tightness in muscles that can last several minutes and, in many instances, result in prolonged soreness. Spasticity, which is frequently experienced by patients with severe neurological conditions, such as MS and ALS, is an abnormal, involuntary increase in the underlying tone of muscles and may be associated with uncontrolled movement, muscle stiffness, difficulty straightening joints, reduced mobility, limb weakness, shaking, intermittent spasms and pain. The treatment of muscle cramps remains challenging because we do not believe there is any product that has been rigorously proven to be effective in treating muscle cramps. The medications used to treat cramps, spasms and spasticity vary in their effectiveness and many patients cannot tolerate the side effects of these drugs. We believe there is a large and underserved market for effective treatment of muscle cramps, spasms and spasticity as a result of the limitations of the current standard of care. 

Nocturnal Leg Cramps 

Background. &#32;Nocturnal leg cramps are muscle cramps, usually occurring in the calf during sleep, that cause pain, stress, disability and poor sleep quality in affected individuals resulting in reduced quality of life and interference with activities of daily living. The causes of nocturnal leg cramps remain unknown but in some individuals may be related to various factors such as inactivity, overexertion, peripheral artery disease, metabolic problems, certain medications and spinal stenosis. The prevalence of nocturnal leg cramps is widespread and increases with age. According to a survey of 233 individuals, 37% of adults over the age of 50 suffered from nocturnal leg cramps. Based on a separate survey of 365 individuals, 50% of adults over the age of 65 suffered from nocturnal leg cramps. We believe our primary target patient population will include individuals that suffer from nocturnal leg cramps daily or weekly and, based on independent third-party survey results, estimate that approximately four million U.S. adults over the age of 65 suffer from nocturnal leg cramps on a daily basis. Nocturnal leg cramps also affect people younger than 65 and we believe there is an opportunity to serve this patient population as well. In the United Kingdom, quinine is prescribed for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps, in addition to being a treatment for malaria. In 2013, approximately 4.5 million quinine prescriptions were written for patients in the United Kingdom, a country with approximately one-fifth the population of the United States. We believe a majority of these prescriptions were for the treatment of individuals suffering from nocturnal leg cramps. 

Limitations of Current Treatment. We do not believe any therapy has been shown to be safe and effective in treating nocturnal leg cramps in well-designed, blinded clinical trials. Stretching and systemic treatments, such as dietary supplements, vasodilators and calcium channel blockers, have shown some benefit in treating nocturnal leg cramps, but we do not believe any medication has shown durable evidence of clinical efficacy. Quinine is prescribed in the United Kingdom for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps. However, quinine is associated with serious and life-threatening adverse events, including thrombocytopenia, hypersensitivity reactions and QT prolongation. In 1994, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, banned the use of over-the-counter quinine for the treatment of leg cramps and expanded this restriction for prescription quinine products in 2006. 

Cramping and Spasticity Associated with Multiple Sclerosis 

Background. MS is an autoimmune disease in which inflammatory processes cause worsening demyelination and cell degeneration over years, resulting in a variety of neurological deficits such as loss of muscle control, sensation and vision. Spasticity is caused by damage to motor systems in the brain and spinal cord. These lesions cause hyperactive muscle stretch reflexes, which result in increased muscle tone and associated symptoms such as myoclonus which are subsumed under the descriptive term spasticity. The need to treat spasticity increases as the disease progresses and go hand in hand with worsening weakness leading to complications such as contractures, bed sores and severe pain. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, between 250,000 and 350,000 people in the United States suffer from MS and approximately 84% of patients with MS experience spasticity. 

Limitations of Current Treatment. Patients suffering from MS spasticity may be treated with antispasticity drugs, muscle relaxants, sedatives and Botox injections, which frequently result in unwanted side effects, including 

dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, fatigue, weakness, diarrhea or constipation and low blood pressure. Further, patient responses to single or combination agents vary and treatments may be incomplete in managing spasticity. 

Cramping, Spasms and Spasticity Associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 

Background. &#32;ALS is a neurological disease that causes muscle weakness and impacts physical function. In most patients, doctors don't know why ALS occurs, which is referred to as sporadic cases. A small number of familial cases are known to occur. ALS often begins with muscle twitching and weakness in an arm or leg, or sometimes with slurring of speech. Eventually, ALS can affect the ability to control the muscles needed to move, speak, eat and breathe. ALS patients commonly experience fasciculations, which are persistent muscle twitches that can interfere with sleep and most patients with ALS may also experience painful muscle cramps, which can sometimes be alleviated with medication. Based on a report published by the Centers for Disease Control, we estimate that over 12,000 people in the United States suffer from ALS. 

Limitations of Current Treatment. The October 2009 American Academy of Neurology ALS Care Guidelines found insufficient data to support or refute any specific interventions for the treatment of muscle cramps, twitches and spasticity in ALS patients. The guidelines did note that in diseases such as MS, effective treatments for similar problems include benzodiazepam, baclofen, dantrolene and tizanidine. 

Other Potential Indications 

We may also pursue the use of our drug product candidates in several other conditions where muscle cramps, spasms or abnormal muscle contractions afflict patients, including spasms due to brain injury such as in stroke or cerebral palsy or trauma, cervical dystonia, spasticity as a result of spinal cord injury, focal dystonias (e.g. blepharospasm), peripheral neuropathy (e.g. diabetic), fibromyalgia, Machado-Joseph disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia, cramp fasciculation syndrome, cramps due to dialysis, spasmodic dysphonia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, piriformis syndrome, lower lumbar radiculopathy and neuromyotonias (focal). 

Exercise-Associated Muscle Cramps 

Background. EAMCs are painful, involuntary contractions of a skeletal muscle that occur during or following exercise in individuals and result in acute pain, stiffness, bulging or knotting of the muscle and soreness that can last for several days. EAMCs can be experienced by individuals participating in any sport, but EAMCs are particularly prevalent in athletes engaged in high-intensity activities, such as triathlons, marathons and cycling events. Our cornerstone consumer product will be directed towards endurance athletes participating in these types of high-intensity sports. 

Limitations of Current Products. There are a number of well-known sports drinks and other consumer products that are intended to treat electrolyte abnormalities and dehydration. However, we do not believe clinical studies have proven that these factors, in isolation, cause EAMCs. Scientists recently began hypothesizing that altered neuromuscular control, as a result of muscle fatigue, causes EAMCs. Our cornerstone product will include TRP activators that reduce alpha-motor neuron hyperexcitability caused by muscle fatigue, thereby preventing muscle cramps. We believe endurance athletes participating in high-intensity sports want a product that has been shown to be clinically effective in treating muscle cramps. 

Our Scientific Approach 

Recent research has shown that muscle cramping is caused by the uncontrolled and repetitive firing of alpha-motor neurons in the spinal cord, resulting in maintained contraction of the muscle. We believe that by reducing this firing of the alpha-motor neurons that control muscle contraction, muscle cramping can be reduced or prevented. 

Motor neurons respond to inputs from complex circuits in the spinal cord that both (A) reduce neuronal and muscle activity, known as &#8220;inhibitory&#8221; input, and (B) increase neuronal and muscle activity, known as "excitatory" input. Our approach exploits a general principle of neural circuits: that strong excitatory input from one source in the body enhances overall inhibitory tone in the spinal cord and thereby reduces neuronal response to other excitation throughout the body. 

The activation of ion channels forms the basis of our scientific approach and our scientific co-founder, Roderick MacKinnon, M.D., is a leader in this field. Dr. MacKinnon was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2003 for his work determining the structure of ion channels and showing the mechanism by which they select for particular ions (Doyle, et al., The Structure of the Potassium Channel: Molecular Basis of K+ Conduction and Selectivity, April 1998, Science). The TRP vanilloid-1, or TRPV1, receptor is important in diverse physiological functions and the 

TRPV1 ion channel acts as a receptor that reacts to multiple sensory inputs. TRPV1 is activated by heat, low pH and a variety of molecules. 

The TRP subfamily A, member 1, or TRPA1, ion channel is a channel in the cell membrane that can be activated by a wide variety of stimuli, including cold temperature and a variety of pungent natural chemical agents. TRPA1 ion channels are expressed mainly in primary sensory neurons associated with slow-conducting C-fibers and carry signals directly to the spinal cord. 

We refer to the mechanism of action of our product candidates as Chemical Neuro Stimulation, which is the process by which a small molecule chemical signal, acting topically, induces a neuronal sensory signal that produces a beneficial effect. Our extract formulation, consumer product and drug product candidates stimulate primary sensory neurons in the mouth, esophagus and/or stomach by activating TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion channels. These sensory neurons project both directly and indirectly to the spinal cord, and we believe that their activation enhances the overall inhibitory tone in spinal cord circuits, which reduces repetitive firing of the alpha-motor neurons throughout the body and thereby prevents or reduces the frequency and intensity of muscle cramps and spasms. Muscle contractions associated with spasms and spasticity are also believed to result from abnormal repetitive firing of alpha-motor neurons. 

We believe that the effects of the TRP activators in our extract formulation and product candidates directly interact with TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channels in a topical and local fashion and trigger strong, centrally-acting excitatory signals from peripheral sensory neurons in the mucus membranes of the mouth, throat, esophagus and stomach, with minimal or no TRP channel activators reaching the bloodstream and, consequently, fewer potential systemic side-effects. This mechanism and the limited systemic exposure may also limit drug-drug interactions. 

Our extract formulation and consumer product contains three active ingredients that the FDA has deemed to be generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, when used in ingested food. Following the positive results of our extract formulation in our electrically induced cramp model, we analyzed the extract formulation and identified two compounds, FLX-787 and FLX-788, as the likely active components of the extract formulation, both of which activate the TRPV1 and TRPA1 ion channels. We then tested the safety and efficacy of FLX-787 and FLX-788 using our electrically induced cramp model. 

Completed Clinical Studies 

Results from our Nocturnal Leg Cramps Study 

In February 2016, we announced the results of a human efficacy study of our extract formulation for individuals with nocturnal leg cramps. In this randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over design study, we compared our extract formulation to a control in 50 individuals, 50-77 years of age, suffering from nocturnal leg cramps. To be included in the study, each subject reported having nocturnal leg cramps at least three nights per week in each of the four weeks prior to screening. Each individual in our nocturnal leg cramps study was tested over a six-week period. The first two weeks of the study were a run-in period where the subjects received a placebo to help reduce potential placebo effects. Only subjects that did not respond to placebo, as determined by a physician's assessment, continued in the study. Following this run-in period, subjects were randomly assigned to a two-week treatment period and a two-week placebo period. In the two-week treatment period, subjects self-administered 50 milliliters of our extract formulation each day and, in the two-week vehicle control period, subjects self-administered 50 milliliters of a vehicle control without active ingredients each day. Subjects &#8220;crossed-over&#8221; between treatment and vehicle control, and in this way, each subject served as his or her own control. 

Statistically significant effects were demonstrated on key endpoints in the study, including cramp frequency (p&#60;0.05), cramp-free days (p&#60;0.01), the physician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change (p&#60;0.01), cramp pain measures (p&#60;0.05), and specific sleep disturbance measures (p&#60;0.05). Additionally, the product appeared to be safe and well-tolerated and there were no serious adverse events reported. 

Clinical Studies of Electrically-Induced Cramps 

In 2014, we studied our extract formulation in a total of 37 healthy normal volunteers using our electrically induced cramp model in three randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over studies, which we refer to as Flex-001, Flex-002 and Flex-003. In each study, our extract formulation showed statistical significance in reducing muscle cramps as compared to vehicle control, with good safety and tolerability. In 2015, we tested FLX-787, FLX-788, FLX-797 and FLX-798 in nine healthy volunteers using our electrically induced cramp model and each showed statistical significance in reducing muscle cramps, with good safety and tolerability. FLX-787 and FLX-788 &#32; are 

single molecule, chemically synthesized, TRP ion channel activators, and FLX-797 and FLX-798 are combinations of chemically synthesized, TRP ion channel activators. These results, and the results from our nocturnal leg cramps study and consumer product testing, support our belief that products based on Chemical Neuro Stimulation may prove helpful to those suffering from nocturnal leg cramps, EAMCs, and cramps and spasms associated with severe neuromuscular disorders. 

Testing Procedures. &#32;In each study using our electrically induced cramp model, we induced muscle cramping in the flexor hallucis brevis muscle, a small muscle on the bottom of the hallux (big toe), using electrical stimulation. We then measured the duration and intensity of the subject's cramp using electromyography, or EMG. EMG is a technique used for evaluating and recording the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles and produces a record called an electromyogram. During our clinical studies, a stimulating electrode was placed on the sole of the foot over the abductor hallucis muscle and recording sensors were attached to the flexor hallucis brevis muscle (see Figure 1). The subject's abductor hallucis muscle and medial plantar nerve were stimulated, which induced a muscle cramp. We then measured muscle cramp intensity and duration using EMG recording sensors. 

Figure 1 

To measure a subject's muscle cramp, we calculated the area under the curve, or AUC, produced by the electromyogram as depicted in Figure 2. Muscle cramp intensity and duration vary by subject, so each study began by inducing a cramp in each subject in order to create a &#8220;baseline AUC.&#8221; This baseline AUC was later compared to the AUC after the subject received either the study article or a vehicle control without active ingredients. The time at which the subject received the study article or vehicle control is referred to as timepoint zero. We then attempted to induce muscle cramps using electrical stimulation at various times following timepoint zero. At each timepoint, we measured the subject's cramp intensity and duration using the EMG recording sensors and then compared each AUC against the baseline AUC. We believe that if a subject's AUC at the subsequent timepoints was smaller than the subject's baseline AUC, then the study article successfully prevented or reduced the intensity of the subject's muscle cramp. 

Figure 2 

Each of these studies was conducted in the United States at a third party clinical research organization specializing in early clinical research services and under the oversight of an institutional review board, or IRB. The studies were conducted under the FDA's dietary supplement regulatory framework. Participants were recruited by the clinical research organization and included healthy, adult males or females, 19-65 years of age, without any clinically significant medical history, physical examination findings or laboratory profiles. In each study, the subjects were pre-screened for overall general health based on the study protocol's inclusion and exclusion criteria. To be included in the study, each subject must have had a toe cramp successfully induced. In each of our studies, subjects &#8220;crossed-over&#8221; from the subject article to the vehicle control between testing days, or vice versa. As a result, each subject received both the study article or vehicle control depending on the testing day and in this way, each subject served as his or her own control. 

Results of Electrically Induced Muscle Cramps Studies. &#32;In each study, our extract formulation and product candidates demonstrated statistical significance in reducing muscle cramps. No participants in the studies reported any serious adverse events and the product candidates were well tolerated. Further, when the data from Flex-001, Flex-002 and Flex-003 are aggregated, our extract formulation showed a statistically significant overall treatment effect in 37 normal healthy volunteers (ANOVA, p&#60;0.0001). In smaller clinical studies, such as Flex-001, Flex-002 and Flex-003 and the studies of the chemically-synthesized agents, statistical significance is often difficult to achieve because, in general, a large effect in the subjects is required. We believe the level of significance achieved in our studies supports our contention that these study articles reduce the intensity of muscle cramps. However, the results of studies with smaller sample sizes can be disproportionately influenced by the impact the treatment had on a few individuals, which limits the ability to generalize the results across a broader community, thus making the study results less reliable than studies with a larger number of subjects. As a result, there may be less certainty that our extract formulation or product candidates would achieve a statistically significant effect in any future clinical studies. 

Figure 3 below depicts the reduction in subjects' muscle cramps at various timepoints following administration of our extract formulation or vehicle control in Flex-001, Flex-002 and Flex-003 combined. Figure 4 below depicts the aggregate reduction in subjects' muscle cramps across all timepoints when data from these studies are combined. The aggregate data reflected in Figures 3 and 4 do not include data at the four hour timepoint for Flex-001 and at the six and eight hour timepoints for Flex-003 because, under the study protocols, data was not collected from subjects at these timepoints.

FLX-787, FLX-788, FLX-797 and FLX-798 were each tested in nine healthy volunteers using our electrically induced cramp model and were observed to decrease cramp intensity (see Figure 5 below). Using a generalized linear mixed model (Tukey-Kramer post-hoc), FLX-787, FLX-788, FLX-797 and FLX-798 treatment arms significantly reduced cramp intensity relative to control (p&#60;0.01), with both FLX-787 and FLX-788 providing a significant improvement in efficacy compared to the extract formulation. On the basis of these results and other considerations, we selected FLX-787 as our clinical candidate for studies outside the United States in patients suffering from MS and ALS. 

Figure 5 

Previous studies have shown a correlation between electrically induced cramping and individual susceptibility to naturally occurring cramping. As a result, we believe that the use of our electrically induced muscle cramping technique is an effective tool for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of naturally occurring muscle cramping. 

Future Clinical Development 

Our founders' novel insights regarding neuromuscular physiology, and the extract formulation we developed based on these insights, form the basis of our clinical development efforts. To date, we have developed our extract formulation as a dietary supplement for the treatment and prevention of muscle cramps. By developing our extract formulation as a dietary supplement, we were able to conduct our clinical studies without filing an investigational new drug application, or IND, with the FDA. Under this same regulatory framework, we conducted studies to identify single molecule, selective and specific TRPA1 and TRPV1 activators in our extract formulation, including FLX-787 and FLX-788, that were efficacious in reducing cramps in our electrically-induced cramp model. We now intend to study single molecule, chemically synthesized, TRPA1 and TRPV1 ion channel activators in individuals suffering from nocturnal leg cramps and severe neuromuscular conditions, such as MS and ALS. 

The following table summarizes the development path of our products under development. 

Nocturnal Leg Cramps 

In 2016, we expect to conduct an additional study of a chemically-synthesized single molecule in subjects suffering from nocturnal leg cramps. We believe this study may be conducted in the United States under the framework applicable to dietary supplements. Our prior nocturnal leg cramp study was designed, in part, to evaluate a number of different potential efficacy objectives and these results may be used to inform the endpoints in our future studies. We may also study chemically-synthesized single molecules in subjects in sleep laboratories. We will review the results from our nocturnal leg cramp studies, as well as several other factors, when deciding on the future development of our nocturnal leg cramps program. 

The FDA regulates products on the basis of their &#8220;intended use&#8221; rather than their mechanism of action. As a result, certain uses of our extract formulation and product candidates will be regulated as dietary supplements and certain uses will be regulated as drug products. Treatment or prevention of nocturnal leg cramps is a particular indication that the FDA stated qualifies as a dietary supplement structure/function claim or intended use, although nocturnal leg cramps can also be targeted by drug products. Unlike drug products, a dietary supplement of GRAS ingredients for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps may be studied in humans in the United States without submitting an IND application with the FDA. As a result, we have tested our extract formulation as a dietary supplement in our electrically-induced cramp model and in nocturnal leg cramps. Similarly, we have tested the constituent molecules of the extract formulation as a dietary supplement in our electrically-induced cramp model. We do not believe our completed clinical studies or our future studies in nocturnal leg cramps require that we file an IND with the FDA. 

Cramps, Spasms and/or Spasticity Associated with MS and ALS 

In 2016, we expect to initiate two randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over design studies outside the United States of FLX-787 as a treatment of cramps, spasms and/or spasticity associated with the MS and ALS. Both our MS and ALS studies will include male or female subjects with cramps and spasms associated with the disease for at least three months prior to screening that is not completely relieved by current therapy. We expect the first two weeks of each study will be a run-in period where the subjects receive a placebo control without active ingredients to help reduce potential placebo effects. Only subjects who do not respond strongly to placebo, as determined by a score of three to seven on the clinical global impression scale, will continue in the study. Following this run-in period, subjects will be randomly assigned to a two-week treatment period followed by a two-week placebo period, or vice-versa. Subjects will self-administer FLX-787 or placebo twice daily, within an hour of rising in the morning and going to bed at night. Because subjects "cross-over" between treatment and placebo, each subject will act as his or her own control. We expect that up to 50 patients may be enrolled in each study. 

IND Enabling Clinical Studies 

To conduct clinical trials in the United States in patients suffering from cramps, spasms and/or spasticity associated with MS or ALS requires that we file an IND with the FDA. We will also be required to file an IND with the FDA if we elect to develop product candidates to treat and prevent nocturnal leg cramps as drug products. We are currently conducting non-clinical testing, also referred to as pre-clinical testing, in order to prepare an IND. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of a drug candidate. Once we have completed these pre-clinical studies, we will be able to submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. 

Consumer Brand and Products 

Cornerstone Consumer Product and Brand Strategy 

We believe there is a significant opportunity to commercialize an efficacious product for treating and preventing EAMCs under a culturally relevant lifestyle brand. We expect to launch our consumer brand with our cornerstone product in the second quarter of 2016. Our product will be marketed to endurance athletes participating in high endurance sports, such as triathlons, marathons and cycling events. Our brand strategy will highlight the scientific origins and support of our cornerstone product, including studies of athletes using our product, which we believe will resonate with this target audience and drive initial sales. To explain the science behind our consumer product, we expect to highlight the importance of an athlete&#8217;s nerves and muscles working together to prevent and treat muscle cramps, which we refer to as neuromuscular performance, or NMP. 

Our cornerstone consumer product is based on our extract formulation. We have modified the active ingredient amounts and ratios and added emulsifiers and flavoring agents, in order to develop a more appealing consumer product. We have continued testing various formulations of the active ingredients in our consumer product for palatability and to ensure the formulations maintained efficacy in treating and preventing muscle cramps. Our cornerstone product will be a 50 milliliter beverage that athletes can take prior to, during and after exercise to 

prevent and treat muscle cramps. We expect this initial product will include organic ingredients and be priced at a premium to existing sports beverages. As our brand and target markets evolve, we anticipate evaluating product line extension opportunities and believe that the breadth of our consumer products will depend on a variety of factors, including market opportunity, brand positioning, target audience and product formulation alternatives. To broaden the appeal of our consumer business, our ultimate goal is to develop several different products, potentially across different product lines, targeting both endurance and casual athletes. 

Launch and Distribution Strategy 

We expect to focus our initial sales and marketing efforts on a limited number of geographic areas with strong endurance sports markets. To date, we have focused our pre-launch activities on educating our target market on the limitations of existing remedies and the scientific background of muscle cramps. When we launch our consumer product, we will begin highlighting our product&#8217;s efficacy. We intend to build awareness and adoption of our cornerstone product among key opinion leaders and core endurance athletes, who we believe are interested in clinically-proven products. We expect to build awareness and demand among this core group of endurance athletes using a number of different tools, including sponsorship of endurance events, endorsements from endurance athletes and the use of targeted digital, print and social media campaigns. We believe that, over time, these athletes will act as opinion leaders and their endorsement and use will drive future adoption by a broader audience. 

We expect to launch our consumer brand in Los Angeles, California, Boulder, Colorado and Boston, Massachusetts and also anticipate a significant online presence. We expect e-commerce sales to be a portion of our sales and we expect to drive early distribution and adoption through specialty retailers, such as cycling, running and triathlon stores. Over time, we may expand to more mainstream distribution channels such as drugstores, vitamin shops and grocery stores. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, consumer products, technology and know-how, and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. 

Patents and Patent Applications 

Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our current and future drug product candidates and consumer products, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. Our commercial success will depend in part upon whether we are able to obtain and maintain adequate protection against unauthorized third-party use of our products and technologies. In our efforts to do so, however, there are a number of risks we may face, any of which may hinder our ability to successfully market our potential products. For more information regarding risks related to patents and other intellectual property, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property." 

We own one pending U.S. utility patent application and one European patent application directed to compositions, which can be used for preventing, treating or ameliorating muscle cramping. A patent based on these applications, if issued, would have a statutory expiration in the United States in July 2031 and in Europe in July 2031. We also own two PCT and one provisional patent applications. Our PCT and provisional patent applications are directed at various aspects of our work including influencing neuromuscular activity by stimulating a TRP channel or acid sensing ion channel, or ASIC, in the nerve ending of a sensory neuron. 

The PCT and provisional patent applications include methods for preventing and treating various muscle-related conditions and disorders and methods of diagnosing and selecting a patient for treatment. The PCT and provisional patent applications also include various uses of TRP or ASIC activators, formulations, compositions of chemical matter, and enabling technology such as the electrical stimulation technique for inducing muscle cramps. The PCT applications will enter the national phase in October 2016. A patent based on the PCT applications, if issued, would have a statutory expiration in April 2035. A patent based on the provisional application, if issued, would have a statutory expiration in October 2036. While we seek broad coverage for our patents, there is always a risk that an alteration to the formulation of our drug product candidates and consumer products may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims by us. 

Trade Secrets, Trademarks and Proprietary Information 

Our drug product candidates and consumer products have gone through numerous iterations to optimize their effectiveness, thereby creating trade secrets and proprietary know-how. In particular, the formulation of our consumer product will be treated as a trade secret. We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our employees to execute Proprietary Information, Inventions, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition Agreements upon the commencement of their employment. Consultants and other advisors are required to sign consulting agreements. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third-parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, and utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during their employment with us, shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials. 

We have applied, and will continue to apply for trademark protection with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and applicable foreign bodies for our brand. Issuance of a federally registered trademark creates a rebuttable presumption of ownership of the mark, but may be subject to challenge by others claiming first use in the mark in some or all of the areas in which it is used. Federally registered trademarks have a perpetual life, as long as they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used properly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third-parties to seek cancellation of the trademarks if they claim priority or confusion of usage. We believe that trademarks will be an important element of our ability to successfully market our consumer products. 

Manufacturing 

We do not currently have our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to continue to use our financial resources to focus on commercializing our consumer product and drug product candidates, and we do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. We intend to meet our pre-clinical and clinical trial manufacturing requirements by establishing relationships with third-party manufacturers and other service providers to perform these services for us. 

We will continue using third-party manufacturers and other service providers to meet the manufacturing needs of our consumer products. We do not have any long-term agreements or commitments for these manufacturing services or long-term agreements or commitments from any of our suppliers. In connection with the launch of our consumer brand, we are negotiating supply and manufacturing agreements to ensure the availability of the material ingredients in our consumer products and the manufacturing services required to produce our consumer products. However, there is no guarantee we will be able to successfully negotiate these agreements or that the terms of any agreement will be favorable to us. 

Sales and Marketing 

We currently have limited marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize any drug product candidate that is approved for commercial sale, we must either develop a sales and marketing infrastructure or collaborate with third-parties that have sales and marketing experience. In connection with the launch of our first consumer product, we are establishing our marketing, sales and distribution capabilities, including resources in target markets and the development of an ecommerce website. 

Drug Products 

We may elect to establish our own sales force to market and sell a drug product candidate for which we obtain regulatory approval. If the geographic market for the product is limited or the prescriptions for the product will be written principally by a relatively small number of physicians, we may elect to market and sell the products ourselves. We do not expect to establish direct sales capabilities until shortly before the products are approved for commercial sale. 

We may also seek third-party support from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for those products that would benefit from the promotional support of a large sales and marketing force. In these cases, we might seek to promote our products in collaboration with marketing partners or rely on relationships with one or more companies with large established sales forces and distribution systems. 

Consumer Brand and Products 

We expect to launch our consumer brand with our cornerstone product in the second quarter of 2016. In 2015, we began pre-launch marketing activities to educate and begin building demand for our cornerstone product among our targeted demographic. These sales and marketing efforts have included brand strategy and development, product development, target market research, limited production, product trial and a print and digital media campaign. As we launch our first consumer product, our marketing efforts will focus on building brand awareness of our cornerstone product among key opinion leaders and core endurance athletes. To drive product trial, we expect to use a variety of sales and marketing strategies, including sponsorships of endurance events, endorsements from endurance athletes, public relations campaigns, product sampling and promotional activities at events such as marathons, triathlons, cycling events and obstacle course races. We anticipate leveraging early adopters to drive product and messaging advocacy and using targeted digital and social media campaigns to initiate and expand product sales. 

We anticipate using e-commerce strategies to sell online through our direct-to-consumer website. We may develop relationships to expand product awareness and encourage product trial. We expect to initially target the following select geographic markets in order to develop this core group of early adopters: Los Angeles, California, Boulder, Colorado and Boston, Massachusetts. We have a limited sales force in each of these locations to accelerate distribution of our product initially through specialty retailers, such as cycling, running and triathlon stores. Over time, we may expand our distribution to more mainstream channels, such as drugstores, vitamin shops and grocery stores. 

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any drug product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our drug product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, durability, safety, price and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 

For nocturnal leg cramps, systemic treatments, such as dietary supplements, vasodilators and calcium channel blockers, are utilized as treatment, but we do not believe any medication has shown evidence of clinical efficacy. Quinine is taken by some individuals outside the United States but the FDA banned the use of quinine for the treatment of nocturnal leg cramps in 1994 and it is presently available only for the prescription treatment of malaria and its labeling contains a boxed warning against use in treating nocturnal leg cramps. 

For patients suffering from MS spasticity, the current treatments include muscle relaxants, sedatives and Botox injections. Other biotechnology companies are currently developing drug products to treat MS spasticity, including Xenoport, Inc., which is developing a r-Baclofen Prodrug, and GW Pharma, which markets Sativex. 

The October 2009 American Academy of Neurology ALS Care Guidelines found insufficient data to support or refute any specific interventions for the treatment of muscle cramps, twitches and spasticity in ALS patients. The guidelines did note that in diseases such as MS, effective treatments for similar problems include benzodiazepam, baclofen, dantrolene and tizanidine. 

We believe our consumer product for the prevention and treatment of EAMCs will compete against traditional beverage companies, sports beverage companies and companies developing dietary supplements. We believe the principal elements of competition in the consumer product industry will be price, selection, brand recognition, brand loyalty, distribution channel offerings and the effectiveness of the product. We do not expect any third-party payors to cover and reimburse for our consumer products. 

Royalty Agreement 

In connection with the transfer of certain intellectual property to us, by the scientific founders of our company and by Christoph Westphal, or collectively the Founders, on March 20, 2014, we entered into a royalty agreement with the Founders. Pursuant to the royalty agreement, we are obligated to pay the Founders a royalty of 2%, in the aggregate, of gross sales of any product sold by us or by any of our licensees for use in the treatment of any neuromuscular disorders, and that uses, incorporates or embodies, or made using any of our intellectual property, including any know-how. The royalty agreement grants the Founders certain audit rights and requires any license or sublicense granted by us be consistent with the terms and conditions of the royalty agreement. Each Founder may assign his rights and obligations under the royalty agreement to a third party upon prior written notice to us and we 

may not assign our rights and obligations thereunder except in the event of a change in control relating to our company. The term of the royalty agreement is perpetual. 

Government Regulation 

Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Any drug candidate that we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the corresponding foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Dietary supplements and conventional foods, while generally not subject to premarket review, still must comply with numerous manufacturing, labeling and other regulations. 

U.S. Drug Development Process 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#8226; 

completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, or other applicable regulations; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#8226; 

approval by an IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA's laws and regulations pertaining to the conduct of human clinical studies, collectively referred to as Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, and according to the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, GCP guidelines, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; 

&#8226; 

submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, for a proposed new drug; 

&#8226; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with the FDA's requirements for current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity; 

&#8226; 

potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 

&#8226; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug. 

The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain. 

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the non-clinical testing stage, also referred to as pre-clinical testing. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the drug candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLP. The IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, 

unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug candidate to healthy subjects or patients with the target disease under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor's control. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA's regulations which reflect the ICH GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. 

During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#8226; 

Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted only in patients having the specific disease. 

&#8226; 

Phase 2. The drug is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse events and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule for patients having the specific disease. 

&#8226; 

Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to statistically confirm the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. Generally, at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA. In some cases, the FDA has approved a drug based on the results of a single adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 study of excellent design and which provided highly reliable and statistically strong evidence of important clinical benefit, such as an effect on survival, and a confirmatory study would have been difficult to conduct on ethical grounds. 

Post-approval studies, also referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as part of the approval process. 

Progress reports detailing the status of drug development and results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects or patients. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is 

not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to study subjects. 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

FDA Review and Approval Processes 

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent pre-clinical and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed labeling, among other things. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has 12 months after submission of an NDA in which to complete its initial review of a standard new molecular entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and eight months for a priority review NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for review of standard and priority review NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by additional three month review periods whenever the FDA requests or the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission at any time during the review cycle. 

The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required. 

Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is to be manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations regarding conduct of clinical trials for the product's trials. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. 

The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA will issue a "complete response" letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. 

Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post approval studies, referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product's safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. These promotion and advertising requirements include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions against promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the drug's approved labeling (known as "off-label use"), rules for conducting industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. 

We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-parties for the production of clinical and future commercial quantities of our products. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA's cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are also required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA. These restrictions may include suspension of a product until the FDA is assured that quality standards can be met, continuing oversight of manufacturing by the FDA under a consent decree of permanent injunction, which frequently includes the imposition of costs and continuing inspections over a period of many years, as well as possible withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 

U.S. Marketing Exclusivity 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company's NDA. If the new drug is a new chemical entity subject to an NDA, the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the pre-clinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

Conventional Food Government Regulation 

Our consumer product under development will be regulated as a conventional food. Treatment or prevention of nocturnal leg muscle cramps are a particular indication that the FDA stated, in a Federal Register notice in 2000 (65 Fed. Reg. 1031), qualifies as a structure/function claim or intended use, although it can also be targeted by drug products. Structure/function claims that focus on effects derived from nutritive value may be made for conventional foods. Food products are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and abroad with respect to their safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution. The manufacture, packaging, labeling, holding, sale, and distribution of foods are also subject to extensive local, state, and foreign government regulation. The Bureau of Customs and Border Patrol, or CBP, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, also regulates shipments containing conventional foods and engages in enforcement activity in concert with the FDA to block the import or export of articles deemed adulterated or otherwise unlawful for sale in the United States (imports) or in the non-U.S. country to which articles are addressed. Import holds on articles or demands for recall can interfere with the timely delivery of products to market and can result in regulatory fines and penalties. 

The FDCA requires that substances added to food must either be approved food additives or must be generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, for their intended use. GRAS status can be documented through several means: an applicable FDA regulation, a notification that is submitted to FDA and to which the agency responds that it has no questions, or through a &#8220;self-determination&#8221; based on the views of scientific experts that is not submitted to the agency. For ingredients that are the subject of a GRAS &#8220;self-determination,&#8221; either by us or by our suppliers, there can be no assurance that FDA will agree with the GRAS assessment. Moreover, the agency can and has revised the status of GRAS ingredients, as it did in June 2015 when FDA revoked the GRAS status of partially hydrogenated oils. 

The FDA, a state Attorney General, or others could object to the positioning of our consumer product as a conventional food rather than a dietary supplement. The FDA issued a guidance document in 2014 objecting to the marketing of dietary supplements in the form of conventional beverages. The guidance explains that FDA will consider such factors as the labeling and advertising, product name, product packaging, serving size and recommended daily intake, recommendations and directions for use, marketing practices, and composition when determining whether a product is lawfully marketed as a conventional food. We believe we have designed each of these elements in a way that is appropriate for a conventional food, but cannot rule out the possibility that the FDA or another party could take the position that the product must be regulated as a dietary supplement, requiring changes to the label and potentially to the formulation. 

The FDA generally prohibits labeling a food with any "health claim" (i.e., any statement associating a nutrient with risk-reduction, but not treatment, of a disease or health-related condition), unless the claim is pre-approved by the FDA. The FDA prohibits entirely disease diagnosis, prevention and treatment claims when made for a food. Additionally, nutrient content claims, or claims that implicitly or expressly characterize the levels of a nutrient found in a food, may only be made in accordance with FDA regulations. However, other claims, including so-called "structure/function claims," are permitted to be included in labeling for foods without FDA pre-approval. Such statements may describe how a food affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a food may affect the structure, function or well-being of the body, but such statements may not state that a food will reduce the risk or incidence of a disease unless such claim has been reviewed and approved by the FDA as a health claim. Structure/function claims used in labeling must be supported by evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. There can be no assurance, however, that the FDA will not determine that a particular structure/function claim that we want to use is an unacceptable disease claim or an unauthorized nutrient-disease relationship claim otherwise permitted with FDA approval as a "health claim." Such a determination might prevent the use of such a claim. 

The regulation of foods may increase or become more restrictive in the future. There can be no assurance that, if more stringent statutes are enacted for foods, or if more stringent regulations are promulgated, we will be able to comply with such statutes or regulations without incurring substantial expense. 

The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA concerning all of the products it regulates, including powers to issue a public "warning letter" to a company, to quarantine and prohibit the sale of products deemed adulterated or misbranded, to publicize information about illegal products, to request a voluntary recall of illegal products from the market, to request that the Department of Justice initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in U.S. courts, and to seek disgorgement from a federal court of all proceeds received from the sale of products deemed misbranded or adulterated. 

The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, enforces the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTCA, and related regulations, which govern the advertising associated with the promotion and sale of dietary supplements to prevent misleading or deceptive claims. 

In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against food and dietary supplement companies for making false or misleading advertising claims and for failing to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising. These enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties and/or restitution by the companies involved. The FTC also regulates other aspects of consumer purchases including, but not limited to, promotional offers of savings compared policies, telemarketing, continuity plans, and "free" offers. 

We are also subject to regulation under various state, local and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements. California has a law called the "Consumers Legal Remedies Act" (Cal. Civ. Code &#167;&#167; 1750 et seq ) that allows private parties to assert a class action claim for false or deceptive advertising. It is typically asserted in combination with claims for false advertising and unfair competition under the California Business and Professions Code. California law firms specializing in this type of consumer class action claims have recently been targeting dietary supplement makers and sellers of products sold in California, claiming injury based on the products' failure to deliver results as claimed in product labeling and promotion. 

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service enforces federal laws governing fraudulent use of the mail. Regulation of certain aspects of the dietary supplement business at the federal level is also governed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, (e.g., concerning the presence of adulterated substances, such as toxic levels of lead or iron, that render products unsafe for consumption and require a CPSC ordered recall), the Department of Agriculture (e.g., for products that are intended for ingestion as dietary supplements for animals) and the Environmental Protection Agency (e.g., in the methods of disposal used for certain dietary ingredients, such as colloidal silver). 

Government regulations in foreign countries may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of certain of our products. We expect that compliance with such foreign governmental regulations will generally be the responsibility of our distributors in those countries and we expect these distributors will be independent contractors that we do not control. 

In addition, from time to time in the future, we may become subject to additional laws or regulations administered by the FDA, the FTC, or by other federal, state, local or foreign regulatory authorities, to the repeal of laws or regulations that we generally consider favorable, or to more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations. We are not able to predict the nature of such future laws, regulations, repeals or interpretations, and we cannot predict what effect additional governmental regulation, if and when it occurs, would have on our business in the future. Such developments could, however, require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, additional personnel or other new requirements. Any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Europe 

The European Union, or EU, is responsible for the development of legislation governing foods, nutritional supplements, and medicines sold in Europe. Member States of the EU, or Member States, are authorized to develop local legislation governing these products, provided such legislation is not more restrictive than the legislation promulgated by the EU. Member States are responsible for enforcement of the applicable legislation. In 2002, the EU established a process for Member States to bring this regulating legislation in line with a published directive of the EU, which addressed the labeling and marketing of vitamins and minerals, what nutrients are permitted or not permitted and other packaging requirements. In 2004, the EU established standards for the manufacture and marketing of herbal medicines with the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive. This requires, among other things, manufacturers of herbal medicinal products to comply with Pharmaceutical Group Standards, and only requires proof of safety, not efficacy. 

In 2006, the EU adopted its Commission Directive 2006/37/EC, amending its Directive 2002/46/EC. Under the amended directive, only nutrients listed in Annex II, or approved by subsequent order of the EU, may be lawfully sold in Member States. The EU also regulates labels, labeling, and advertising associated with the promotion and 

sale of dietary supplements in Europe. These regulations may make it unlawful for us to sell in Europe certain products lawfully labeled and sold in the United States. 

In the United Kingdom, the principal governing legislation is the Food Safety Act of 1990 (governing safety of food products) and the Medicines Act of 1968 (governing licensing and sale of medicine). Further guidance is provided by numerous Statutory Instruments addressing the formulation, purity, packaging, advertising and labeling of such products. Medicinal products are regulated and enforced by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), an agency of the Department of Health. The MHRA determines if an herbal remedy is medicinal by virtue of its "presentation" or "function." Food products are regulated by the Food Standard Agency (FSA), which reports to the Department of Health and to the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Vitamin and mineral supplements and soup products with herbal ingredients are generally considered food supplements and are subject to the purview of the FSA. Additional legislative standards have been adopted in the other EU countries, typically similar in scope to the UK. The regulatory scheme in Canada is similar but not identical to that of the United States concerning medicines and healthcare products or material health products and is regulated by Health Canada. 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement for Drug Products 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any drug products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. In addition, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will continue to experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative and regulatory initiatives. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our drug products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. If these third-party payors do not consider our drug products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as the drug candidates that we are developing and could adversely affect our net revenue and results. 

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. For example, in the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 

Healthcare Reform 

In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been, and continue to be, a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. 

In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively, the ACA, a sweeping law intended to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among other things, the ACA revises the definition of "average manufacturer price" for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states once the provision is effective. Further, the new law imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare providers and entities, and a significant number of provisions are not yet, or have only recently become, effective. Although it is too early to determine the full effect of the ACA, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, on August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations. 

Moreover, the recently enacted Drug Supply Chain Security Act, imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing, which is being phased in over several years. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 

We expect that the ACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenue. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. 

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 

In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, various activities, including but not limited to sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs, must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the 

federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the federal False Claims Act and similar state laws, each as amended. Failure to comply with such requirements could potentially result in substantial penalties to us. Even if we structure our programs with the intent of compliance with such laws, there can be no certainty that we would not need to defend against enforcement or litigation, in light of the fact that there is significant enforcement interest in pharmaceutical companies in the United States, and some of the applicable laws are quite broad in scope. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. The term "remuneration" has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of co-payments or deductibles, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the ACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below). 

Additionally, the federal civil monetary penalties statute imposes fines against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

The federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, impose liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the civil False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims laws analogous to the False Claims Act. Many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a federal healthcare program. There are many potential bases for liability under the civil False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on, for example, the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper promotion of off-label uses (i.e., uses not expressly approved by FDA in a drug's label), and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Our business activities relating to the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our future products, and the sale and marketing of our future products and our service arrangements or data purchases, among other activities, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. The cost of defending any such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could adversely affect our financial performance. 

Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created several new federal crimes, including healthcare fraud, and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 

Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the federal laws mentioned above, and some of these state laws are broader in scope and may apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. For example, HIPAA and its implementing regulations established uniform federal standards for certain "covered entities" (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of protected health information. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the economic stimulus package, included expansion of HIPAA's privacy and security standards under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, referred to as HITECH, which became effective on February 17, 2010. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA's security standards directly applicable to "business associates" &#8212; independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Covered manufacturers were required to report these payments for the first reporting period to the Centers for Medicare &#38; Medicaid Services, or the CMS, by June 30, 2014. CMS published certain data reported by covered manufacturers for the first reporting period on September 30, 2014. Compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking is performed properly, and some of these laws result in the public disclosure of various types of payments and relationships. 

Several states have also enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical companies for use in sales and marketing, and prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. Additionally, in order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. 

Many of our current as well as possible future activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We must also comply with laws that require clinical trial registration and reporting of clinical trial results on the publicly available clinical trial databank maintained by the National Institutes of Health at www.ClinicalTrials.gov. We are subject to various environmental, health and safety regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances. From time to time, and in the future, our operations may involve the use of hazardous materials. 

Because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant administrative, criminal and civil penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals, private "qui tam" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply 

contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 

Europe/Rest of World Government Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country's national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country's requirements, the clinical trial described in that CTA may proceed. 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the ICH GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. In the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: the Community MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, a body of the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA, and which is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA; and the National MA, which is issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only authorized marketing in that Member State's national territory and not the EEA as a whole. 

The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. The National MA is for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member state, or RMS. If the RMS proposes to authorize the product, and the other Member States do not raise objections, the product is granted a national MA in all the Member States where the authorization was sought. Before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 

In addition, we may be subject to certain health regulatory laws in the foreign countries in which we conduct business. For instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

Employees 

As of March 4, 2016, we had 31 full-time employees and three part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

Research and Development 

We incurred $16.8 million of research and development expenses from February 26, 2014 (inception) through December 31, 2015.
