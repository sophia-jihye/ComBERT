&#160; 

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements:

general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected; 

&#8226; 

competition among depository and other financial institutions; 

&#8226; 

inflation and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins and yields or reduce the fair value of financial instruments; 

&#8226; 

adverse changes in the securities or credit markets; 

&#8226; 

changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees and capital requirements; 

&#8226; 

our ability to manage operations in the current economic conditions; 

&#8226;

&#8226; 

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; 

&#8226; 

changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; 

&#8226; 

cyber attacks, computer viruses and other technological risks that may breach the security of our websites or other systems to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information and destroy data or disable our systems; 

&#8226; 

changes in our organization, compensation, and benefit plans; 

&#8226; 

changes in the level of government support for housing finance; 

&#8226; 

significant increases in our loan losses; and 

&#8226; 

changes in the financial condition, results of operations, or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own. 

&#160; 

Because of these and other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-K, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

At December 31, 2015, Hopewell Valley had approximately $508.3 million in assets and operated nine branches in Hunterdon and Mercer counties in New Jersey. 

&#160; 

Northfield Bank&#8217;s principal business consists of originating multifamily and other commercial real estate loans, purchasing investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds, and to a lesser extent depositing funds in other financial institutions. Northfield Bank also offers construction and land loans, commercial and industrial loans, one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, and home equity loans and lines of credit, as well as acquires pools of loans from time to time. Northfield Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including certificates of deposit, passbook, statement, and money market savings accounts, transaction deposit accounts (negotiable orders of withdrawal (NOW) accounts and non-interest bearing demand accounts), individual retirement accounts, and to a lesser extent when it is deemed cost effective, brokered deposits.

&#160; 

Market Area and Competition 

&#160; 

We have been in business for over 128 years, offering a variety of financial products and services to meet the needs of the communities we serve. Our commercial and retail banking network consists of multiple delivery channels including full-service banking offices, automated teller machines, telephone, and internet banking capabilities including mobile banking and remote deposit capture. We consider our competitive products and pricing, branch network, customer service, and financial strength, as our major strengths in attracting and retaining customers in our market areas. 

&#160; 

We face intense competition in our market areas both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market areas have a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks, and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds, and insurance companies. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. 

&#160; 

Our deposit sources are primarily concentrated in the communities surrounding our branch offices in the New York counties of Richmond (Staten Island) and Kings (Brooklyn), and Union and Middlesex counties in New Jersey. As of June 30, 2015 (the latest date for which information is publicly available), we ranked fourth in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured deposit market share in Staten Island with an 11.19% market share. As of that date, we had a 0.63% deposit market share in Brooklyn, New York, and a combined deposit market share of 0.84% in the Middlesex and Union counties in New Jersey. In addition, after completion of our acquisition of Hopewell Valley, we also gained deposit sources in the Hunterdon and Mercer counties of New Jersey, which as of June 30, 2015, had a combined deposit market share of 2.39%. This market share data does not reflect deposits held by credit unions.

Lending Activities 

&#160; 

Our principal lending activity is the origination of multifamily real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, other commercial real estate loans (typically on office, retail, and industrial properties), in New York City, New Jersey, and Eastern Pennsylvania. We also originate one-to-four family residential real estate loans (investment properties), construction and land loans, commercial and industrial loans, and home equity loans and lines of credit. 

&#160; 

Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Participations, and Servicing. &#32;All loans we originate for our portfolio are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures or are properly approved as exceptions to our policies and procedures. In addition, historically we used to originate both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate residential real estate loans under an origination assistance agreement with a third-party underwriter that conformed to secondary market underwriting standards, whereby the third-party underwriter would process and underwrite one-to-four family residential real estate loans that we funded at origination, and we elected either to portfolio the loans or sell them to the third-party. The agreement with this third party 

underwriter was discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our ability to originate fixed- or adjustable-rate loans is dependent on the relative customer demand for such loans, which is affected by various factors including current market interest rates as well as anticipated future market interest rates. Our loan origination and sales activity may be adversely affected by changes in economic conditions that result in decreased loan demand. Our home equity loans and lines of credit typically are generated through direct mail advertisements, newspaper advertisements, online applications through our website, and referrals from branch personnel. A significant portion of our multifamily real estate loans and other commercial real estate loans are generated with the use of third-party loan brokers and referrals from accountants and other professional contacts. Our commercial and industrial loans typically are generated through referrals from professional contacts. 

&#160; 

We generally retain in our portfolio all adjustable-rate residential real estate loans we originate, as well as shorter-term, fixed-rate residential real estate loans (terms of 10 years or less). Loans we sell consist primarily of conforming, longer-term, fixed-rate residential real estate loans. We sold $2.4 million &#32;of one-to-four family residential real estate loans (generally fixed-rate loans, with terms of 15 years or longer) during the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

We sell our loans without recourse, except for standard representations and warranties typical in secondary market transactions. During 2012, we sold the servicing rights of one-to-four family residential real estate loans owned by others to a third-party bank. Historically, the origination of loans held-for-sale and related servicing activity has not been material to our operations. 

&#160; 

Loans acquired in assisted transactions with the FDIC and in the merger with Flatbush Federal Bancorp, Inc. with deteriorated credit quality, herein referred to as purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, have a carrying value of $33.1 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 . The accounting and reporting for these loans differs substantially from those loans originated and classified as held-for-investment. For purposes of reporting, discussion and analysis, management has classified its loan portfolio into four categories: (1) PCI loans, which are held-for-investment, and initially valued at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition, with no initial related allowance for loan losses, (2) loans originated and held-for-sale, which are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or estimated fair value, less costs to sell, and therefore have no associated allowance for loan losses, (3) originated loans held-for-investment, which are carried at amortized cost, less net charge-offs and the allowance for loan losses, and (4) acquired loans with no evidence of credit deterioration, which are held-for-investment, and initially valued at an estimated fair value on the date of acquisition, with no initial related allowance for loan losses. PCI and acquired loans are periodically evaluated for impairment after their initial valuation and could have an associated allowance for loan losses. 

&#160; 

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority . &#160; Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards approved by our board of directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral that will secure the loan, if any. To assess the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay, we review the borrower&#8217;s income and credit history, and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. 

&#160; 

In underwriting a loan secured by real property, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser approved by our board of directors. The appraisals of multifamily, mixed-use, and other commercial real estate properties are also reviewed by an independent third-party appraiser. We review and inspect properties before disbursement of funds during the term of a construction loan. Generally, management obtains updated appraisals when a loan is deemed impaired. These appraisals may be more limited than those prepared for the underwriting of a new loan. In addition, when we acquire other real estate owned, we generally obtain a current appraisal to substantiate the net carrying value of the asset. 

&#160; 

The board of directors maintains a loan committee consisting of bank directors to: periodically review and recommend for approval our policies related to lending (collectively, the loan policies) as prepared by management; approve or reject loan applicants meeting certain criteria; and monitor loan quality including concentrations and certain other aspects of our lending functions, as applicable. Certain Northfield Bank officers, at levels beginning with senior vice president, have individual lending authority that is approved by the board of directors. 

Loan Portfolio Composition. &#32;The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio, by type of loan, at the dates indicated, excluding loans held for sale of $471,000 , $5.4 million &#32;and $3.9 million , at December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. There were no loans held for sale at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

Multifamily Real Estate Loans . We currently focus on originating multifamily real estate loans. Loans secured by multifamily properties totaled approximately $1.32 billion , or 55.7% &#32;of our total loan portfolio, at December 31, 2015 . We include in this category mixed-use properties having more than four residential units and a business or businesses where the majority of space is utilized for residential purposes. At December 31, 2015 , we had 821 originated multifamily real estate loans, with an average loan balance of approximately $1.6 million, although there are a large number of loans with balances substantially greater than this average. At December 31, 2015 , our largest multifamily real estate loan had a principal balance of $30.9 million and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. Substantially all of our multifamily real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market areas and Eastern Pennsylvania. 

&#160; 

Our multifamily real estate loans typically amortize over 20 to 30 years with negotiated interest rates that adjust after an initial five-, seven-, or 10-year period, and every five years thereafter. Interest rates adjust at margins generally ranging from 275 basis points to 350 basis points above the average yield on U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted to a constant maturity of similar term, as published by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) for loans originated prior to 2009. Adjustable rate loans originated subsequent to 2008 generally have been indexed to the five-year London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) swaps rate as published in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release adjusted for a negotiated margin. We also originate, to a lesser extent, 10- to 15-year fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. In general, our multifamily real estate loans have interest rate floors equal to the interest rate on the date the loan is originated, and have prepayment penalties should the loan be prepaid in the initial five-, seven-, or 10-year term. 

&#160; 

In underwriting multifamily real estate loans, we consider a number of factors, including the ratio of the projected net cash flow to the loan&#8217;s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum ratio of 120%, computed after deduction for a vacancy factor, when applicable, and property expenses we deem appropriate), the age and condition of the collateral, the financial resources and income of the sponsor, and the sponsor&#8217;s experience in owning or managing similar properties. Multifamily real estate loans generally are originated in amounts up to 75% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. We require title insurance, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance up to the regulatory required amount of $500,000, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. Although a significant portion of our multifamily real estate loans are referred to us by third-party loan brokers, we underwrite all multifamily real estate loans in accordance with our underwriting standards. Due to competitor considerations, as is customary in our marketplace, we typically do not obtain personal guarantees of the principals on multifamily real estate loans, except where warranted. 

&#160; 

Loans secured by multifamily real estate properties generally have less credit risk than other commercial real estate loans. The repayment of loans secured by multifamily real estate properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property. If the cash flow from the property is reduced, the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. 

&#160; 

In a ruling that was contrary to a 1996 advisory opinion from the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal that owners of housing units who benefited from the receipt of &#8220;J-51&#8221; tax incentives under the Rent Stabilization Law are eligible to decontrol apartments, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled on October 22, 2009, that residential housing units located in two major housing complexes in New York City had been illegally decontrolled by the current and previous property owners. This ruling may subject other property owners that have previously or are currently benefiting from a J-51 tax incentive to litigation, possibly resulting in a significant reduction to property cash flows. Based on management&#8217;s assessment of our multifamily loan portfolio, we believe that only one loan may be affected by the ruling regarding J-51. The loan had a principal balance of $6.9 &#32; million at December 31, 2015 , and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms at that date. 

&#160; 

Commercial Real Estate Loans. &#32;Commercial real estate loans (other than multifamily real estate loans) totaled $402.1 million , or 17.0% &#32;of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015 . At December 31, 2015 , our commercial real estate loan portfolio consisted of 388 loans with an average loan balance of approximately $1.0 million, although there are a large number of loans with balances substantially greater than this average. At December 31, 2015 , our largest commercial real estate loan had a principal balance of $21.6 million, was secured by a mall with two small retail buildings, and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. Substantially all of our commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in our primary market areas.

Our commercial real estate loans typically amortize over 20 to 25 years with negotiated interest rates that adjust after an initial five-, seven-, or 10-year period, and every five years thereafter. Interest rates adjust at margins generally ranging from 275 basis points to 350 basis points above the average yield on U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted to a constant maturity of similar term, as published by the FRB for loans originated prior to 2009. Adjustable rate loans originated subsequent to 2008 generally have been indexed to the five-year LIBOR swaps rate as published in the Federal Reserve Statistical Release, adjusted for a negotiated margin. We also originate, to a lesser extent, 10- to 15-year fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. In general, our commercial real estate loans have interest rate floors equal to the interest rate on the date the loan is originated, and generally have prepayment penalties if the loan is repaid in the initial five-, seven-, or 10-year term. 

&#160; 

In underwriting commercial real estate loans, we generally lend up to the lesser of 75% of either the property&#8217;s appraised value or purchase price. Our policies permit the origination of certain single-use property types but at lower loan-to-appraised value ratios. We base our decision to lend primarily on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we emphasize the ratio of the property&#8217;s projected net cash flow to the loan&#8217;s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum ratio of 125%), computed after deduction for a vacancy factor, when applicable, and property expenses we deem appropriate. Personal guarantees of the principals are typically obtained. We require title insurance, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance up to the regulatory required amount of $500,000, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. Although a significant portion of our commercial real estate loans were referred to us by third-party loan brokers, we underwrite all commercial real estate loans in accordance with our underwriting standards. 

&#160; 

Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one-to-four family residential real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans also generally have greater credit risk compared to one-to-four family residential real estate loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property or business. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender may affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for commercial real estate than for residential properties. 

&#160; 

Construction and Land Loans. At December 31, 2015 , construction and land loans total $18.7 million , or 0.8% &#32;of total loans receivable, and the additional un-advanced portion of these construction loans totaled $4.9 million. At December 31, 2015 , we had 20 construction and land loans with an average loan balance of approximately $934,000 and our largest construction and land loan had a principal balance of $4.1 million and was for the purpose of financing land. At December 31, 2015 , this loan was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. 

&#160; 

Our construction and land loans typically are interest-only loans with interest rates that are tied to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal . Margins generally range from zero basis points to 200 basis points above the prime rate. We also originate, to a lesser extent, 10- to 15-year fixed-rate, fully amortizing land loans. In general, our construction and land loans have interest rate floors equal to the interest rate on the date the loan is originated, and we do not typically charge prepayment penalties. 

&#160; 

We grant construction and land loans to experienced developers for the construction of single-family residences, including condominiums, and commercial properties. Construction and land loans also are made to individuals for the construction of their personal residences. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction, but are generally limited to a loan-to-completed appraised value ratio of 70%. Repayment of construction loans on residential properties normally is expected from the sale of units to individual purchasers, or in the case of individuals building their own residences, with a permanent mortgage. In the case of income-producing property, repayment usually is expected from permanent financing upon completion of construction. We typically offer permanent mortgage financing on our construction loans on income-producing properties. 

&#160; 

Land loans also help finance the purchase of land intended for future development, including single-family housing, multifamily housing, and commercial property. In some cases, we may make an acquisition loan before the borrower has received approval to develop the land. In general, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for land acquisition loans is 50% of the appraised value of the property, and the maximum term of these loans is two years. Generally, if the maturity of the loan exceeds three years, the loan must be an amortizing loan. 

&#160; 

Construction and land loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one-to-four family residential real estate loans. Construction and land loans have greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the real estate value at completion of construction as compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other 

assumptions. If the estimate of construction costs is inaccurate, we may decide to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property. However, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold the real estate with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon its sale. In the event we make a land acquisition loan on real estate that is not yet approved for the planned development, there is a risk that approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Construction loans also expose us to a risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, the ultimate sale or rental of the real estate may not occur as anticipated and the market value of collateral, when completed, may be less than the outstanding loans against the real estate and there may be no permanent financing available upon completion. Substantially all of our construction and land loans are secured by real estate located in our primary market areas. 

&#160; 

Commercial and Industrial Loans . At &#32; December 31, 2015 , commercial and industrial loans totaled $25.6 million &#32;or &#32; 1.1% &#32;of the total loan portfolio and the additional un-advanced portion of these commercial and industrial loans totaled $16.7 million. As of &#32; December 31, 2015 , we had 150 commercial and industrial loans with an average loan balance of approximately $171,000, &#32; although we originate these types of loans in amounts substantially greater than this average. At &#32; December 31, 2015 , our largest commercial and industrial loan had a principal balance of $5.0 &#32; million and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. 

&#160; 

Our commercial and industrial loans typically amortize over 10 years with interest rates that are tied to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal . Margins generally range from zero basis points to 300 basis points above the prime rate. We also originate, to a lesser extent, 10-year fixed-rate, fully amortizing loans. In general, our commercial and industrial loans have interest rate floors equal to the interest rate on the date the loan is originated and have prepayment penalties. 

&#160; 

We make various types of secured and unsecured commercial and industrial loans for the purpose of working capital and other general business purposes. The terms of these loans generally range from less than one year to a maximum of 15 years. The loans either are negotiated on a fixed-rate basis or carry adjustable interest rates indexed to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal . 

&#160; 

Commercial credit decisions are based on our credit assessment of the applicant. We evaluate the applicant&#8217;s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms of the loan and assess the risks involved. Personal guarantees of the principals are typically obtained. In addition to evaluating the loan applicant&#8217;s financial statements, we consider the adequacy of the secondary sources of repayment for the loan, such as pledged collateral and the financial stability of the guarantors. Credit agency reports of each guarantor&#8217;s personal credit history supplement our analysis of the applicant&#8217;s creditworthiness. We also attempt to confirm with other banks and conduct trade investigations as part of our credit assessment of the borrower. Collateral securing a loan also is analyzed to determine its marketability. 

&#160; 

During 2013, the Company expanded its small business lending to include unsecured loans of up to $250,000 using a scoring system developed by a third-party vendor. The scoring system provides a consistent method of timely decisions related to these small business loans. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company began assembling a commercial and industrial lending team to serve primarily the Company's existing markets. 

&#160; 

Commercial and industrial loans generally carry higher interest rates than one-to-four family residential real estate loans of like maturity because they have a higher risk of default since their repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrowers&#8217; business. 

One-to-Four Family Residential &#32; Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2015 , we had 271 originated one-to-four family residential real estate loans outstanding with an aggregate balance of $98.3 million , or 4.2% &#32;of our total loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2015 , the average balance of originated one-to-four family residential real estate loans was approximately $365,000, although we originate this type of loan in amounts substantially greater than this average. At December 31, 2015 , our largest loan of this type had a principal balance of $5.0 million, was collateralized by 48 two-bedroom individual condominiums, and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. 

&#160; 

For all one-to-four family residential real estate loans originated through the origination assistance agreement with our third-party underwriter, upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower: (1) a credit report is reviewed; (2) income, assets, indebtedness and certain other information are reviewed; (3) if necessary, additional financial information is required of the borrower; and (4) an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan is ordered from an independent appraiser. This agreement was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2015. One-to-four family residential real estate loans sold to our third-party underwriter under a Loan and Servicing Rights Purchase and Sale Agreement totaled $2.4 million and $1.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

&#160; 

We generally do not offer &#8220;interest-only&#8221; mortgage loans on one-to-four family residential real estate properties, where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan. &#32;&#32; However, during 2014 and 2015, we purchased pools of one-to-four family residential real estate loans, a substantial amount of which are interest-only mortgage loans. For further details on this purchase, see &#8220;Acquired Loans&#8221; discussion below. We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as &#8220;Option ARM&#8221; loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer &#8220;subprime loans&#8221; (loans to borrowers with weak credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios). 

&#160; 

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. &#32;At December 31, 2015 , we had 1,078 home equity loans and lines of credit with an aggregate outstanding balance of $61.4 million , or 2.6% &#32;of our total loan portfolio. Of this total, outstanding home equity lines of credit totaled $29.8 million, or 1.3%, of our total loan portfolio and home equity loans totaled $31.6 million, or 1.3%, of our total loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015 , the average home equity loan and line of credit balance was approximately $58,000, although we originate these types of loans in amounts substantially greater than this average. At December 31, 2015 , our largest outstanding home equity line of credit was $379,000 and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. At December 31, 2015 , our largest outstanding home equity loan was $251,000 and was performing in accordance with its original contractual terms. 

&#160; 

We offer home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are secured by the borrower&#8217;s primary residence or second home. Home equity lines of credit are adjustable rate loans tied to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal &#32;adjusted for a margin, and have a maximum term of 20 years during which time the borrower is required to make principal payments based on a 20-year amortization. Home equity lines generally have interest rate floors and ceilings. The borrower is permitted to draw against the line during the entire term on originations occurring prior to June 15, 2011. For home equity loans originated beginning June 15, 2011, forward, the borrower is only permitted to draw against the line for the initial 10 years. Our home equity loans typically are fully amortizing with fixed terms to 20 years. Home equity loans and lines of credit generally are underwritten with the same criteria we use to underwrite fixed-rate, one-to-four family residential real estate loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan. We appraise the property securing the loan at the time of the loan application to determine the value of the property. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of credit, we record a mortgage to perfect our security interest in the underlying collateral. 

&#160; 

PCI Loans. PCI loans are accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Subtopic 310-30, &#8220;Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality,&#8221; since all of these loans were acquired at a discount attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. PCI loans are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no valuation allowance (i.e., allowance for loan losses). Under ASC Subtopic 310-30, the PCI loans are aggregated and accounted for as pools of loans based on common risk characteristics. PCI loans had a carrying balance of approximately $33.1 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 , or 1.4% &#32;of our total loan portfolio. PCI loans consisted of approximately 28% &#32;commercial real estate loans and 52% &#32;commercial and industrial loans, with the remaining balance in residential and home equity loans. At December 31, 2015 , 7.9% of PCI loans were past due 30 to 89 days, and 21.4% were past due 90 days or more. 

&#160; 

The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the investment in the PCI loans, or the &#8220;accretable yield,&#8221; is recognized as interest income utilizing the level-yield method over the life of the loans in each pool. Contractually required payments of interest and principal that exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition, or the &#8220;non-accretable difference,&#8221; are not recognized as a yield adjustment or as a loss accrual or a valuation allowance. Increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the acquisition are recognized prospectively through an adjustment of the yield on the pool over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a loss provision and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. 

&#160; 

Acquired Loans. &#32; Loans acquired with no evidence of credit deterioration, are held-for-investment, and initially valued at estimated fair value on the date of acquisition, with no initial related allowance for loan losses. These loans are evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis as part of our analysis of the allowance for loan losses. During 2015, we purchased approximately $185.0 million loans, the most significant of which were a $127.4 million pool of one-to-four family residential loans and a $47.4 million pool of multifamily loans.

The weighted average coupon of 2.53% noted in the table above is net of the servicing fee retained by the originating bank. Of the total loans purchased, $114.7 million, or 62%, are interest-only for the initial 10 years and will re-price in less than five years at one month LIBOR plus a weighted average margin of 1.7%. The remainder of the loan pool is scheduled to make principal and interest payments and will re-price in less than five years at one month LIBOR plus a weighted average margin of 1.8%. The geographic locations of the properties securing the loans are as follows: 46.0% in New York, 30.5% in Massachusetts, and 23.5% in other states. 

At December 31, 2015 , acquired loans totaled approximately $409.0 million &#32;and consisted of approximately 80.8% &#32;one-to-four family residential loans and 15.8% &#32;multifamily loans, with the remaining balance in commercial real estate and home equity loans. At December 31, 2014, acquired loans totaled approximately $265.7 million and consisted of approximately 88.3% &#32;one-to-four family residential loans and 7.1% &#32;multifamily loans, with the remaining balance in commercial real estate and industrial loans. 

Non-Performing and Problem Assets 

&#160; 

When a loan is over 15 days delinquent, we generally send the borrower a late charge notice. When a loan is 30 days past due, we generally mail the borrower a letter reminding the borrower of the delinquency and, except for loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate, we attempt personal, direct contact with the borrower to determine the reason for the delinquency, to ensure the borrower correctly understands the terms of the loan, and to emphasize the importance of making 

payments on or before the due date. If necessary, additional late charges and delinquency notices are issued and the account will be monitored. After 90 days of delinquency, we send the borrower a final demand for payment and generally refer the loan to legal counsel to commence foreclosure and related legal proceedings. At times, we may shorten these time frames. 

&#160; 

Generally, loans (excluding PCI loans) are placed on non-accrual status when payment of principal or interest is 90 days or more delinquent unless the loan is considered well secured and in the process of collection. Loans also are placed on non-accrual status at any time if the ultimate collection of principal or interest in full is in doubt. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, unpaid accrued interest is reversed, and further income is recognized only to the extent received, and only if the principal balance is deemed fully collectible. The loan may be returned to accrual status if both principal and interest payments are brought current and factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, including performance by the borrower under the loan terms for a six-month period. Our Chief Lending Officer reports monitored loans, including all loans rated watch, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss, to the loan committee of the board of directors at least quarterly. 

&#160; 

To minimize our losses on delinquent loans we work with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties and will consider modifying existing loan terms and conditions that we would not otherwise consider, commonly referred to as troubled debt restructurings (TDR). We record an impairment loss associated with TDRs, if any, based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the original loan&#8217;s effective interest rate or the underlying collateral value, less cost to sell, if the loan is collateral dependent. Once an obligation has been restructured because of credit problems, it continues to be considered restructured until paid in full or, if the obligation yields a market rate (a rate equal to or greater than the rate we were willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk), until the year subsequent to the year in which the restructuring takes place, provided the borrower has performed under the modified terms for a consecutive six-month period. 

&#160; 

PCI loans are subject to the same internal and external credit review process as non-PCI loans. If and when unexpected credit deterioration occurs at the loan pool level subsequent to the acquisition date, a provision for credit losses for PCI loans will be charged to earnings for the full amount of the decline in the discounted expected cash flows for the pool. Under the accounting guidance of ASC Subtopic 310-30, for acquired credit-impaired loans, the allowance for loan losses on PCI loans is measured at each financial reporting date based on future expected cash flows. This assessment and measurement is performed at the pool level and not at the individual loan level. Accordingly, decreases in expected cash flows resulting from further credit deterioration on a pool of acquired PCI loan pools as of such measurement date compared to those originally estimated are recognized by recording a provision and allowance for credit losses on PCI loans. Subsequent increases in the expected cash flows of the loans in that pool would first reduce any allowance for loan losses on PCI loans, and any excess will be accreted prospectively as a yield adjustment. 

&#160; 

We consider our PCI loans to be performing due to the application of the yield accretion method under ASC Subtopic 310-30. ASC Subtopic 310-30 allows us to aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that the loans have common risk characteristics. A pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation of cash flows. Accordingly, loans that may have been classified as non-performing loans are no longer classified as non-performing because, at the respective dates of acquisition, we believed that we would fully collect the new carrying value of these loans. The new carrying value represents the contractual balance, reduced by the portion expected to be uncollectible (referred to as the non-accretable difference) and by an accretable yield (discount) that is recognized as interest income. Management&#8217;s judgment is required in reclassifying loans subject to ASC Subtopic 310-30 as performing loans, and is dependent on having a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of the cash flows to be collected, even if a loan is contractually past due. 

Non-Performing and Restructured Loans &#32; (excluding PCI Loans). &#32;The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated. At December 31, 2015 , 2014 , 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , we had TDRs of $4.4 million , $9.5 million, $10.7 million, $19.3 million, and $23.3 million, respectively, which are included in the appropriate categories within non-accrual loans. Additionally, we had $22.3 million , $24.2 million, $26.2 million, $25.7 million, and $18.3 million of TDRs on accrual status at December 31, 2015 , 2014 , 2013 , 2012 , and 2011 , respectively, which do not appear in the table below. Generally, the types of concessions that we make to troubled borrowers include reductions in interest rates and payment extensions and to a lesser extent interest and principal forgiveness. At December 31, 2015 , 77.1% of TDRs were commercial real estate loans, 14.1% were one-to-four family residential loans, 7.0% were multifamily loans, 1.3% were home equity loans, and 0.5% were commercial and industrial loans. At December 31, 2015 , loans totaling $7.2 million, or 32.3%, of the $22.3 million &#32;accruing TDRs were not performing in accordance with their restructured terms. The majority of the $7.2 million is attributable to one commercial real estate loan with a balance of $5.6 million which was 31 days delinquent at December 31, 2015. Based on the results of the impairment analysis for this loan as of December 31, 2015, no impairment reserve was necessary as the loan is adequately covered by collateral (a hotel and catering hall in Central New Jersey) with an estimated fair value of approximately $7.6 million. At December 31, 2015 , the borrower was paying on a regular, but delayed basis. At December 31, 2015 , loans totaling $2.3 million, or 53.2%, of the non-accruing $4.4 million &#32;TDRs were not 

performing in accordance with their restructured terms. Two separate relationships account for these loans, which are primarily collateralized by real estate with an aggregate appraised value of $2.6 million.

Other Real Estate Owned . &#32; Real estate acquired by us as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned. On the date the property is acquired, it is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, establishing a new cost basis. Estimated fair value generally represents the sale price a buyer would be willing to pay on the basis of current market conditions, including normal terms from other financial institutions, less the estimated costs to sell the property. Holding costs and declines in estimated fair value result in charges to expense after acquisition. Other real estate owned consisted of one property with a carrying value of approximately $45,000 &#32;at December 31, 2015 , as compared to six properties with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $752,000 &#32;at December 31, 2014 , the decrease in the carrying value being due to property sales. 

&#160; 

Potential Problem Loans and Classification of Assets. &#32;Our loan officers and credit administration department continuously monitor their loan portfolios, including evaluation of borrowers&#8217; business operations, current financial condition, underlying values of any collateral, and assessment of their financial prospects in the current and deteriorating economic environment. Based on these evaluations, we determine an appropriate strategy for individual potential problem loans, with the objective of maximizing the recovery of the related loan balances. 

&#160; 

Our policies, consistent with regulatory guidelines, provide for the classification of loans and other assets that are considered to be of lesser quality as substandard, doubtful, or loss assets. An asset is classified substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those assets characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets (or portions of assets) classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets is not warranted. Assets that do not expose us to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but which possess potential weaknesses that deserve our close attention, are designated as special mention. At December 31, 2015 , classified assets, excluding loans on nonaccrual status, consisted of substandard assets of $30.1 million and no doubtful or loss assets. At December 31, 2015 , we also had $10.6 million of assets designated as special mention. At December 31, 2014 , classified assets, excluding loans on non-accrual status, consisted of substandard assets of $42.2 million and no doubtful or loss assets. At December 31, 2014 , we also had $20.8 million of assets designated as special mention. 

&#160; 

Our determination as to the classification of our assets (and the amount of our loss allowances) is subject to review by our principal federal regulator, the OCC, which can require that we adjust our classification and related loss allowances. We regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. We also engage the services of a third party to review, on a sample basis, our classifications on a semi-annual basis. 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company had $21.6 million &#32;of accruing loans that were 30 to 89 days delinquent, as compared to $12.3 million at December 31, 2014 . The following table sets forth the total amounts of delinquencies for accruing loans that were 30 to 89 days past due by type and by amount at the dates indicated:

The increase in the delinquent loans is primarily attributable to one commercial real estate loan with a balance of $5.6 million, which was 31 days delinquent and classified as an accruing TDR at December 31, 2015. Based on the results of the impairment analysis for this loan as of December 31, 2015, no impairment reserve was necessary as the loan is adequately 

covered by collateral (a hotel and catering hall in Central New Jersey) with an estimated fair value of approximately $7.6 million. At December 31, 2015 , the borrower was paying on a regular, but delayed basis. 

Allowance for Loan Losses 

&#160; 

We provide for loan losses based on the consistent application of our documented allowance for loan loss methodology. Loan losses are charged to the allowance for loans losses and recoveries are credited to it. Additions to the allowance for loan losses are provided by charges against income based on various factors, which, in our judgment, deserve current recognition in estimating probable losses. Loan losses are charged-off in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed uncollectible. Generally, the Company will record a loan charge-off (including a partial charge-off) to reduce a loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less cost to sell, for collateral dependent loans. We regularly review the loan portfolio in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). See &#32; &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Polices - Allowance for Loan Losses&#8221; &#32; for a description of our allowance methodology .

Investments 

&#160; 

We conduct securities portfolio transactions in accordance with our board-approved investment policy, which is reviewed at least annually by the risk committee of the board of directors. Any changes to the policy are subject to ratification by the full board of directors. This policy dictates that investment decisions give consideration to the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, the ability to provide collateral for pledging requirements, and consistency with our interest rate risk management strategy. Our Chief Investment Officer executes our securities portfolio transactions, within policy requirements, with the approval of either the Chief Executive Officer or the President. NSB Services Corp.&#8217;s and NSB Realty Trust&#8217;s investment officers execute security portfolio transactions in accordance with investment policies that substantially mirror Northfield Bank&#8217;s investment policy. All purchase and sale transactions are reviewed by the risk committee at least quarterly. 

&#160; 

Our current investment policy permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs). The investment policy also permits, with certain limitations, investments in debt securities issued by the U.S. Government, agencies of the U.S. Government or U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), asset-backed securities, municipal bonds, money market mutual funds, federal funds, investment grade corporate bonds, reverse repurchase agreements, and certificates of deposit. 

&#160; 

Northfield Bank&#8217;s investment policy does not permit investment in preferred and common stock of other entities including GSEs, other than our required investment in the common stock of the FHLB of New York or as permitted for community reinvestment purposes or for the purposes of funding the Bank&#8217;s deferred compensation plan. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. may invest in equity securities of other financial institutions up to certain limitations. As of December 31, 2015 , we held no asset-backed securities other than mortgage-backed securities. Our board of directors may change these limitations in the future. 

&#160; 

Our current investment policy does not permit hedging through the use of derivative instruments such as financial futures or interest rate options and swaps. 

&#160; 

At the time of purchase, we designate a security as either held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, based upon our ability and intent to hold such securities. Trading securities and securities available-for-sale are reported at estimated fair value, and securities held-to-maturity are reported at amortized cost. A periodic review and evaluation of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios is conducted to determine if the estimated fair value of any security has declined below its carrying value and whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. If such impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the security is written down to a new cost basis and the resulting loss is charged against earnings. The estimated fair values of our securities are obtained from an independent nationally recognized pricing service (see &#8220;Item.7 Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Securities Valuation and Impairment&#8221;) for further discussion. At December 31, 2015 , our investment portfolio consisted primarily of mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by GSEs and to a lesser extent private label mortgage-backed securities, mutual funds and corporate debt securities. The market for these securities primarily consists of other financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, and mutual funds. 

&#160; 

We purchase mortgage-backed securities insured or guaranteed primarily by the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), or the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), and to a lesser extent, securities issued by private companies (private label). We invest in mortgage-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk as a result of the guarantees provided by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae as well as to provide us liquidity to fund loan originations and deposit outflows. In September 2008, the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae into conservatorship. The U.S. Treasury Department has established financing agreements to ensure that Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae meet their obligations to holders of mortgage-backed securities that they have issued or guaranteed. 

&#160; 

Mortgage-backed securities are securities sold in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as &#8220;pass-through&#8221; certificates because the principal and interest of the underlying loans is &#8220;passed through&#8221; pro rata to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees, in proportion to an investor&#8217;s ownership in the entire pool. The issuers of such securities, pool mortgages and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors. The interest rate on the security is lower than the interest rates on the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. Ginnie Mae, a U.S. Government agency, and GSEs, 

such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, may guarantee the payments, or guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest to investors. 

&#160; 

Mortgage-backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans since there is a more active market for such securities. In addition, mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize our specific liabilities and obligations. Investments in mortgage-backed securities issued or guaranteed by GSEs involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on our securities. We periodically review current prepayment speeds to determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause adjustment of amortization or accretion. 

REMICs are a type of mortgage-backed security issued by special-purpose entities that aggregate pools of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and create different classes of securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules, as well as a residual interest, with each class possessing different risk characteristics. The cash flows from the underlying collateral are generally divided into &#8220;tranches&#8221; or classes that have descending priorities with respect to the distribution of principal and interest cash flows. 

&#160; 

The timely payment of principal and interest on these REMICs is generally supported (credit enhanced) in varying degrees by either insurance issued by a financial guarantee insurer, letters of credit, over collateralization, or subordination techniques. Substantially all of these securities are rated &#8220;AAA&#8221; by Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s or Moody&#8217;s at the time of purchase. Privately issued REMICs and pass-throughs can be subject to certain credit-related risks normally not associated with U.S. Government agency and GSE mortgage-backed securities. The loss protection generally provided by the various forms of credit enhancements is limited, and losses in excess of certain levels are not protected. Furthermore, the credit enhancement itself is subject to the creditworthiness of the credit enhancer. Thus, in the event a credit enhancer does not fulfill its obligations, the holder could be subject to risk of loss similar to a purchaser of a whole loan pool. Management believes that the credit enhancements are adequate to protect us from material losses on our private label mortgage-backed securities investments. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , our corporate bond portfolio consisted of investment-grade securities with remaining maturities generally shorter than three years. Our investment policy provides that we may invest up to 15% of our tier-one risk-based capital in corporate bonds from individual issuers which, at the time of purchase, are within the investment-grade ratings from Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s, Moody&#8217;s or Fitch. The maturity of these bonds may not exceed 10 years, and there is no aggregate limit for this security type. Corporate bonds from individual issuers not rated investment grade at the time of purchase, are limited to the lesser of 1% of our total assets or 15% of our tier-one risk-based capital, and must have a maturity of less than one year. Aggregate holdings of this security type cannot exceed 5% of our total assets. Additionally, at the time of purchase, management performs due diligence to conclude that the security meets the regulatory standard for investment-grade. Bonds that subsequently experience a decline in credit rating below investment grade are monitored at least quarterly. 

&#160; 

The following table sets forth the amortized cost and estimated fair value of our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios (excluding FHLB of New York common stock) at the dates indicated. As of December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , we also had a trading portfolio with a market value of $6.7 million , $6.4 million and $6.0 million, respectively, consisting of mutual funds quoted in actively traded markets. These securities are utilized to fund non-qualified deferred compensation obligations.

Sources of Funds 

&#160; 

General. &#32;Deposits traditionally have been our primary source of funds for our securities and lending activities. We also borrow from the FHLB of New York and other financial institutions to supplement cash flow needs, to manage the maturities of liabilities for interest rate and investment risk management purposes, and to manage our cost of funds. Our additional sources of funds are the proceeds of loan sales, scheduled loan and investment payments, maturing investments, loan prepayments, brokered deposits, and retained income on other earning assets. 

&#160; 

Deposits. &#32;We accept deposits primarily from the areas in which our offices are located. We rely on our convenient locations, customer service, and competitive products and pricing to attract and retain deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts to businesses and consumers with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of transaction accounts (NOW and non-interest bearing checking accounts), savings accounts (money market, passbook, and statement savings), and certificates of deposit, including individual retirement accounts. We accept brokered deposits when it is deemed cost effective. At December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we had brokered deposits totaling $157.1 million &#32;and $40.9 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

Interest rates offered generally are established weekly, while maturity terms, service fees, and withdrawal penalties are reviewed on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies, market interest rates, and liquidity requirements. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , we had a total of $499.9 million &#32;in certificates of deposit, of which $222.4 million &#32;had remaining maturities of one year or less. 

The following table sets forth the distribution of our average total deposit accounts, by account type, for the periods indicated:

&#160; 

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Northfield Bank is a federally chartered savings bank that is regulated, examined, and supervised by the OCC and the FDIC. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC&#8217;s deposit insurance fund and depositors, and not for the protection of security holders. Under this system of federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market interest rates. Northfield Bank also is regulated to a lesser extent by the FRB, governing reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters, including payments of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock. The OCC examines Northfield Bank and prepares reports for the consideration of its board of directors on any operating deficiencies. Northfield Bank&#8217;s relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of Northfield Bank&#8217;s loan documents. Northfield Bank is also a member of and owns stock in the FHLB of New York, which is one of the twelve regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. 

&#160; 

As a savings and loan holding company, Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB. It is required to file certain reports with and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the FRB. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 

&#160; 

Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the FDIC, the OCC, the FRB, or Congress, could have a material adverse effect on Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and Northfield Bank and their operations. 

Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to Northfield Bank and Northfield Bancorp, Inc. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Northfield Bank and Northfield Bancorp, Inc. 

&#160; 

Business Activities 

&#160; 

A federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act, as amended, and the regulations of the OCC. Under these laws and regulations, Northfield Bank may originate mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business loans, and consumer loans, and it may invest in certain types of debt securities and certain other assets. Certain types of lending, such as commercial and consumer loans, are subject to aggregate limits calculated as a specified percentage of Northfield Bank&#8217;s capital or assets. Northfield Bank also may establish subsidiaries that may engage in a variety of activities, including some that are not otherwise permissible for Northfield Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. 

&#160; 

Loans-to-One-Borrower 

&#160; 

We generally may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of Northfield Bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which is defined to include certain financial instruments and bullion, but generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2015 , we were in compliance with our loans-to-one-borrower limitations. 

&#160; 

Qualified Thrift Lender Test 

&#160; 

Northfield Bank is required to satisfy a qualified thrift lender (QTL) test, under which we either must qualify as a &#8220;domestic building and loan&#8221; association as defined by the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65% of our &#8220;portfolio assets&#8221; in &#8220;qualified thrift investments.&#8221; &#8220;Qualified thrift investments&#8221; consist primarily of residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed and related securities. &#8220;Portfolio assets&#8221; generally mean total assets less specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets and the value of property used to conduct business. A savings institution that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test also subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. As of December 31, 2015 , we maintained 82.2% of our portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore, we met the QTL test. 

&#160; 

Standards for Safety and Soundness 

&#160; 

Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe for insured depository institutions under its jurisdiction standards relating to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, employee compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to submit or implement an acceptable plan, the appropriate federal banking agency may issue an enforceable order requiring correction of the deficiencies. 

&#160; 

Capital Requirements 

&#160; 

Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015, and are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders&#8217; equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. In assessing an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions when deemed necessary. 

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increases each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

&#160; 

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action 

Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulators take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. OCC regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. Under the amended regulations, an institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 

&#160; 

The regulations provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings institution receives notice that it is &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Any holding company for the savings institution required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5.0% of the savings institution&#8217;s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Various restrictions, including as on growth and capital distributions, also apply to &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; institutions. If an &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; institution fails to submit an acceptable capital plan, it is treated as &#8220;significantly undercapitalized.&#8221; &#8220;Significantly undercapitalized&#8221; institutions must comply with one or more additional restrictions including, but not limited to, an order by the OCC to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss officers or directors and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 

Capital Distribution &#160; 

Federal regulations restrict &#8220;capital distributions&#8221; by savings institutions. For purposes of the regulations, capital distributions generally include cash dividends and other transactions charged to the capital account of a savings institution. A federal savings institution must file an application with the OCC for approval of the capital distribution if: 

&#8226; 

the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceeds the sum of the institution&#8217;s net income for that year to date plus the institution&#8217;s retained net income for the preceding two years that is still available for dividend; 

&#8226; 

the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution; 

&#8226; 

the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or written regulatory condition; or 

&#8226; 

the institution is not eligible for expedited review of its filings (i.e., generally, institutions that do not have safety and soundness, compliance and Community Reinvestment Act ratings in the top two categories or fail a capital requirement). 

&#160; 

A savings institution that is a subsidiary of a holding company, which is the case with Northfield Bank, must file a notice with the FRB at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution and receive FRB non-objection to the payment of the dividend. 

&#160; 

Applications or notices may be denied if the institution will be undercapitalized after the proposed dividend raises safety and soundness concerns or the proposed dividend would violate a law, regulation enforcement order, or regulatory condition. 

&#160; 

In the event that a savings institution&#8217;s capital falls below its regulatory requirements or it is notified by the regulatory agency that it is in need of more than normal supervision, its ability to make capital distributions would be restricted. In addition, any proposed capital distribution could be prohibited if the regulatory agency determines that the distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. 

Transactions with Related Parties 

A savings institution&#8217;s authority to engage in transactions with related parties or &#8220;affiliates&#8221; is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, FRB Regulation W. The term &#8220;affiliate&#8221; generally means any company that controls or is under common control with an institution, including Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and its non-savings institution subsidiaries (although certain subsidiaries of the institution itself are not considered affiliates). Applicable law limits the aggregate amount of &#8220;covered&#8221; transactions with any individual affiliate, including loans to the affiliate, to 10.0% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20.0% of the savings institution&#8217;s capital and surplus. Certain covered transactions with affiliates, such as loans to or guarantees issued on behalf of affiliates, are required to be secured by specified amounts of collateral. Purchasing low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Regulation W also provides that transactions with affiliates, including covered transactions, must be on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited by law from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. 

Authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% or greater shareholders (insiders), as well as entities controlled by insiders, is governed by Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, FRB Regulation O. Among other things, loans to insiders must be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for bank-wide lending programs that do not discriminate in favor of insiders. Regulation O also places individual and aggregate limits on the amount of loans that may be made to insiders based, in part, on the institution&#8217;s capital position, and requires that certain prior board approval procedures be followed. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional restrictions on the types and amounts of loans that may be made. At December 31, 2015 , Northfield Bank was in compliance with these regulations. 

&#160; 

Enforcement 

&#160; 

The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions, including the authority to bring enforcement action against &#8220;institution-related parties,&#8221; including officers, directors, certain shareholders, and attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution, receivership, conservatorship or the termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance 

&#160; 

Northfield Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in Northfield Bank are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor by the FDIC. 

&#160; 

The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all insured depository institutions. Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations, with less risky institutions paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from two and one half to 45 basis points of each institution&#8217;s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC&#8217;s current system represents a change, required by the Dodd-Frank Act, from its prior practice of basing the assessment on an institution&#8217;s volume of deposits. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%. 

The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Northfield Bank. Future insurance assessments cannot be predicted. 

&#160; 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed in writing. Management of Northfield Bank does not know of any practice, condition, or violation that may lead to termination of the Company's deposit insurance. 

In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation is authorized to impose and collect, through the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the Financing Corporation are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, the annualized Financing Corporation assessment was equal to 0.60 basis points of total quarterly average assets less quarterly average tangible capital. 

&#160; 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 

&#160; 

Northfield Bank is a member of the FHLB of New York, and therefore is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the FHLB are required to acquire and hold a specified amount of shares of FHLB capital stock. Northfield Bank was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2015. 

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws 

&#160; 

Savings institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. An institution&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on certain activities such as branching and acquisitions. Northfield Bank received a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent examination. 

&#160; 

Other Regulations 

&#160; 

Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Northfield Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Northfield Bank&#8217;s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 

&#8226; 

Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#8226; 

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one-to-four family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services; 

&#8226; 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

&#8226; 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

&#8226; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 

&#8226; 

Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 

&#8226; 

Truth in Savings Act; and 

&#8226; 

Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 

&#160; 

The operations of Northfield Bank also are subject to the: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

&#8226; 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; 

&#8226; 

Check Clearing for the 21 st &#32;Century Act (also known as Check 21), which gives &#8220;substitute checks,&#8221; such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; 

&#8226; 

The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires banks and savings institutions to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement pre-existing compliance requirements that apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and 

&#8226; 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties and requires all financial institutions offering products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution&#8217;s privacy policy and allow such customers the opportunity to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. 

&#160; 

Holding Company Regulation 

&#160; 

Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is a unitary savings and loan holding company subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. The FRB has enforcement authority over Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and its non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, that authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to Northfield Bank. 

&#160; 

As a savings and loan holding company, Northfield Bancorp, Inc.'s activities are limited to those activities permissible by law for financial holding companies (if Northfield Bancorp elects financial holding company status and otherwise qualifies to be a financial holding company) or multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. Such activities include lending and other activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, insurance and underwriting equity securities. The Dodd-Frank Act added that any savings and loan holding company that engages in activities that are solely permissible for a financial holding company must meet the qualitative requirements for a bank holding company to be a financial holding company and conduct the activities in accordance with the requirements that would apply to a financial holding company&#8217;s conduct of the activity. Multiple savings and loan companies are authorized to engage in activities specified by FRB regulation, including activities permitted for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act. 

&#160; 

Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the FRB and from acquiring or retaining control of any depository not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the FRB must consider such things as the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on and the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. An acquisition by a savings and loan holding company of a savings institution in another state to be held as a separate subsidiary may not be approved unless it is a supervisory acquisition under Section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or the law of the state in which the target is located authorizes such acquisitions by out-of-state companies. 

&#160; 

Savings and loan holding companies have not historically been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. However, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the FRB to set for all depository institution holding companies minimum consolidated capital levels that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act as to savings and loan holding companies. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary depository institutions applied to savings and loan holding companies as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer is being phased in between 2016 and 2019. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. exceeded the FRB&#8217;s consolidated capital requirements as of December 31, 2015. 

The Dodd-Frank Act extended the &#8220;source of strength&#8221; doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The FRB has issued regulations implementing the &#8220;source of strength&#8221; policy that requires holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity, and other support in times of financial stress. 

The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company&#8217;s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company&#8217;s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company&#8217;s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also specifies that a holding company should advise FRB supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common or perpetual preferred stock when the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock such that the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction as of the end of a quarter in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Northfield Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 

&#160; 

Federal Securities Laws 

&#160; 

Northfield Bancorp, Inc.&#8217;s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

&#160; 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: (i) they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting; (ii) they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and (iii) they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and whether there have been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. 

&#160; 

Change in Control Regulations 

&#160; 

Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company, such as Northfield Bancorp, Inc., unless the FRB has been given 60 days prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution&#8217;s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power to direct, or directly or indirectly to exercise a controlling influence over, the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a savings and loan holding company&#8217;s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as is the case with Northfield Bancorp, Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

&#160; 

In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a savings and loan holding company without the prior approval of the FRB. Any company that acquires such control becomes a &#8220;savings and loan holding company&#8221; subject to registration, examination, and regulation by the FRB. 

&#160; 

TAXATION 

Federal Taxation 

&#160; 

General . Northfield Bank and Northfield Bancorp, Inc. are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Northfield Bancorp, Inc. or Northfield Bank. 

&#160; 

Northfield Bancorp, Inc.'s consolidated federal tax returns are not currently under audit. 

&#160; 

Method of Accounting . For federal income tax purposes, Northfield Bancorp, Inc. currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns. 

&#160; 

Bad Debt Reserves . &#32; &#160; Historically, Northfield Bank was subject to special provisions in the tax law applicable to qualifying savings banks regarding allowable tax bad debt deductions and related reserves. Tax law changes were enacted in 1996 that eliminated the ability of savings banks to use the percentage of taxable income method for computing tax bad debt reserves for tax years after 1995, and required recapture into taxable income over a six-year period of all bad debt reserves accumulated after a savings bank&#8217;s last tax year beginning before January 1, 1988. Northfield Bank recaptured its post December 31, 1987, bad-debt reserve balance over the six-year period ended December 31, 2004. 

&#160; 

Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is required to use the specific charge-off method to account for tax bad debt deductions. 

&#160; 

Taxable Distributions and Recapture . &#32; &#160; Prior to 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if Northfield Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests or made certain distributions. Tax law changes in 1996 eliminated thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 tax bad debt reserves remain subject to recapture if Northfield Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its common stock, pays dividends in excess of earnings and profits, or fails to qualify as a &#8220;bank&#8221; for tax purposes. At December 31, 2015 , the total federal pre-base year bad debt reserve of Northfield Bank was approximately $5.9 million. 

Alternative Minimum Tax . The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, less any available exemption. The alternative minimum tax is imposed to the extent it exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Northfield Bancorp, Inc.&#8217;s consolidated group has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover. 

&#160; 

Net Operating Loss Carryovers . A financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2015 , Northfield Bancorp, Inc.&#8217;s consolidated group had no net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. 

&#160; 

Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction . Northfield Bancorp, Inc. may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from Northfield Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary by filing consolidated tax returns. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 80% when the corporation receiving the dividend owns at least 20% of the stock of the distributing corporation. The dividends-received deduction is 70% when the corporation receiving the dividend owns less than 20% of the distributing corporation. 

&#160; 

State Taxation 

&#160; 

On March 31, 2014, New York State (NYS) enacted several reforms (the Tax Reform Package) to its tax structure, including changes to the franchise, sales, estate, and personal income taxes. These changes were effective on January 1, 2015. The Tax Reform Package is intended to simplify the existing corporate tax code for NYS businesses while remaining relatively neutral in relation to corporate tax receipts. 

Under the Tax Reform Package, the NYS corporate income tax rate drops, effective January 1, 2016, from 7.10% to 6.50%. Effective January 1, 2015, the metropolitan commuter transportation district surcharge (MTA Tax) increases from 17.0% to 25.6% of the surcharge tax base. The MTA Tax rate for years beginning on or after January 1, 2016 will be adjusted based on future Metropolitan Transit Authority budget projections. 

Some of the most significant elements of the Tax Reform Package include the merger of the bank tax into the general corporate franchise tax, expanded application of economic nexus, adoption of water&#8217;s-edge unitary reporting, and apportionment of source income solely by reference to customer location. 

Merger of the Bank Tax into the Corporate Franchise Tax. NYS has historically imposed a franchise tax on general business corporations, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Article 9-A Corporate Franchise Tax,&#8221; and a separate franchise tax on 

banking corporations, commonly referred to as the &#8220;Article 32 Bank Tax.&#8221; Under these statutes, NYS financial service companies and banks are taxed under different regimes, even though the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which became federal law in 1999, changed the federal regulatory system to permit the cross-ownership of finance and banking firms. 

The Tax Reform Package repeals the Article 32 Bank Tax, merging it into the Article 9-A Corporate Franchise Tax. It also makes several modifications to the Article 9-A Corporate Franchise Tax to accommodate the merger, most notably providing a choice between two potential financial institution tax deductions: 1) a deduction equal to 32% of modified NYS taxable income available to all thrifts and banks with assets that do not exceed $8 billion; and 2) a deduction based upon 50% of the net interest income received from loans secured by real estate located in NYS or business loans made to NYS borrowers with a principal amount of less than $5 million. Alternatively, for financial institutions with assets that do not exceed $8 billion that owned a captive real estate investment trust (REIT) as of April 1, 2014, the Tax Reform Package preserves the ability to exclude a percentage of dividends received from the REIT in determining NYS taxable income and increases this exclusion from the current level of 60% to 160% for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015. Financial institutions that continue to maintain these grandfathered REITs are prohibited from claiming either of the two financial institution tax deductions described above. 

Consequently, under the revised Article 9-A Corporate Franchise Tax structure, for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, the Bank will be required to claim the 160% exclusion for dividends received from its captive REIT subsidiary for any year the REIT remains in existence. If the REIT is liquidated, then the Bank will be entitled to choose on an annual basis between: 1) the 32% of modified taxable income deduction; or 2) the deduction based upon 50% of the net interest income received from NYS real estate loans and small commercial loans to NYS customers. 

Expansion of the Application of Economic Nexus. The Tax Reform Package requires that all companies availing themselves of the NYS market, referred to as having an &#8220;economic nexus with New York,&#8221; will be subject to NYS tax, regardless of whether they have any other connection with NYS. A corporation could thus become a NYS taxpayer without a physical presence in NYS. 

Adoption of a Full Water&#8217;s-Edge Unitary Combined Filing. The Tax Reform Package requires all firms meeting an ownership test of 50% or more be deemed a unitary business and required to file a combined tax return. Substantial intercompany transactions are eliminated, and a domestic corporation without any assets or customers in NYS, but engaged in a unitary business with a related New York taxpayer, would become part of the NYS unitary group. 

Source Income Solely by Reference to the Location of the Customer. The Tax Reform Package requires business income to be apportioned to and taxed by NYS using a single receipts factor based on the customer&#8217;s location. These provisions also contain favorable apportionment rules for asset-backed securities that will be beneficial to the Bank. 

&#160; 

Northfield Bank reports income on a calendar year basis to New York City (NYC). On April 13, 2015, NYC enacted corporate tax reforms, which are effective retroactive for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015. NYC generally conforms its tax law to NYS tax law and adopted conforming Tax Reform Package provisions similar to those described above for NYS. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, the NYC income tax rate applied to the Company apportioned NYC taxable income is 8.85%. 

&#160; 

Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and Northfield Bank file New Jersey Corporation Business Tax returns on a calendar year basis. Generally, the income derived from New Jersey sources is subject to New Jersey tax. Northfield Bancorp, Inc. and Northfield Bank pay the greater of the corporate business tax at 9% of taxable income or the minimum tax of $1,200 per entity. 

&#160; 

Our NYS and NYC tax returns are currently under audit for tax years 2010 through 2012. 

As a Delaware business corporation, Northfield Bancorp, Inc. is required to file an annual report with and pay franchise taxes to the state of Delaware. 

&#160;
