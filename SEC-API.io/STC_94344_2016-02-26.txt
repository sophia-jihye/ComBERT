 Item 1. Business 

We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1970. We and our predecessors have been engaged in the title business since 1893. 

Stewart Information Services Corporation (NYSE-STC) is a global real estate services company, offering products and services through our direct operations, network of Stewart Trusted Providers&#8482; and family of companies. From residential and commercial title insurance and closing and settlement services to specialized offerings for the mortgage industry, we offer the comprehensive service, deep expertise and solutions our customers need for any real estate transaction. At Stewart, we believe in building strong relationships - and these partnerships are the cornerstone of every closing, every transaction and every deal. 

Our international division delivers products and services protecting and promoting private land ownership worldwide. Currently, our primary international operations are in Canada, the United Kingdom, Central Europe, Latin America and Australia. 

We report our business in three segments: title insurance and related services, mortgage services and corporate. The financial information related to these segments is discussed in Item 7 &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements. 

Title Insurance Services 

Title insurance and related services (title) include the functions of searching, examining, closing and insuring the condition of the title to real property. The title segment also includes certain ancillary services provided for Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 tax-deferred exchanges and home and personal insurance services. 

Examination and closing . The purpose of a title examination is to ascertain the ownership of the property being transferred, debts that are owed on it and the scope of the title policy coverage. This involves searching for and examining documents such as deeds, mortgages, wills, divorce decrees, court judgments, liens, paving assessments and tax records. 

At the closing or &#8220;settlement&#8221; of a sale transaction, the seller executes and delivers a deed to the new owner. The buyer typically signs new mortgage documents. Closing funds are then disbursed to the seller, the prior lender, real estate brokers, the title company and others. The documents are then recorded in the public records. A title insurance policy is generally issued to both the new lender and the owner. 

Title insurance policies . Lenders in the United States generally require title insurance as a condition to making a loan on real estate, including securitized lending. This is to assure lenders of the priority of their lien position. The purchasers of the property want insurance to protect against claims that may arise against the title to the property. The face amount of the policy is normally the purchase price or the amount of the related loan. 

Title insurance is substantially different from other types of insurance. Fire, auto, health and life insurance protect against future losses and events. In contrast, title insurance insures against losses from past events and seeks to protect the public by eliminating covered risks through the examination and settlement process. In essence, a title insurance policy provides a warranty to the policyholder that the title to the property is free from defects that might impair ownership rights. Most other forms of insurance provide protection for a limited period of time and, hence the policy must be periodically renewed. Title insurance, however, is issued for a one-time premium and the policy provides protection for as long as the owner owns the property or has liability in connection with the property. Also, a title insurance policy does not have a finite contract term, whereas most other lines of insurance have a definite beginning and ending date for coverage. Although a title insurance policy provides protection as long as the owner owns the property being covered, the title insurance company generally does not have information about which policies are still effective. Most other lines of insurance receive periodic premium payments and policy renewals thereby allowing the insurance company to know which policies are effective. 

Losses . Losses on policies occur when a title defect is not discovered during the examination and settlement process. Reasons for losses include forgeries, misrepresentations, unrecorded or undiscovered liens, the failure to pay off existing liens, mortgage lending fraud, mishandling or defalcation of settlement funds, issuance by title agencies of unauthorized coverage and defending policyholders when covered claims are filed against their interest in the property. 

Some claimants seek damages in excess of policy limits. Those claims are based on various legal theories. We vigorously defend against spurious claims and provide protection for covered claims up to policy limits. We have from time-to-time incurred losses in excess of policy limits. 

Experience shows that most policy claims and claim payments are made in the first six years after the policy has been issued, although claims can also be incurred and paid many years later. By their nature, claims are often complex, vary greatly in dollar amounts and are affected by economic and market conditions and the legal environment existing at the time claims are processed. 

Our liability for estimated title losses comprises both known claims and our estimate of claims that may be reported in the future. The amount of our loss reserve represents the aggregate future payments (net of recoveries) that we expect to incur on policy and escrow losses and in costs to settle claims. In accordance with industry practice, these amounts have not been discounted to their present values. 

Estimating future title loss payments is difficult due to the complex nature of title claims, the length of time over which claims are paid, the significantly varying dollar amounts of individual claims and other factors. Estimated provisions for current year policy losses are charged to income in the same year the related premium revenues are recognized. The amounts provided for policy losses are based on reported claims, historical loss payment experience, title industry averages and the current legal and economic environment. Actual loss payment experience relating to policies issued in previous years, including the impact of large losses, is the primary reason for increases or decreases in our estimated loss provision. 

Amounts shown as our estimated liability for future loss payments are continually reviewed by us for reasonableness and adjusted as appropriate. We have consistently followed the same basic method of estimating and recording our loss reserves for more than 10 years. As part of our process, we also obtain input from third-party actuaries regarding our methodology and resulting reserve calculations. While we are responsible for determining our loss reserves, we utilize this actuarial input to assess the overall reasonableness of our reserve estimation. 

See &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates - Title Loss Reserves&#8221; for information on current year policy losses and balance sheet reserves. 

Factors affecting revenues . Title insurance revenues are closely related to the level of activity in the real estate markets we serve and the prices at which real estate sales are made. Real estate sales are directly affected by the availability and cost of money to finance purchases. Other factors include consumer confidence and demand by buyers. In periods of low interest rates, loan refinancing transactions are also an important contributor to revenues. 

These factors may override the seasonal nature of the title business. Generally, our first quarter is the least active and our second and third quarters are the most active in terms of title insurance revenues.

Customers . The primary sources of title insurance business are attorneys, builders, developers, home buyers and home sellers, lenders, mortgage brokers, and real estate brokers and agents. No one customer was responsible for as much as 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in any of the last three years. Titles insured include residential and commercial properties, undeveloped acreage, farms, ranches, wind and solar power installations, other energy-related projects and water rights. 

Service, location, financial strength, size and related factors affect customer acceptance. Increasing market share is accomplished primarily by providing superior service. The parties to a closing are concerned with personal schedules and the interest and other costs associated with any delays in the settlement. The rates charged to customers are regulated, to varying degrees, in most states. 

The financial strength and stability of the title underwriter are important factors in maintaining and increasing our business, particularly commercial business. We are rated as investment grade by the title industry&#8217;s leading rating companies. Our principal underwriter, Stewart Title Guaranty Company (Guaranty), is currently rated &#8220;A&#8221; by Demotech, Inc., "A-" by Fitch, "A-" by A. M. Best and "B+" by Kroll Bond Rating Agency. 

Market share . Title insurance statistics are compiled quarterly by the title industry&#8217;s national trade association. Based on 2015 unconsolidated statutory net premiums written through September 30, 2015, Guaranty is one of the leading title insurers in the United States. 

Our principal competitors are Fidelity National Financial, Inc. (which includes Fidelity National Title Insurance Company, Chicago Title Insurance Company and Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company), First American Financial Corporation (which includes First American Title Insurance Company) and Old Republic Title Insurance Group (which includes Old Republic National Title Insurance Company). We also compete with other independent title insurer companies, as well as abstractors, attorneys who issue title opinions and attorney-owned title insurance funds. A number of homebuilders, financial institutions, real estate brokers and others own or control title insurance agencies, some of which issue policies underwritten by Guaranty.

Regulations . Title insurance companies are subject to comprehensive state regulations covering premium rates, agency licensing, policy forms, trade practices, reserve requirements, investments and the transfer of funds between an insurer and its parent or its subsidiaries and any similar related party transactions. Kickbacks and similar practices are prohibited by most state and federal laws. (See Item 1A, Risk Factors - Our Insurance Subsidiaries Must Comply With Extensive Government Regulations.) 

Mortgage Services 

Our mortgage services segment includes a diverse set of complementary products and services provided to enhance the mortgage and real estate markets. These services are provided principally through Stewart Lender Services (SLS) and PropertyInfo&#174; Corporation's Stewart Government Services. 

SLS offers services for the entire lifecycle of the mortgage process including mortgage origination support, servicing support, default and REO services and loan review and audit services. These services include a full suite of valuation, title and closing services, post-closing outsourcing, loan review and audit, component servicing, portfolio reviews and audits, loan file reviews, loan quality control and servicer oversight to residential mortgage lenders, servicers and investors. 

Stewart Government Services provides automation of county recorder offices and other county services. 

Factors affecting revenues . As in the title segment, mortgage services revenues, particularly those generated by lender services, are closely related to the level of activity in the real estate market, including the volume of originations (new or refinancing), foreclosures or other distressed property activity. Revenues related to some services are generated on a project basis or through longer term contracts. 

Companies that compete with our mortgage services businesses vary across a wide range of industries. In the mortgage-related products and services area, competitors include the major title insurance underwriters mentioned under &#8220;Title Insurance Services - Market share&#8221; as well as other real estate technology and business process outsourcing providers. In some cases, the competitor may be the customer itself. For example, certain services offered by SLS can be, or historically have been, performed by internal departments of large mortgage lenders. 

Customers . Customers for our mortgage services products and services primarily include mortgage lenders and servicers, mortgage brokers, mortgage investors and government entities. 

Many of the services and products offered by our mortgage services segment are used by professionals and intermediaries who have been retained to assist consumers with the sale, purchase, mortgage, transfer, recording and servicing of real estate-related transactions. To that end, timely, accurate and compliant services are critical to our customers since these factors directly affect the service they provide to their customers. Financial strength, scale, compliance activities, marketplace presence and reputation as a reliable, compliant solution are important factors in attracting new business. 

Corporate 

The corporate segment consists of the expenses of the parent holding company, certain other corporate overhead expenses, and the costs of our centralized support operations not otherwise allocated to the the operating segments. We periodically review our allocation models and may make adjustments to the amounts charged to the business units as deemed appropriate. Underwriter investment income is recorded in the corporate segment, as are certain realized gains or losses. 

General 

Investment Policies . Our investment portfolios reside in two domestic and two international regulated subsidiary underwriters. These underwriters maintain investments in accordance with certain statutory requirements for the funding of statutory premium reserves and deposits, or, in the case of our international operations, for the maintenance of certain capital ratios required by regulators. The activities of the portfolios are overseen by investment committees comprised of certain senior executives. Their oversight includes such activities as policy setting, determining appropriate asset classes with different and distinct risk/return profiles so as to prudently diversify the portfolio, and to approve all service vendors (managers and custodians). Our investment policies are designed to comply with regulatory requirements as applicable law imposes certain restrictions upon the types and amounts of investments that may be made by the regulated insurance subsidiaries. 

Our investment policies further provide that investments are to be managed with a view to balancing profitability, liquidity, and risk (interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk) while mindful of impacting earnings per share and income taxes. 

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 95% of our debt and equity investment portfolios together consisted of fixed income securities. As of that date, approximately 92% of the fixed income investments are held in securities that are A-rated or higher, and substantially all of the fixed income portfolios are rated investment grade or higher. Percentages are based on the market value of the securities. Credit ratings are based on Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Rating Services and Moody&#8217;s Investor Services, Inc. published ratings. If a security was rated differently by both ratings agencies, the lower of the two ratings was selected. 

In addition to our debt and equity investment securities portfolios, we maintain certain money-market and other short-term investments. 

Trademarks . We have developed and acquired numerous automated products and processes that are crucial to both our title and mortgage services segments. These systems automate most facets of the real estate transaction. Among these trademarked products and processes are AIM+&#8482;, AgencySecure &#174; , TitleWorkPlace &#174; , LenderExpressQuote&#8482;, Stewart Online&#8482;, Property Profiles&#8482;, Stewart Select&#8482;, PropertyInfo &#174; , SureClose &#174; , TitleSearch &#174; &#32;and Virtual Underwriter &#174; . We consider these trademarks, which are perpetual in duration, to be important to our business. 

Employees . As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 6,900 people. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

Available information . We file annual, quarterly and other reports and information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).
