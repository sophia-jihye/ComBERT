 Item 1. Business

&#160;

General

&#160;

NorthWest Indiana Bancorp, an Indiana corporation (the &#8220;Bancorp&#8221;), was incorporated on January 31, 1994, and is the holding company for Peoples Bank SB, an Indiana savings bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bancorp. The Bancorp has no other business activity other than being the holding company for the Bank and the Bank's wholly owned subsidiaries.

&#160;

The Bank is primarily engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and the origination of loans, mostly upon the security of single family residences and commercial real estate, as well as, construction loans and various types of consumer loans, commercial business loans and municipal loans, within its primary market area of Lake and Porter Counties, in northwest Indiana. In addition, the Bancorp's Wealth Management Group provides estate and retirement planning, guardianships, land trusts, profit sharing and 401(k) retirement plans, IRA and Keogh accounts, investment agency accounts, and serves as the personal representative of estates and acts as trustee for revocable and irrevocable trusts.

&#160;

The Bank&#8217;s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;), which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;), an agency of the federal government. As the holding company for the Bank, the Bancorp is subject to comprehensive examination, supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;FRB&#8221;), while the Bank is subject to comprehensive examination, supervision and regulation by both the FDIC and the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (&#8220;DFI&#8221;). The Bank is also subject to regulation by the FRB governing reserves required to be maintained against certain deposits and other matters. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (&#8220;FHLB&#8221;) of Indianapolis, which is one of the twelve regional banks comprising the system of Federal Home Loan Banks.

&#160;

The Bancorp maintains its corporate office at 9204 Columbia Avenue, Munster, Indiana, from which it oversees the operation of its sixteen branch locations. For further information, see &#8220;Properties.&#8221;

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

Regulatory Environment. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#34;Dodd-Frank Act&#34;) contains comprehensive provisions governing the practices and oversight of financial institutions and other participants in the financial markets. The Dodd-Frank Act regulates, among other institutions, community banks, thrifts, and small bank and thrift holding companies, such as the Bancorp, through a variety of measures, including increased capital requirements and enhanced supervisory authority. The federal banking regulators have implemented and continue to propose new regulations and supervisory guidance under the Dodd-Frank Act and otherwise. The impact of the evolving regulatory environment on the Bancorp&#8217;s business and operations depends upon a number of factors, including supervisory priorities and actions, the actions of our competitors and other financial institutions, and the behavior of consumers. Regulatory developments could negatively impact our business strategies, require us to limit or change our business practices, limit our product offerings, invest more management time and resources in compliance efforts, or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities and obtain related required regulatory approvals. Regulatory developments also could impact our strategies, the value of our assets, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, the additional expense, time, and resources needed to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may impact our business and results of operations.

&#160;

Regulatory Capital Rules. In 2013, the Federal Reserve approved final rules that substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bancorp and the Bank. The FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) subsequently approved these rules. The final rules implement the &#8220;Basel III&#8221; regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.

&#160;

The rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which were instituted in 2015 and will continue to be phased in through 2019, and refine the definition of what constitutes &#8220;capital&#8221; for purposes of calculating those ratios. The minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Bancorp and the Bank under the final rules are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The final rules also establish a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital. The capital conservation buffer was instituted on January 1, 2016 and will be phased-in over four years, as follows: the maximum buffer will be 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. This will result in the following minimum ratios beginning in 2019: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Under the final rules, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.

&#160;

The final rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with Basel III regarding the various components of Tier 1 capital, including common equity, unrealized gains and losses, as well as certain instruments that will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, some of which will be phased out over time. However, the final rules provide that small depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009 (which includes the Bancorp) will be able to permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature.

&#160;

The final rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including the Bank, if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. These revisions took effect on January 1, 2015. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as &#8220;well capitalized:&#8221; (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 10%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%.

&#160;

The final rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which were instituted effective as of January 1, 2015. The standardized approach final rule utilizes an increased number of credit risk exposure categories and risk weights, and also addresses: (i) an alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act; (ii) revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation; (iii) rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; (iv) revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions; and (v) disclosure requirements for top-tier banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the &#8220;advance approach rules&#8221; that apply to banks with greater than $250 billion in consolidated assets. Based on our current capital composition and levels, we believe we are in compliance with the requirements as set forth in the final rules.

&#160;

Acquisition Activity. On March 20, 2015, the Bancorp announced that the Bank signed a definitive agreement to acquire Liberty Savings Bank, FSB (&#8220;Liberty&#8221;), a federally chartered mutual savings association based in Whiting, Indiana, with three branch offices in Lake County Indiana. On July 1, 2015, the Bank successfully completed the acquisition, merging Liberty with and into the Bank immediately following Liberty&#8217;s voluntary supervisory conversion to stock form. The Bank did not issue or pay any shares, cash, or other consideration in the merger.

Lending Activities

&#160;

General. The Bancorp&#8217;s product offerings include residential mortgage loans, construction loans, commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, commercial business loans and loans to municipalities. The Bancorp&#8217;s lending strategy stresses quality growth, product diversification, and competitive and profitable pricing. While lending efforts include both fixed and adjustable rate products, the focus has been on products with adjustable rates and/or shorter terms to maturity. It is management&#8217;s goal that all programs are marketed effectively to our primary market area.

&#160;

The Bancorp is primarily a portfolio lender. Mortgage banking activities are limited to the sale of fixed rate mortgage loans with contractual maturities generally exceeding fifteen years and greater. These loans are sold, on a case-by-case basis, in the secondary market as part of the Bancorp&#8217;s efforts to manage interest rate risk. All loan sales are made to Freddie Mac or to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis. All loans held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or market value.

&#160;

Under Indiana Law, an Indiana stock savings bank generally may not make any loan to a borrower or its related entities if the total of all such loans by the savings bank exceeds 15% of its unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus (plus up to an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, in the case of loans fully collateralized by readily marketable collateral); provided, however, that certain specified types of loans are exempted from these limitations or subject to different limitations. The maximum amount that the Bank could have loaned to one borrower and the borrower&#8217;s related entities at December 31, 2015, under the 15% of capital and surplus limitation was approximately $12,450,000. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had no loans that exceeded the regulatory limitations.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, there were no concentrations of loans in any type of industry that exceeded 10% of total loans that were not otherwise disclosed as a loan category.

&#160; 

Loan Portfolio. The following table sets forth selected data relating to the composition of the Bancorp&#8217;s loan portfolio by type of loan and type of collateral at the end of each of the last five years. The amounts are stated in thousands (000&#8217;s).

&#160;

Loan Maturity Schedule. The following table sets forth certain information at December 31, 2015 regarding the dollar amount of loans in the Bancorp&#8217;s portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity. Demand loans, loans having no schedule of repayments and no stated maturity, and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less. Contractual principal repayments of loans do not necessarily reflect the actual term of the loan portfolio. The average life of mortgage loans is substantially less than their contractual terms because of loan prepayments and because of enforcement of due-on-sale clauses, which give the Bancorp the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event, among other things, that the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage. The amounts are stated in thousands (000&#8217;s).

The following table sets forth the dollar amount of all loans due after one year from December 31, 2015, which have predetermined interest rates or have floating or adjustable interest rates. The amounts are stated in thousands (000&#8217;s).

Lending Area. The primary lending area of the Bancorp encompasses all of Lake and Porter Counties in northwest Indiana, where a majority of loan activity is concentrated. To a lesser extent, the Bancorp also has lending activity in LaPorte, Newton and Jasper counties in Indiana, and Lake, Cook and Will counties in Illinois. The communities of Munster, Crown Point, Dyer, St. John, Merrillville, Schererville, and Cedar Lake have experienced consistent growth and, therefore, have provided the greatest lending opportunities.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Page 6 of 85 

&#160;

&#160;

Loan Origination Fees. All loan origination and commitment fees, as well as incremental direct loan origination costs, are deferred and amortized into income as yield adjustments over the contractual lives of the related loans.

&#160;

Loan Origination Procedure. The primary sources for loan originations are referrals from commercial customers, real estate brokers and builders, solicitations by the Bancorp&#8217;s lending and retail staff, and advertising of loan programs and rates. The Bancorp employs no staff appraisers. All appraisals are performed by fee appraisers that have been approved by the Board of Directors and who meet all federal guidelines and state licensing and certification requirements.

&#160;

Designated officers have authorities, established by the Board of Directors, to approve loans. Loans up to $2,500,000 are approved by the loan officers&#8217; loan committee. Loans from $2,500,000 to $4,000,000 are approved by the senior officers&#8217; loan committee. All loans in excess of $4,000,000, up to the legal lending limit of the Bank, must be approved by the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors or its Executive Committee. (All members of the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors and Executive Committee are also members of the Bancorp&#8217;s Board of Directors and Executive Committee, respectively.) The maximum in-house legal lending limit as set by the Board of Directors is $6,000,000. Requests that exceed this amount will be considered on a case-by-case basis, after taking into consideration the legal lending limit, by specific Board action. Peoples Bank will not extend credit to any of its executive officers, directors, or principal shareholders or to any related interest of that person, except in compliance with the insider lending restrictions of Regulation O under the Federal Reserve Act and in an amount that, when aggregated with all other extensions of credit to that person, exceeds $500,000 unless: (1) the extension of credit has been approved in advance by a majority of the entire Board of Directors of the Bank, and (2) the interested party has abstained from participating directly or indirectly in the voting.

&#160;

All loans secured by personal property must be covered by insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the full amount of the loan. All loans secured by real estate must be covered by insurance in an amount sufficient to cover the full amount of the loan or restore the property to its original state. First mortgage loans must be covered by a lender&#8217;s title insurance policy in the amount of the loan.

&#160;

The Current Lending Programs

&#160;

Residential Mortgage Loans. The primary lending activity of the Bancorp has been the granting of conventional mortgage loans to enable borrowers to purchase existing homes, refinance existing homes, or construct new homes. Conventional loans are made up to a maximum of 97% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is less. For loans made in excess of 80% of value, private mortgage insurance is generally required in an amount sufficient to reduce the Bancorp&#8217;s exposure to 80% or less of the appraised value of the property. Loans insured by private mortgage insurance companies can be made for up to 97% of value. During 2015, 77% of mortgage loans closed were conventional loans with borrowers having 20% or more equity in the property. This type of loan does not require private mortgage insurance because of the borrower&#8217;s level of equity investment.

&#160;

Fixed-rate loans currently originated generally conform to Freddie Mac guidelines for loans purchased under the one-to-four family program. Loan interest rates are determined based on secondary market yield requirements and local market conditions. Fixed rate mortgage loans with contractual maturities generally exceeding fifteen years and greater may be sold and/or classified as held for sale to control exposure to interest rate risk.

&#160;

The 15-year mortgage loan program has gained wide acceptance in the Bancorp&#8217;s primary market area. As a result of the shortened maturity of these loans, this product has been priced below the comparable 20 and 30 year loan offerings. Mortgage applicants for 15 year loans tend to have a larger than normal down payment; this, coupled with the larger principal and interest payment amount, has caused the 15 year mortgage loan portfolio to consist, to a significant extent, of second time home buyers whose underwriting qualifications tend to be above average.

The Bancorp&#8217;s Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans (&#8220;ARMs&#8221;) include offerings that reprice annually or are &#8220;Mini-Fixed.&#8221; The &#8220;Mini-Fixed&#8221; mortgage reprices annually after a one, three, five, seven or ten year period. ARM originations totaled $7.1 million for 2015 and $4.7 million for 2014. During 2015, ARMs represented 9.6% of total mortgage loan originations. The ability of the Bancorp to successfully market ARM&#8217;s depends upon loan demand, prevailing interest rates, volatility of interest rates, public acceptance of such loans and terms offered by competitors.

&#160;

Construction Loans. Construction loans on residential properties are made primarily to individuals and contractors who are under contract with individual purchasers. These loans are personally guaranteed by the borrower. The maximum loan-to-value ratio is 89% of either the current appraised value or the cost of construction, whichever is less. Residential construction loans are typically made for periods of six months to one year.

&#160;

Loans are also made for the construction of commercial properties. All such loans are made in accordance with well-defined underwriting standards. Generally if the loans are not owner occupied, these types of loans require proof of intent to lease and a confirmed end-loan takeout. In general, loans made do not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property. Commercial construction loans are typically made for periods not to exceed two years or date of occupancy, whichever is less.

&#160;

Commercial Real Estate Loans. Commercial real estate loans are typically made to a maximum of 80% of the appraised value. Such loans are generally made on an adjustable rate basis. These loans are typically made for terms of 15 to 20 years. Loans with an amortizing term exceeding 15 years normally have a balloon feature calling for a full repayment within seven to ten years from the date of the loan. The balloon feature affords the Bancorp the opportunity to restructure the loan if economic conditions so warrant. Commercial real estate loans include loans secured by commercial rental units, apartments, condominium developments, small shopping centers, owner occupied commercial/industrial properties, hospitality units and other retail and commercial developments.

&#160;

While commercial real estate lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than single-family residential lending due to the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and the effects of general economic conditions on real estate developers and managers, the Bancorp has endeavored to reduce this risk in several ways. In originating commercial real estate loans, the Bancorp considers the feasibility of the project, the financial strength of the borrowers and lessees, the managerial ability of the borrowers, the location of the project and the economic environment. Management evaluates the debt coverage ratio and analyzes the reliability of cash flows, as well as the quality of earnings. All such loans are made in accordance with well-defined underwriting standards and are generally supported by personal guarantees, which represent a secondary source of repayment.

&#160;

Loans for the construction of commercial properties are generally located within an area permitting physical inspection and regular review of business records. Projects financed outside of the Bancorp&#8217;s primary lending area generally involve borrowers and guarantors who are or were previous customers of the Bancorp or projects that are underwritten according to the Bank&#8217;s underwriting standards.

&#160;

Consumer Loans. The Bancorp offers consumer loans to individuals for personal, household or family purposes. Consumer loans are either secured by adequate collateral, or unsecured. Unsecured loans are based on the strength of the applicant&#8217;s financial condition. All borrowers must meet current underwriting standards. The consumer loan program includes both fixed and variable rate products. On a limited basis, the Bancorp purchases indirect dealer paper from various well-established businesses in its immediate banking area.

&#160;

Home Equity Line of Credit. The Bancorp offers a fixed and variable rate revolving line of credit secured by the equity in the borrower&#8217;s home. Both products offer an interest only option where the borrower pays interest only on the outstanding balance each month. Equity lines will typically require a second mortgage appraisal and a second mortgage lender&#8217;s title insurance policy. Loans are generally made up to a maximum of 89% of the appraised value of the property less any outstanding liens.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Home Improvement Loans and Equity Loans&#8212;Fixed Term. Home improvement and equity loans are made up to a maximum of 85% of the appraised value of the improved property, less any outstanding liens. These loans are offered on both a fixed and variable rate basis with a maximum term of 240 months. All home equity loans are made on a direct basis to borrowers.

&#160;

Commercial Business Loans. Although the Bancorp&#8217;s priority in extending various types of commercial business loans changes from time to time, the basic considerations in determining the makeup of the commercial business loan portfolio are economic factors, regulatory requirements and money market conditions. The Bancorp seeks commercial loan relationships from the local business community and from its present customers. Conservative lending policies based upon sound credit analysis governs the extension of commercial credit. The following loans, although not inclusive, are considered preferable for the Bancorp&#8217;s commercial loan portfolio: loans collateralized by liquid assets; loans secured by general use machinery and equipment; secured short-term working capital loans to established businesses secured by business assets; short-term loans with established sources of repayment and secured by sufficient equity and real estate; and unsecured loans to customers whose character and capacity to repay are firmly established.

&#160;

Government Loans. The Bancorp is permitted to purchase non-rated municipal securities, tax anticipation notes and warrants within the local market area.

&#160;

Non-Performing Assets, Asset Classification and Provision for Loan Losses

&#160;

Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are generally placed on a non-accrual status when, in the opinion of management, serious doubt exists as to the collectability of a loan. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when either principal or interest is 90 days or more past due. Consumer non-residential loans are generally charged off when the loan becomes over 120 days delinquent. Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on non-accrual status is charged against interest income. Subsequent payments are either applied to the outstanding principal balance, tax and insurance reserve or recorded as interest income, depending on the assessment of the ultimate collectability of the loan.

&#160;

The Bancorp&#8217;s mortgage loan collection procedures provide that, when a mortgage loan is 15 days or more delinquent, the borrower will be contacted by mail and payment requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower. In certain instances, the Bancorp will recast the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize his, her or its financial affairs. If the loan continues in a delinquent status for 120 days, the Bancorp will generally initiate foreclosure proceedings. Any property acquired as the result of foreclosure or by voluntary transfer of property made to avoid foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate until such time as it is sold or otherwise disposed of by the Bancorp. Foreclosed real estate is recorded at fair value at the date of foreclosure. At foreclosure, any write-down of the property is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Costs relating to improvement of property are capitalized, whereas holding costs are expensed. Valuations are periodically performed by management, and a valuation allowance is established by a charge to operations if the carrying value of a property exceeds its estimated fair value less selling costs. Subsequent gains or losses on disposition, including expenses incurred in connection with the disposition, are charged to operations. Collection procedures for consumer loans provide that when a consumer loan becomes ten days delinquent, the borrower will be contacted by mail and payment requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower. In certain instances, the Bancorp may grant a payment deferral. If a loan continues to be delinquent after 60 days and all collection efforts have been exhausted, the Bancorp will initiate legal proceedings. Collection procedures for commercial business loans provide that when a commercial loan becomes ten days delinquent, the borrower will be contacted by mail and payment requested. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts will be made to contact the delinquent borrower pursuant to the commercial loan collection policy. In certain instances, the Bancorp may grant a payment deferral or restructure the loan. Once it has been determined that collection efforts are unsuccessful, the Bancorp will initiate legal proceedings.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Bancorp classified four loans totaling $5.0 million as troubled debt restructurings, which involves modifying the terms of a loan to forego a portion of interest or principal or reducing the interest rate on the loan to a rate materially less than market rates, or materially extending the maturity date of a loan. The Bancorp&#8217;s troubled debt restructurings include one commercial real estate hotel loan in the amount of $4.4 million, for which significant deferrals of principal repayments were granted; one commercial real estate loan in the amount of $522 thousand for which a significant deferral of principal and interest repayment was granted by the Bank as required by a bankruptcy plan and two commercial business loans totaling $74 thousand for which a reduction in principal was granted. At December 31, 2015, $4.5 million of the Bancorp&#8217;s loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are accruing loans. The valuation basis for the Bancorp&#8217;s troubled debt restructurings is based on the present value of cash flows, unless consistent cash flows are not present, then the fair value of the collateral securing the loan is the basis for valuation.

&#160;

During 2015, gross interest income of $253,000 would have been recorded on loans accounted for on a non-accrual basis if the loans had been current throughout the period. Interest on such loans included in income during the period amounted to $123,000.

Federal regulations require savings banks to classify their own loans and to establish appropriate general and specific allowances, subject to regulatory review. These regulations are designed to encourage management to evaluate loans on a case-by-case basis and to discourage automatic classifications. Loans classified as substandard or doubtful must be evaluated by management to determine loan loss reserves. Loans classified as loss must either be written off or reserved for by a specific allowance. Amounts reported in the general loan loss reserve are included in the calculation of the Bancorp&#8217;s total risk-based capital requirement (to the extent that the amount does not exceed 1.25% of total risk-based assets), but are not included in Tier 1 leverage ratio calculations and Tier 1 risk-based capital requirements. Loans internally classified as substandard totaled $11.3 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $9.5 million at December 31, 2014. No loans are internally classified as doubtful at December 31, 2015 or 2014. No loans were classified as loss at either December 31, 2015 or 2014. Substandard loans include non-performing loans and potential problem loans, where information about possible credit issues or other conditions causes management to question the ability of such borrowers to comply with loan covenants or repayment terms. In addition to identifying and monitoring non-performing and other classified loans, management maintains a list of watch loans. Watch loans represent loans management is closely monitoring due to one or more factors that may cause the loan to become classified. Watch loans totaled $13.5 million at December 31, 2015, compared to $14.5 million at December 31, 2014.

&#160;

A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that a borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, impaired loans totaled $7.4 million. The December 31, 2015, impaired loan balances consist of nine commercial real estate and commercial business loans totaling $5.5 million that are secured by business assets and real estate, and are personally guaranteed by the owners of the businesses. In addition, eight mortgage loans totaling $227 thousand, along with sixty-two purchased credit impaired mortgage loans totaling $1.7 million, have also been classified as impaired. The December 31, 2015 allowance for loan losses (&#8220;ALL&#8221;) contained $356 thousand in specific allowances for collateral deficiencies, compared to $426 thousand at December 31, 2014. Typically, management does not individually classify smaller-balance homogeneous loans, such as residential mortgages or consumer loans, as impaired, unless they are troubled debt restructurings.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, management is of the opinion that there are no loans, except those discussed above, where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which will imminently result in disclosure of such loans as non-accrual, past due or restructured loans. Management does not presently anticipate that any of the non-performing loans or classified loans would materially impact future operations, liquidity or capital resources.

&#160;

For 2015, $954 thousand in provisions to the ALL were required, compared to $875 thousand for 2014 an increase of $79 thousand or 9.0%. The ALL provision increase is primarily a result of increased originations and overall loan portfolio growth. For 2015, charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaled $362 thousand, compared to $1.7 million for 2014. The net loan charge-offs for 2015 were comprised of $230 thousand in residential real estate loans, $67 thousand in commercial business loans, $37 thousand in commercial real estate loans, and $28 thousand in consumer loans. The ALL provisions take into consideration management&#8217;s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio, loan portfolio balances, changes in the portfolio mix and local economic conditions. In determining the provision for loan losses for the current period, management has given consideration to historically elevated risks associated with the local economy, changes in loan balances and mix, and asset quality.

&#160;

The ALL to total loans was 1.22% at December 31, 2015, compared to 1.30% at December 31, 2014. The ALL to non-performing loans (coverage ratio) was 124.66% at December 31, 2015, compared to 114.83% at December 31, 2014. The December 31, 2015 balance in the ALL account of $7.0 million is considered adequate by management after evaluation of the loan portfolio, past experience and current economic and market conditions. While management may periodically allocate portions of the allowance for specific problem loans, the whole allowance is available for any loan charge offs that occur. The allocation of the ALL reflects performance and growth trends within the various loan categories, as well as consideration of the facts and circumstances that affect the repayment of individual loans, and loans which have been pooled as of the evaluation date, with particular attention given to non-performing loans and loans which have been classified as substandard, doubtful or loss. Management has allocated reserves to both performing and non-performing loans based on current information available.

Investment Activities

&#160;

The primary objective of the investment portfolio is to provide for the liquidity needs of the Bancorp and to contribute to profitability by providing a stable flow of dependable earnings. Securities can be classified as either held-to-maturity (HTM) or available-for-sale (AFS) at the time of purchase. No securities are classified as trading or as held-to-maturity. AFS securities are those the Bancorp may decide to sell if needed for liquidity, asset-liability management or other reasons. During 2015, the Bancorp did not hold as investments any derivative instruments and was not involved in hedging activities as defined by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging. It has been the policy of the Bancorp to invest its excess cash in U.S. government agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and municipal securities. In addition, short-term funds are generally invested as interest-bearing balances in financial institutions and federal funds. At December 31, 2015, the Bancorp&#8217;s investment portfolio totaled $233.4 million. In addition, the Bancorp had $845 thousand of federal funds sold, and $3.0 million in FHLB stock.

The Bancorp currently holds four trust preferred securities of which three of the securities&#8217; quarterly interest payments have been placed in &#8220;payment in kind&#8221; status. Payment in kind status results in a temporary delay in the payment of interest. As a result of a delay in the collection of the interest payments, management placed these securities in non-accrual status. At December 31, 2015, the cost basis of the three trust preferred securities in non-accrual status totaled $3.8 million. Current estimates indicate that the interest payment delays may continue through 2019. One trust preferred security with a cost basis of $1.3 million remains in accrual status.

Sources of Funds

&#160;

General. Deposits are the major source of the Bancorp&#8217;s funds for lending and other investment purposes. In addition to deposits, the Bancorp derives funds from maturing investment securities and certificates of deposit, dividend receipts from the investment portfolio, loan principal repayments, repurchase agreements, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (FHLB) and other borrowings. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows are significantly influenced by general interest rates and money market conditions. Borrowings may be used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds. They may also be used on a longer-term basis for general business purposes. The Bancorp uses repurchase agreements, as well as a line-of-credit and advances from the FHLB for borrowings. At December 31, 2015, the Bancorp had $18.5 million in repurchase agreements. Other borrowings totaled $39.5 million, of which $39.1 million represents FHLB advances.

&#160; 

Deposits. Retail and commercial deposits are attracted principally from within the Bancorp&#8217;s primary market area. The Bancorp offers a broad selection of deposit instruments including non-interest bearing demand accounts, interest bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, certificate accounts and retirement savings plans. Deposit accounts vary as to terms, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. Certificate account offerings typically range in maturity from ten days to 42 months. The deregulation of federal controls on insured deposits has allowed the Bancorp to be more competitive in obtaining funds and to be flexible in meeting the threat of net deposit outflows. The Bancorp does not obtain funds through brokers.

&#160;

The following table presents the average daily amount of deposits and average rates paid on such deposits for the years indicated. The amounts are stated in thousands (000&#8217;s).

Borrowings. Borrowed money is used on a short-term basis to compensate for reductions in the availability of other sources of funds and is generally accomplished through repurchase agreements, as well as, through a line of credit and advances from the FHLB. Repurchase agreements generally mature within one year and are generally secured by U.S. government securities or U.S. agency securities, under the Bancorp&#8217;s control. FHLB advances with maturities ranging from one year to five years are used to fund securities and loans of comparable duration, as well as to reduce the impact that movements in short-term interest rates have on the Bancorp&#8217;s overall cost of funds. Fixed rate advances are payable at maturity, with a prepayment penalty.

Bank Subsidiary Activities 

&#160;

Peoples Service Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank was incorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana. The subsidiary currently provides insurance and annuity investments to the Bank&#8217;s wealth management customers. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had an investment balance of $171 thousand in Peoples Service Corporation.

&#160;

NWIN, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank. NWIN, LLC was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada as an investment subsidiary. The investment subsidiary currently holds Bank security investments, which are managed by a professional portfolio manager. In addition, the investment subsidiary is the parent of a real estate investment trust, NWIN Funding, Inc., that invests in real estate loans originated by the Bank. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had an investment balance of $256.4 million in NWIN, LLC.

&#160;

NWIN Funding, Inc. is a subsidiary of NWIN, LLC, and was formed as an Indiana Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT). The formation of NWIN Funding, Inc. provides the Bancorp with a vehicle that may be used to raise capital utilizing portfolio mortgages as collateral, without diluting stock ownership. In addition, NWIN Funding, Inc. will receive favorable state tax treatment for income generated by its operations. At December 31, 2015, the REIT held assets of $22.8 million in real estate loans.

&#160;

Columbia Development Company, LLC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank and was incorporated under the laws of the State of Indiana. The subsidiary holds real estate properties that the Bank has acquired through the foreclosure process. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had an investment balance of $1.8 million in Columbia Development Company, LLC.

&#160;

The consolidated financial statements include NorthWest Indiana Bancorp (the Bancorp), its wholly owned subsidiary, Peoples Bank SB (the Bank), and the Bank&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiaries, Peoples Service Corporation, NWIN, LLC and Columbia Development Company, LLC. The Bancorp has no other business activity other than being a holding company for the Bank. The Bancorp&#8217;s earnings are dependent upon the earnings of the Bank. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The Bancorp&#8217;s primary market area for deposits, loans and financial services encompasses Lake and Porter Counties, in northwest Indiana, where all of its offices are located. Ninety-five percent of the Bancorp&#8217;s business activities are within this area.

&#160;

The Bancorp faces strong competition in its primary market area for the attraction and retention of deposits and in the origination of loans. The Bancorp&#8217;s most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings associations, and credit unions located in its primary market area. Particularly in times of high interest rates, the Bancorp has had significant competition from mutual funds and other firms offering financial services. The Bancorp&#8217;s competition for loans comes principally from savings associations, commercial banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, insurance companies, and other institutional lenders.

&#160;

The Bancorp competes for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees it charges and the efficiency and quality of the services it provides borrowers and other third-party sources. It competes for deposits by offering depositors a wide variety of savings accounts, checking accounts, competitive interest rates, convenient banking center locations, drive-up facilities, automatic teller machines, tax deferred retirement programs, electronic banking, and other miscellaneous services.

&#160;

The activities of the Bancorp and the Bank in the geographic market served involve competition with other banks as well as with other financial institutions and enterprises, many of which have substantially greater resources than those available to the Bancorp. In addition, non-bank financial services companies with which the Bancorp and Bank compete, while subject to regulation by the CFPB, are generally not subject to the same type of extensive regulation by the federal and state banking agencies applicable to the Bancorp and the Bank.

&#160;

&#160;

Personnel 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had 179 full-time and 36 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes its employee relations are good. The Bancorp has five officers (listed below under Item 4.5 &#8220;Executive Officers of the Bancorp&#8221;), but has no other employees. The Bancorp&#8217;s officers also are full-time employees of the Bank, and are compensated by the Bank.

&#160; 

Regulation and Supervision

&#160;

Bank Holding Company Regulation. As a registered bank holding company for the Bank, the Bancorp is subject to the regulation and supervision of the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#34;BHCA&#34;). Bank holding companies are required to file periodic reports with and are subject to periodic examination by the FRB.

&#160;

Under the BHCA, without the prior approval of the FRB, the Bancorp may not acquire direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting stock or substantially all of the assets of any company, including a bank, and may not merge or consolidate with another bank holding company. In addition, the Bancorp is generally prohibited by the BHCA from engaging in any nonbanking business unless such business is determined by the FRB to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Under the BHCA, the FRB has the authority to require a bank holding company to terminate any activity or relinquish control of a nonbank subsidiary (other than a nonbank subsidiary of a bank) upon the FRB's determination that such activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness and stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.

&#160;

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company is expected to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks. Pursuant to this requirement, a bank holding company should stand ready to use its resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity. This support may be required by the FRB at times when the Bancorp may not have the resources to provide it or, for other reasons, would not be inclined to provide it. Additionally, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#34;FDICIA&#34;), a bank holding company is required to provide limited guarantee of the compliance by any insured depository institution subsidiary that may become &#34;undercapitalized&#34; (as defined in the statute) with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency.

&#160;

Savings Bank Regulation. As an Indiana stock savings bank, the Bank is subject to federal regulation and supervision by the FDIC and to state regulation and supervision by the DFI. The Bank's deposit accounts are insured by DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. The Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System.

&#160;

Both federal and Indiana law extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business such as reserve requirements, truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings disclosures, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting, trading in securities and other aspects of banking operations. Current federal law also requires savings banks, among other things, to make deposited funds available within specified time periods.

&#160;

Under FDICIA, insured state chartered banks are prohibited from engaging as principal in activities that are not permitted for national banks, unless: (i) the FDIC determines that the activity would pose no significant risk to the appropriate deposit insurance fund, and (ii) the bank is, and continues to be, in compliance with all applicable capital standards.

&#160;

Branches and Acquisitions. Branching by the Bank requires the approval of the Federal Reserve and the DFI. Under current law, Indiana chartered banks may establish branches throughout the state and in other states, subject to certain limitations. Congress authorized interstate branching, with certain limitations, beginning in 1997. Indiana law authorizes an Indiana bank to establish one or more branches in states other than Indiana through interstate merger transactions and to establish one or more interstate branches through de novo branching or the acquisition of a branch. The Dodd-Frank Act permits the establishment of de novo branches in states where such branches could be opened by a state bank chartered by that state. The consent of the state is no longer required.

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; Page 20 of 85 

&#160;

&#160; 

Transactions with Affiliates. Under Indiana law, the Bank is subject to Sections 22(h), 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, which restrict financial transactions between banks and affiliated companies, such as the Bancorp. The statute limits credit transactions between a bank and its executive officers and its affiliates, prescribes terms and conditions for bank affiliate transactions deemed to be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, and restricts the types of collateral security permitted in connection with a bank's extension of credit to an affiliate.

&#160;

Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions, including state chartered FRB member banks, to meet several minimum capital standards: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%; (iii) a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8%; and (iv) a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.

&#160;

As noted, the capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common shareholders&#8217; equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock, and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (&#8220;AOCI&#8221;), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.

&#160;

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, and residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four-family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.

&#160;

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions by the institution and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if an institution does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

&#160;

The FRB has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution&#8217;s capital level is or may become inadequate in light of the particular risks or circumstances. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank met all applicable capital adequacy requirements.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Page 21 of 85 

&#160;

&#160;

Bank holding companies are generally subject to consolidated capital requirements established by the FRB. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to set minimum capital levels for bank holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository subsidiaries. The previously discussed final rule concerning regulatory capital accomplished this directive, effective January 1, 2015. However, legislation was enacted in December 2014 which required the FRB to amend its &#8220;Small Bank Holding Company&#8221; exemption from consolidated bank holding company capital requirements to generally extend the applicability of the exemption from $500 million to $1 billion in assets. Regulations implementing this legislation were effective May 15, 2015. Consequently, bank holding companies with less than $1 billion in consolidated assets, such as the Bancorp, are exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the FRB determines otherwise in particular cases.

&#160;

Federal law establishes a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. The law requires that certain supervisory actions be taken against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends on the degree of undercapitalization. The FRB has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation as to state member banks. The regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0%, or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.

Subject to a narrow exception, a receiver or conservator is required to be appointed for an institution that is &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; within specified time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FRB within 45 days of the date an institution is deemed to have received notice that it is &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; Compliance with the plan must be guaranteed by any parent holding company up to the lesser of 5% of the institution&#8217;s total assets when it was deemed to be undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve compliance with applicable capital requirements. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The FRB could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures.

&#160;

The following table shows that, at December 31, 2015, the Bancorp&#8217;s capital exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2015 the Bancorp&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios were substantially the same. At December 31, 2015, the Bancorp and the Bank were categorized as well capitalized. The dollar amounts are stated in millions.

Banking regulators may change these capital requirements from time to time, depending on the economic outlook generally and the outlook for the banking industry. The Bancorp is unable to predict whether and when any such further capital requirements would be imposed and, if so, to what levels and on what schedule.

Dividend Limitations. The Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The primary source of the Bancorp&#8217;s cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends on the Bancorp&#8217;s Common Stock, is the payment of dividends to the Bancorp by the Bank. Under Indiana law, the Bank may pay dividends of so much of its undivided profits (generally, earnings less losses, bad debts, taxes and other operating expenses) as is considered expedient by the Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors. However, the Bank must obtain the approval of the DFI for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank during the current year, including the proposed dividend, would exceed the sum of retained net income for the year to date plus its retained net income for the previous two years. For this purpose, &#8220;retained net income&#8221; means net income as calculated for call report purposes, less all dividends declared for the applicable period. An exemption from DFI approval would require that the Bank have been assigned a composite uniform financial institutions rating of 1 or 2 as a result of the most recent federal or state examination; the proposed dividend would not result in a Tier 1 leverage ratio below 7.5%; and that the Bank not be subject to any corrective action, supervisory order, supervisory agreement, or board approved operating agreement.

&#160;

The FDIC has the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the Bank. In addition, under FRB supervisory policy, a bank holding company generally should not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common shares unless (i) the organization&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, assets, quality, and overall financial condition. The FRB issued a letter dated February 24, 2009, to bank holding companies providing that it expects banks holding companies to consult with it in advance of declaring dividends that could raise safety and soundness concerns (i.e., such as when the dividend is not supported by earnings or involves a material increase in the dividend rate) and in advance of repurchasing shares of common preferred stock.

&#160;

Federal Deposit Insurance. Deposits in the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC up to a maximum amount, which is generally $250,000 per depositor, subject to aggregation rules. There is no unlimited insurance coverage for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. Rather, deposits held in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts are aggregated with interest-bearing deposits the owner may hold in the same ownership category, and the combined insured up to at least $250,000. The Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments by the FDIC pursuant to its regulations establishing a risk-related deposit insurance assessment system, based on the institution&#8217;s capital levels and risk profile. Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk-weighted categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels, and certain other factors with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. An institution&#8217;s initial assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned. There are also adjustments to a bank&#8217;s initial assessment rates based on levels of long-term unsecured debt, secured liabilities in excess of 25% of domestic deposits and, for certain institutions, brokered deposit levels. Pursuant to FDIC rules adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act (described below), initial assessments ranged from 5 to 35 basis points of the institution&#8217;s total assets minus its tangible equity. The Bank paid deposit insurance assessments of $522 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015. For 2015, the deposit insurance assessment rate before applying one time credits was approximately 0.067% of insured deposits. No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.

&#160;

The Bank is also subject to assessment for the Financing Corporation (FICO) to service the interest on its bond obligations. The amount assessed on individual institutions, including the Bank, by FICO is in addition to the amount paid for deposit insurance according to the risk-related assessment rate schedule. These assessments will continue until the FICO bonds are repaid between 2017 and 2019. During 2015, the FICO assessment rate ranged between 0.58 and 0.66 basis points for each $100 of insured deposits per quarter. The Bank paid interest payment assessments of $43 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015. Future increases in deposit insurance premiums or changes in risk classification would increase the Bank&#8217;s deposit related costs.

&#160;

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund at no less than 1.35%, and must achieve the 1.35% designated reserve ratio by September 30, 2020. The FDIC must offset the effect of the increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on insured depository institutions of less than $10 billion, and may declare dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio at the end of a calendar quarter is at least 1.5%, although the FDIC has the authority to suspend or limit such permitted dividend declarations. The FDIC has set the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund at 2% of estimated insured deposits, which the FDIC has established as a long-term goal.

&#160;

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the assessment base for deposit insurance premiums changed from adjusted domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. Tangible equity for this purpose means Tier 1 capital. These changes went into effect in April 2011. The rate schedules set forth in the rule are scaled to the increase in the assessment base, including schedules that will go into effect when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15%, 2%, and 2.5%.

&#160;

The schedules reduce the initial base assessment rate in each of the four risk-based pricing categories.

&#183; For small Risk category I banks, the rates range from 5-9 basis points. &#183; The rates for small institutions in Risk Categories II, III and IV are 14, 23 and 35 basis points, respectively. &#183; For large institutions and large, highly complex institutions, the rate schedule ranges from 5 to 35 basis points. &#160;

There are also adjustments made to the initial assessment rates based on long-term unsecured debt, depository institution debt, and brokered deposits. The FDIC also revised the assessment system for large depository institutions with over $10 billion in assets.

&#160;

The FDIC has the authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.

&#160;

The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if the FDIC determines, after a hearing, that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe and unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed in writing by, or written agreement with, the FDIC. The FDIC may also suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for a permanent termination of insurance if the institution has no tangible capital.

&#160;

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, which is one of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. It is funded primarily from funds deposited by member institutions and proceeds from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of trustees of the Federal Home Loan Bank. As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis in an amount equal to the greater of 1% of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans, home purchase contracts or similar obligations at the beginning of each year or 5% of our outstanding advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank. At December 31, 2015, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.

&#160;

At December 31, 2015, the Bancorp owned $3.00 million of stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis (&#8220;FHLBI&#8221;) and had outstanding borrowings of $39.1 million from the FHLBI. The FHLBI stock entitles the Bancorp to dividends from the FHLBI. The Bancorp recognized dividend income of approximately $151 thousand in 2015. At December 31, 2015, the Bancorp&#8217;s excess borrowing capacity based on collateral from the FHLBI was $94.5 million. Generally, the loan terms from the FHLBI are better than the terms the Bancorp can receive from other sources making it cheaper to borrow money from the FHLBI.

&#160; 

Federal Reserve System. Under regulations of the FRB, the Bank is required to maintain reserves against its transaction accounts (primarily checking accounts) and non-personal money market deposit accounts. The effect of these reserve requirements is to increase the Bank&#8217;s cost of funds. The Bank is in compliance with its reserve requirements.

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FDIC in connection with its examination of the Bank, to assess its record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by the Bank. For example, the regulations specify that a bank&#8217;s CRA performance will be considered in its expansion (e.g., branching) proposals and may be the basis for approving, denying or conditioning the approval of an application. As of the date of its most recent regulatory examination, the Bank was rated &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; with respect to its CRA compliance.

&#160;

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#34;Gramm-Leach&#34;), bank holding companies are permitted to offer their customers virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. In order to engage in these new financial activities, a bank holding company must qualify and register with the FRB as a &#34;financial holding company&#34; by demonstrating that each of its bank subsidiaries is well capitalized, well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the CRA. The Bancorp has no current intention to elect to become a financial holding company under Gramm-Leach.

&#160;

Gramm-Leach established a system of functional regulation, under which the federal banking agencies regulate the banking activities of financial holding companies, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulates their securities activities and state insurance regulators regulate their insurance activities.

&#160;

Under Gramm-Leach, federal banking regulators adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of Gramm-Leach affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors.

&#160;

The Bancorp does not disclose any nonpublic information about any current or former customers to anyone except as permitted by law and subject to contractual confidentiality provisions which restrict the release and use of such information.

&#160;

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;) within the Federal Reserve, which is granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth in Lending Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, the Consumer Financial Privacy provisions of Gramm-Leach and certain other statutes. Many of the consumer financial protection functions formerly assigned to the federal banking and other designated agencies are now performed by the CFPB. The CFPB has a large budget and staff, and has the authority to implement regulations under federal consumer protection laws and enforce those laws against, and examine, financial institutions. The CFPB has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets. Smaller institutions are subject to rules promulgated by the CFPB but continue to be examined and supervised by the federal banking regulators for consumer compliance purposes. The CFPB has the authority to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practice in connection with the offering of consumer financial products. Additionally, this bureau is authorized to collect fines and provide consumer restitution in the event of violations, engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data, and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities.

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Page 25 of 85 

&#160;

&#160;

Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the CFPB to establish certain minimum standards for the origination of residential mortgages including a determination of the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay. In addition, the CFPB has published several final regulations impacting the mortgage industry, including rules related to ability-to-pay, mortgage servicing, and mortgage loan originator compensation. The ability-to-repay rule makes lenders liable if they fail to assess ability to repay under a prescribed test, but also creates a safe harbor for so-called &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; Failure to comply with the ability-to-repay rule may result in possible CFPB enforcement action and special statutory damages plus actual, class action, and attorneys&#8217; fees damages, all of which a borrower may claim in defense of a foreclosure action at any time. The Dodd-Frank Act also permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and standards that are more stringent than those adopted at the federal level and, in certain circumstances, permits state attorneys general to enforce compliance with both the state and federal laws and regulations. Federal preemption of state consumer protection law requirements, traditionally an attribute of the federal savings association charter, has also been modified by the Dodd-Frank Act and now requires a case-by-case determination of preemption by the OCC and eliminates preemption for subsidiaries of a bank. Depending on the implementation of this revised federal preemption standard, the operations of the Bank could become subject to additional compliance burdens in the states in which it operates. There continues to be significant uncertainty as to how the CFPB&#8217;s regulatory, supervisory, examination, and enforcement strategies and priorities will impact the Bancorp&#8217;s business.

&#160;

Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending . Title XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act, includes a series of amendments to the Truth In Lending Act with respect to mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other things, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards and pre-payments. With respect to mortgage loan originator compensation, except in limited circumstances, an originator is prohibited from receiving compensation that varies based on the terms of the loan (other than the principal amount). The amendments to the Truth In Lending Act also prohibit a creditor from making a residential mortgage loan unless it determines, based on verified and documented information of the consumer&#8217;s financial resources, that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan. The amendments also prohibit certain pre-payment penalties and require creditors offering a consumer a mortgage loan with a pre-payment penalty to offer the consumer the option of a mortgage loan without such a penalty. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act expands the definition of a &#8220;high-cost mortgage&#8221; under the Truth In Lending Act, and imposes new requirements on high-cost mortgages and new disclosure, reporting and notice requirements for residential mortgage loans, as well as new requirements with respect to escrows and appraisal practices.

&#160;

Interchange Fees for Debit Cards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, interchange fees for debit card transactions must be reasonable and proportional to the issuer&#8217;s incremental cost incurred with respect to the transaction plus certain fraud related costs. Although institutions with total assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from this requirement, competitive pressures are likely to require smaller depository institutions to reduce fees with respect to these debit card transactions.

&#160;

Federal Securities Law. The shares of Common Stock of the Bancorp have been registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act (the &#8220;1934 Act&#8221;). The Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the 1934 Act and the rules of the SEC there under. If the Bancorp has fewer than 300 shareholders, it may deregister its shares under the 1934 Act and cease to be subject to the foregoing requirements.

&#160;

Shares of Common Stock held by persons who are affiliates of the Bancorp may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If the Bancorp meets the current public information requirements under Rule 144, each affiliate of the Bancorp who complies with the other conditions of Rule 144 (including those that require the affiliate&#8217;s sale to be aggregated with those of certain other persons) would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of (i) 1% of the outstanding shares of the Bancorp or (ii) the average weekly volume of trading in such shares during the preceding four calendar weeks.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Bancorp is required to provide its shareholders an opportunity to vote on the executive compensation payable to its named executive officers and on golden parachute payments in connection with mergers and acquisitions. These votes are non-binding and advisory. At least once every six years, the Bancorp must also permit shareholders to determine on an advisory basis whether such votes should be held every one, two, or three years.

&#160;

Other Future Legislation and Change in Regulations. Various other legislation, including proposals to expand or contract the powers of banking institutions and bank holding companies, is from time to time introduced. This legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Bancorp and the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. The Bancorp cannot accurately predict whether any of this potential legislation will ultimately be enacted, and, if enacted, the ultimate effect that it, or implementing regulations, would have upon the financial condition or results of operations of the Bancorp or the Bank.

&#160;

Federal Taxation

&#160;

For federal income tax purposes, the Bank reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting. The Bancorp and the Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return for each fiscal year ending December 31.

&#160;

State Taxation

&#160;

The Bank is subject to Indiana&#8217;s Financial Institutions Tax (&#8220;FIT&#8221;), which is imposed at a flat rate of 7.5% on &#8220;adjusted gross income&#8221; for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2015. This rate is scheduled to decrease over the succeeding years as follows: to 7.0% for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2016, to 6.5% for 2017 and 2018, to 6.25% for 2019, to 6.0% for 2020, to 5.5% for 2021, to 5.0% for 2022, and to 4.9% for 2023 and thereafter. &#8220;Adjusted gross income,&#8221; for purposes of FIT, begins with taxable income as defined by Section 63 of the Code and, thus, incorporates federal tax law to the extent that it affects the computation of taxable income. Federal taxable income is then adjusted by several Indiana modifications. Other applicable state taxes include generally applicable sales and use taxes plus real and personal property taxes.

&#160;

Accounting for Income Taxes

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Bancorp&#8217;s consolidated total deferred tax assets were $4.2 million and the consolidated total deferred tax liabilities were $2.1 million, resulting in a consolidated net deferred tax asset of $2.1 million, net of a $91,000 valuation allowance. The valuation allowance of $91,000 was provided for the state tax credit, as management does not believe these amounts will be fully utilized before statutory expiration.

&#160;
