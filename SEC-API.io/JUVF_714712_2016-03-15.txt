 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

Juniata Valley Financial Corp. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Juniata&#8221;) is a Pennsylvania corporation that was formed in 1983 as a result of a plan of merger and reorganization of The Juniata Valley Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;). The plan received regulatory approval on June 7, 1983, and Juniata, a one-bank holding company, registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The Bank is the oldest independent commercial bank in Juniata and Mifflin Counties, having originated under a state bank charter in 1867. The Company has one reportable segment, consisting of the Bank, as described in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company&#8217;s 2015 Annual Report to Shareholders (&#8220;2015 Annual Report&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Nature of Operations 

Juniata operates primarily in central and northern Pennsylvania with the purpose of delivering financial services within its local markets. The Company provides retail and commercial banking services through 15 offices in the following locations: five community offices in Juniata County; five community offices in Mifflin County, as well as a financial services office; two community offices in McKean County; one community office in each of Potter, Perry and Huntingdon Counties; and a loan production office in Centre County. The Company offers a full range of consumer and commercial banking services. Consumer banking services include: Internet banking; mobile banking; telephone banking; twelve automated teller machines; personal checking accounts; club accounts; checking overdraft privileges; money market deposit accounts; savings accounts; debit cards; certificates of deposit; individual retirement accounts; secured lines of credit; construction and mortgage loans; and safe deposit boxes. Commercial banking services include: low and high-volume business checking accounts; Internet account management services; remote deposit capability; ACH origination; payroll direct deposit; commercial lines of credit; commercial letters of credit; and commercial term and demand loans. The Bank provides comprehensive trust, asset management and estate services, and the Company has a contractual arrangement with a broker-dealer to offer a full range of financial services, including annuities, mutual funds, stock and bond brokerage services and long-term care insurance to the Bank&#8217;s customers. Management believes the Bank has a relatively stable deposit base with no major seasonal depositor or group of depositors. Most of the Company&#8217;s commercial customers are small and mid-sized businesses in central and northern Pennsylvania. 

&#160; 

Juniata&#8217;s loan underwriting policies are updated periodically and are presented for approval to the Board of Directors of the Bank. The purpose of the policies is to grant loans on a sound and collectible basis, to invest available funds in a safe, profitable manner, to serve the credit needs of the communities in Juniata&#8217;s primary market area and to ensure that all loan applicants receive fair and equal treatment in the lending process. It is the intent of the underwriting policies to seek to minimize loan losses by requiring careful investigation of the credit history of each applicant, verifying the source of repayment and the ability of the applicant to repay, securing those loans in which collateral is deemed to be required, exercising care in the documentation of the application, review, approval and origination process and administering a comprehensive loan collection program. 

&#160; 

The major types of investments held by Juniata consist of obligations and securities issued by U.S. government agencies or corporations, obligations of state and local political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities and common stock. Juniata&#8217;s investment policy directs that investments be managed in a way that provides necessary funding for the Company&#8217;s liquidity needs and adequate collateral to pledge for public funds held and, as directed by the Asset Liability Committee, manages interest rate risk. The investment policy specifies the types of permitted investments owned, addresses credit quality of investments and includes limitations by investment types and issuer. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s primary source of funds is deposits, consisting of transaction type accounts, such as demand deposits and savings accounts, and time deposits, such as certificates of deposit. The majority of deposits are held by customers residing or located in Juniata&#8217;s market area. No material portion of the deposits has been obtained from a single or small group of customers, and the Company believes that the loss of any customer&#8217;s deposits or a small group of customers&#8217; deposits would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Other sources of funds used by the Company include retail repurchase agreements, borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh and lines of credit established with various correspondent banks for overnight funding. 

&#160; 

Competition 

The Bank&#8217;s service area is characterized by a high level of competition for banking business among commercial banks, savings and loan associations and other financial institutions located inside and outside the Bank&#8217;s market area. The Bank actively competes with dozens of such banks and institutions for local consumer and commercial deposit accounts, loans and other types of banking business. Many competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger branch systems than those of the Bank. 

&#160; 

In commercial transactions, the Company believes that the Bank&#8217;s legal lending limit to a single borrower (approximately $8,010,000 as of December 31, 2015) enables it to compete effectively for the business of small and mid-sized businesses. However, this legal lending limit is considerably lower than that of various competing institutions and thus may act as a constraint on the Bank&#8217;s effectiveness in competing for larger financings. 

&#160; 

In consumer transactions, the Bank believes that it is able to compete on a substantially equal basis with larger financial institutions because it offers competitive interest rates on savings and time deposits and on loans. 

&#160; 

In competing with other banks, savings and loan associations and financial institutions, the Bank seeks to provide personalized services through management&#8217;s knowledge and awareness of its service areas, customers and borrowers. In management&#8217;s opinion, larger institutions often do not provide sufficient attention to the retail depositors and the relatively small commercial borrowers that comprise the Bank&#8217;s primary customer base. 

&#160; 

Other competitors, including credit unions, consumer finance companies, insurance companies and money market mutual funds, compete with many of the lending and deposit services offered by the Bank. The Bank also competes with insurance companies, investment counseling firms, mutual funds and other business firms and individuals in corporate and trust investment management services. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

General 

The Company operates in a highly regulated industry, and thus may be affected by changes in state and federal regulations and legislation. As a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;Bank Holding Company Act&#8221;), the Company is subject to supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) and is required to file periodic reports and information regarding its business operations and those of the Bank with the FRB. In addition, under the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities has the authority to examine the books, records and affairs of the Company and to require any documentation deemed necessary to ensure compliance with the Pennsylvania Banking Code. 

&#160; 

The Bank Holding Company Act requires the Company to obtain FRB approval before: acquiring more than a five percent ownership interest in any class of the voting securities of any bank; acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of a bank; or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. In addition, the Bank Holding Company Act prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring the assets, or more than five percent of the voting securities, of a bank located in another state, unless such acquisition is specifically authorized by the statutes of the state in which the bank is located. 

&#160; 

The Company is generally prohibited under the Ban Holding Company Act from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company engaged in, nonbanking activities unless the FRB, by order or regulation, has found such activities to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In making such determination, the FRB considers whether the performance of these activities by a bank holding company can reasonably be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh the possible adverse effects. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

A satisfactory safety and soundness rating, particularly with regard to capital adequacy, and a satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act rating are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions and open branch offices. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank was rated &#8220;outstanding&#8221; under the Community Reinvestment Act and was a &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; bank. An institution&#8217;s Community Reinvestment Act rating is considered in determining whether to grant approvals relating to charters, branches and other deposit facilities, relocations, mergers, consolidations and acquisitions. Less than satisfactory performance may be the basis for denying an application. 

&#160; 

There are various legal restrictions on the extent to which the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from the Bank. In general, these restrictions require that any such extensions of credit must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and are limited, as to any one of the Company or such non-bank subsidiaries, to ten percent of the lending bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus and, as to the Company and all such non-bank subsidiaries in the aggregate, to 20 percent of the Bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus. Further, the Company and the Bank are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services. 

&#160; 

As a bank chartered under the laws of Pennsylvania, the Bank is subject to the regulations and supervision of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. These government agencies conduct regular safety and soundness and compliance reviews that have resulted in satisfactory evaluations to date. Some of the aspects of the lending and deposit business of the Bank that are regulated by these agencies include personal lending, mortgage lending and reserve requirements. 

&#160; 

The operations of the Bank are also subject to numerous Federal, state and local laws and regulations which set forth specific restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to interest rates on loans, the extension of credit, credit practices, the disclosure of credit terms and discrimination in credit transactions. The Bank also is subject to certain limitations on the amount of cash dividends that it can pay to the Company. See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in the 2015 Annual Report, which is included in Exhibit 13 to this report and incorporated by reference in this Item 1. 

&#160; 

Under FRB policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and Liverpool Community Bank (&#8220;LCB&#8221;), of which the Company owns 39.16%, and to commit resources to support the Bank and LCB in circumstances where they might not be in a financial position to support themselves. Consistent with the &#8220;source of strength&#8221; policy for subsidiary banks, the FRB has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank holding company generally should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the Company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. 

&#160; 

As a public company, the Company is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s rules and regulations relating to periodic reporting, proxy solicitation and insider trading. 

&#160; 

FDIC Insurance 

The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures the deposits, up to prescribed statutory limits, of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries. The FDIC administers the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;). Since 2008, the standard maximum deposit insurance coverage per depositor, has been $250,000. This increase was effective immediately upon the President&#8217;s signature on July 21, 2010. The FDIC deposit insurance coverage limit applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. The FDIC has been given greater latitude in setting the assessment rates for insured depository institutions which could be used to impose minimum assessments. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The FDIC is authorized to set the reserve ratios for the Deposit Insurance Fund annually at between 1.15% and 1.5% of estimated insured deposits. FDIC assessment rates currently range from 12 to 50 basis points. Institutions in the lowest risk category, Risk Category I, pay between 12 and 14 basis points. Initial base assessment rates range between 12 and 45 basis points &#8211; 12 -16 basis points for Category I. The initial base rates for risk categories II, III and IV were 20, 30 and 45 basis points, respectively. For institutions in any risk category, assessment rates rose above initial rates for institutions relying significantly on secured liabilities. Assessment rates increased for institutions with a ratio of secured liabilities (repurchase agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, secured Federal Funds purchased and other secured borrowings) to domestic deposits of greater than 15%, with a maximum of 50% above the rate before such adjustment. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (&#8220;Dodd Frank Act&#8221;) revised the statutory authorities governing the FDIC&#8217;s management of the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;). Key requirements from the Dodd-Frank Act have resulted in the FDIC&#8217;s adoption of the following amendments: (1) redefined the assessment base used to calculate deposit insurance assessments to &#8220;average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity&#8221;; (2) raised the DIF&#8217;s minimum reserve ratio to 1.35 percent and removed the upper limit on the reserve ratio; (3) revised adjustments to the assessment rates by eliminating one adjustment and adding another; and (4) revised the deposit insurance assessment rate schedules due to changes to the assessment base. Revised rate schedules and other revisions to the deposit insurance assessment rules became effective April 1, 2011. Though deposit insurance assessments maintain a risk-based approach, the FDIC&#8217;s changes effective April 1, 2011, impose a more extensive risk-based assessment system on large insured depository institutions with at least $10 billion in total assets since they are more complex in nature and could pose greater risk. Due to the changes to the assessment base and assessment rates, as well as the DIF restoration time frame, the impact on the Company&#8217;s deposit insurance assessments resulted in lower premiums from 2011 through 2015 and will likely continue in future years. 

&#160; 

Under the Reform Act, the FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution&#8217;s deposits upon finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe and unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Company does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of its deposit insurance. 

&#160; 

In addition, all insured institutions of the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the Federal government established to finance resolutions of insolvent thrifts. These assessments, the current quarterly rate of which is approximately .0154 of insured deposits, will continue until the Financing Corporation bonds mature in 2017. 

&#160; 

Community Reinvestment Act 

Under the Community Reinvestment Act, the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. However, the Community Reinvestment Act does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The Community Reinvestment Act also requires; 

&#183; the applicable regulatory agency to assess an institution&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community; &#183; public disclosure of an institution&#8217;s CRA rating; and &#183; that the applicable regulatory agency provides a written evaluation of an institution&#8217;s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Capital Regulation 

The Company and the Bank are subject to risk-based and leverage capital standards by which all bank holding companies and banks are evaluated in terms of capital adequacy. The risk-based capital standards relate a banking organization&#8217;s capital to the risk profile of its assets and require that bank holding companies and banks must have Tier 1 capital of at least 4% of its total risk-adjusted assets, and total capital, including Tier 1 capital, equal to at least 8% of its total risk-adjusted assets. Tier 1 capital includes common stockholders&#8217; equity and qualifying perpetual preferred stock together with related surpluses and retained earnings. The remaining portion of this capital standard, known as Tier 2 capital, may be comprised of limited life preferred stock, qualifying subordinated debt instruments and the reserves for possible loan losses. 

&#160; 

Additionally, a bank holding company must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3%, measured as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets. This 3% leverage ratio is a minimum for the most highly rated bank holding companies without any supervisory, financial or operational weaknesses or deficiencies. For all other bank holding companies, the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is 4.% 

&#160; 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (the &#34;1991 Act&#34;), a bank holding company is required to guarantee that any &#34;undercapitalized&#34; (as such term is defined in the statute) insured depository institution subsidiary will comply with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal banking agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institution's total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount which is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards as of the time the institution failed to comply with such capital restoration plan. 

&#160; 

See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in the 2015 Annual Report and incorporated by reference in this Item 1, for a table that provides the Company&#8217;s risk based capital ratios and leverage ratio. 

&#160; 

Federal banking agencies have broad powers to take corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institutions in question are &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221;, &#8220;significantly undercapitalized,&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; As of December 31, 2015, the Bank was a &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; bank, as defined by the FDIC. 

&#160; 

The FDIC has issued a rule that sets the capital level for each of the five capital categories by which banks are evaluated. A bank is deemed to be &#34;well capitalized&#34; if the bank has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, has a leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to any order or final capital directive by the FDIC to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. A bank may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it received an unsatisfactory safety and soundness examination rating. 

&#160; 

All of the bank regulatory agencies have issued rules that amend their capital guidelines for interest rate risk and require such agencies to consider in their evaluation of a bank's capital adequacy the exposure of a bank's capital and economic value to changes in interest rates. These rules do not establish an explicit supervisory threshold. The agencies intend, at a subsequent date, to incorporate explicit minimum requirements for interest rate risk into their risk based capital standards and have proposed a supervisory model to be used together with bank internal models to gather data and hopefully propose at a later date explicit minimum requirements. 

&#160; 

The United States is a member of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the &#8220;Basel Committee&#8221;) that provides a forum for regular international cooperation on banking supervisory matters. The Basel Committee develops guidelines and supervisory standards and is best known for its international standards on capital adequacy. 

&#160; 

In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, officially identified by the Basel Committee as &#8220;Basel III&#8221;. In July 2013, the FRB approved final rules to implement the Basel III capital framework which revises the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions described above. The new minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, and will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

When fully phased in, Basel III requires financial institutions to maintain: (a) Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; (which is added to the 4.5% CET1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0%); (b) a minimum ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation); (c) a minimum ratio of total (that is, tier 1 plus tier 2) capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation); and (d) as a newly adopted international standard, a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0%, calculated as the ratio of tier 1 capital to a bank&#8217;s balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet exposures (computed as the average for each quarter of the month-end ratios for the quarter). 

&#160; 

As a result of the new capital conservation buffer rules, once in effect, if the Company&#8217;s bank subsidiary (The Juniata Valley Bank) fails to maintain the required minimum capital conservation buffer, the Company may be unable to obtain capital distributions from it, which could negatively impact the Company&#8217;s ability to pay dividends, service debt obligations or repurchase common stock. In addition, such a failure could result in a restriction on the Company&#8217;s ability to pay certain cash bonuses to executive officers, negatively impacting the Company&#8217;s ability to retain key personnel. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company believes its current capital levels would meet the fully phased-in minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer, as prescribed in the U.S. Basel III Capital Rules. 

&#160; 

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 

On November 12, 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (&#8220;GLB&#8221;) was signed into law. GLB permits commercial banks to affiliate with investment banks. It also permits bank holding companies which elect financial holding company status to engage in any type of financial activity, including securities, insurance, merchant banking/equity investment and other activities that are financial in nature. The Company has not elected financial holding company status. The merchant banking provisions allow a bank holding company to make a controlling investment in any kind of company, financial or commercial. GLB allows a bank to engage in virtually every type of activity currently recognized as financial or incidental or complementary to a financial activity. A commercial bank that wishes to engage in these activities is required to be well capitalized, well managed and to have a satisfactory or better Community Reinvestment Act rating. GLB also allows subsidiaries of banks to engage in a broad range of financial activities that are not permitted for banks themselves. Although the Company and the Bank have not commenced these types of activities to date, GLB enables them to evaluate new financial activities that would complement the products already offered to enhance non-interest income. 

&#160; 

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 implemented a broad range of corporate governance, accounting and reporting measures for companies, like Juniata, that have securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the various regulations promulgated under the Act, established, among other things: (i) requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise, and responsibilities; (ii) additional responsibilities relating to financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of reporting companies; (iii) standards for auditors and regulation of audits, including independence provisions that restrict non-audit services that accountants may provide to their audit clients; (iv) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for reporting companies and their directors and executive officers, including accelerated reporting of stock transactions and a prohibition on trading during pension blackout periods; and (v) a range of civil and criminal penalties for fraud and other violations of the securities laws. In addition, Sarbanes-Oxley required stock exchanges, such as NASDAQ, to institute additional requirements relating to corporate governance in their listing rules. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires the Company to include in its Annual Report on Form 10-K a report by management and an attestation report by the Company&#8217;s independent registered public accounting firm on the adequacy of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. Management&#8217;s internal control report must, among other things, set forth management&#8217;s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. 

&#160; 

Financial Privacy 

Federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect the Company by limiting how consumer information is transmitted and conveyed to outside vendors. 

&#160; 

Anti-Money Laundering Initiatives and the USA Patriot Act 

A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 (&#8220;USA Patriot Act&#8221;) imposes significant compliance and due diligence obligations, creates criminal and financial liability for non-compliance and expands the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. The United States Treasury has issued a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions. These regulations require financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

&#160; 

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation 

The U.S. has instituted economic sanctions which restrict transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These are typically known as the &#8220;OFAC rules&#8221; because they are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;). The OFAC-administered sanctions target countries in various ways. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country, and prohibitions on &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221; engaging in financial transactions which relate to investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. &#160; 

&#160; 

Consumer Protection Statutes and Regulations 

The Company is subject to many federal consumer protection statutes and regulations including the Truth in Lending Act, Truth in Savings Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act, Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Among other things, these acts: 

&#160; 

&#183; require banks to disclose credit terms in meaningful and consistent ways; &#183; prohibit discrimination against an applicant in any consumer or business credit transaction; &#183; prohibit discrimination in housing-related lending activities; &#183; require banks to collect and report applicant and borrower data regarding loans for home purchases or improvement projects; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; require lenders to provide borrowers with information regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements; &#183; prohibit certain lending practices and limit escrow account amounts with respect to real estate transactions; and &#183; prescribe possible penalties for violations of the requirements of consumer protection statutes and regulations. &#160; 

On November 17, 2009, the FRB published a final rule amending Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. The final rule limits the ability of a financial institution to assess an overdraft fee for paying automated teller machine transactions and one-time debit card transactions that overdraw a customer&#8217;s account, unless the customer affirmatively consents, or opts in, to the institution&#8217;s payment of overdrafts for these transactions. 

&#160; 

Dodd-Frank Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act resulted in significant financial regulatory reform. The Dodd-Frank Act also changed the responsibilities of the current federal banking regulators. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Oversight Council, with oversight authority for monitoring and regulating systemic risk, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has broad regulatory and enforcement powers over consumer financial products and services. Effective July 21, 2011, the CFPB became responsible for administering and enforcing numerous federal consumer financial laws enumerated in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd Frank Act also provided that, for banks with total assets of more than $10 billion, the CFPB would have exclusive or primary authority to examine those banks for, and enforce compliance with, the federal consumer financial laws. Although not subject to examination by the CFPB, the Company remains subject to the review and supervision of other applicable regulatory authorities, and such authorities may enforce compliance with regulations issued by the CFPB. 

&#160; 

The scope of the Dodd-Frank Act impacts many aspects of the financial services industry, and it requires the development and adoption of numerous regulations, some of which have not yet been issued. The effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry will depend, in large part, upon the extent to which regulators exercise the authority granted to them under the Dodd-Frank Act and the approaches taken in implementing those regulations. Additional uncertainty regarding the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act exists due to court decisions and the potential for additional legislative changes to the Dodd-Frank Act. 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act's provisions that have received the most public attention have generally been those which apply only to larger institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. However, the Dodd-Frank Act contains numerous other provisions that affect all bank holding companies, including the Company. 

&#160; 

The following is a list of significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and, if applicable, the resulting regulatory rules adopted, that apply (or will apply), most directly to the Company and its subsidiary: 

&#160; 

&#183; Federal deposit insurance - On April 1, 2011, the FDIC's revised deposit insurance assessment base changed from total domestic deposits to average total assets, minus average tangible equity. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act created a two scorecard system, one for large depository institutions that have more than $10 billion in assets and another for highly complex institutions that have over $50 billion in assets. &#183; Debit card interchange fees - In June 2011, the FRB adopted regulations, which became effective on October 1, 2011, setting maximum permissible interchange fees issuers can receive or charge on electronic debit card transaction fees and network exclusivity arrangements (the &#34;Current Rule&#34;). &#183; Interest on demand deposits - Beginning in July 2011, depository institutions were no longer prohibited from paying interest on business transaction and other accounts. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#183; Stress testing - In October 2012, the FRB issued final rules regarding company-run stress testing. In accordance with these rules, a Company whose assets exceed $10 billion is required to conduct an annual stress test in the manner specified, and using assumptions for baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios announced by the FRB . The stress test is designed to assess the potential impact of various scenarios on a company&#8217;s earnings, capital levels and capital ratios over at least a nine-quarter time horizon. If applicable, the Company's board of directors and its senior management are required to consider the results of the stress test in the normal course of business, including as part of its capital planning process and the evaluation of the adequacy of its capital. While the Company believes that both the quality and magnitude of its capital base are sufficient to support its current operations given its risk profile, this requirement is not applicable to the Company because its assets are under $10 billion. &#183; Ability-to-pay rules and qualified mortgages - As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a series of final rules in January 2013 amending Regulation Z, implementing the Truth in Lending Act, by requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a residential mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. These final rules, most of which became effective January 10, 2014, prohibit creditors, such as the Company, from extending residential mortgage loans without regard for the consumer's ability to repay and add restrictions and requirements to residential mortgage origination and servicing practices. In addition, these rules restrict the imposition of prepayment penalties and compensation practices relating to residential mortgage loan origination. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers' ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate &#34;qualified mortgages,&#34; which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a &#34;qualified mortgage&#34; is a residential mortgage loan that does not have certain high risk features, such as negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or a term exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount, and the borrower's total debt-to-income ratio must be no higher than 43% (subject to certain limited exceptions for loans eligible for purchase, guarantee or insurance by a government sponsored entity or a federal agency). &#160; 

Compliance with these rules has increased Juniata's overall regulatory compliance costs and required changes to the underwriting practices of the Company with respect to mortgage loans. 

&#160; 

&#183; Integrated disclosures under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Lending Act - In December 2013, the CFPB issued final rules revising and integrating previously separate disclosures required under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) in connection with certain closed-end consumer mortgage loans. These final rules became effective August 1, 2015 and require lenders to provide a new Loan Estimate, combining content from the former Good Faith Estimate required under RESPA and the initial disclosures required under TILA not later than the third business day after submission of a loan application, and a new Closing Disclosure, combining content of the former HUD-1 Settlement Statement required under RESPA and the final disclosures required under TILA at least three days prior to the loan closing. &#183; Volcker Rule &#8212; As mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, in December 2013, the OCC, FRB, FDIC, SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission issued a final rule (the &#34;Final Rules&#34;) implementing certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and non-bank financial company supervised by the FRB to engage in proprietary trading and have certain ownership interests in, or relationships with, a &#34;covered fund&#34; (the so-called &#34;Volcker Rule&#34;). The Final Rules generally treat as a covered fund any entity that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#34;1940 Act&#34;) but for the application of the exemptions from SEC registration set forth in Section 3(c)(1) (fewer than l00 beneficial owners) or Section 3(c)(7) (qualified purchasers) of the 1940 Act. The Final Rules also require regulated entities to establish an internal compliance program that is consistent with the extent to which it engages in activities covered by the Volcker Rule, which must include making regular reports about those activities to regulators. Although the Final Rules provide some tiering of compliance and reporting obligations based on size, the fundamental prohibitions of the Volcker Rule apply to banking entities of any size, including the Company. In December 2014, the FRB extended, until July 21, 2016, the date by which banking entities must conform their activities and investments to the requirements of the Final Rules, and announced its intention to grant an additional one-year extension of the conformance period to July 21, 2017. The Corporation does not engage in any activities prohibited by the Final Rules. Therefore, it does not currently expect that the Final Rules will have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

While the Company does not engage in proprietary trading or in any other activities prohibited by the Final Rules, the Company will continue to evaluate whether any of its investments fall within the definition of a &#34;covered fund&#34; and would need to be disposed of by the extended deadline. However, based on the Company's evaluation to date, it does not currently expect that the Final Rules will have a material effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations. 

&#183; Incentive compensation &#8212; As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, a joint interagency proposed regulation was issued in April 2011. The proposed rule would require the reporting of incentive-based compensation arrangements by a covered financial institution and prohibit incentive-based compensation arrangements at a covered financial institution that provides excessive compensation or that could expose the institution to inappropriate risks that could lead to material financial loss. The proposed rule, if adopted as currently proposed, could limit the manner in which the Company structures incentive compensation for its executives. &#160; 

National Monetary Policy 

In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, the earnings and growth of the Bank and, therefore, the earnings and growth of the Company, are affected by the policies of regulatory authorities, including the FRB and the FDIC. An important function of the FRB is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, setting the discount rate and changes in financial institution reserve requirements. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. 

&#160; 

The monetary policies and regulations of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon the future businesses, earnings and growth of the Company cannot be predicted with certainty. 

&#160; 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a total of 105 full-time and 45 part-time employees.
