Recent Financing Activities 

&#160;

Since November 2011, Mr. Shrewsbury, our CEO, has provided financing to us that, in addition to a bank term loan, we have relied upon to fund and expand our business operations. On February 25, 2014, Mr. Shrewsbury agreed to consolidate and restructure this indebtedness and we issued in exchange for such indebtedness a Consolidated Secured Promissory Note (the &#8220;Consolidated Note&#8221;) in the principal amount of $2,000,000. The Consolidated Note bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum or prime rate if higher than 5% per annum is repayable in full ten years from the date of issuance and is subject to certain events of default. Payment of the Consolidated Note is secured by the death benefit proceeds of a $2 million key man term life insurance policy purchased by the Company on the life of Mr. Shrewsbury which has been assigned to Mr. Shrewsbury. In addition, in consideration of Mr. Shrewsbury agreeing to consolidate the indebtedness, the Company granted to Mr. Shrewsbury options to purchase an aggregate of 500,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the terms of a Non-Qualified Stock Option Agreement, issued February 25, 2014. The options are exercisable for a period of three years commencing April 1, 2014. The options at exercisable at a price of $0.0924 per share subject to certain anti-dilution adjustments in the event of stock dividends, subdivisions, capital reorganizations, a consolidation, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets.

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016, Mr. Shrewsbury had advanced to the Company an additional $198,637 which is not interest bearing and is repayable upon demand.

&#160;

During fiscal 2015 and through December 3, 2015, we maintained a $750,000 line of credit with a bank. On December 3, 2015, we refinanced the line of credit with a new term loan from the bank in the amount of $711,376 and utilized the proceeds of the new loan to repay the line of credit. The new loan is for a term of five years and matures on December 3, 2020. During the term of the loan, we have agreed to make equal monthly repayments of principal and interest of $6,967 commencing January 3, 2016 and make a final payment on December 3, 2020, of the outstanding balance of the interest and principal then due, estimated to be approximately $391, 896. Interest under the new loan is variable and is based upon the Wall Street Journal Prime rate, currently 3.25% per annum. In the event of a default, interest under the loan may be increased by 2%. The line of credit is secured by a priority security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable and is guaranteed by our CEO.

&#160;

The Consolidated Note and advances due to Mr. Shrewsbury are subordinate to the Company&#8217;s bank indebtedness.

Our Business 

&#160;

Background 

&#160; 

Mining and Rail Supplies 

&#160;

We supply and distribute rail products including rail, switches, ties and related products, and drill bits, augurs, related tools and mining supplies to U.S. coal mine operators and distributors primarily located in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia.

&#160;

The U.S. coal production has decreased in recent years due in part to the retirement of U.S. coal-fired electricity generators, increased environmental regulation and related compliance costs on the part of coal mining companies, the increase use of natural gas generators and the availability of relative inexpensive natural gas, a modest demand growth for electricity, and reduced demand for coal abroad, including China. The U.S. coal industry produced approximately 1.0 Billion short tons of coal in 2014 (as compared to 984 million in 2013) from coal mining operations. The average price of coal per short ton in 2014 was $34.83 (as compared to $37.24 in 2013). ( See, U.S. Energy Information Administration, Annual Coal Report 2014, http://www.eia.gov/coal/annual/pdf/acr.pdf .) 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In the U.S., coal is produced from mines located in approximately 25 states. The principal coal producing states are Wyoming, West Virginia, Kentucky, Illinois and Texas. Coal is used to generate approximately 39% of the electricity in the U.S., but is also used for coke production and for certain industrial applications, such as cement making.

&#160;

In November 2014, there were approximately 985 active coal producing mines in the U.S. ( as compared to1,061 in 2013), and approximately 700 coal producers, of which the top 5 coal producers accounted for approximately 55.3% of the total U.S. coal production. ( See U.S. Energy Information Administration, Annual Coal Report 2014, http://www.eia.gov/coal/annual/pdf/acr.pdf. ) 

&#160; 

Recent Development 

&#160; 

In November 2014, and with a view to diversifying our business, we acquired The Bag Rack, LLC. The acquired company had developed a new product, &#8220;The Bag Rack,&#8221; a device that enables bags with handles to be stored efficiently in a car preventing the bags from tipping over and causing spillage. We expect to market and sell the new product online, through broadcast shopping networks, and other distribution outlets, and through certain national retailers and discount stores. During fiscal 2016 and 2015, we did not generate any revenue from the sale of the product and there can be no assurance we will be able to generate any revenue from this new product.

&#160; 

Principal Products 

&#160;

Drilling Products 

&#160;

We distribute and sell drill steel mining products for use in the coal mining industry, including:

&#160;

&#183; drill steel, used for drilling holes for bolts supporting mine ceilings; &#183; drill bit products and accessories, used for hard and soft rock mining operations; &#183; tungsten carbide drill bits and augurs, and &#183; related accessories and tools. &#160;

Rail Products 

&#160;

We distribute and sell drill steel mining products used by the coal industry in its extraction process, including:

&#160;

&#183; tee rails, used for railroad tracks for the transportation of coal by coal mine operators; &#183; steel ties for securing rail; &#183; switches, and &#183; related accessories and tools. &#160;

Cyclicality 

&#160; 

Changes in economic conditions affecting the global and domestic mining industry can occur abruptly and unpredictably, which may have significant effects on our sales. Cyclicality is driven, primarily, by price volatility of coal, as well as product life cycles, competitive pressures and other economic factors affecting the mining industry, such as company consolidations and mergers, bankruptcies, increased regulation of the coal mining or electrical utility industry, and competition affecting demand for coal, and the broader economy, including changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and from market expectations with respect to such policies. Falling prices for coal have in the past, and may in the future, lead to reduced production levels of existing mines, a contraction in the number of existing mines and the closure of less efficient mines, and are likely to lead to a decrease in demand for our mining supplies and rail products. Conversely, rising coal prices typically lead to the expansion of existing mines, opening of new mines or re-opening of less efficient mines. Increased mining activity typically leads to an increase in demand for our mining supplies and rail products.

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our business is subject to moderate seasonality, with the first quarter of our fiscal year (October to December), generally experiencing higher sales than the last three quarters of our fiscal year.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Manufacturers and Suppliers 

&#160;

Our drill steel mining products, drill bits, and related products are manufactured and supplied to us by several manufacturers located overseas. Our rail products are supplied to us by several suppliers located overseas and in the U.S.

&#160;

Management does not believe that the loss of any of such manufacturers or suppliers would adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business and believes that alternative manufacturers and suppliers would be readily available to us.

&#160;

Distribution and Sales 

&#160;

We sell our mining supplies and rail products primarily through two independent sales agents and, to a limited extent, directly to our customers. Our sales agents are independent contractors and are compensated on a commission basis. Our sales agents sell our mining supplies to resellers as well as directly to coal mine operators.

&#160;

Our products are delivered to us and warehoused in our Ashland, Kentucky warehouse facility, from where they are shipped to our customers primarily by road. Shipping costs are normally paid for by the purchaser.

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160;

We distribute and sell our mining supplies and rail products principally to certain coal mining companies located in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia and certain distributors. Our customers include both large and small mining companies and operators. During the year ended September 30, 2016, one customer accounted for approximately 23% of our revenues (9% in 2015), two customer accounted for approximately 13% of our revenues (one customer was 4%, and the second customer was 0% in 2015), one customers accounted for approximately 11% of our revenues (5% in 2015) and one customer accounted for 9% of our revenues (10% in 2015). The loss of any one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We continue to seek to increase our customer base and reduce our reliance on a limited number of customers.

&#160; 

Competitive Business Conditions 

&#160;

We compete with large and small manufacturers and suppliers of drill bits and other cutting tools and related products to the U.S. coal mining industry. We compete with several manufacturers and distributors of mine rail and related products. Many of our competitors are large manufacturers or distributors or divisions of large companies, however, our industry remains relatively fragmented with several hundred fabricators and toolmakers. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, greater name recognition, and more established relationships in the industry than we have. We believe we compete on the basis of the reliability, quality and performance of our products, competitive pricing, prompt delivery and good customer service and support.

&#160;

Patents and Proprietary Rights 

&#160;

In connection with our mining and rail supplies business, we rely on a combination of common law trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret law to establish and protect our proprietary rights and promote our reputation and the growth of our business. We do not own any patents with regard to our rail or mining products that would prevent or inhibit our competitors from using our products or entering our market, although we may seek such protection in the future.

&#160;

We do not require our employees, consultants and independent contractors to enter into agreements containing non-disclosure, non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions and covenants, accordingly, we rely only upon common law protections to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights or to deter independent third-party development of products similar to the products we distribute and sell.

&#160;

Governmental Regulation 

&#160;

We are unaware of and do not anticipate having to expend significant resources to comply with any governmental regulation of the distribution of mining supplies and rail products. We are subject to the laws and regulations of those jurisdictions in which we sell our products, which are generally applicable to business operations, such as business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements. We do not believe our current business is subject to any environmental or similar laws. However, we may become subject to product liability claims related to the products we distribute and sell.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In connection with our prior oil and gas business operations, we were subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. In particular, our exploration, development and production operations, our activities in connection with storage and transportation of oil and other hydrocarbons and our use of facilities for treating, processing or otherwise handling hydrocarbons and related wastes may be subject to regulation under these and similar state legislation.

&#160;

If it is subsequently determined that we failed to comply with these laws and regulations we may be subject to the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines, penalties or other liability, or the imposition of injunctive relief that could have a material adverse impact on us and our financial condition.

&#160;

Insurance 

&#160;

We maintain general liability insurance and auto coverage liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 to cover certain liabilities associated with the distribution of our mining supplies and rail products.

&#160;

We purchased a $2 million key man term life insurance policy on the life of our CEO (William Shrewsbury) that has been assigned to Mr. Shrewsbury as security for a loan he has made to us. In addition, we purchased a $500,000 key man term life insurance policy on the life of our CFO (Jose Fuentes) that has been assigned to Mr. Fuentes to cover prior years&#8217; accrued but unpaid compensation.

&#160;

Our prior oil and gas operations were subject to all the risks inherent in the exploration for, and development and production of, oil and gas including blowouts, fires and other casualties. We did not maintain insurance coverage related to such activities. Losses could arise from uninsured risks.

&#160;

Research and Development Expenditure 

&#160;

No research and development cost was incurred in 2016. During 2015, the Company incurred $7,312 in research and development cost. Research and development cost incurred in 2015 was expensed as the amount was considered immaterial and no proven product was developed.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of September 30, 2016, we employed three full-time employees and two part-time employees. None of our employees is a party to a collective bargaining agreement and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. Also, we employ certain consultants and independent contractors on a regular basis to assist in the marketing and sale of our products. Our sales agents are compensated on a commission basis.
