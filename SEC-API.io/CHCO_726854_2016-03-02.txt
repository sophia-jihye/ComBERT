 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

City Holding Company (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or "City Holding") is a financial holding company headquartered in Charleston, West Virginia. The Company conducts its principal activities through its wholly-owned subsidiary, City National Bank of West Virginia (&#8220;City National&#8221;). City National provides banking, trust and investment management and other financial solutions through its network of 85 &#32;banking offices and 853 &#32;full-time equivalent associates located in the states of West Virginia, Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southeastern Ohio. The Company&#8217;s business activities are currently limited to one reportable business segment, which is community banking. 

The principal products produced and services rendered by City National include: 

&#8226; 

Commercial Banking - City National offers a full range of commercial banking services to corporations and other business customers. Loans are provided for a variety of business purposes, including financing for commercial and industrial projects, income producing commercial real estate, owner-occupied real estate and construction and land development. City National also provides deposit services for commercial customers, including treasury management, lockbox and other cash management services. City National provides merchant credit card services through an agreement with a third party vendor. 

&#8226; 

Consumer Banking - City National provides banking services to consumers, including checking, savings and money market accounts as well as certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. In addition, City National provides consumers with installment and real estate loans and lines of credit. City National also offers credit cards through an agreement with a third party vendor. 

&#8226; 

Mortgage Banking - City National provides mortgage banking services, including fixed and adjustable-rate mortgages, construction financing, production of conventional and government insured mortgages, secondary marketing and mortgage servicing. 

&#8226;

These services include the administration of personal trusts and estates as well as the management of investment accounts for individuals,

employee benefit plans and charitable foundations. City National also provides corporate trust and institutional custody, financial and estate planning and retirement plan services. 

On January 9, 2015, City National sold its insurance operations, CityInsurance, to The Hilb Group, effective January 1, 2015. As a result of this sale, the Company recognized a one-time, after tax gain of $5.8 million . 

On November 6, 2015, the Company consummated the acquisition of three branch locations from American Founders Bank, Inc.&#8217;s (&#8220;AFB&#8221;) located in Lexington, Kentucky. The Company acquired approximately $119 million in performing loans and assumed deposit liabilities of approximately $145 million. The Company paid AFB a deposit premium of 5.5% on non-time deposits, and 1.0% on premium loan balances acquired. 

City National&#8217;s customer base is diverse and no single depositor could have a material adverse effect on liquidity, capital, or other elements of financial performance. Although no portion of City National&#8217;s loan portfolio is concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries, it historically has held residential mortgage loans as a significant portion of its loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015 , approximately 53% &#32;of the Company&#8217;s loan portfolio was categorized as residential mortgage and home equity loans. However, due to the fractionated nature of residential mortgage lending, there is no concentration of credits that would be considered materially detrimental to the Company&#8217;s financial position or operating results. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s business is not seasonal and has no significant foreign sources or applications of funds. There are no anticipated material capital expenditures, or any expected material effects on earnings or the Company&#8217;s competitive position as a result of compliance with federal, state and local provisions enacted or adopted relating to environmental protection. 

&#160; 

City National&#8217;s loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, residential real estate, home equity, consumer loans and demand deposit account ("DDA") overdrafts. 

&#160; 

The commercial and industrial loan portfolio consists of loans to corporate and other legal entity borrowers primarily in small to mid-size industrial and commercial companies. Commercial and industrial loans are considered to contain a higher level of risk than other loan types although care is taken to minimize these risks. Numerous risk factors impact this portfolio including industry specific risks such as economy, new technology, labor rates and cyclicality, as well as customer specific factors, such as cash flow, financial structure, operating controls and asset quality. As of December 31, 2015 , City National reported $165.9 million &#32;of loans classified as &#8220;Commercial and Industrial.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Commercial real estate loans consist of commercial mortgages, which generally are secured by nonresidential and multi-family residential properties. Commercial real estate loans are to many of the same customers and carry similar industry risks as the commercial and industrial loans. As of December 31, 2015 , City National reported $1.13 billion &#32;of loans classified as &#8220;Commercial Real Estate.&#8221; 

City National diversifies risk within the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate portfolios by closely monitoring industry concentrations and portfolios to ensure that it does not exceed established lending guidelines. Diversification is intended to limit the risk of loss from any single unexpected economic event or trend. Underwriting standards require a comprehensive credit analysis and independent evaluation of all larger balance commercial loans by the loan committee prior to approval. 

City National categorizes commercial loans by industry according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to monitor the portfolio for possible concentrations in one or more industries. As of December 31, 2015 , City National did not have any single industry classification that exceeded 10% &#32;of total loans; however, approximately 20% &#32;of City National's commercial loans are within the Lessors of Residential Buildings and Dwellings and Lessors of Nonresidential Buildings classifications. 

Residential real estate loans represent loans to consumers that are secured by a first lien on residential property. Residential real estate loans provide for the purchase or refinance of a residence and first-lien home equity loans that allow consumers to borrower against the equity in their home. These loans primarily consist of single family 3 and 5 year adjustable rate mortgages with terms that amortize up to 30 years. City National also offers fixed-rate residential real estate loans that are sold in the secondary market that are not included on City National's balance sheet and City National does not retain the servicing rights to these loans. Residential mortgage loans are generally underwritten to comply with Fannie Mae guidelines, while the home equity loans are underwritten with typically less documentation, but with lower loan-to-value ratios and shorter maturities. As of December 31, 2015 , City National reported $1.38 billion &#32;of loans classified as &#8220;Residential Real Estate.&#8221; 

- 5 - 

City National's home equity loans represent loans to consumers that are secured by a second (or junior) lien on a residential property. Home equity loans allow consumers to borrower against the equity in their home without paying off an existing first lien. These loans consist of home equity lines of credit ("HELOC") and amortized home equity loans that require monthly installment payments. Home equity loans are underwritten with less documentation, lower loan-to-value ratios and for shorter terms. The amount of credit extended is directly related to the value of the real estate at the time the loan is made. As of December 31, 2015 , City National reported $147.0 million &#32;of loans classified as &#8220;Home Equity.&#8221; 

All mortgage loans, whether fixed rate or adjustable rate, are originated in accordance with acceptable industry standards and comply with regulatory requirements. Fixed rate loans are processed and underwritten in accordance with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines; while adjustable rate loans are underwritten in accordance with City National's internal loan policy. 

&#160; 

Consumer loans may be secured by automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles, certificates of deposit and other personal property or they may be unsecured. The Company monitors the risk associated with these types of loans by monitoring such factors as portfolio growth, lending policies and economic conditions. Underwriting standards are continually evaluated and modified based upon these factors. As of December 31, 2015 , City National reported $36.1 million &#32;of loans classified as &#8220;Consumer.&#8221; 

&#160; 

DDA overdraft balances reflect demand deposit accounts that have been overdrawn by deposit customers and have been reclassified as loans. As of December 31, 2015 , City National reported $3.4 million &#32;of loans classified as &#8220;DDA Overdrafts.&#8221; 

&#160; 

City National&#8217;s loan underwriting guidelines and standards are updated periodically and are presented for approval by the Board of Directors. The purpose of the standards and guidelines is to grant loans on a sound and collectible basis; to invest available funds in a safe, profitable manner; to serve the legitimate credit needs of the communities in City National's primary market area; and to ensure that all loan applicants receive fair and equal treatment in the lending process. It is the intent of the underwriting guidelines and standards to: minimize loan losses by carefully investigating the credit history of each applicant, verify the source of repayment and the ability of the applicant to repay, collateralize those loans in which collateral is deemed to be required, exercise care in the documentation of the application, review, approval, and origination process, and administer a comprehensive loan collection program. The above guidelines are adhered to and subject to the experience, background and personal judgment of the loan officer assigned to the loan application. 

&#160; 

Market Area 

&#160; 

City National operates a network of 85 &#32;branch offices primarily along the I-64 corridor from Lexington, Kentucky through Lexington, Virginia; and along the I-81 corridor through the Shenandoah Valley from Lexington, Virginia to Martinsburg, West Virginia. City's branch network includes 57 &#32;offices in West Virginia, 14 &#32;offices in Virginia, 11 &#32;offices in Kentucky and 3 &#32;offices in Ohio. City National provides credit, deposit and investment advisory products and services to a broad geographical area that includes many rural and small community markets in addition to larger cities including Charleston (WV), Huntington (WV), Martinsburg (WV), Winchester (VA), Staunton (VA), Virginia Beach (VA), Ashland (KY) and Lexington (KY). 

City National has approximately 11% &#32;of the deposit market share in the counties of West Virginia it serves. In Kentucky, City National has approximately 2% &#32;of the deposit market share in the counties in its eleven offices serve. In Ohio, City National has approximately 13% &#32;of the deposit market share in the county in its three offices serve. In Virginia, City National has approximately 11% &#32;of the deposit market share along the I-81 corridor in which thirteen offices serve. 

According to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau estimates, in the counties where City National's offices are located, West Virginia&#8217;s population was approximately 1.0 &#32;million and has increased 1.0% &#32;since 2010. The population in the counties that City National serves in Kentucky icreased 2.8% &#32;since 2010 and in Lawrence County, Ohio, where City National's three offices are located, the population has decreased 1.3% &#32;since 2010. The population in the counties City National serves in Virginia along the I-81 corridor have increased 2.6% &#32;since 2010, which is more comparable to the national average increase of approximately 3.3% . 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

As noted previously, the Company&#8217;s principal markets are located in West Virginia and contiguous markets in the surrounding states of Kentucky and Ohio and in Virginia. The majority of the Company&#8217;s banking offices are located in the areas of Charleston (WV), Huntington (WV), Beckley (WV), Lewisburg (WV), Martinsburg (WV), Lexington (KY) and along the I-81 corridor in Virginia where there is a significant presence of other financial service providers. In its markets, the Company competes with national, regional, and local community banks for deposits, credit and trust and investment management customers. In addition to traditional banking organizations, the Company competes with credit unions, finance companies, insurance companies and other financial service providers who are able to provide specialty financial services to targeted customer groups. As further

discussed below, changes in laws and regulations enacted in recent years have increased the competitive environment the Company and its subsidiaries faces to retain and attract customers. 

Regulation and Supervision 

&#160; 

Overview : The Company, as a registered financial holding company, and City National, as an insured depository institution, operate in a highly regulated environment and are regularly examined by federal and state regulators. The following description briefly discusses certain provisions of federal and state laws and regulations to which the Company and City National are subject and the potential impact of such provisions. These federal and state laws and regulations are designed to reduce potential loss exposure to the depositors of such depository institutions and to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&#8217;s insurance fund and are not intended to protect the Company&#8217;s security holders. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised in Congress, in state legislatures, and before the various bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and timing of any changes and the impact such changes might have on the Company are impossible to determine with any certainty. A change in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material impact on the business, operations and earnings of the Company. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified entirely by reference to the particular statute and/or regulation. 

&#160; 

As a financial holding company, the Company is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHCA&#8221;), and is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board. The BHCA provides generally for &#8220;umbrella&#8221; regulation of bank holding companies such as the Company by the Federal Reserve Board, and for functional regulation of banking activities by bank regulators, securities activities by securities regulators, and insurance activities by insurance regulators. The Company is also under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;) and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. The Company is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") under the trading symbol &#8220;CHCO,&#8221; and is subject to the rules of the NASDAQ for listed companies. 

&#160; 

City National is organized as a national banking association under the National Bank Act. It is subject to regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#8220;OCC&#8221;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). The OCC's supervision and regulation of banks is primarily intended to protect the interests of depositors. The National Bank Act generally requires each national bank to maintain reserves against deposits, restricts the nature and amount of loans that may be made and the interest that may be charged, and restricts investments and other activities. 

&#160; 

In general, the BHCA limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Under the BHCA, bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity (as determined by the Federal Reserve Board in consultation with the OCC) or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as solely determined by the Federal Reserve Board). Activities that are financial in nature include, among other things, securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. 

&#160; 

The BHCA generally limits acquisitions by bank holding companies that are not qualified as financial holding companies to commercial banks and companies engaged in activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to order any bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve Board has reasonable grounds to believe that continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company. 

&#160; 

The International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001 (&#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) was adopted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The Patriot Act provides law enforcement with greater powers to investigate terrorism and prevent future terrorist acts. Among the broad-reaching provisions contained in the Patriot Act are several designed to deter terrorists&#8217; ability to launder money in the United States and provide law enforcement with additional powers to investigate how terrorists and terrorist organizations are financed. The Patriot Act creates additional requirements for banks, which were already subject to similar regulations. The Patriot Act authorizes the Secretary of Treasury to require financial institutions to take certain &#8220;special measures&#8221; when the Secretary suspects that certain transactions or accounts are related to money laundering. These special measures may be ordered when the Secretary suspects that a jurisdiction outside of the United States, a financial institution operating outside of the United States, a class of transactions involving a jurisdiction outside of the United States or certain types of accounts are of &#8220;primary money laundering concern.&#8221; The special measures include the following: (a) require financial 

- 7 - 

institutions to keep records and report on transactions or accounts at issue; (b) require financial institutions to obtain and retain information related to the beneficial ownership of any account opened or maintained by foreign persons; (c) require financial institutions to identify each customer who is permitted to use a payable-through or correspondent account and obtain certain information from each customer permitted to use the account; and (d) prohibit or impose conditions on the opening or maintaining of correspondent or payable-through accounts. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

&#160; 

The Company and its subsidiary bank and non-financial subsidiaries are affiliates within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve Act imposes limitations on a bank with respect to extensions of credit to, investments in, and certain other transactions with, its parent bank holding company and the holding company&#8217;s other subsidiaries. Furthermore, bank loans and extensions of credit to affiliates are also subject to various collateral requirements. Further, the authority of City National to extend credit to the Company's directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, including their immediate family members, corporations and other entities that they control, is subject to substantial restrictions and requirements the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereafter. These statutes and regulations impose specific limits on the amount of loans City National may make to directors and other insiders, and specify approval procedures that must be followed in making loans that exceed certain amounts. 

&#160; 

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#8220;CRA&#8221;) requires depository institutions to assist in meeting the credit needs of their market areas consistent with safe and sound banking practice. Under the CRA, each depository institution is required to help meet the credit needs of its market areas by, among other things, providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. Depository institutions are periodically examined for compliance with the CRA and are assigned ratings. In order for a financial holding company to commence any new activity permitted by the BHCA, or to acquire any company engaged in any new activity permitted by the BHCA, each insured depository institution subsidiary of the financial holding company must have received a rating of at least &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; in its most recent examination under the CRA. Furthermore, banking regulators take into account CRA ratings when considering approval of a proposed transaction. City National received a "satisfactory" rating on its most recent CRA examination in 2015. 

&#160; 

On July 21, 2010, sweeping financial regulatory reform legislation entitled the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act&#8221; (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was signed into law. The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial regulatory landscape, including provisions that accomplish the following: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has rule making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and have broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws; 

&#8226; 

Change standards for Federal preemption of state laws related to federally chartered institutions and their subsidiaries; 

&#8226; 

Require the OCC to seek to make its capital requirements for national banks countercyclical so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decrease in times of economic contraction; 

&#8226; 

Require financial holding companies, such as the Company, to be well-capitalized and well-managed . Bank holding companies and banks must also be both well-capitalized and well-managed to maintain their status as financial holding companies; 

&#8226; 

Provide for an increase in the FDIC assessment for depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, increase the minimum reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund from 1.15% to 1.35% and changes in the basis for determining FDIC premiums from deposits to assets; 

&#8226; 

Provide for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance. These disclosures and requirements apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions; 

&#8226; 

Permanently increase the $250,000 limit for federal deposit insurance and increase the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000; 

&#8226; 

Repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits; 

&#8226; 

Amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) to, among other things, give the Federal Reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers having assets over $10 billion and to enforce a new statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the actual cost of a transaction to the issuer; 

&#8226; 

Enhance the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; definition and increase the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained; 

&#8226; 

Strengthen the existing limits on a depository institution&#8217;s credit exposure to one borrower by expanding the scope of limitations to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions; 

- 8 - 

&#8226; 

Strengthen loan restrictions to insiders by expanding the types of transactions subject to various limits, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Additionally, restrictions on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and approved by the institution&#8217;s board of directors in certain situations are to be put in place; and 

&#8226; 

Increase the authority of the Federal Reserve to examine the Company and its non-bank subsidiaries. 

On December 10, 2013 the Federal Reserve adopted the final rules implementing the Volcker Rule, which amends the BHCA to require the federal financial regulatory agencies to adopt rules that prohibit banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain unregistered investment companies (defined as hedge funds and private equity funds). The Volcker Rule became effective on July 21, 2012 and the final rules became effective April 1, 2014, but the Federal Reserve issued an order extending the period during which institutions have to conform their activities and investments to the requirements of the Volcker Rule to July 21, 2015. On December 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve Board announced it acted to give banks until July 21, 2016, to conform investments in and relationships with covered funds that were in place prior to December 31, 2013. The Federal Reserve Board also announced its intention to act next year to grant banks an additional one-year extension of the conformance period until July 21, 2017, to conform ownership interests in and relationships with such covered funds. 

In 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB") issued eight final regulations governing mainly consumer mortgage lending. The first of these rules was issued on January 10, 2013, and included the ability to repay and qualified mortgage rule. This rule imposes additional requirements on banks, including rules designed to require banks to ensure borrowers' ability to repay their mortgage and took effect January 10, 2014. The same day, the CFPB also finalized a rule on escrow accounts for higher priced mortgage loans and a rule expanding the scope of the high-cost mortgage provision in the Truth In Lending Act. On January 17, 2013, the CFPB issued its final rules implementing provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that relate to mortgage servicing, which took effect on January 10, 2014. On January 18, 2013, the CFPB issued a final appraisal rule under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and six federal agencies including the CFPB, issued an interagency rule on appraisals for higher-priced mortgage loans. On November 20, 2013, the CFPB issued its final rule on integrated mortgage disclosures under the Truth In Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, for which compliance was required by August 1, 2015. 

Recently, banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address unethical or otherwise bad business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with the "unfair or deceptive acts or practices" ("UDAP") law. However, the UDAP provisions have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to "unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices", which has been delegated to the CFPB for supervision. 

Uncertainty remains as to the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act, which could have a material adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a whole, or on the Company&#8217;s business, results of operations and financial condition. Provisions in the legislation that affect deposit insurance assessments, payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate. Provisions in the legislation that require revisions to the capital requirements of the Company and City National could require the Company and City National to seek other sources of capital in the future. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy : Federal banking regulations set forth capital adequacy guidelines, which are used by regulatory authorities to assess the adequacy of capital in examining and supervising a bank holding company and its insured depository institutions. 

Prior to January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital standard applicable to City Holding and City National were based on Basel I. Those capital adequacy guidelines generally required bank holding companies to maintain total capital equal to at least 8% of total risk-adjusted assets, with at least one-half of total capital consisting of core capital (i.e., Tier 1 capital) and the remaining amount consisting of &#8220;other&#8221; capital-eligible items (i.e., Tier II capital), such as perpetual preferred stock, certain subordinated debt, and, subject to limitations, the allowance for loan losses. Tier 1 capital generally included common stockholders&#8217; equity plus, within certain limitations, perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities. For purposes of computing risk-based capital ratios, bank holding companies must have met specific capital guidelines that involved quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items, calculated under regulatory accounting practices. City Holding&#8217;s and City National&#8217;s capital amounts and classifications were also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. In addition to total and Tier 1 capital requirements, regulatory authorities also required bank holding companies and insured depository institutions to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of 3%. The leverage ratio was determined as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total average assets, where average assets exclude goodwill, other intangibles, and other specifically excluded assets. The guidelines also provided that banking organizations that were experiencing internal growth or making 

- 9 - 

acquisitions would be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels. In those instances where these criteria were not evident, regulatory authorities expect, and may have required, bank holding companies and insured depository institutions to maintain higher than minimum capital levels. 

&#160; 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve published the final rules that established a new comprehensive capital framework for banking organizations, commonly referred to as Basel III. These final rules substantially revised the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions. The final rule became effective January 1, 2015 for smaller, non-complex banking organizations with full implementation by January 1, 2019. 

&#160; 

Regulatory guidelines require the Company to maintain a minimum common equity tier I ("CET 1") capital ratio of 4.5% and a total capital to risk-adjusted assets ratio of 8.0%, with at least one-half of capital consisting of tangible common stockholders&#8217; equity and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 6.0%. Similarly, City National is also required to maintain minimum capital levels as set forth by various regulatory agencies. Under capital adequacy guidelines, City National is required to maintain minimum CET 1, total capital, Tier 1 capital, and leverage ratios of 4.5%, 8.0%, 6.0%, and 4.0%, respectively. To be classified as &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; City National must maintain CET 1, total capital, Tier 1 capital, and leverage ratios of 6.5%, 10.0%, 8.0%, and 5.0%, respectively. 

&#160; 

When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the Basel III Capital Rules will require City Holding and City National to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of CET 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% "capital conservation buffer" (which is added to the 4.5% CET 1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of CET 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of Total capital (that is, Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation) and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as compared to a current minimum leverage ratio of 3.0% for banking organizations that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority's risk-adjusted measure for market risk). 

&#160; 

The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). The Basel III Capital Rules also provide for a &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer&#8221; that is applicable to only certain covered institutions and does not have any current applicability to City Holding Company or City National Bank. 

&#160; 

The aforementioned capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.

Management believes that, as of December 31, 2015 , City Holding and City National would meet all capital adequacy requirements under Basel III on a fully phased-in basis as if such requirements had been in effect. 

Additionally, federal banking laws require regulatory authorities to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to depository institutions that do not satisfy minimum capital requirements. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institutions in question are &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;, &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221;, &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221;, &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221;, as such terms are defined under uniform regulations defining such capital levels issued by each of the federal banking agencies. As an example, a depository institution that is not well capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market. Additionally, a depository institution is generally prohibited from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company, may be subject to asset growth limitations and may be required to submit capital restoration plans if the depository institution is considered undercapitalized.

Dividends and Other Payments : The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from City National. Dividends from City National are essentially the sole source of cash for the Company. The right of the Company, and shareholders of the Company, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of City National through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of City National, except to the extent that claims of the Company in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized. Moreover, there are various legal limitations applicable to the payment of dividends to the Company as well as the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders. 

&#160; 

City National is subject to various statutory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the Company. Specifically, the approval of the OCC is required prior to the payment of dividends by City National in excess of its earnings retained in the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years. The payment of dividends by the Company and City National may also be limited by other factors, such as requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The OCC has the authority to prohibit any bank under its jurisdiction from engaging in an unsafe and unsound practice in conducting its business. Depending upon the financial condition of City National, the payment of dividends could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. The Federal Reserve Board and the OCC have indicated their view that it generally would be an unsafe and unsound practice to pay dividends except out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve Board has stated that, as a matter of prudent banking, a bank or bank holding company should not maintain its existing rate of cash dividends on common stock unless (1) the organization&#8217;s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fund fully the dividends and (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should serve as a source of managerial and financial strength to their subsidiary banks. Accordingly, the Federal Reserve Board has stated that a bank holding company should not maintain a level of cash dividends to its shareholders that places undue pressure on the capital of bank subsidiaries, or that can be funded only through additional borrowings or other arrangements that may undermine the bank holding company&#8217;s ability to serve as a source of strength. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , City National could pay dividends up to $18.2 million &#32;without prior regulatory permission. No dividends were paid in 2015 &#32;that required regulatory approval. During 2015 , the Company used cash obtained from these dividends primarily to: (1) pay common dividends to shareholders, (2) remit interest payments on the Company&#8217;s junior subordinated debentures and (3) fund the repurchases of the Company's common shares. Management believes that the Company&#8217;s available cash balance, together with cash dividends from City National, is adequate to satisfy its funding and cash needs in 2016 . 

&#160; 

Under federal law, City National may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or invest in the securities of, or take securities of the Company as collateral for loans to any borrower. City National is also subject to collateral security requirements for any loans or extensions of credit permitted by such exceptions. 

Governmental Policies 

&#160; 

The Federal Reserve Board regulates money and credit and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for time and savings deposits. Federal Reserve monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. 

Deposit Insurance 

&#160; 

Substantially all of the deposits of City National are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. On April 1, 2011, the deposit insurance assessment base changed from total domestic deposits to average total assets minus average tangible equity, pursuant to a rule issued by the FDIC as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. FDIC insurance expense totaled $1.8 million , $1.6 million &#32;and $1.9 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (DRR), that is, the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits. The Dodd-Frank Act directs the FDIC to amend its assessment regulations so that future assessments will generally be based upon a depository institution&#8217;s average total consolidated assets minus the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period, whereas assessments were previously based on the amount of an institution&#8217;s insured deposits. The minimum deposit insurance fund rate will increase from 1.15% to 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and the cost of the increase will be borne by depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the fund and, if needed, will increase or decrease assessment rates, following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required. 

&#160; 

- 12 - 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (&#8220;FDIA), the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

Cybersecurity 

In March 2015, federal regulators issued two statements regarding cybersecurity: (i) a statement indicating that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institutions and (ii) a statement indicating the expectation of a financial institution's management to maintain a sufficient business continuity planning process to ensure rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the financial institution's operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to: (a) enable recovery of data and business operations, (b) address rebuilding network capabilities, and (c) restore data if the financial institution or any of its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. 

If the Company does not comply with this regulatory guidance, it could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, as well as financial penalties. The Company believes that it is in compliance with this guidance. 

&#160; 

Future Legislation 

&#160; 

Various other legislative and regulatory initiatives, including proposals to overhaul the banking regulatory system and to limit the investments that a depository institution may make with insured funds, are from time to time introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as regulatory agencies. Such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of the Company and its subsidiaries in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance in the financial services industry generally. The Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that such potential legislation, if enacted, would have upon its financial condition or operations.
