Company History 

&#160; 

Valley High Mining Company (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221;, &#8220;our,&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was incorporated in the State of Utah on November 14, 1979, under the name Valley High Oil, Gas &#38; Minerals, Inc. (&#8220;Valley High Oil&#8221;), for the purpose of engaging in the energy, mining and natural resources business. In order to raise the money necessary to acquire, explore and develop oil and gas properties and other natural resource-related ventures or projects, we undertook an offering of our common stock pursuant to the Regulation A exemption from registration afforded under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, wherein we offered and sold a total of 25 million common shares at a price of two cents ($0.02) per share and received gross proceeds of $500,000 from over 1,000 subscribers. These funds were utilized in our attempt to acquire and explore for oil and gas, uranium, coal, geothermal, and other mineral (metallic and nonmetallic) properties. 

&#160; 

Between 1980 and 1985, we spent nearly all of our capital on several natural resource and mining ventures. In 1985, we effectuated a 10:1 reverse split. By 1986, after engaging in several unsuccessful ventures, we exhausted our capital reserves. From April 1989 through 2003, we were dormant, doing only those actions necessary to allow the Company to remain as an active entity. In April 2004, pursuant to the affirmative vote of our shareholders we reincorporated into the State of Nevada by merging with a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary company under the name Valley High Mining Company (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, for every 35 shares of Valley High Oil, a shareholder was entitled to receive one (1) share of Valley High Mining Company, a Nevada corporation, the surviving entity in the Merger. 

&#160; 

On April 19, 2004, the day that the Merger was effective, we entered into a mining lease agreement with North Beck Joint Venture, LLC, a Utah limited liability company (&#8221;North Beck&#8221;), an entity owned and controlled by our then principal shareholder and officer/director. The terms of the lease consideration were based upon prior lease agreements that North Beck Joint Venture had entered into with other mining companies in the past. As a result, we acquired control of over 470 acres of patented precious metals mining claims located adjacent to, and just west of, the town of Eureka in Juab County, Utah, in the so-called &#8220;Tintic Mining District&#8221; (the &#8220;North Beck Claims&#8221;). The Tintic Mining District of Juab County, Utah, is located approximately 100 miles south of Salt Lake City. The North Beck Claims have an extensive history and contain several mines, mining shafts or &#34;prospecting pits,&#34; two of which are over 1,000 feet deep. This project also proved to be unsuccessful. As a result, in February, 2010, control of our Company changed again, with the business objective to seek a suitable acquisition candidate through acquisition, merger, reverse merger or other suitable business combination method. We disposed of the North Beck Claims in connection with the change in control. 

&#160; 

Until September 2012, our then management continued to seek a suitable acquisition candidate, without success. On September 8, 2012, we executed a Joint Venture Agreement (the &#8220;Joint Venture&#8221;) with Corizona Mining Partners LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company (&#8220;Corizona&#8221;). Prior, on July 20, 2012, the Company and Corizona formed a limited liability company, Minera Carabamba S.A. pursuant to the laws of Peru. The Joint Venture acquired a 50% leasehold interest in a property of approximately 966 hectares, located in La Libertad, Peru, in order to conduct gold mining operations on the property under the project name of Machacala. On March 1, 2013, the Company advised Corizona that we were no longer interested in continuing with our role in the Joint Venture due to the inability to gain access to the property. 

&#160; 

Also during our fiscal year ended December 31, 2012, we reviewed a second possible venture with Corizona. They introduced us to a second property located in Peru and on October 5, 2012, we executed a letter of intent (&#8220;LOI&#8221;) to develop this project, which consisted of a 50% aggregate interest. The LOI provided for us to initially own 80% of the venture, with Corizona owning the remaining 20%. We agreed to pay the costs of developing the project, which was estimated to be approximately $500,000, subject to our due diligence. We performed our due diligence on this project and discovered that it was not in production, despite representations to the contrary. We also could not reach an agreement with Corizona on a budget for this project. As a result, we elected to terminate this venture.

During the year ended December 31, 2013, we also formed a wholly owned subsidiary, VH Energy, Inc., a Texas corporation, which was formed with the intention of engaging in the oil and gas industry. We initially engaged in a venture which involved the brokerage of diesel fuel, which failed to close. We have commenced legal action against various parties involved in this transaction, however the matter is closed. See &#8220;Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings,&#8221; below. 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company began to identify new underserved and emerging industries to move into and discovered an increasing demand for fresher locally grown organic foods. The demand for organic food rose 11% between 2011 and 2012, reaching $28 billion and the market is now predicted to grow at a 14% annual rate for the next four years. As a result, the Company determined to transition into the organic foods market and on December 4, 2014, the Company completed the purchase of a fully contained grow environment, or grow pod, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Bill of Sale. This grow pod is a template for many to be built and deployed into culture centers (between 20 and 40 pods). The grow pod is a steel shipping container converted to be self-contained, insulated, solarized, bug free, pesticide free, heated, cooled, LED lighted hydroponic growing facilities that can be managed from a computer or phone. Each of our pods requires only seven to ten hours of attending weekly. Our pods are capable of growing leafy green vegetables, herbs, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and certain types of berries all year without regard to weather and free from pests and disease. These crops may be harvested up to thirty times a year. The Company has tried unsuccessfully throughout fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 to adequately capitalize its transition to the organic food market. As such, we will continue to explore this market and others moving into 2016.

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

Domestic mineral exploration operations are subject to extensive federal regulation and, with respect to federal leases, to interruption or termination by governmental authorities on account of environmental and other considerations. The trend towards stricter standards in environmental legislation and regulation could increase our costs and others in the industry. Mineral lessees are subject to liability for the costs of clean-up of pollution resulting from a lessee&#8217;s operations, and may also be subject to liability for pollution damages. We do not intend to obtain insurance against costs of clean-up operations as we do not intend to continue in the mining industry, rather, we are transitioning to organic food and nutraceutical. 

&#160; 

Estimate of the Amount Spent on Research and Development 

&#160; 

Research and development expenses were $0 and $0 in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we have two (2) full-time employees, our Chief Executive Officer and President. For the foreseeable future, we intend to use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Growth in organic agricultural production is taking place in both developed and developing countries worldwide, and the competition for major consumer markets in developed countries is increasing. U.S. producers have been challenged to keep pace with growing consumer demand for organic products for over a decade, and new statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce show that organic imports play a key role in meeting U.S. demand. Many of the top imported organic products are tropical and subtropical crops, including bananas and coffee, which the U.S. does not produce in large quantities. However, among all organic product imports lettuce, a primary crop we are targeting, is the fastest growing.
