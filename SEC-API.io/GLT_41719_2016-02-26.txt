 ITEM 1 BUSINESS Overview Glatfelter began operations in 1864, and we believe we are one of the world&#146;s leading manufacturers of specialty papers and fiber-based engineered materials. Headquartered in York, Pennsylvania, we own and operate manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and the Philippines and we have sales and distribution offices in Russia and China. 

Acquisitions Over the past several years, we have completed a number of acquisitions that have diversified our revenue, expanded our geographic footprint and enhanced our asset base. The most recent transactions include the April 2013, $211 million acquisition of Dresden Papier GmbH (&#147;Dresden&#148;) and the October 2014, $8.0 million acquisition of Spezialpapierfabrik Oberschmitten GmbH (&#147;SPO&#148;). Dresden is a leading supplier of nonwoven wall covering products with annual revenues of approximately $160 million in the year of acquisition. SPO is a producer of highly technical papers for a wide range of electrical applications with annual sales of approximately $33 million. Both of these businesses operate within our Composite Fibers business unit. 

Products Our three business units manufacture and distribute a wide array of specialty papers and fiber-based engineered materials including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Composite Fibers with revenue from the sale of single-serve tea and coffee filtration papers, nonwoven wall covering materials, metallized papers, composite laminates papers, and many technically special papers including substrates for electrical applications; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Advanced Airlaid Materials with revenue from the sale of airlaid nonwoven fabric-like materials used in feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products, wipes, and other airlaid applications; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Specialty Papers with revenue from the sale of papers for carbonless and other forms, envelopes, book publishing, and engineered products such as papers for high-speed ink jet printing, office specialty products, greeting cards, packaging, casting, release, transfer, playing card, postal, FDA-compliant food and beverage applications, and other niche specialty applications. 

The global growth markets served by the Composite Fibers and Advanced Airlaid Materials business units are characterized by attractive growth rates as the result of emerging products and markets, changing end-user preferences and evolving demographics. Specialty Papers serves more mature market segments, many of which are in decline. 

As a result of our strategy to diversify sources of revenue and invest in growth businesses, revenue generated from Composite Fibers and Advanced Airlaid Materials is expected to represent an increasingly greater proportion of total revenue. Combined, these two business units comprised 47% of our total net sales in 2015 compared with 30% in 2006. 

Consolidated net sales and the relative net sales contribution of each of our business units for the past three years are summarized below:

&#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160; &#160; 100.0 % Strategy Our strategy is focused on growing revenues, organically and by acquisition, in our key global growth markets including single-serve coffee and tea, nonwoven wall covering materials, electrical products, hygiene and wipes products, and other technical materials. We partner with leading consumer product companies and other market leaders to provide innovative products with outstanding performance to meet market requirements. Over the past several years, we have made investments to increase production capacity and improve our technical capabilities to ensure we are best positioned to serve the 

&#160;

&#160; 

GLATFELTER 2015 FORM 10-K 1 

market demands and grow our revenue. This includes a $50 million investment in 2013 to expand capacity and improve inclined wire paper machine capabilities in Composite Fibers. We are committed to growing in our key markets and expect to make additional investments to support our customers and satisfy market demands. Consistent with this strategy, in December 2015, we announced plans to invest approximately $80 million to build a new advanced airlaid facility in the southern U.S. to service the North America market. Production at the new facility is expected to start in two years with an annual capacity of approximately 22,000 short tons, increasing our total global airlaid materials capacity to approximately 129,000 short tons. 

New product development and new business development is a critical component of our business strategy requiring a focus on product innovation. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we invested $10.4 million, $12.3 million and $12.2 million, respectively, in new product development activities. In each of the past three years, in excess of 50% of net sales were generated from products developed, enhanced or improved within the past five years. 

In addition, our business strategy includes expanding product margins driven by cost reduction and continuous improvement initiatives, generating strong and reliable free cash flows and making strategic investments designed to improve our returns on invested capital. 

And finally, the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow profile has allowed us to pursue strategic actions such as the Dresden and SPO acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy complements our long-term strategy of driving growth in core and adjacent markets. Since 2006, we have successfully completed six acquisitions demonstrating our ability to establish leading market positions through the successful acquisition and integration of complementary businesses. 

Our Business Units We manage our company as three distinct business units: Composite Fibers; Advanced Airlaid Materials; and Specialty Papers. Net tons sold by each business unit for the past three years were as follows:

Composite Fibers Our Composite Fibers business unit serves customers globally and focuses on higher value-added products in the following markets: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Food &#38; Beverage paper primarily used for single-serve coffee and tea products; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Wallcovering base materials used by the world&#146;s largest wallpaper manufacturers; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Metallized products used in the labeling of bottles, self-adhesive labels, packaging liners, gift wrap, and other consumer product applications; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Composite Laminates paper used in production of decorative laminates, furniture, and flooring applications; and

&#160; $ 541,468 &#160; &#160; $ 617,851 &#160; &#160; $ 566,360 &#160; A significant portion of this business unit&#146;s revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and therefore the comparison from period to period reflects the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates unfavorably affected the comparison of 2015 to 2014 by $75.8 million. 

We believe many of the markets served by Composite Fibers present attractive growth opportunities by capitalizing on evolving consumer preferences, expanding into new or emerging geographic markets, and by gaining market share through superior products and quality. Many of this business&#146; papers are technically sophisticated, require specialized fibers, and many are extremely lightweight, requiring specifically designed papermaking equipment and production processes. Our proven 

&#160;

&#160; 

capability to produce these demanding products and our customer orientation positions us well to compete in these global markets. 

During 2013, we completed the acquisition of Dresden, a leading global supplier of nonwoven wallpaper base materials. The Dresden acquisition added another industry-leading nonwovens product line to our Composite Fibers business, and broadened our relationship with leading producers of consumer and industrial products. Dresden produces products with superior performance and characteristics such as dry strip-ability, higher tear resistance, and no material shrinkage or expansion when wet. However, since late 2014, demand for and pricing of Dresden&#146;s products has been adversely impacted by the geopolitical and economic conditions in Russia and Ukraine, countries from which Dresden generates a significant portion of its revenue. 

The primary raw materials used in the production of our lightweight papers are abaca pulp, wood pulp and synthetic fibers. Abaca pulp is a specialized pulp with limited sources of availability. Sufficient quantities of abaca pulp and its source fiber are required to support growth in this business unit. Our abaca pulp production process, fulfilled by our Philippine mill, provides a unique advantage to our Composite Fibers business unit. In the event the supply of abaca fiber becomes constrained or when production demands exceed the capacity of the Philippines mill, alternative sources and/or substitute fibers are used to meet customer demands. 

The Composite Fibers business unit is comprised of four paper making facilities (Germany, France and England), a nonwoven wall cover base mill (Germany), metallizing operations (Wales and Germany) and a pulp mill (the Philippines). The combined attributes of the facilities are summarized as follows: 

&#160;

Production Capacity (short tons) &#160; Principal Raw Material (&#147;PRM&#148;) &#160; Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM (short tons) 154,000 lightweight and other 

&#160; Abaca pulp &#160; 17,300 &#160; Wood pulp &#160; 95,000 &#160; Synthetic fiber &#160; 22,000 28,000 metallized 

&#160; Base stock &#160; 28,000 18,000 abaca pulp 

&#160; Abaca fiber &#160; 27,000 Composite Fibers&#146; lightweight products are produced using highly specialized inclined wire paper machine technology and we believe we currently maintain approximately 25% of the global inclined wire capacity. 

In addition to critical raw materials, the cost to produce Composite Fibers&#146; products is influenced by energy. Although the business unit generates all of its steam needed for production, in 2015, it purchased 75% of its electricity. 

In Composite Fibers&#146; markets, competition is product line specific as the necessity for technical expertise and specialized manufacturing equipment limits the number of companies offering multiple product lines. The following chart summarizes key competitors by market segment:

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; maximizing capacity utilization provided by the investment in state-of-the-art inclined wire technology to support consistent growth of key markets; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; enhancing product mix across all markets by utilizing new product and new business development capabilities; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; implementing continuous improvement methodologies to increase productivity, reduce costs and expand capacity; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; ensuring readily available access to specialized raw material requirements to support projected growth. 

As part of our commitment to realizing the growth potential of certain of this business unit&#146;s markets, in 2013 we completed a $50 million investment to expand our inclined wire capacity by nearly 20%, or approximately 10,500 short tons. In addition, the 2014 acquisition of SPO furthers our strategy of capitalizing on the fast-growing electrical market by broadening our electrical papers platform and know-how.

Advanced Airlaid Materials serves customers who are industry leading consumer product companies as well as private-label converters for feminine hygiene, adult incontinence and specialty wipes products. We believe this business unit holds leading market share positions in many of the markets it serves. Advanced Airlaid Materials has developed long-term customer relationships through superior quality, customer service, and a reputation for quickly bringing product and process innovations to market.

&#160; $ 244,589 &#160; &#160; $ 281,673 &#160; &#160; $ 268,396 &#160; A significant portion of this business unit&#146;s revenue is transacted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and therefore the comparison from period to period reflects the impact of changes in currency exchange rates. Changes in exchange rates unfavorably affected the comparison of 2015 to 2014 by $25.1 million. 

The feminine hygiene category accounted for 74% of Advanced Airlaid Material&#146;s revenue in 2015. The majority of sales of this product are to a small group of large, leading global consumer products companies. These markets are considered to be more growth oriented due to population growth in certain geographic regions and changing consumer preferences. In developing regions, demand is also influenced by increases in disposable income and cultural preferences. The airlaid wipes market 

presents attractive growth opportunities and as a result, we are investing approximately $80 million over the next two years to build a new advanced airlaid facility in the United States. 

The Advanced Airlaid Materials business unit operates state-of-the-art facilities in Falkenhagen, Germany and Gatineau, Canada. The Falkenhagen location operates three multi-bonded production lines and three proprietary single-lane festooners. The Gatineau location consists of two airlaid production lines employing multi-bonded and thermal-bonded airlaid technologies and two proprietary single-lane festooners. 

The business unit&#146;s two facilities operate with the following combined attributes: 

&#160;

Airlaid Production Capacity (short tons) &#160; Principal Raw Material (&#147;PRM&#148;) &#160; Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM (short tons) &#160; 107,000 

&#160; Fluff pulp &#160; &#160; 75,000 &#160; In addition to the cost of critical raw materials, production cost is impacted by energy. Advanced Airlaid Materials purchases substantially all of the electricity and natural gas used in its operations. Approximately 90% of this business unit&#146;s revenue is earned under contracts with pass-through provisions directly related to the price of key raw material costs. 

Advanced Airlaid Materials continues to be a technology and product innovation leader in technically demanding segments of the airlaid market, most notably feminine hygiene. This business unit&#146;s airlaid material production employs multi-bonded and thermal-bonded airlaid technologies as opposed to other methods such as hydrogen-bonding. We believe that its facilities are among the most modern and flexible airlaid facilities in the world, allowing it to produce at industry leading operating rates. Its proprietary single-lane festooning technology provides converting and product packaging which supports efficiency optimization by the customers converting processes. This business unit&#146;s in-house technical expertise, combined with significant capital investment requirements and rigorous customer expectations creates large barriers to entry for new competitors.

&#160; $ 875,026 &#160; &#160; $ 902,891 &#160; &#160; $ 887,859 &#160; Many of the market segments served by Specialty Papers are characterized by declining demand resulting in excess capacity, lower operating rates and pricing pressure. As a result, over the past several years, certain producers have closed, reduced or repurposed production capacity in 

an attempt to bring supply balance to the market. In addition, foreign producers have created additional imbalance by shipping product to the U.S. when market pricing is favorable or the U.S. dollar is stronger. Maintaining the supply and demand balance will require the industry to continually remove capacity sufficient to match declining demand. 

Despite our exposure to declining markets, in each of the past eleven years, we have outperformed the broader uncoated free sheet market in terms of shipping volume. We have been successful at maintaining this business unit&#146;s shipments by leveraging the flexibility of our asset base to respond to new product and new business development opportunities, efficiently responding to changing customer demands and delivering superior customer service. 

We are one of the leading suppliers of carbonless and book publishing papers in the United States. Although the markets for these products are declining, we have been successful in executing our strategy to replace this lost volume with products such as envelope papers, business forms, and other value-added specialty engineered products. Specialty Papers&#146; envelope papers market is also declining, however we have leveraged our customer service capabilities and geographic locations to grow our market share in each of the last several years. 

Specialty Papers&#146; highly technical engineered products include high speed ink jet printing products, office specialty products, greeting cards, packaging, casting, release, transfer, playing card, postal, FDA-compliant food and other niche specialty applications. Such products comprise an array of distinct business niches that are in a continuous state of evolution. Many of these products are utilized for demanding, specialized customer and end-user applications. Some of our products are new and higher growth while others are more mature and further along in the product life cycle. Because many of these products are technically complex and involve substantial customer-supplier development collaboration, they typically command higher per ton prices and generally exhibit greater pricing stability relative to commodity grade paper products. 

The Specialty Papers business unit operates two integrated pulp and paper making facilities with the following combined attributes: 

&#160;

Uncoated Production Capacity (short tons) &#160; Principal Raw Material (&#147;PRM&#148;) &#160; Estimated Annual Quantity of PRM (short tons) 820,000

&#160; 

GLATFELTER 2015 FORM 10-K 5 

This business unit&#146;s pulp mills have a combined pulp making capacity of 615,000 tons of bleached pulp per year. The principal raw material used to produce pulp is pulpwood, including both hardwoods and softwoods. Pulpwood is obtained from a variety of locations including the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. To protect our sources of pulpwood, we actively promote conservation and forest management among suppliers and woodland owners. 

The Spring Grove facility includes five uncoated paper machines as well as an off-line combi-blade coater and a Specialty Coater which together provide annual production capacity for coated paper of approximately 65,000 tons. The Chillicothe facility operates four paper machines producing uncoated and carbonless paper. Two of the machines have built-in coating capability which along with three additional coaters at the facility provide annual coated capacity of approximately 126,000 tons. 

In addition to critical raw materials, the cost to produce Specialty Papers&#146; products is influenced by energy. Although the business unit generates all of its steam needed for production at both facilities and generates more power than it consumes at the Spring Grove, PA facility, it purchased approximately 25% of its electricity needed for the Chillicothe, OH mill in 2015. The facilities&#146; source of fuel is primarily coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. As discussed more fully under &#147;Environmental Matters,&#148; in order to comply with new air quality regulations, we will be implementing modifications that will convert certain boilers to burn natural gas rather than coal. As a result, the consumption of natural gas will increase significantly in late 2016 and beyond.

Capital expenditures totaled $99.9 million, $66.0 million and $103.0 million, in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. For 2016, capital expenditures are estimated as follows:

&#160; 

health and safety. At various times, we have incurred significant costs to comply with these regulations and we could incur additional costs as new regulations are developed or regulatory priorities change. 

We have incurred and will incur additional material capital costs to comply with upcoming air quality regulations including the U.S. EPA Best Available Retrofit Technology rule (BART; otherwise known as the Regional Haze Rule) and the Boiler Maximum Achievable Control Technology rule (Boiler MACT). These rules require process modifications and/or upgrades of air pollution controls on boilers at two of our facilities. We have begun converting or replacing five coal-fired boilers to natural gas and upgrading site infrastructure to accommodate the new boilers, including connecting to gas supply. The total cost of these projects is estimated at $85 million to $90 million, of which $33.0 million has been incurred through the end of 2015. The balance of the related spending should be substantially completed in 2016. 

We are a defendant in the Fox River environmental matter. Although this matter is the subject of extensive and ongoing litigation, during 2015, we spent $9.7 million for remediation activities, and possibly may spend a similar amount in 2016. For a more complete discussion of this matter, see Item 8 &#150; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#150; Note 23. 

Employees As of December 31, 2015, we employed 4,375 people worldwide, of which approximately 75% are unionized. The United Steelworkers International Union and the Office and Professional Employees International Union represents 1,446 hourly employees at our Chillicothe, OH and Spring Grove, PA facilities under labor contracts expiring in August 2016 for Chillicothe and January 2017 for Spring Grove. Hourly employees at each of our international locations are represented by various unions or works councils. We consider the overall relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.
