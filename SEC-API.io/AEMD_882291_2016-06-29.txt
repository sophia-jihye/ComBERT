 ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview and Corporate History 

&#160; 

We are a leading developer of immunotherapeutic technologies to combat infectious disease and cancer. To augment the body's natural immune defenses, the Aethlon Hemopurifier&#174; eliminates life-threatening disease targets that are often shielded from the immune system and not well addressed by traditional drug therapies. The technology captures circulating viruses, bacterial toxins and cancer promoting exosomes through affinity attachment to a unique structure that cloaks these targets from immune detection. At present, the Hemopurifier&#174; is being advanced under an FDA approved clinical study. Aethlon is also the majority owner of Exosome Sciences, Inc., or Exosome, a company focused on the discovery of exosomal biomarkers to diagnose and monitor life-threatening diseases. In addition, we operate under a Department of Defense contract through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, related to the development of a sepsis treatment device. We also operate under a second Department of Defense contract as a subcontractor.

&#160;

Aethlon Medical was formed on March 10, 1999. Our executive offices are located at 9635 Granite Ridge Drive, Suite 100, San Diego, California 92123. Our telephone number is (858) 459-7800. All references to &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221; are references to Aethlon Medical, Inc., combined with its majority-owned subsidiary, Exosome Sciences, Inc.

&#160;

Target Market and Strategy 

&#160; 

Our primary therapeutic business segment is divided into two areas. First, we are advancing our lead product, the Aethlon Hemopurifier, which targets the removal of circulating viruses and shed glycoproteins to treat infectious viral pathogens. In oncology indications, the Hemopurifier targets the removal of circulating exosomes, which are released to promote cancer progression and to seed the spread of metastasis.

&#160;

The second focus is government contracting. We operate under two Department of Defense contracts related to a program entitled &#8220;Dialysis-Like Therapeutics.&#8221; One is a contract with DARPA, and the other is a subcontract with Battelle Memorial Institute.. Under these contracts, our tasks include the development of a dialysis-like device to prevent sepsis, a fatal bloodstream infection that is often the cause of death in combat-injured soldiers. Specific to the Hemopurifier, the program has focused on validating the capture of viral pathogens and bacterial toxins.

&#160;

The third facet of our business is conducted through Exosome, which is our diagnostic business segment and is developing exosome-based products to diagnose and monitor life-threatening disease conditions.

&#160;

We initially developed the Hemopurifier as a broad-spectrum countermeasure to address the many infectious viral pathogens that are not addressed with antiviral drugs. We also envision our technology serving as an adjunct therapy to improve the benefit of infectious disease and cancer therapy regimens marketed by pharmaceutical organizations. For example, a clinical trial protocol administered at the Medanta Medicity Institute in India was designed to treat Hepatitis C patients as they began their standard of care drug regimen as a means to reduce the time it normally takes for the virus to become undetectable in the patient&#8217;s blood. At completion of the Medanta Medicity study, we reported that patients who received the Hemopurifier therapy protocol had higher rapid virologic response and sustained virologic response rates as compared to what would normally be expected for Hepatitis C virus infected individuals who receive standard of care interferon-ribavirin drug therapy alone.

&#160;

Our Lead Device: The Aethlon Hemopurifier 

&#160;

The Aethlon Hemopurifier is a device that selectively targets the rapid elimination of circulating viruses and tumor-secreted exosomes that promote cancer progression. More specifically, the Hemopurifier addresses antiviral drug-resistance in Hepatitis C virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected individuals; serves as a countermeasure against viral pathogens not addressed by drug or vaccine therapies; and, we believe, represents the first therapeutic strategy to address cancer promoting exosomes. In clinical studies conducted in India, safety and efficacy observations of Hemopurifier therapy have been observed in both Hepatitis C virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected individuals. We are currently conducting the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved studies of Hemopurifier therapy in the U.S.

&#160;

The Scientific Mechanism of the Hemopurifier 

&#160;

The Hemopurifier is an extracorporeal (situated or occurring outside the body) device designed for the single-use removal of viruses, viral toxins, and deleterious exosomes from the circulatory system of treated patients. Delivery of Hemopurifier therapy can occur through the established infrastructure of continuous renal replacement therapy and dialysis instruments routinely found in hospitals and clinics worldwide. Most extracorporeal techniques, including dialysis and plasmapheresis, are designed to solely remove circulating particles by molecule size, which results in the elimination of disease targets as well as blood components required for health.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

However, the Hemopurifier is an interactive technology that incorporates a lectin affinity agent that binds to a unique high mannose signature that is abundant on the surface of tumor-derived exosomes and glycoproteins that reside on the outer membrane of infectious viruses. The Hemopurifier is designed to provide a broad-spectrum mechanism to reduce the presence of certain cancer and infectious disease related particles. To date, clinical treatment protocols have administered Hemopurifier therapy for periods lasting from three to six and one half hours in duration.

&#160;

The Hemopurifier - Antiviral Drug-Resistance; Planned U.S. Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

The Hemopurifier provides a novel methodology to target mutant viral strains that trigger antiviral drug resistance in both Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Hepatitis C virus infections. In Hepatitis C virus care, we believe the Hemopurifier is positioned to address drug resistance associated with emerging all-antiviral therapies and also to accelerate Hepatitis C virus depletion at the outset of peginterferon+ribavirin therapy.

&#160;

Based on previous studies we conducted in India, safety and efficacy observations of Hemopurifier therapy have been observed in both disease conditions. As a result of these outcomes, we have initiated the first FDA-approved feasibility study of Hemopurifier therapy in the U.S. The feasibility study is being conducted on Hepatitis C virus-infected patients at DaVita MedCenter Dialysis in Houston, Texas. The principal investigator for the study is Dr. Ronald Ralph, who replaced Dr. Stephen Z. Fadem as principal investigator in late 2015.

&#160;

Successful completion of this study will permit us to initiate further stage studies that are required for market clearance to treat Hepatitis C virus and other viral pathogens in the U.S. Our feasibility study protocol calls for the enrollment of ten Hepatitis C virus-infected end stage renal disease patients who have not received any pharmaceutical therapy for their Hepatitis C virus infection for at least 30 days. The protocol will consist of a control phase of three consecutive standard dialysis treatments during week one followed by the inclusion of our Hemopurifier during a total of six dialysis sessions conducted during weeks two and three. The rate of adverse events observed during the Hemopurifier therapy phase will be compared to the rate experienced during the control phase. Per-treatment changes of viral load will be observed through quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Additionally, we plan to measure the number of viral copies of Hepatitis C virus captured within the Hemopurifier during each treatment session.

&#160;

On February 14, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Total Renal Research, Inc. (dba DaVita Clinical Research). Pursuant to the agreement, Da Vita Clinical Research is conducting site management administrative services for a study. The agreement with DaVita Clinical Research requires us to pay certain expenses related to the study protocol projected to be less than $200,000, including certain start-up and close-out costs, patient compensation and project management fees. Additional activities and completion of this clinical trial will require us to pay additional costs estimated to be $650,000. We will also be responsible for the fees for any third-party consulting physicians, including Dr. Ralph, utilized in connection with the study and other pass-through expenses if incurred. The work order under this agreement was effective as of May 16, 2014 and will continue in effect until completion of the services being provided by DaVita Clinical Research.

&#160;

The Hemopurifier - Antiviral Studies in India 

&#160; 

Previously, we conducted Hepatitis C virus treatment studies at the Apollo Hospital, Fortis Hospital, and most recently the Medanta Medicity Institute in India.

&#160;

In the Medanta Medicity Institute study, twelve Hepatitis C virus-infected individuals were enrolled to receive three six-hour Hemopurifier treatments during the first three days of a 48-week peginterferon+ribavirin treatment regimen. The study was conducted under the leadership of Dr. Vijay Kher at the Medanta Medicity Institute, a multi-specialty medical institute established to be a premier center for medical tourism in India. Dr. Kher&#8217;s staff reported that Hemopurifier therapy was well tolerated and without device-related adverse events in the twelve treated patients.

&#160;

Of these twelve patients, ten completed the Hemopurifier-peginterferon+ribavirin treatment protocol, including eight genotype-1 patients and two genotype-3 patients. Eight of the ten patients achieved a sustained virologic response, which is the clinical definition of treatment cure and is defined as undetectable Hepatitis C virus in the blood 24 weeks after the completion of the 48-week peginterferon+ribavirin drug regimen. Both genotype-3 patients achieved a sustained virologic response, while six of the eight genotype-1 patients achieved a sustained virologic response.

&#160;

Of the ten patients who completed the full treatment protocol, five also achieved a rapid virologic response, defined as undetectable Hepatitis C virus in the blood at day 30 of therapy. Rapid virologic response represents the clinical endpoint that best predicts sustained virologic response cure rates resulting from peginterferon+ribavirin therapy. As a point of reference, the landmark Individualized Dosing Efficacy vs Flat Dosing to Assess Optimal Pegylated Interferon Therapy study of 3,070 Hepatitis C virus genotype-1 patients documented that 10.35% (n=318/3070) of peginterferon+ribavirin-treated patients achieved a rapid virologic response. Patients who achieved a rapid virologic response had sustained virologic response rates of 86.2% (n=274/318) versus sustained virologic response rates of 32.5% (n=897/2752) in non-rapid virologic response patients. Two of the genotype-1 patients who achieved a rapid virologic response also achieved an immediate virologic response, defined as undetectable Hepatitis C virus in the blood seven days after initiation of Hemopurifier-peginterferon+ribavirin treatment protocol. The earliest measured report of undetectable Hepatitis C virus in blood in the Individualized Dosing Efficacy vs Flat Dosing to Assess Optimal Pegylated Interferon Therapy study was on day 14 of the study.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Data from two patients was not included in the reported Hemopurifier-peginterferon+ribavirin dataset. One of these patients was a genotype-5 patient who discontinued peginterferon+ribavirin therapy at day 180, yet still achieved a sustained virologic response. The second patient was a genotype-3 patient who also achieved a sustained virologic response, yet was unable to tolerate peginterferon+ribavirin therapy and discontinued therapy at day 90. Overall, ten of the twelve patients who enrolled in the study achieved a sustained virologic response and seven of the twelve patients achieved a rapid virologic response.

&#160;

Hemopurifier - Human Immunodeficiency Virus; Single Proof Study 

&#160; 

In addition to treating Hepatitis C virus-infected individuals, we have conducted a single proof-of-principle treatment study related to the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus. In the study, Hemopurifier therapy reduced viral load by 93% in a Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome-infected individual without the administration of antiviral drug therapy. The study protocol provided for 12 Hemopurifier treatments, each four hours in duration, which were administered over the course of one month.

&#160;

Researchers at the Morehouse School of Medicine have since discovered that the Hemopurifier is able to capture exosomes that transport negative regulatory factor protein, which is reported to suppress the immune response in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-infected individuals.

&#160;

The Hemopurifier - Viral Pathogens Not Addressed by Drug Therapies 

&#160; 

The protocol design of our forthcoming FDA-approved study was originally designed as a human safety challenge and model for addressing drug and vaccine resistant bioterror and emerging pandemic threats. In vitro studies conducted by leading government and non-government researchers have demonstrated that the Hemopurifier is able to capture a broad spectrum of some of the world&#8217;s deadliest viral pathogens. These include: Dengue hemorrhagic fever, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Lassa hemorrhagic fever, H5N1 avian influenza, H1N1 swine flu virus, the reconstructed 1918 influenza virus, West Nile virus and Vaccinia and Monkeypox, which serve as models for human smallpox infection. Human efficacy studies are not permissible against high-threat bioterror and pandemic threats.

&#160;

The following table lists some of the key viral pathogens captured during in vitro studies and the name of the research institute that ran the study.

The Hemopurifier - Candidate to Treat Cancer 

&#160; 

In &#8220;Extracellular Vesicles: Emerging Targets for Cancer Therapy,&#8221; a review article sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and published in the July 2014 issue of Trends in Molecular Medicine , we were the sole organization referenced to have a therapeutic candidate to address tumor-secreted exosomes, which have been discovered to suppress the immune system of cancer patients, seed the creation and spread of metastasis, promote angiogenesis, trigger resistance to chemotherapy, and transport primary cancer therapeutic targets of the biopharmaceutical industry. To date, we have received an issued patent that protects the use of our Hemopurifier to remove immunosuppressive extracellular vesicles or exosomes from the blood of cancer patients. Through internal research and external research collaborations, we have demonstrated that the affinity lectin immobilized in our Hemopurifier is able to bind exosomes underlying a broad spectrum of disease indications including cancer.

&#160;

We believe that Hemopurifier therapy could play a role in the emerging immuno-oncology industry as an adjunct that can combine with established and emerging cancer therapies without adding drug toxicity. More specifically, we believe that a mechanism to inhibit exosome immune suppression should be clinically tested in combination with drugs designed to stimulate the immune response.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On April 9, 2015, we entered into an investigator-initiated clinical trial agreement with the University of California, Irvine, or UCI, pursuant to which UCI will conduct a five-year clinical study protocol entitled &#8220;Plasma Exosome Concentration in Cancer Patients Undergoing Treatment.&#8221; The protocol will seek to enroll five individuals in each of nine defined tumor types for a total study population of up to 45 subjects. The tumor types include the following forms of cancer: breast adenocarcinoma, colorectal, gastric and gastroesophageal, pancreatic, cholangiocarcinoma, lung, head and neck, melanoma and ovarian adenocarcinoma. The principal investigator of the study is Edward Nelson, M.D. The budget for the protocol provides for (i) $19,032 in startup charges; (ii) $8,039 in protocol-related variable pass-through charges; and (iii) per subject visit charges of $3,359 per subject, for a total subject visit charge of $151,155 for 45 subjects. We will bear these costs. UCI may disseminate the results of the clinical trial through presentation and publication but may not disclose any of our confidential information.

&#160;

Exosome Sciences, Inc. - Diagnostic Candidates 

&#160; 

Through our majority-owned subsidiary Exosome, which is our diagnostic product-oriented business segment, we are developing exosome-based product candidates to diagnose and monitor neurological disorders and cancer. Since it began operations in 2013, Exosome researchers have disclosed that they have isolated brain-specific biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's Disease and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. Specific to Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, Exosome is participating in a research collaboration with The Boston University CTE Center to study the correlation of a biomarker known as tausome with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. The initial results from that research collaboration were published in an article entitled &#8220;Preliminary Study of Plasma Exosomal Tau as a Potential Biomarker for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy&#8221; in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease on April 12, 2016.

&#160;

Exosome researchers have demonstrated the ability to identify, quantify, and characterize circulating Glioblastoma multiforme exosomes, which hold promise as a disease biomarker to identify the early detection of this aggressive form of cancer and monitor response to therapy. We believe that the discovery of circulating glioblastoma multiforme exosomes may offer a potential new paradigm in glioblastoma multiforme exosomes clinical management through a platform technology to predict tumor regression or progression.

&#160;

U.S. Government Contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency 

&#160; 

On September 30, 2011, we entered into a $6.8 million multi-year contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, part of the Department of Defense, resulting from our response to a program entitled &#8220;Dialysis-Like Therapeutics.&#8221; Under this contract, our tasks include the development of a dialysis-like device to prevent sepsis, a fatal bloodstream infection that is often the cause of death in combat-injured soldiers.

&#160;

The initial award from DARPA was a fixed-price contract with potential total payments to us of $6,794,389 over the course of five years. As noted below, such contract was subsequently reduced by $858,469. Fixed price contracts require the achievement of multiple, incremental milestones to receive the full award during each year of the contract. Under the terms of the contract, we are required to perform certain incremental work towards the achievement of specific milestones against which we will invoice the government for fixed payment amounts.

&#160;

Originally, only the base year (year one of the contract) was effective for the parties, however, DARPA subsequently exercised the option on the remaining four years of the contract. The milestones are comprised of planning, engineering and clinical targets, the achievement of which in some cases will require the participation and contribution of third party participants under the contract. We cannot assure you that we alone, or with third party participants, will meet such milestones to the satisfaction of the government and in compliance with the terms of the contract or that we will be paid the full amount of the contract revenues during any year of the remaining contract term. We commenced work under the contract in October 2011.

&#160;

In February 2014, DARPA reduced the scope of our contract in years three through five of the contract. The reduction in scope focused our research on exosomes, viruses and blood processing instrumentation. This scope reduction will reduce the possible payments under the contract by $858,469 over years three through five.

&#160;

The DARPA contract requires us to perform certain scientific research and development activities geared toward the achievement of specific milestones set forth in the contract. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, we recognized revenue of $863,011 and $630,887, respectively, under the DARPA contract. Based on the DARPA contract, as now in force, we may achieve up to an additional $387,438 in revenue under the DARPA contract during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.

Subcontract with Battelle Memorial Institute 

&#160; 

We entered into a subcontract agreement with Battelle in March 2013. Battelle was chosen by DARPA to be the prime contractor on the systems integration portion of the DARPA contract, and we are one of several subcontractors on that systems integration project. We began generating revenues under the subcontract in the three months ended September 30, 2013. During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2015, we recognized revenue of $23,561 and $131,530, respectively, under the Battelle subcontract. Our expected future revenue from the subcontract will be at the discretion of Battelle. The Battelle subcontract is our first cost-reimbursable contract.

&#160;

Our revenue under this contract is a function of cost reimbursement plus an overhead mark-up for hours devoted to the project by specific employees (with specific hourly rates for those employees), for travel expenses related to the project, for any equipment purchased for the project and for the cost of any consultants hired by us to perform work on the project. Each payment will require approval by the program manager at Battelle.

&#160;

Research and Development Costs 

&#160; 

A substantial portion of our operating budget is used for research and development activities. The cost of research and development, all of which has been charged to operations, amounted to approximately $782,000 and $1,028,000 in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

&#160;

Industry 

&#160; 

The industry for treating infectious disease and cancer is extremely competitive, and companies developing new treatment procedures face significant capital and regulatory challenges. Additionally, as the Hemopurifier is a new device, we have the additional challenge of establishing medical industry support, which will be driven by treatment data resulting from clinical studies of each disease condition that we pursue. The industry includes pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies competing to treat illnesses on a worldwide basis.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

We are advancing our Hemopurifier as a treatment strategy to enhance and prolong current drug therapies by removing the viral strains that cause drug resistance. We are also advancing the Hemopurifier as a tool for cancer treatment in conjunction with existing, and to be developed, cancer therapies. The Hemopurifier also may prolong life for infected patients who have become drug resistant or have been infected with a viral pathogen for which there is no drug or vaccine therapy. We believe our Hemopurifier augments the benefit of drug therapies and should not be considered a competitor to such treatments. However, if the industry considered the Hemopurifier to be a potential replacement for drug therapy, or a device that limited the need or volume of existing drug therapies, then the marketplace for the Hemopurifier would be extremely competitive. We believe our Hemopurifier is the sole therapeutic device able to selectively remove viruses and immunosuppressive proteins from circulation. However, we are aware that Asahi Kasei Kurary Medical based in Japan has created a double filtration plasmapheresis system that indiscriminately removes particles from blood in a certain molecule range that includes Hepatitis C virus. Asahi Kasei Kurary Medical is now marketing this device in Japan as an adjunct therapy for Hepatitis C virus. We may also face competition from producers of antiviral drugs and vaccines.

Government Regulation of Medical Devices 

&#160; 

The Hemopurifier is subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, primarily the FDA, and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, storage, distribution, advertising and promotion, and post-marketing surveillance reporting of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution. Failure to obtain approval or clearance to market our product and products under development and to meet the ongoing requirements of these regulatory authorities could prevent us from commercializing the Hemopurifier and future products in the U.S. and elsewhere.

&#160;

Hemopurifier Investigational Device Exemption and Supplement 

&#160; 

In 2013, the FDA approved our investigational device exemption to initiate human clinical studies in the U.S. as a feasibility study. We were required to reach agreement with the internal review board of DaVita MedCenter Dialysis prior to beginning our U.S. clinical trial. We are also required to obtain patients' informed consent that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy regulations. We, the FDA or the internal review board at each site at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device, may be equivocal or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain approval of the product. The investigational device exemption is part of the FDA&#8217;s clearance process. This process is discussed in detail in the &#8220;Pre-Marketing Regulations in the U.S.&#8221; section below.

&#160;

In December 2014, the FDA approved our request for a supplement to our investigational device exemption to establish a protocol to clinically investigate the use of the Hemopurifier for the treatment of Ebola-infected patients in the U.S. Under the supplement, we may treat up to 20 Ebola-infected persons, at no more than 10 institutions in the U.S., using the supplement protocol; however, this is not a clinical trial. We must clearly distinguish data collected in the supplement protocol from data collected in our chronic Hepatitis C virus clinical trial (discussed above). Prior to treating Ebola-infected patients, we must comply with specified patient protection procedures established by the applicable institution including its institutional review board. Also, we must report any unanticipated adverse events resulting from the supplement protocol to the FDA within 10 working days. Even if the protocol is established, and patients are treated, the results of such treatments may not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device. In addition, we cannot assure you that any Ebola-infected individuals will be treated under this protocol.

&#160;

Pre-Marketing Regulations in the U.S. 

&#160; 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device distributed commercially in the U.S. requires either prior 510(k) clearance or premarket approval, or PMA, from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Class I devices are subject to only general controls, such as establishment registration and device listing, labeling, medical device reporting, and prohibitions against adulteration and misbranding. Class II medical devices generally require prior 510(k) clearance before they may be commercially marketed in the U.S. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, are placed in Class III, generally requiring submission of a PMA supported by clinical trial data. Our Hemopurifier is a Class III product, and we believe that products utilizing our Aethlon ADAPT&#8482; system will be considered to be Class III products and thus will require submission and approval of a PMA. In the future, we may develop new products that are considered to be Class II and require the clearance of a 510(k).

&#160;

510(k) Clearance Pathway 

&#160; 

To obtain 510(k) clearance, a premarket notification must be submitted to FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications. FDA&#8217;s 510(k) clearance pathway usually takes from three to twelve months, but it can take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.

&#160;

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k), or a premarket approval, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#8217;s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or premarket approval is obtained. If the FDA requires a 510(k) holder to seek 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any modifications to a previously cleared product, the 510(k) holder also may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until this clearance or approval is obtained.

&#160;

&#160;

Premarket Approval Pathway 

&#160; 

A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to data obtained from technical, preclinical and clinical studies and relating to manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device.

&#160;

After a PMA submission is sufficiently complete, the FDA will accept the application and begin an in-depth review, which generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information already provided. Also, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel&#8217;s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR. New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device&#8217;s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling and design. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.

&#160;

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA. To perform a clinical trial in the U.S. for a significant risk device, FDA requires the device sponsor to file an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial. An IDE amendment or supplement must also be submitted before initiating a significant change to the clinical protocol or device under an existing IDE. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, and any available data on human clinical experience, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound.

&#160;

The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specific number of patients. Clinical trials conducted in the U.S. for significant risk devices may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, overseeing the welfare of the research subjects and responsible for that particular clinical trial. Under its regulations, the FDA responds to an IDE or an IDE amendment within 30 days. The FDA may approve the IDE or amendment, grant an approval with certain conditions, or identify deficiencies and request additional information. It is common for the FDA to require additional information before approving an IDE or amendment for a new trial, and thus final FDA approval on a submission may require more than the initial 30 days. The FDA may also require that a small-scale feasibility study be conducted before a pivotal trial may commence. In a feasibility trial, the FDA limits the number of patients, sites and investigators that may participate. Feasibility trials are typically structured to obtain information on safety and to help determine how large a pivotal trial should be to obtain statistically significant results.

&#160;

Clinical trials are subject to extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Our clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an IRB for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. We are also required to obtain the patients&#8217; informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA or the IRB may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA approval to market the product in the U.S.

Post-Marketing Regulations in the U.S. 

&#160; 

Should our Hemopurifier device be cleared for market use in the U.S. by the FDA, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; the FDA's Quality System Regulation which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or off-label uses; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; clearance or approval of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. &#160;

The regulations also require that we report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury.

&#160;

We will also be required to register with FDA as a medical device manufacturer within 30 days of commercial distribution of our products and must obtain all necessary state permits or licenses to operate our business. As a manufacturer, we are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by FDA to determine our compliance with quality system regulation and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or state authorities, which may include any of the following sanctions:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; &#160; &#183; unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; &#160; &#183; customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds; &#160; &#183; recall, detention or seizure of our products; &#160; &#183; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; &#160; &#183; refusing or delaying our requests for premarket approval of new products or modified products; &#160; &#183; operating restrictions; &#160; &#183; withdrawing PMA approvals that have already been granted; &#160; &#183; refusal to grant export approval for our products; or &#160; &#183; criminal prosecution. &#160; 

Compliance with U.S. Health Care Laws 

&#160; 

Should our Hemopurifier device be cleared for market use in the U.S. by the FDA, we must comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback regulations, as well as other healthcare laws in connection with the commercialization of our products. Fraud and abuse laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services and various state agencies.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b, as amended, prohibits persons, including a medical device manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), from knowingly or willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for a service or product or the purchasing, ordering, arranging for, or recommending the ordering of, any service or product for which payment may be made by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal healthcare program. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between medical device manufacturers on one hand and healthcare providers on the other. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, such as cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, waiver of payments, credit arrangements, ownership interests, the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment, and the provision of anything at less than its fair market value. Courts have broadly interpreted the scope of the law, holding that it may be violated if merely one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals, irrespective of the existence of other legitimate purposes. The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the healthcare industry. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was broadened by the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. In addition to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, many states have their own anti-kickback laws. Often, these laws closely follow the language of the federal law, although they do not always have the same scope, exceptions, safe harbors or sanctions. In some states, these anti-kickback laws apply not only to payments made by government healthcare programs but also to payments made by other third-party payors, including commercial insurance companies.

&#160;

We may also be subject to various federal and state marketing laws, such as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which generally require certain types of expenditures in the U.S. and the particular states to be tracked and reported. The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, maintenance of a payments database, and public reporting of the payment data. Device manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program are required to track and report such payments. Moreover, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and medical device companies to establish marketing compliance programs or even prohibit providing meals to prescribers or other marketing related activities. Compliance with such requirements may require investment in infrastructure to ensure that tracking and reporting is performed properly. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated.

&#160;

International Regulation 

&#160; 

International development and sales of medical devices are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. For example, the primary regulatory authority with respect to medical devices in Europe is that of the European Union. The unification of these countries into a common market has resulted in the unification of laws, standards and procedures across these countries, which may expedite the introduction of medical devices like those we are offering and developing.

&#160;

The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of relevant directives will be entitled to bear CE Conformity Marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the European Union. Actual implementation of these directives, however, may vary on a country-by-country basis.

&#160;

To date, we have not begun any process to obtain the CE Mark and have no immediate plans to test or commercialize the Hemopurifier in any European Union countries.

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Manufacturing of our Hemopurifier occurs in collaboration with a contract manufacturer based in San Diego, California that is compliant with the Good Manufacturing Practice regulations promulgated by the FDA. Our contract manufacturer is registered with the FDA. We also have received an export license from the FDA that allows the export our Hemopurifier for commercial purposes to India. To date, our manufacture of the Hemopurifier has been limited to quantities necessary to support our clinical studies.

&#160;

&#160;

Sources and Suppliers 

&#160; 

We are not dependent on any specific vendors for the materials used in our Hemopurifier. The key raw materials in the Hemopurifier include the affinity lectin Galanthus nivalis agglutinin, pharmaceutical grade diatomaceous earth, plasmapheresis cartridges and certain chemical binding agents. The affinity lectin is available from several life science supply companies in the U.S. Diatomaceous earth is available from several life science supply companies in the U.S. To date, we have purchased plasmapheresis cartridges from one vendor in Europe however similar cartridges are commercially available from vendors on a worldwide basis should that European vendor cease to be available for any reason, including prohibitive pricing. The chemical binding agents are available from a number of life science supply companies on a worldwide basis. We typically purchase our raw materials on purchase order basis. Therefore, we remain subject to risks of supply shortages and price increases that potentially could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results if and when we begin large scale manufacture of the Hemopurifier.

&#160;

The key raw materials used by Exosome Sciences, Inc. in its research are blood samples supplied by research partners and a number of chemical and lab products commercially available from vendors on a worldwide basis. Exosome Sciences, Inc. is not dependent on any specific vendors for the materials used in its research activities.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We do not currently have any sales and marketing capability. With respect to commercialization efforts in the future, we intend to build or contract for distribution, sales and marketing capabilities for any product candidate that is approved. From time to time, we have had and are having strategic discussions with potential collaboration partners for our product candidates, although no assurance can be given that we will be able to enter into one or more collaboration agreements for our product candidates on acceptable terms, if at all.

&#160;

Product Liability 

&#160; 

The risk of product liability claims, product recalls and associated adverse publicity is inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical products. We have limited clinical trial liability insurance coverage. We cannot assure you that future insurance coverage will be adequate or available. We may not be able to secure product liability insurance coverage on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed. Any liability for mandatory damages could exceed the amount of our coverage. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product recall could generate substantial negative publicity about our products and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future product candidates.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

We have five full-time employees consisting of our Chief Executive Officer, our President, our Chief Financial Officer, a research scientist and an executive assistant. We utilize, whenever appropriate, consultants in order to conserve cash and resources.

&#160;

We believe our employee relations are good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective-bargaining agreements.
