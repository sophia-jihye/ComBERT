Segments 

As of May 31, 2016, we, together with our unconsolidated affiliates, operated 82 manufacturing facilities in 24 states and 11 countries. A total of 31 of these facilities are operated by wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiaries of the Company. The remaining facilities are operated by our consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures. 

Our operations are managed principally on a products and services basis and are comprised of three primary operating segments which correspond with our reportable business segments: Steel Processing, Pressure Cylinders and Engineered Cabs. The Steel Processing operating segment consists of the Worthington Steel business unit (&#147;Worthington Steel&#148;) which operates 23 manufacturing facilities; Worthington Steelpac Systems, LLC (&#147;SteelPac&#148;), which designs and manufactures recyclable steel packaging solutions for the movement of products; and three consolidated joint ventures: Spartan Steel Coating, LLC (&#147;Spartan&#148;), which operates a cold-rolled hot dipped galvanizing line in Monroe, Michigan; TWB Company, L.L.C. (&#147;TWB&#148;), which operates a laser welded blank business headquartered in Monroe, Michigan; and Worthington Specialty Processing (&#147;WSP&#148;), which processes wide-sheet steel for the auto industry and operates three facilities in Michigan. The Pressure Cylinders operating segment consists of the Worthington Cylinders business unit (&#147;Worthington Cylinders&#148;) which operates 21 manufacturing facilities; and two consolidated joint ventures: Turkey-based Worthington Ar&#105;ta&#351; Bas&#105;n&#231;l&#105; Kaplar Sanayi (&#147;Worthington Aritas,&#148;), a manufacturer of cryogenic 

&#160; 

pressure vessels for LNG and other gas storage applications; and Utah-based dHybrid Systems, LLC (&#147;dHybrid&#148;), a manufacturer of CNG fuel systems primarily for heavy duty, refuse and other trucks. The Engineered Cabs operating segment consists of the Worthington Industries Engineered Cabs business unit (&#147;Engineered Cabs&#148;), which operates two manufacturing facilities. 

Our remaining operating segments include Construction Services and Worthington Energy Innovations (&#147;WEI&#148;), which are disclosed in the Other category for segment reporting purposes, as they do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure. Certain income and expense items not allocated to our operating segments are also included in the Other category as is activity related to the wind down of Construction Services. 

We hold equity positions in 12 active joint ventures, which are further discussed in the Joint Ventures section below. Of these, six are consolidated with their operating results reported within our reportable business segments as follows: Spartan, TWB, and WSP in Steel Processing; dHybrid and Worthington Ar&#105;tas in Pressure Cylinders; and WEI in Other. 

During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 (&#147;fiscal 2016&#148;), the Steel Processing, Pressure Cylinders and Engineered Cabs operating segments served approximately 1,000, 4,300, and 75 customers, respectively, located primarily in the United States. Foreign operations accounted for approximately 8% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2016 and were comprised primarily of sales to customers in Europe. No single customer accounted for over 10% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016. 

Refer to &#147;Item 8. &#150; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#150; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#150; Note N &#150; Segment Data&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a full description of our reportable business segments. 

Recent Developments 

On December 7, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the global CryoScience business of Taylor Wharton, including a manufacturing facility in Theodore, Alabama, for $30.6 million. The asset purchase was made pursuant to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of Taylor Wharton. The acquired net assets became part of the Pressure Cylinders operating segment upon closing. 

On January 15, 2016, the Company acquired the net assets of NetBraze, LLC, a manufacturer of brazing alloys, silver brazing filler metals, solders and fluxes, for $3.4 million. The acquired net assets became part of the Pressure Cylinders operating segment upon closing. 

As of March 1, 2016, the Company reached an agreement with United States Steel Corporation (&#147;U. S. Steel&#148;), its partner in the WSP joint venture, whereby the Company appoints a majority of the WSP Board of Directors, giving the Company effective control over the operations of WSP. As a result, we began consolidating the results of WSP within the financial results of Steel Processing beginning March 1, 2016. The ownership percentages in WSP remained unchanged at 51% Worthington and 49% U.S. Steel. 

Steel Processing 

Our Steel Processing operating segment consists of the Worthington Steel business unit, which includes SteelPac and our consolidated joint ventures, Spartan, TWB and for the last quarter of fiscal 2016, WSP. For fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, the percentage of consolidated net sales generated by Steel Processing was approximately 65%, 63%, and 62%, respectively. 

Worthington Steel is one of the largest independent intermediate processors of flat-rolled steel in the United States. It occupies a niche in the steel industry by focusing on products requiring exact specifications. These products cannot typically be supplied as efficiently by steel mills to the end-users of these products. 

&#160; 

The Steel Processing operating segment, including Spartan, TWB, and WSP, operates 23 manufacturing facilities located in Ohio (5), Michigan (5), Mexico (4), Alabama (2), Indiana (2), Tennessee (2), Kentucky (1), New York (1), and Canada (1). 

Our Steel Processing operating segment serves approximately 1,000 customers, principally in the automotive, aerospace, agricultural, appliance, construction, container, hardware, HVAC, lawn and garden, leisure and recreation, office furniture and office equipment markets. The automotive industry is one of the largest consumers of flat-rolled steel, and thus the largest end market for our Steel Processing operating segment. For fiscal 2016, Steel Processing&#146;s top three customers represented approximately 33% of the operating segment&#146;s total net sales. 

Our Steel Processing operating segment buys coils of steel from integrated steel mills and mini-mills and processes them to the precise type, thickness, length, width, shape and surface quality required by customer specifications. Computer-aided processing capabilities include, among others: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; cold reducing, which achieves close tolerances of thickness; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; configured blanking, which mechanically stamps steel into specific shapes; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; coil fed laser blanking, which uses lasers to cut coils of steel, aluminum and other metals into specific shapes; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; cutting-to-length, which cuts coils into sheets of exact length; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; dry-lube, the process of coating steel with a dry, soap-based lubricant; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; hot-dipped galvanizing, which coats steel with zinc and zinc alloys through a hot-dip process; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; hydrogen annealing, a thermal process that changes the hardness and certain metallurgical characteristics of steel; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; laser welding, which joins steel or aluminum blanks and coils with different thicknesses, coatings or material strength; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; pickling, a chemical process using an acidic solution to remove surface oxide which develops on hot-rolled steel; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; slitting, which cuts steel coils or steel sheets to specific widths; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; oscillate slitting, a slitting process that spools together several narrow coils welded end-to-end into one larger coil; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; temper rolling, which is the process of light cold-rolling steel; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; tension leveling, a method of applying pressure to achieve precise flatness tolerances; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; non-metallic coating, including acrylic and paint coating. 

Our Steel Processing operating segment also toll processes steel for steel mills, large end-users, service centers and other processors. Toll processing is different from typical steel processing in that the mill, end-user or other party retains title to the steel and has the responsibility for selling the end product. Toll processing enhances Worthington Steel&#146;s participation in the market for wide sheet steel and large standard orders, which is a market generally served by steel mills rather than by intermediate steel processors. 

The steel processing industry is fragmented and highly competitive. There are many competitors, including other independent intermediate processors. Competition is primarily on the basis of price, product quality and the ability to meet delivery requirements. Technical service and support for material testing and customer-specific applications enhance the quality of products (see &#147;Business &#150; Technical Services&#148;). However, the extent to which technical service capability has improved Worthington Steel&#146;s competitive 

&#160; 

position has not been quantified. Worthington Steel&#146;s ability to meet tight delivery schedules is, in part, based on the proximity of our facilities to customers, suppliers and one another. The extent to which plant location has impacted Worthington Steel&#146;s competitive position has not been quantified. Processed steel products are priced competitively, primarily based on market factors, including, among other things, market pricing, the cost and availability of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs, and overall economic conditions in the United States and abroad. 

On July 31, 2013, we purchased an additional 10% interest in TWB, increasing our ownership to a 55% controlling interest. As a result, TWB&#146;s results have been consolidated within Steel Processing since the acquisition date. TWB operates four facilities in the United States &#150; one facility in each of Kentucky and Michigan and two facilities in Tennessee &#150; one facility in Canada and four facilities in Mexico. 

During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we made certain organizational changes impacting the internal reporting and management structure of SteelPac. As a result of these organizational changes, management responsibilities and internal reporting were realigned under Steel Processing. SteelPac designs and manufactures reusable custom steel platforms, racks and pallets for supporting, protecting and handling products throughout the shipping process for customers in industries such as automotive, lawn and garden and recreational vehicles. SteelPac operates one facility in Indiana. 

As of March 1, 2016, the Company reached an agreement with U.S. Steel, its partner in the WSP joint venture, whereby the Company appoints a majority of the WSP Board of Directors, giving the Company effective control over the operations of WSP. As a result, we began consolidating the results of WSP within the financial results of our Steel Processing operating segment as of March 1, 2016. The ownership percentages in WSP remained unchanged at 51% Worthington and 49% U.S. Steel. 

Pressure Cylinders 

The Pressure Cylinders operating segment consists of the Worthington Cylinders business unit and two consolidated joint ventures: Worthington Aritas, a Turkish manufacturer of cryogenic pressure vessels for LNG and other gas storage applications; and dHybrid, which manufactures CNG fuel systems primarily for heavy duty, refuse and other trucks out of a facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. The percentage of consolidated net sales generated by Pressure Cylinders was approximately 30% in each of fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. 

Our Pressure Cylinders operating segment manufactures and sells filled and unfilled pressure cylinders, tanks, hand torches, and oil and gas equipment along with various accessories and related products for diversified end-use market applications. The following is a description of these markets: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Industrial Products: This market sector includes high pressure and acetylene cylinders for industrial gases, refrigerant and certain propane gas cylinders, hand torch cylinders and joining products such as solder and brazing rods and other specialty products. Cylinders in these markets are generally sold to gas producers, cylinder exchangers and industrial distributors. Industrial cylinders hold fuel for uses such as cutting, brazing and soldering, semiconductor production, and beverage delivery. Refrigerant gas cylinders are used to hold refrigerant gases for commercial, residential and automotive air conditioning and refrigeration systems. LPG cylinders hold fuel for barbeque grills, recreational vehicle equipment, residential and light commercial heating systems, industrial forklifts and commercial/residential cooking (the latter, generally outside North America). Specialty products include a variety of fire suppression and chemical tanks. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Consumer Products: This market sector includes propane-filled cylinders for torches, camping stoves and other applications, hand held torches and accessories, and Balloon Time &#174; helium-filled balloon kits. These products are sold primarily to mass merchandisers and distributors. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Alternative Fuels: This market sector includes composite and steel cylinders used to hold CNG and hydrogen for automobiles, buses, and light-duty trucks, and to hold propane/autogas for automobiles and light- and medium-duty trucks, as well as CNG fuel systems for heavy duty, refuse and other trucks. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Oil &#38; Gas Equipment: This market sector includes steel and fiberglass storage tanks, separation equipment, controls and other products primarily used in the energy markets, including oil and gas and nuclear. This sector also includes hoists and other marine products which are used principally in shipyard lift systems. It also leverages its manufacturing competencies to produce pressure vessels, atmospheric tanks, controls and various custom machined components for other industrial and agricultural end markets. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Cryogenics: This market sector includes cryogenic equipment, systems and services for handling liquid gases. Key product segments include LNG systems for marine and mining applications, liquid nitrogen storage freezers and shipping containers for organic specimens in healthcare markets, and tanks, trailers, and regasification plants for liquefied nitrogen, oxygen, argon, hydrogen, and natural gas. 

While a large percentage of Pressure Cylinders sales are made to major accounts, this operating segment serves approximately 4,300 customers. No single customer represented greater than 10% of net sales for the Pressure Cylinders operating segment during fiscal 2016. 

The Pressure Cylinders operating segment, including the Worthington Aritas and dHybrid consolidated joint ventures, operates 21 manufacturing facilities located in Alabama, California, Kansas (2), Massachusetts, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio (6), Oklahoma, Utah, Wisconsin, Austria, Poland (2), Portugal and Turkey. 

For sales in the United States and Canada, high-pressure and low-pressure cylinders are primarily manufactured in accordance with United States Department of Transportation and Transport Canada specifications. Outside the United States and Canada, cylinders are manufactured according to European norm specifications, as well as various other international standards. Other products are produced to applicable industry standards including, as applicable, those standards issued by the American Petroleum Institute, ASME and UL. 

Worthington Cylinders has one principal domestic competitor in the low-pressure non-refillable refrigerant market and one principal domestic competitor in the low-pressure LPG cylinder market. There are also several foreign competitors in these markets. We believe that Worthington Cylinders has the largest market share in its domestic low-pressure cylinder markets. In the other cylinder markets, there are several competitors. Worthington Cylinders is a leading supplier to the European markets for LNG vessels and for both the high-pressure cylinders and the low-pressure non-refillable cylinders. Worthington Cylinders generally has a strong competitive position for its industrial, energy, retail and specialty products, but competition varies on a product-by-product basis, and geographically for energy products. As with our other operating segments, competition is based upon price, service and quality. 

The Pressure Cylinders operating segment uses the trade name &#147;Worthington Cylinders&#148; to conduct business and the registered trademark &#147;Balloon Time &#174; &#148; to market helium-filled balloon kits; the registered trademark &#147;Bernzomatic &#174; &#148; to market certain fuel cylinders and hand held torches; the trademark &#147;WORTHINGTON PRO-GRADE&#148; to market certain LPG cylinders, hand torches and camping fuel cylinders; and the registered trademarks &#147;MAP-PRO &#174; &#148; and &#147;Pro-Max &#174; &#148; to market certain hand torch cylinders. 

Engineered Cabs 

The Engineered Cabs operating segment consists of the Worthington Industries Engineered Cabs business unit. For fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, the percentage of consolidated net sales generated by Engineered Cabs was approximately 4%, 6%, and 7%, respectively. 

Engineered Cabs is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio and operates two primary manufacturing facilities, one in each of South Dakota and Tennessee, which are located near key assembly locations of original equipment manufacturers. The Company closed its facility in Florence, South Carolina on September 30, 2015. The majority of the Florence, South Carolina business was moved to the facility in Greeneville, Tennessee. 

&#160; 

Engineered Cabs is a non-captive designer and manufacturer of high-quality, custom-engineered open and enclosed cabs and operator stations and custom fabrications for heavy mobile equipment used primarily in the agricultural, construction, forestry, military and mining industries. Engineered Cabs&#146; product design, engineering support and broad manufacturing capabilities enable it to produce cabs and structures used in products ranging from small utility equipment to the large earthmovers. 

In addition to its engineered cab products, this operating segment has the capability to provide a full suite of complementary products such as machined structural components, complex and painted weldments, engine doors, boom components and complete frames. Engineered Cabs has the manufacturing capability for steel laser cutting, steel bending and forming, roll-form tube curving and bending, machining, welding &#150; robotic and manual, automated steel product cleaning and E-coating, top coat painting and assembly. 

Engineered Cabs produces products for over 150 different equipment platforms for approximately 75 customers. For fiscal 2016, Engineered Cabs&#146; top three customers represented approximately 73% of the operating segment&#146;s total net sales. Its production levels can range from small and medium production volumes through high volume productions. 

Engineered Cabs competes with a limited number of non-captive producers of engineered cabs in the United States, although there are numerous other suppliers who can perform various functions supplied by the Company. Some customers can also produce operator cabs in-house. The Company&#146;s competitive strengths include design and engineering capabilities as well as broad manufacturing capabilities, often providing a fully-integrated complete cab at a more effective cost than customers can produce in-house. Competitive drivers are related to price, quality, delivery and service. 

Key supplies for this operating segment include steel sheet and plate, stampings, steel tubing, hardware, controls, wiper systems, glazing materials (glass, polycarbonate), perishables (paint, urethane, caulk), electrical materials, HVAC systems and aesthetic materials (acoustical trim, plastics, foam), which are available from a variety of sources. 

Other 

The Other category includes the Construction Services and WEI operating segments, which do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure, as well as other corporate-related entities. 

Construction Services . The Company is in the process of winding down this business, which involved the supply and construction of single family housing, with a focus on military housing. 

Worthington Energy Innovations . This operating segment is comprised of our 75%-owned and consolidated joint venture, WEI, which is described in more detail in the Joint Ventures section below.

During these same three fiscal years, our unconsolidated joint ventures had operations in China, France, Mexico, Spain 

&#160; 

(through December 2013), the United Kingdom and the United States. Summary information about our foreign operations, including net sales and fixed assets by geographic region, is provided in &#147;Item 8. &#150; Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#150; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#150; Note A &#150; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies &#150; Risks and Uncertainties&#148; and &#147;Note N &#150; Segment Data&#148; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Suppliers 

The primary raw material purchased by Worthington is steel. We purchase steel in large quantities at regular intervals from major primary producers of steel, both domestic and foreign. The amount purchased from any particular supplier varies from year to year depending on a number of factors including market conditions, then current relationships and prices and terms offered. In nearly all market conditions, steel is available from a number of suppliers and generally any supplier relationship or contract can and has been replaced with little or no significant interruption to our business. During fiscal 2016, we purchased approximately 1.8 million tons of steel (84% hot-rolled, 12% cold-rolled and 4% galvanized) on a consolidated basis. 

In the Steel Processing operating segment, steel is primarily purchased and processed based on specific customer orders. The Pressure Cylinders and Engineering Cabs operating segments purchase steel to meet production schedules. For certain raw materials, there are more limited suppliers &#150; for example, helium and zinc, which are generally purchased at market prices. Since there are a limited number of suppliers in the helium and zinc markets, if delivery from a major supplier is disrupted due to a force majeure type occurrence, it may be difficult to obtain an alternative supply. Raw materials are generally purchased in the open market on a negotiated spot-market basis at prevailing market prices. Supply contracts are also entered into, some of which have fixed pricing and some of which are indexed (monthly or quarterly). During fiscal 2016, we purchased steel from the following major suppliers, in alphabetical order: AK Steel Corporation; ArcelorMittal; Essar Steel Algoma Inc.; NLMK USA; North Star BlueScope Steel, LLC; Nucor Corporation; Steel Dynamics, Inc.; and U.S. Steel. Major suppliers of aluminum to the Pressure Cylinders operating segment in fiscal 2016 were, in alphabetical order: Alcoa; DK Tech Co; and Sapa Group. Major suppliers of zinc to the Steel Processing operating segment were, in alphabetical order: Considar Metal Marketing Inc. (a/k/a HudBay); Glencore Ltd; and Teck Cominco Limited. Approximately 32.1 million pounds of zinc were purchased in fiscal 2016. We believe our supplier relationships are good. 

Technical Services 

We employ a staff of engineers and other technical personnel, and we maintain fully equipped laboratories to support operations. These facilities enable verification, analysis and documentation of the physical, chemical, metallurgical and mechanical properties of raw materials and products. Technical Service personnel also work in conjunction with the sales force to specify components and materials required to fulfill customer needs. Engineers at Engineered Cabs design cabs and cab manufacturing processes according to applicable industry standards. To provide these services, we maintain a continuing program of developmental engineering with respect to product characteristics and product performance under applicable operating conditions. Laboratory facilities also perform metallurgical and chemical testing as dictated by the regulations of the United States Department of Transportation, Transport Canada, and other associated agencies, along with International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ASTM, and other customer and industry specific requirements. An IASI (International Accreditations Service, Incorporated) accredited product material testing laboratory supports some of these efforts. 

Seasonality and Backlog 

Sales are generally strongest in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as our operating segments are generally operating at seasonal peaks. Historically, sales have generally been weaker in the third quarter of 

&#160; 

our fiscal year, primarily due to reduced activity in the building and construction industry as a result of inclement weather, as well as customer plant shutdowns, particularly in the automotive industry, due to holidays. We do not believe backlog is a significant indicator of our business. 

Employees 

As of May 31, 2016, we had approximately 10,000 employees, including those employed by our unconsolidated joint ventures. Approximately 8% of our consolidated labor force is represented by collective bargaining units. Worthington believes it has good relationships with its employees, including those covered by collective bargaining units. 

Joint Ventures 

As part of our strategy to selectively develop new products, markets and technological capabilities and to expand our international presence, while mitigating the risks and costs associated with those activities, we participate in six consolidated and six unconsolidated joint ventures.
