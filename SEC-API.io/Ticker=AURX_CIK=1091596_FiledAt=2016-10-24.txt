 Item 1. Business &#8211; Bankruptcy and Emergence from Bankruptcy ,&#8221; the Company emerged from bankruptcy protection effective May 5, 2016 in accordance with the Modified First Amended Plan of Reorganization of the Debtor under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, as confirmed by the April 25, 2016 Order Granting Final Approval of Disclosure Statement and Confirming Debtor&#8217;s Plan of Reorganization (as so confirmed, the &#8220;Plan of Reorganization&#8221;).

&#160;

During the pendency of its Chapter 11 case and following the date of the Company&#8217;s emergence from bankruptcy on May 5, 2016, in addition to their regular financial reporting duties, the Company&#8217;s management team and finance and accounting personnel were required to devote significant time and attention to matters relating to and on the preparation of materials required in connection with the Chapter 11 case and the Plan of Reorganization, including monthly and quarterly reports which the Company filed under cover of Current Reports on Form 8-K. 

&#160;

As a result, the Company was unable to file this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (this &#8220;Annual Report&#8221;), Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016 (the &#8220;First Quarter 10-Q&#8221;) and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016 (the &#8220;Second Quarter 10-Q&#8221;) within the prescribed time periods because of the limitations on staffing, the Company&#8217;s limited financial resources and the significant additional burdens that the Chapter 11 case imposed on the Company&#8217;s available human and financial resources. Such inability could not have been eliminated by the Company without unreasonable effort or expense.

&#160;

Following its emergence from bankruptcy on May 5, 2016, the Company commenced the process of preparing the Annual Report, First Quarter 10-Q and Second Quarter 10-Q.

&#160;

This document represents the Annual Report. It contains the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the accompanying footnotes (the &#8220;2015 Financial Statements&#8221;), as well as a discussion comparing the Company&#8217;s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 in the section titled &#8220; Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8221; (the &#8220;Period-to-Period Comparison&#8221;). Unless otherwise specified therein, the historical financial and share-based information contained in the 2015 Financial Statements and the Period-to-Period Comparison reflects the Company&#8217;s status as of and for time periods that ended prior to the Company&#8217;s reorganization, and therefore is not indicative of the Company&#8217;s current financial condition or results of operations from and after May 5, 2016.

&#160;

More specifically, following the consummation of the Plan of Reorganization, the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations from and after May 5, 2016 will not be comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in the Company&#8217;s prior financial statements (including those contained in this Annual Report) due to the Company&#8217;s application of fresh-start accounting to time periods beginning on and after May 5, 2016. Fresh-start accounting requires the Company to adjust its assets and liabilities contained in its financial statements immediately before its emergence from bankruptcy protection to their estimated fair values using the acquisition method of accounting. Those adjustments are material and affect the Company&#8217;s financial condition and results of operations from and after May 5, 2016. For that reason, it is difficult to assess our performance in periods beginning on or after May 5, 2016 in relation to prior periods.

&#160;

The Company is contemporaneously herewith filing its First Quarter 10-Q and Second Quarter 10-Q. Investors should note that the Company filed for bankruptcy protection during the first quarter 2016 and emerged from bankruptcy protection during the second quarter 2016. The financial and share-based information contained in the unaudited financial statements and period-to-period comparisons included in the Second Quarter 10-Q that relates to dates and time periods from and after May 5, 2016 will therefore differ significantly from the corresponding information presented in this Annual Report.

&#160;

Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.
