As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires or indicates, references to &#8220;Swift Energy,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;ours&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to Swift Energy Company. See pages 24 &#32;and 25 &#32;for explanations of abbreviations and terms used herein. 

Overview 

Swift Energy Company, a Texas corporation founded in 1979, is an independent oil and gas company engaged in developing, exploring, acquiring, and operating oil and gas properties. Our primary focus is on the Eagle Ford trend of South Texas and, to a lesser extent, the onshore and inland waters of Louisiana. We operate approximately 97% &#32;of the properties that we own and we have implemented leading edge technologies to maximize the discovery, development and production of our potential reserve base in the Eagle Ford and other areas where we operate. As a result of the significant resource potential from our properties in the Eagle Ford, we plan to invest a significant portion from our total 2016 planned capital expenditures in this area. 

At December 31, 2015 , we had estimated proved reserves of 70.3 &#32;MMBoe with a PV-10 Value of $374.0 &#32;million (PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure, see the section titled &#8220;Oil and Natural Gas Reserves&#8221; of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, the closest GAAP measure). This is a decrease of approximately 124 MMBoe from year-end 2014 proved reserves quantities due to the impact of lower commodity prices and uncertainties, due in part to our bankruptcy filing, surrounding the availability of the financing that would be necessary to develop our proved undeveloped reserves. Our total proved reserves at December 31, 2015 &#32;were approximately 14% &#32;crude oil, 74% &#32;natural gas, and 12% &#32;NGLs while 80% &#32;of our total proved reserves were developed. Approximately 90% &#32;of our proved reserves are located in Texas with the remainder in Louisiana. 

Bankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11 

On December 31, 2015, the Company and eight of its subsidiaries (the &#8220;Chapter 11 Subsidiaries&#8221;) filed voluntary petitions seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (In re Swift Energy Company, et al, Case No. 15-12670). The Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries are currently operating our business as debtors in possession in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Court has granted all motions filed by the Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries that were designed primarily to minimize the impact of the Chapter 11 proceedings on the Company&#8217;s operations, customers and employees. As a result the Company is not only able to conduct normal business activities and pay all associated obligations for the period following its bankruptcy filing, it is also authorized to pay and has paid (subject to caps applicable to payments of certain pre-petition obligations), pre-petition employee wages and benefits, pre-petition amounts owed to certain lienholders and critical vendors, pre-petition amounts owed to pipeline owners that transport the Company&#8217;s production, and funds belonging to third parties, including royalty holders and partners. During the pendency of the Chapter 11 case, all transactions outside the ordinary course of our business require the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. As a result of the automatic stay, which became effective upon the commencement of the Chapter 11 case, most judicial or administrative actions against the Company and efforts by creditors to collect on or otherwise exercise rights or remedies with respect to pre-petition claims are stayed. 

On February 5, 2016, the Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries filed with the Bankruptcy Court a joint plan of reorganization (the &#8220;Plan&#8221;), which is supported by an ad hoc committee of the Company&#8217;s noteholders. The Plan is subject to confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court. If the Plan is ultimately approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the Company and the Chapter 11 Subsidiaries would exit bankruptcy pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Under the Plan, the holders of the Company&#8217;s senior notes and certain other unsecured creditors, together with the lenders under the debtor-in-possession credit agreement, are to receive 96% of the new common stock to be issued upon emergence of the Company from bankruptcy, with the remaining 4% to be issued to the Company&#8217;s then-current equity holders. Claims of other creditors would be paid in full in cash, reinstated or otherwise treated in a manner acceptable to the creditors. 

The Bankruptcy Court has approved the Company&#8217;s disclosure statement with respect to the Plan, and the Company is in the process of soliciting votes with respect to the Plan. A confirmation hearing on the Plan is scheduled on March 30, 2016 in the Bankruptcy Court. 

For a further description of these matters, see Note 1A to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

As a consequence of depressed oil prices and our limited liquidity (See &#8220;2016 Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis in this Form 10-K report), as disclosed in our Bankruptcy Court filings, the Company&#8217;s current $78.0 million capital budget for 2016 is significantly reduced from 2015 levels, and includes $66 million for completion 

costs for 12 previously drilled but not completed wells, drilling and completion of 4 wells, drilling but not completion of 8 additional wells, and recompletion of 8 wells. The budget also includes $12.0 million for anticipated regulatory, corporate and other capital costs. 

For the duration of our Chapter 11 proceedings, our operations and our ability to develop and execute our business plan are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with the Chapter 11 proceedings as described in Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; As a result of these risks and uncertainties, the number of our outstanding shares and our stockholders, assets, liabilities, officers and/or directors could be significantly different following the outcome of the Chapter 11 proceedings, and the description of our operations, properties and capital plans included in this Annual Report may not accurately reflect our operations, properties and capital plans following the Chapter 11 process. 

Pending Sale of Interests in South Bearhead Creek and Burr Ferry Louisiana Fields to Texegy LLC 

On December 31, 2015 the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Texegy LLC (Texegy) to sell a full participating 75% working interest of Swift Energy&#8217;s position in the South Bearhead Creek Field and Burr Ferry Field located in Allen, Avoyelles, Vernon, Sabine and Beauregard Parishes in central Louisiana. The Bankruptcy Court approved the sale on February 2, 2016. To date, Swift Energy has received two equal cash deposits aggregating $4.9 million from Texegy, the second of which was made upon Bankruptcy Court approval of the sale on February 2, 2016. The purchase agreement provides for Texegy to pay Swift Energy approximately $49.0 million in cash consideration, which is subject to closing adjustments and adjustments for interim operations between January 1, 2016 and the closing date. Upon closing, which the purchase and sale agreement provides will occur on or prior to March 15, 2016 unless a later date is agreed to by both parties, Swift will retain approximately $13.0 million of the closing proceeds (subject to the same adjustments), with the balance to be paid to the Company&#8217;s first-lien secured lenders under the Company&#8217;s credit facility. The properties being sold represent approximately 5% of the Company's total proved reserves as of December 31, 2015. 

In addition to paying for its share of costs, Texegy has agreed to carry a portion of the Company&#8217;s field development costs, which are limited to the Company&#8217;s 25% share of all costs for the drilling of two wells to casing point in the South Bearhead Creek Field. On the closing date, Swift Energy and Texegy plan to enter into a joint development agreement and a joint operating agreement (together, the &#8220;JV Agreements&#8221;) to continue operation and development of the Properties, with a Texegy affiliate serving as the operator of the Properties that will conduct all drilling, completion and production operations. Under the JV Agreements, future development plans for the field will be mutually agreed upon by the Company and Texegy. 

Business Strategy 

Our business strategy is primarily focused on exploiting our unconventional reserves from the Eagle Ford and, to a lesser extent, exploiting our more conventional reserves in Louisiana. 

&#8226; 

Develop our Eagle Ford shale resource play . We have a long successful history operating oil and gas wells and finding reserves in South Texas. We first acquired producing Olmos properties in our AWP field in 1989. This area has remained a cornerstone of our operations since we first began drilling here in 1994. While the combination of proven drilling and completion technologies have allowed us to exploit the Eagle Ford shale, we have applied the same methods to further develop the &#8220;mature&#8221; Olmos sand, substantially increasing our Olmos production. The application of horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing technology has resulted in increases in production and decreases in completion and operating costs in our South Texas Olmos and Eagle Ford operations. During 2015, we drilled 24 &#32;horizontal Eagle Ford wells. Focusing on the Eagle Ford play allows us to use our operating, technical and regional expertise to interpret geological and operating trends, enhance production rates and maximize well recovery. We are focused on enhancing the value of our assets through operating improvements that utilize cost-effective technology to locate the highest quality intervals to drill and complete oil and gas wells. For instance, we are using proprietary 3D seismic techniques to identify a narrow high quality interval of the lower Eagle Ford within which to steer our laterals, resulting in marked improvement in our recent well results. Our 2016 plans include completing 12 previously drilled (but not completed) wells and drilling (but not completing) an additional 8 new wells. 

&#8226; 

Operate our properties as a low-cost producer. &#32;We believe our concentrated acreage position in the Eagle Ford and our experience as an operator of virtually all of our properties enables us to apply drilling and completion techniques and economies of scale that improve the returns that we are able to achieve. Operating control allows us to better manage timing and risk as well as the cost of infrastructure, drilling and ongoing operations . &#32;We generally drill multiple wells from a single pad, which reduces facilities costs and surface impact. Our operational control is critical to us being able to transfer successful drilling and completion techniques from one field to another. 

&#8226; 

Emerge from bankruptcy: Our current schedule is to emerge from bankruptcy within 110 days of our December 31, 2015 Chapter 11 filing. We expect that we will exit bankruptcy with an improved balance sheet and additional liquidity. This should allow us to access capital necessary to maintain, and in some cases, improve our asset base. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

Experienced technical team. &#32; We employ 43 &#32;oil and gas technical professionals, including geophysicists, petrophysicists, geologists, petroleum engineers and production and reservoir engineers, who have an average of approximately 21 &#32;years of experience in their technical fields and have been employed by us for an average of approximately eight &#32;years. In addition, we engage experienced and qualified consultants to perform various comprehensive seismic acquisitions, processing, reprocessing, interpretation, and other related services. We continually apply our extensive in-house experience and current technologies to benefit our drilling and production operations. 

Operating Areas 

Our operations are primarily focused in three core areas identified as South Texas, Southeast Louisiana and Central Louisiana. The following table sets forth information regarding our 2015 &#32;year-end proved reserves of 70.3 &#32;MMBoe and production of 11.7 &#32;MMBoe by area:

South Texas 

AWP . During 2015 , the Company drilled 5 &#32;wells in AWP targeting the Eagle Ford formation. All wells in this field were drilled and are operated by Swift Energy. Our proved reserves in this formation are 54% &#32;natural gas, 26% &#32;NGLs, and 20% &#32;oil on a Boe basis. As of December 31, 2015 we had 4 &#32;wells drilled that were waiting on completion. These wells were subsequently completed in February of 2016. 

In the Olmos formation, the wells are operated and owned by Swift Energy and our reserves in this formation are approximately 58% &#32;natural gas, 28% &#32;NGLs, and 14% &#32;oil on a Boe basis. 

Artesia Wells . Our December 31, 2015 &#32;proved reserves in this formation are 48% &#32;natural gas, 37% &#32;NGLs, and 15% &#32;oil on a Boe basis. 

Fasken . During 2015 , the Company drilled 19 &#32;wells in Fasken targeting the Eagle Ford formation. All wells in this field were drilled and are operated by Swift Energy. Our reserves in this Eagle Ford formation are 100% &#32;natural gas. At December 31, 2015 , we had drilled 8 &#32;proved undeveloped locations that are expected to be completed in the first and second quarters of 2016. 

On July 15, 2014, we closed a transaction with Saka Energi to fully develop 8,300 acres of natural gas Eagle Ford shale properties in our Fasken field. Saka Energi purchased a 36% full participating interest in the properties. Refer to Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of this transaction. 

Southeast Louisiana 

Lake Washington. Since its discovery in the 1930's, the field has produced over 300 million Boe from multiple stacked Miocene sand layers radiating outward from a central salt dome which are heavily faulted, thereby creating a large number of potential hydrocarbon traps. Approximately 98% &#32;of our proved reserves in this field consisted of oil and NGLs which are gathered to several platforms located in water depths from 2 to 12 feet, with drilling and workover operations performed with rigs on barges. 

In 2015 &#32;we did not drill any wells in Lake Washington, but we did perform numerous production enhancement operations including sliding sleeve changes, gas lift modifications and well stimulations. 

Central Louisiana 

Burr Ferry. &#32;This field is predominately located in Vernon Parish, Louisiana. The reserves are approximately 62% &#32;oil and NGLs. 

South Bearhead Creek. This field is located in Beauregard Parish, Louisiana and is a large east-west trending anticline closure. Wells drilled in this field are completed in a multiple set of separate sands in the Wilcox formation. 

On December 31, 2015, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Texegy LLC to sell to Texegy 75% of Swift Energy&#8217;s position in the South Bearhead Creek and Burr Ferry Fields. Refer to Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of this transaction. 

Oil and Natural Gas Reserves 

The following tables present information regarding proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to our interests in producing properties as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 . The information set forth in the tables regarding reserves is based on proved reserves reports we have prepared in accordance with SEC rules. Our Chief Reservoir Engineer, the primary technical person responsible for overseeing the preparation of our 2015 reserves estimates, holds a bachelor's degree in geology, is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the Society of Professional Well Log Analysts, and has over 25 years of experience in petrophysical analysis, reservoir engineering, and reserves estimation. H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc., Houston, Texas, independent petroleum engineers, has audited 99% &#32;of our proved reserves for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 97% &#32;of our proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 . The audit by H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. conformed to the meaning of the term &#8220;reserves audit&#8221; as presented in Regulation S-K, Item 1202. The technical person at H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. primarily responsible for overseeing the audit, is a Licensed Professional Engineer, holds a degree in petroleum engineering, is past Chairman of the Gulf Coast Section of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, is past President of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and has over 30 years of experience overseeing reserves audits. Based on their 

audit, it is the judgment of H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. that Swift Energy used appropriate engineering, geologic, and evaluation principles and methods that are consistent with practices generally accepted in the petroleum industry. 

The reserves estimation process involves members of the reserves and evaluation department who report to the Chief Reservoir Engineer as well as engineers whose duty is to prepare estimates of reserves in accordance with the Commission's rules, regulations and guidelines, and who are part of multi-disciplinary teams responsible for each of the Company's major core asset areas. The multi-disciplinary teams consist of experienced reservoir engineers, geologists and other oil and gas professionals. A majority of our asset team reservoir engineers involved in the reserves estimation process have over 10 years of reservoir engineering experience. The Chief Reservoir Engineer supervises this process with multiple levels of review and reconciliation of reserves estimates to ensure they conform to SEC guidelines. Reserves data is also reported to and reviewed by senior management and the Board of Directors on a periodic basis. At year-end, a reserves audit is performed by the third-party engineering firm, H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc., to ensure the integrity and reasonableness of our reserves estimates. In addition, our independent Board members meet with H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. in executive session at least annually to review the annual reserves audit report and the overall reserves audit process. 

A reserves audit and a financial audit are separate activities with unique and different processes and results. As currently defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission within Regulation S-K, Item 1202, a reserves audit is the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts interpreted and assumptions underlying a reserves estimate prepared by another party and the rendering of an opinion about the appropriateness of the methodologies employed, the adequacy and quality of the data relied upon, the depth and thoroughness of the reserves estimation process, the classification of reserves appropriate to the relevant definitions used, and the reasonableness of the estimated reserves quantities. A financial audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. A financial audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 

Estimates of future net revenues from our proved reserves and their PV-10 Value (a non-GAAP measure defined below), for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 &#32;are made based on the preceding 12-months' average adjusted price after differentials based on closing prices on the first business day of each month, excluding the effects of hedging and are held constant, for that year's reserves calculation, throughout the life of the properties, except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment, including, in the case of natural gas contracts, the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations. We have interests in certain tracts that are estimated to have additional hydrocarbon reserves that cannot be classified as proved and are not reflected in the following tables. 

The following prices are used to estimate our year-end PV-10 Value. The 12-month 2015 &#32;average adjusted prices after differentials for operations were $2.61 &#32;per Mcf of natural gas, $49.58 &#32;per barrel of oil, and $14.64 &#32;per barrel of NGL, compared to $4.32 &#32;per Mcf of natural gas, $93.64 &#32;per barrel of oil, and $33.00 &#32;per barrel of NGL for 2014 &#32;and $3.41 &#32;per Mcf of natural gas, $104.38 &#32;per barrel of oil, and $31.68 &#32;per barrel of NGL for 2013 . 

The following tables set forth estimates of future net revenues presented on the basis of unescalated prices and costs in accordance with criteria prescribed by the SEC and their PV-10 Value as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 . Operating costs, development costs, asset retirement obligation costs, and certain production-related taxes were deducted in arriving at the estimated future net revenues. No provision was made for income taxes. The estimates of future net revenues and their present value differ in this respect from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows set forth in supplemental information to our consolidated financial statements (the "Standardized Measure"), which is calculated after provision for future income taxes. 

At December 31, 2015, we had estimated proved reserves of 70.3 MMBoe with a PV-10 Value of $374 million. This is a decrease of approximately 124 MMBoe from year-end 2014 proved reserves due to the impact of lower commodity prices and uncertainties, due in part to our bankruptcy filing, surrounding the availability of the financing that would be necessary to develop our proved undeveloped reserves. Our total proved reserves at December 31, 2015 were approximately 14% crude oil, 74% natural gas, and 12% NGLs, while 80% of our total proved reserves were developed. Approximately 90% of our proved reserves are located in Texas with the remainder in Louisiana. The following amounts shown in MBoe below are based on a natural gas conversion factor of 6 Mcf to 1 Boe:

(2) The PV-10 Values as of December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 &#32;are net of $57.8 &#32;million, $85.5 &#32;million, and $87.0 &#32;million of asset retirement obligation liabilities, respectively. 

(3) The decrease in 2015 reserves volumes is due to the impact of lower commodity prices and uncertainties, due in part to our bankruptcy filing, surrounding the availability of the financing that would be necessary to develop our proved undeveloped reserves. 

. 

Proved reserves are estimates of hydrocarbons to be recovered in the future. Reserves estimation is a subjective process of estimating the sizes of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Reserves reports of other engineers might differ from the reports contained herein. Results of drilling, testing, and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimates. Future prices received for the sale of oil and natural gas may be different from those used in preparing these reports. The amounts and timing of future operating and development costs may also differ from those used. Accordingly, reserves estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. There can be no assurance that these estimates are accurate predictions of the present value of future net cash flows from oil and natural gas reserves. 

PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure. The closest GAAP measure to the PV-10 Value is the Standardized Measure. We believe the PV-10 Value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure because the PV-10 Value is a widely used measure within the industry and is commonly used by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the 

value of proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties. We use the PV-10 Value in our ceiling test computations, for comparison against our debt balances, to evaluate properties that are bought and sold and to assess the potential return on investment in our oil and gas properties. PV-10 Value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our PV-10 Value and the Standardized Measure do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. 

The following table provides a reconciliation between the PV-10 Value and the Standardized Measure.

During 2015 , our proved undeveloped reserves decreased by approximately 114 MMBoe due to the impact of lower commodity prices and uncertainties , due in part to our bankruptcy filing, surrounding the availability of the financing that would be necessary to develop our proved undeveloped reserves, as disclosed in Note 1A of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. We also incurred approximately $47 million in capital expenditures during the year which resulted in the conversion of 15 MMBoe of our December 31, 2014 proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, primarily in the Fasken field. 

The PV-10 Value from our proved undeveloped reserves was $53.0 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 , which was approximately 14% &#32;of our total PV-10 Value of $374.0 million . The PV-10 Value of our proved undeveloped reserves, by year of booking was 26% &#32;in 2014 &#32;and 74% &#32;in 2013 . 

Sensitivity of Reserves to Pricing 

As of December 31, 2015 , a 5% increase in oil and NGL pricing would increase our total estimated proved reserves of 70.3 &#32;MMBoe by approximately 0.7 MMBoe, and would increase the PV-10 Value of $374.0 million &#32;by approximately $18 million. Similarly, a 5% decrease in oil and NGL pricing would decrease our total estimated proved reserves by approximately 0.8 MMBoe and would decrease the PV-10 Value by approximately $18 million. 

As of December 31, 2015 , a 5% increase in natural gas pricing would increase our total estimated proved reserves by approximately 1.0 MMBoe and would increase the PV-10 Value by approximately $22 million. Similarly, a 5% decrease in natural gas pricing would decrease our total estimated proved reserves by approximately 1.1 MMBoe and would decrease the PV-10 Value by approximately $21 million.

The Company holds the fee mineral (royalty) interest in a portion of the acreage located in Central Louisiana. The above table includes acreage where Swift Energy is the fee mineral owner as well as a working interest owner. This acreage included in the above table totals 66,073 gross and net undeveloped acres and 20,174 gross and net developed acres. The Company also owns fee mineral interest in approximately 16,295 acres that are currently unleased and not included in the table above. Swift owns a total of 86,247 mineral acres. 

(2) 

In South Texas a substantial portion of our Eagle Ford and Olmos acreage overlaps. In most cases the Eagle Ford and Olmos rights are contracted under separate lease agreements. For the purposes of the above table, a surface acre where we have leased both the Eagle Ford and Olmos rights is counted as a single acre. Acreage which is developed in any formation is counted in the developed acreage above, even though there may also be undeveloped acreage in other formations. In the Eagle Ford, we have 36,994 &#32;gross and 30,270 &#32;net developed acres and 47,308 &#32;gross and 39,310 &#32;net undeveloped acres. A large portion of our undeveloped Eagle Ford acreage underlies developed Olmos acreage. In the Olmos, we have 50,276 &#32;gross and 46,877 &#32;net developed acres and 26,169 &#32;gross and 22,801 &#32;net undeveloped acres. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Swift Energy's net undeveloped acreage subject to expiration over the next three years, if not renewed, is approximately 14% &#32;in 2016, 26% &#32;in 2017 and 14% &#32;in 2018. In most cases, acreage scheduled to expire can be held through drilling operations or we can exercise extension options. As of February 29, 2016, 2,643 net undeveloped acres have expired during the current year. The exploration potential of all undeveloped acreage is fully evaluated before expiration. In each fiscal year where undeveloped acreage is subject to expiration our intent is to reduce the expirations through either development or extensions, if we believe it is commercially advantageous to do so. Due to the bankruptcy proceedings and depressed commodity prices, it is possible that we may not have the ability to do so.

Present Activities 

As of December 31, 2015 , we were in the process of drilling one development well in our Fasken field which has a 64% working interest. In the first quarter of 2016, we have begun the process of conducting completion operations for 12 wells (approximately 9 net wells) drilled during the third and fourth quarters of 2015. 

We are also currently developing and implementing a number of operational cost reduction initiatives, including a plan to reconfigure the production gathering system in the Lake Washington field to consolidate production into one platform. We are also planning to temporarily shut in a number of our wells with marginal production. Implementation of these initiatives, in addition to other initiatives being planned, is expected to result in significant operating expense reductions. 

Operations 

We generally seek to be the operator of the wells in which we have a significant economic interest. As operator, we design and manage the development of a well and supervise operation and maintenance activities on a day-to-day basis. We do not own drilling rigs or other oil field services equipment used for drilling or maintaining wells on properties we operate. Independent contractors supervised by us provide this equipment and personnel. We employ drilling, production, and reservoir engineers, geologists, and other specialists who work to improve production rates, increase reserves, and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties. 

Operations on our oil and natural gas properties are customarily conducted in accordance with COPAS guidelines. We charge a monthly per-well supervision fee to the wells we operate including our wells in which we own up to a 100% working interest. Supervision fees vary widely depending on the geographic location and depth of the well and whether the well produces oil or natural gas. The fees for these activities in 2015 &#32;totaled $9.2 million &#32;and ranged from $250 &#32;to $2,029 &#32;per well per month. 

Marketing of Production 

We typically sell our oil and natural gas production at market prices near the wellhead or at a central point after gathering and/or processing. We usually sell our natural gas in the spot market on a monthly basis, while we sell our oil at prevailing market prices. We do not refine any oil we produce. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 , Shell Oil Company and affiliates accounted for 16% , 21% &#32;and 33% &#32;of our total oil and gas gross receipts, respectively. Kinder Morgan, Plains Marketing and Howard Energy accounting for approximately 27% , 18% &#32;and 13% &#32;of our total oil and gas gross receipts in 2015, respectively. Kinder Morgan and Plains Marketing accounted for approximately 20% &#32;and 11% &#32;of our total oil and gas gross receipts in 2014, while BP America accounted for approximately 21% &#32;of our total oil and gas gross receipts in 2013. Credit losses in each of the last three years were immaterial. 

We have gas processing and gathering agreements with Southcross Energy for a majority of our natural gas production in the AWP area. Other gas production in the AWP area is processed or transported under arrangements with DCP Midstream and Enterprise. Oil production is transported to market by truck and sold at prevailing market prices. 

We have a gathering agreement with Howard Energy providing for the transportation of our Eagle Ford production on the pipeline from Fasken to Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline or Eagle Ford Midstream, where it is sold at prices tied to monthly and daily natural gas price indices. At Fasken, we also have a connection with the Navarro gathering system into which we may deliver natural gas from time to time. 

We have an agreement with Eagle Ford Gathering LLC that provides for the gathering and processing for almost all of our natural gas production in the Artesia Wells area. Natural gas in the area can also be delivered to the Targa (formerly Atlas) system for processing and transportation to downstream markets. In the Artesia Wells area, our oil production is sold at prevailing market prices and transported to market by truck. 

Oil production from the Lake Washington field is either delivered into ExxonMobil's crude oil pipeline system or transported on barges for sales to various purchasers at prevailing market prices. Historically, our natural gas production from this field is either consumed on the lease or is delivered to High Point Gas Transmission (successor to El Paso's Southern Natural Gas Company) pipeline system and the processing of natural gas occurs at the Toca Plant. 

Oil production from the Burr Ferry and South Bearhead Creek fields is sold to various purchasers at prevailing market prices. Our natural gas production from the Burr Ferry field is processed under long term gas processing contracts with Energy Transfer (successor in interest to Eagle Rock Operating, LLC.) South Bearhead Creek natural gas production is sold into the interstate market on Trunkline Gas Company's pipeline at prevailing market prices. 

The prices in the tables below do not include the effects of hedging. Quarterly prices and hedge adjusted pricing are detailed under &#8220;Results of Operations &#8211; Revenues&#8221; in &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in this Form 10-K. 

The following table summarizes sales volumes, sales prices, and production cost information for our net oil, NGL and natural gas production for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 .

Risk Management 

Our operations are subject to all of the risks normally incident to the exploration for and the production of oil and natural gas, including blowouts, cratering, pipe failure, casing collapse, fires, and adverse weather conditions, each of which could result in severe damage to or destruction of oil and natural gas wells, production facilities or other property, or individual injuries. The oil and natural gas exploration business is also subject to environmental hazards, such as oil spills, natural gas leaks, and ruptures and discharges of toxic substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability due to pollution and other environmental damage. We maintain comprehensive insurance coverage, including general liability insurance, operators extra expense insurance, and property damage insurance. Our standing Insurable Risk Advisory Team, which includes individuals from operations, drilling, 

facilities, legal, HSE and finance meets regularly to evaluate risks, review property values, review and monitor claims, review market conditions and assist with the selection of coverages. We believe that our insurance is adequate and customary for companies of a similar size engaged in comparable operations, but if a significant accident or other event occurs that is uninsured or not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us. Refer to &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; of this Form 10-K for more details and for discussion of other risks. 

Commodity Risk 

The oil and gas industry is affected by the volatility of commodity prices. Realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas. From time to time in the past, to a limited extent we have used derivative instruments to protect against declines in oil and natural gas prices. There were no unsettled derivative assets and no unsettled derivative liabilities at December 31, 2015 as all outstanding hedge agreements had settled as of year-end. For additional discussion related to our price-risk policy, refer to Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K. 

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive environment, competing with major integrated and independent energy companies for desirable oil and natural gas properties, as well as for equipment, labor, and materials required to develop and operate such properties. Many of these competitors have financial and technological resources substantially greater than ours. The market for oil and natural gas properties is highly competitive and we may lack technological information or expertise available to other bidders. We may incur higher costs or be unable to acquire and develop desirable properties at costs we consider reasonable because of this competition. Our ability to replace and expand our reserves base depends on our continued ability to attract and retain quality personnel and identify and acquire suitable producing properties and prospects for future drilling and acquisition. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company employed 228 &#32;people. None of our employees were represented by a union and relations with employees are considered to be good. 

Facilities 

At December 31, 2015 , we occupied approximately 119,000 square feet of office space at 17001 Northchase Drive, Houston, Texas. For discussion regarding the term and obligations of this lease refer to Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.
