With the contracted tea cultivation bases, production facilities, established brand and extensive sales network, Yunnan Image has developed an integrated business model in year 2014 &#8211; Tea Manor Program (membership program) which provides the bespoke tea packaging, tourism and tea cultural center.

Products 

&#160; 

Yunnan Image currently provides eight sub-varieties of refined Puer teas and private label member tea as well as loose packed teas. Yunnan Image has a team of certified tea tasters, who use organoleptic means to judge and appraise the characteristics and qualities of its raw teas and grade them according to their external appearance and innate quality (such as aroma, taste, tea colour and appearance of tea remainings). Furthermore, the tea tasters choose the top-grade Puer raw teas and blend them in various proportions to make premium refined Puer tea with the signature characteristics of Yunnan Image&#8217;s brand. 

&#160; 

Production and Delivery 

&#160; 

Yunnan Image, through Fuhai Tea Factory, under the sole agent agreement, entered into the Contracting Agreements with the relevant village committees, pursuant to which, the Yunnan Image agreed to purchase from the relevant village committees the use rights of the tea trees and plantations at a fixed rate and the land use rights at an annual fee for the entire contracting period in respect of the 5000 mu Ecological Forest Lands. 

&#160; 

Yunnan Image&#8217;s sole contracted cultivation base is located in Xi Shuang Ban Na, Yunan Province, PRC. With its terroir including a cool climate, adequate rainfall, high frequency of cloud and mist, fertile soil, suitable acidity of soil, moderate sunshine and long day-time, all of which help the accumulation of the products of photosynthesis, Yunan is a well-known location for growing quality Puer and is the source of origin of Puer. Yunnan Image&#8217;s directors consider that the strategic selection of the cultivation bases has a significant bearing on the level of productivity and the quality of tea leaves. 

&#160;

&#160; 

COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS 

&#160; 

We believe that the Yunnan Image&#8217;s historical success and future prospects are underpinned by a combination of competitive strengths including: 

&#160; 

Strategically located cultivation bases 

&#160; 

The Yunnan Image&#8217;s contracted tea cultivation bases comprise the 5000 mu Ecological Forest Lands, which are all strategically located in Xi Shuang Ban Na, Yunan Province, PRC. The we believe that since tea leaves is the most important raw materials of Yunnan Image, the cultivation bases enable the Yunnan Image to exercise better control over quality from the initial stage of plantation and this competitive advantage distinguishes the Yunnan Image from its competitors which do not have their sole contracted cultivation bases for tea plants. We also consider that the strategic location of the cultivation bases in Xi Shuang Ban Na, Yunan, a well-known location for growing high quality of Puer and the source of origin of Puer, has a significant bearing on the Yunnan Image&#8217;s level of productivity and the quality of its tea leaves, which distinguishes the Yunnan Image from its competitors. 

&#160; 

Proven integrated Tea Manor Program 

&#160; 

The Yunnan Image implemented an integrated business model in which the Yunnan Image provides Tea Culture Education as well as Tea Tasting Sharing to the member in order to distinguish the quality of tea from other competitors. 

&#160; 

The Program also provide direct sales and marketing channel. 

&#160; 

Sales, Marketing and Distribution Strategy 

&#160; 

Yunnan Image adopts a two-prong strategy in the sales of its tea products to focus not only on the production and sales of raw teas, but also on the development of its branded tea business by implementing tea manor program to promote its Image Tea brand. 

&#160; 

Yunnan Image sells a majority of its raw teas on a wholesale basis, and sells on a retail basis its refined Banzhang Puer under its Image Tea brand. Some of the Yunnan Image&#8217;s refined teas are also sold with a private label to our members. 

&#160; 

MARKET CONDITIONS 

&#160; 

According to IBISWorld&#8217;s Tea Production market research report on the &#8220;Tea Production in China&#8221; published in June 2015, the tea production industry has rapidly increased its share of China&#8217;s beverage market over the past decade, from 7.0% of total domestic beverage volume in 2000 to 26.0% in 2013. Over the past five years, industry revenue has been increasing at an annualized rate of 13.3% to an expected $19.5 billion in 2015. There are about 256 enterprises operating in the industry, with 67,961 workers. 

&#160; 

According to EuroMonitor International&#8217;s analysis published in February 2016, tea is expected to post steady volume and value growth over 2015-2020, supported by stable demand in a traditional tea-drinking country. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

The Chinese tea market in which the Company operates could be considered as highly competitive and fragmented, and the competition is expected to continually increase. Many of the Company&#8217;s competitors sell products that are similar to the Company&#8217;s products, and the Company&#8217;s ability to compete against them is significantly dependent on its ability to distinguish its products from those of its competitors and demonstrate product quality.
