 ITEM 1 - BUSINESS 

&#160; 

GENERAL 

&#160;

We believe that our solutions constitute mission critical applications for clients, as they encapsulate end-to-end business processes, facilitating faster processing and increased transactions.

OUR BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Company Business Model 

&#160; 

NetSol believes that strong technology solutions with provable returns on investment are required to sell to its globally competitive and mature marketplace. NetSol believes that people are the drivers of success and we invest in hiring, training and retaining top-notch staff to ensure not only successful selling but also the ongoing satisfaction of our clients. Taken together, this &#8220;selling and attentive servicing&#8221; approach creates a distinctive advantage for NetSol and a unique value for its customers. NetSol continues to underpin this effective business model with a combination of careful cost arbitrage, subject matter expertise, domain experience, scalability and proximity with its global and regional customers.

&#160; 

Niche Market Focus 

&#160; 

By specializing in leasing and financing solutions, we have gained footholds in several global locations and a market leading position in the captive auto-finance segment and a growing presence in the general asset finance space. 

&#160; 

Subject Matter Expertise 

&#160; 

NetSol&#8217;s dual expertise in enterprise technology implementation and financial application development has helped it emerge as a global contender in the lease and finance industry, and secure a broad footprint throughout the major markets of North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. The Asia Pacific operating region has particularly benefitted from the organic growth in the fast developing leasing automation industry, which is still nascent by Western standards. 

&#160; 

Domain Experience 

&#160; 

NetSol has a strong presence in the captive auto-finance domain. With a collective experience of almost two decades in Asia Pacific and over three decades in North America and Europe, NetSol is one of a few global competitors in this niche industry. 

&#160; 

Proximity with Global and Regional Customers 

&#160; 

The Company has offices across the world, located strategically to maintain close contact and proximity with its customers in various key markets. It has helped in strengthening customer relationships and building a deeper understanding of local market dynamics. Simultaneously, the Company is able to extend services and even development support through a combination of local/onsite and central/off-site resources. This approach allows the Company to offer blended rates to its customers by employing a unique and cost effective global development model. 

&#160;

While our business model is built around the development, implementation and maintenance of our suite of financial applications, under NFS&#8482;, NetSol has employed the same facilities and competencies to extend its offerings into related segments, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; IT consulting &#38; services &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; business intelligence &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; information security &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; independent system review &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; outsourcing services and software process improvement consulting &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; maintenance and support of existing systems &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; project management &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; technology/start-up incubation &#160; 

Our global operation is broken down into three regions: North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. All of the subsidiaries are seamlessly integrated to function effectively with global delivery capabilities, cross selling to multinational asset finance companies, leveraging a centralized marketing and pre-sales organization and a network of employees connected across the globe to support local and global customers and partners.

&#160; 

OUR SOLUTIONS 

&#160; 

NetSol Financial Suite&#8482; 

&#160; 

NetSol&#8217;s offerings include its flagship global solution, NFS&#8482;. A robust suite of four software applications that is an end-to-end solution for the asset finance industry covering the complete leasing and finance cycle starting from quotation origination through end of contract transactions, and including digital channel support with intuitive mobile applications. The four applications under NFS&#8482; have been designed and developed for a highly flexible setting and are capable of dealing with multinational, multi-company, multi-asset, multi-lingual, multi-distributor and multi-manufacturer environments. Each application is a complete system in itself and can be used independently to address specific sub-domains of the leasing/financing cycle. When used together, they fully automate the entire leasing/financing cycle for companies of any size, including those with multi-billion dollar portfolios. 

&#160; 

On October 24, 2013, we announced the introduction and release of NFS Ascent&#8482;, the Company&#8217;s next generation platform, offering a technologically advanced solution for the auto and equipment finance and leasing industry. NFS Ascent&#8217;s&#8482; architecture and user interfaces were designed based on the Company&#8217;s collective experience with global Fortune 500 companies over the past 40 years combined with UX design concepts. The platform&#8217;s framework allows auto captive and asset finance companies to rapidly transform legacy driven technology into a state-of-the-art IT and business process environment. At the core of the NFS Ascent&#8482; platform is a lease accounting and contract processing engine, which allows for an array of interest calculation methods, as well as robust accounting of multi-billion dollar lease portfolios in compliance with various regulatory standards. NFS Ascent&#8482;, with its distributed and clustered deployment across parallel application and high volume data servers, enables finance companies to process voluminous data in a hyper speed environment. 

&#160; 

NFS Ascent&#8482; has been developed using the latest tools and technologies and its n-tier SOA architecture allows the system to greatly improve a myriad of areas including, but not limited to, scalability, performance, fault tolerance and security. We believe that the transition from NFS&#8482; to NFS Ascent&#8482; allows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Improvement in overall productivity throughout the delivery organization: &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The features of the integrated Business Process Manager, Workflow Engine and Business Rule Engine, will provide flexibility to our clients allowing them to configure certain parts of the application themselves rather than requesting customization. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The NFS Ascent&#8482; platform and the SOA architecture allow us to develop portals and mobile applications quickly by utilizing our existing services. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The n-tier architecture allows us to intelligently distribute processing and eases application maintenance. The loose coupling between various modules and layers reduces the risk of regression in other parts of the system as a result of changes made in one part of the system and follows proven and accepted SOA principles. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Improvement in talent acquisition and retention: &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Because NFS Ascent&#8482; has been developed using the latest technologies and tools available in the market, it is helping us in attracting and retaining top engineers. &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Better customer satisfaction: &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; As a result of the powerful NFS Ascent&#8482; platform and improvement in the talent pool, the quality of our deliverables have increased. &#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

NFS&#8482; and NFS Ascent&#8482; have the following as their constituent applications : 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Credit Application Processing System (CAP) 

&#160; 

CAP provides companies in the financial sector with an environment to handle the incoming credit applications from dealers, agents, brokers and the direct sales force. CAP automatically gathers information from different interfaces like credit rating agencies, evaluation guides, and contract management systems and gives the applications a score against a user defined point scoring system. This automated workflow permits the credit team members to make their decisions more quickly and accurately. CAP is a database independent online system developed in Microsoft&#8217;s .Net framework. It can be run from any computer system with normal specifications, which is a key benefit for clients. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Regional NFS&#8482; Offerings 

&#160; 

While NFS Ascent&#8482; is designed to be a truly global solution ready for customization in any market, the Company has historically provided products tailored to various markets. As such, we offer the following additional regional products: 

&#160; 

LeasePak 

&#160; 

In North America, NetSol Technologies Americas, Inc. (NTA) has and continues to develop the LeasePak CMS product. LeasePak streamlines the lease management lifecycle, while maintaining customer service and reducing operating costs. It is web-enabled and can be configured to run on HP-UX, SUN/Solaris or Linux, as well as for SQL Server, Oracle and Sybase users. It is scalable from a basic offering to a collection of highly specialized add on modules for systems, portfolios and accrual methods for virtually all sizes and varying complexity of operations. It is part of the vehicle leasing infrastructure at leading Fortune 500 banks and manufacturers, as well as for some of the industry&#8217;s leading independent lessors. It handles every aspect of the lease or loan lifecycle, including credit application origination, credit adjudication, pricing, documentation, booking, payments, customer service, collections, midterm adjustments, and end-of-term options and asset disposition. It is also integrated with Vertex Series O. 

&#160; 

LeasePak-SaaS 

&#160; 

NTA also offers the LeasePak Software-as-a-Service (&#8220;Saas&#8221;) business line, which provides high performance with a reduced total cost of ownership. SaaS offers a proven deployment option whereby customers only require access to the internet to use the software. With an elastic cloud price, revenue stream predictability and improved return on investment for customers, management believes that its SaaS customers will experience the performance, the reliability and the speed usually associated with a highly scalable private cloud. LeasePak-SaaS targets small and mid-sized leasing and finance companies. 

&#160; 

LeaseSoft 

&#160; 

In addition to offering NFS Ascent&#8482; to the Europe market, NTE has some regional offerings, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; LeaseSoft &#8211; a full lifecycle lease and finance system aimed predominantly at the UK funder market, including modules to support web portals and an electronic data interchange manager to facilitate integration between funders and introducers. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; LoanSoft &#8211; similar to LeaseSoft, but optimized for the consumer loan market. &#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Implementation Process 

&#160; 

The implementation process can span from three to eighteen months depending upon the complexity and scope. The implementation process also includes related software services such as configuration, data migration, training and any other additional third party interfaces. Even after implementation, customers seek enhancements and additions to improve their business processes. NetSol charges these efforts in a man-day rate. Post implementation, NetSol consultants may remain at the client site to assist the customer in smooth operations. After this phase, the regular maintenance and support services phase for the implemented software begins. In addition to the daily rate paid by the customer for each consultant, the customer also pays for all the transportation related expenses, boarding of the consultants, and a living allowance. NetSol&#8217;s involvement in all of the above steps is priced to bring value to our customers and increase our profitability from our interactions. 

&#160; 

Pricing and Revenue Streams 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s revenue streams occur through the following three main areas: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Product licensing &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Implementation related services &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Maintenance and support related services &#160; 

License fees can vary generally between $100,000 for SaaS minimal modules to more than $2,000,000 for more robust multiple module implementations. There are various attributes which determine the level of complexity, a few of which are: number of contracts; size of the portfolio; business strategy of the customer; internal business processes followed by the customer; number of business users; and branch network of the customer. The Company recognizes revenue from license contracts without major customization when a non-cancelable, non-contingent license agreement has been signed, delivery of the software has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. However, revenue from sale of licenses with major customization, modification, and development is recognized on a percentage of completion basis. Implementation related services, including configuration, data migration and third party interfaces are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method. Maintenance and support related services are then provided on a continued basis. The annual maintenance fee, which typically is an agreed upon percentage of overall monetary value of the license, then becomes an ongoing revenue stream realized on yearly basis. Revenue from software services includes fixed price contracts and is recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method using the output measure of &#8220;Unit of Work Completed.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Joint Ventures 

&#160; 

NetSol-Innovation 

&#160; 

In November 2004, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with 1insurer (formerly the Innovation Group) forming NetSol-Innovation (Pvt) Ltd., (&#8220;NetSol-Innovation&#8221;), a Pakistani company. NetSol-Innovation provides support services enabling 1insurer to scale solution delivery operations in key growth markets. NetSol-Innovation operations are centered in NetSol&#8217;s delivery center in Lahore, Pakistan. NetSol owns a majority of the venture. The entities share in the profits of the joint venture on the basis of their shareholding. The outsourcing model between 1insurer and NetSol involves services pertaining to business analyses, configuration, testing, software quality assurance, technical communication, research and development regarding its insurance platform, client support as well as project management for development of software for 1insurer. 

&#160; 

Initiated with a 10-person outsourcing team in Lahore in February 2005, this arrangement has extended to over 200 persons with the additional resources catering to the increased influx of outsourcing of configuration and testing assignments from 1insurer. Currently, prominent 1insurer&#8217;s customers being serviced from Lahore include GuideOne USA, Homesite USA, UPC USA and MDU UK. 

&#160; 

Virtual Lease Services 

&#160; 

Virtual Lease Services (VLS) is a joint venture partnership with NTE and Investec Bank. NetSol owns a majority of the venture. VLS provides an asset finance services proposition complementing our core solutions offerings. VLS provides three core services, covering business process outsourcing (BPO), provision of standby servicing to the securitization markets, and audit services. The cornerstone of VLS&#8217;s range of services is the BPO offering which provides portfolio management to a range of businesses, including start-ups, growth businesses, and those in run down mode. The BPO service also supports portfolio acquirers. VLS carries a Fitch ABS Primary Servicer Rating of &#8220;ABPS3&#8221;, upgraded from &#8220;ABPS3-&#8221; in October 2014. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Alliances 

&#160; 

Daimler Financial Services (&#8220;DFS&#8221;) Asia Pacific has established an &#8220;Application Support Centre (ASC)&#8221; in Singapore to facilitate the regional companies in NFS&#8482; related matters. This ASC is powered by highly qualified technical and business personnel. ASC, in conjunction with our Asia Pacific Region, are supporting DFS companies in seven different countries in Asia and this list can increase as other DFS companies from other countries also opt for NFS&#8482;. In July 2008, the Company entered into a Frame Agreement with Daimler Financial Services AG (&#8220;DFS&#8221;) for the Asia Pacific and Africa regions. This agreement was renewed in October 2010 for an additional 3year term and renewed again in 2013. The agreement serves as a base line for use of the NFS&#8482; products by DFS companies and affiliated companies. 

&#160; 

Technical Affiliations 

&#160; 

The Company is a Microsoft Certified Silver Partner and an Oracle Certified Partner. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Selling 

&#160; 

NetSol management continues its optimism that the Company will experience ever increasing opportunities for its product and services offerings in 2016 and beyond. The objective of the Company&#8217;s marketing program is to create and sustain preference and loyalty for NetSol. Marketing is performed at the corporate and business unit levels. The corporate marketing department has overall responsibility for communications, advertising, public relations and the website. In addition, corporate marketing oversees central marketing and communications programs for use by each of the business units. 

&#160; 

Our dedicated marketing personnel, within the regions, undertake a variety of marketing activities, including sponsoring focused client events to demonstrate our skills and products, sponsoring and participating in targeted conferences and holding private briefings with individual companies. We believe that the industry focus of our sales professionals and our business unit marketing personnel enhances their knowledge and expertise in these industries and will generate additional client engagements. 

&#160; 

The Markets 

&#160; 

NetSol provides its services primarily to clients in global commercial industries. In the global commercial area, the Company&#8217;s service offerings are marketed to clients in a wide array of industries including, automotive, software, banks, higher education and financial services. 

&#160; 

The Asian continent, including Australia and New Zealand, from the perspective of marketing, are targeted by the Asia Pacific Region from its Bangkok, Beijing and Lahore facilities. The marketing for our core offerings in the Americas and Europe is carried out from our San Francisco Bay Area and London Metropolitan area offices respectively. 

&#160; 

People and Culture 

&#160; 

The Company believes it has developed a strong corporate culture that is critical to its success. Its key values are delivering world-class quality software, client-focused timely delivery, leadership, long-term relationships, creativity, openness and transparency and professional growth. The services provided by NetSol require proficiency in many fields, such as software engineering, project management, business analysis, technical writing, sales and marketing, and communication and presentation skills. 

&#160; 

Due to the growing demand for our core offerings and IT services, retention of technical and management personnel is essential. We have enhanced the compensation structure for our technical teams and senior management to stay ahead of global and regional competition. As a result, we have improved IT employee turnover from almost 20% in 2012 to less than 10% today. This is a significant milestone towards building capacity and driving revenue growth. In addition, we are committed to improving key performance indicators such as efficiency, productivity and revenue per employee. 

&#160; 

To encourage all employees to build on our core values, we reward teamwork and promote individuals that demonstrate these values. We believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to the high caliber of our employees and our commitment to maintain the values on which our success has been based. NetSol is an equal opportunity employer with the largest concentration of female employees in Lahore, Pakistan and our U.S. headquarters. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

NetSol believes it should give back to the community and employees as much as possible. Certain of our subsidiaries are located in regions where basic services are not readily available. Where possible, NetSol acts to not only improve the quality of life of its employees but also the standard of living in these regions. Examples of such programs are: 

&#160; 

&#9679; Humanitarian Relief - We are all aware of the devastation that can be wrought by natural disasters. NetSol has historically supported earthquake and flood relief where the need is the greatest. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Literacy Program - launched to educate low paid illiterate employees of the organization. The main objective of this program is to enable these resources to acquire basic reading, writing and arithmetic skills. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Noble Cause Fund - A noble cause fund has been established to meet medical and education expenses of the children of low paid employees. NetSol employees voluntarily contribute a fixed amount every month to the fund and the Company matches the employee subscriptions with an equivalent contribution amount. A portion of this fund is also utilized to support social needs of certain institutions and individuals, outside NetSol. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Day Care Facility - NetSol&#8217;s human resources are its key assets and thus the Company takes numerous steps to ensure the provision of basic comforts to its employees. In Pakistan, the provision of outside pre-school child care is a rarity. With this in mind, a child day care facility has been created in close proximity to NetSol offices providing employees with peace of mind knowing their children are nearby and being taken care of by qualified staff in a child friendly facility. &#160; &#160; &#9679; Preventative Health Care Program - In addition to the comprehensive out-patient and in-patient medical benefits, preventive health care has also been introduced. This phased program focuses on vaccination of our employees against such diseases as Hepatitis &#8211; A/B, Tetanus, Typhoid and Flu on a routine basis. &#160; 

There is significant competition for employees with the skills required to perform the services we offer. The Company runs an elaborate training program for different cadre of employees to cover technical skills and business domain knowledge, as well as communication, management and leadership skills. The Company believes that it has been successful in its efforts to attract and retain the highest level of talent available, in part because of the emphasis on core values, training and professional growth. We intend to continue to recruit, hire and promote employees who share our vision. 

&#160; 

As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately 1,630 employees; comprised of 1,235 IT project and technical personnel; and 395 non-IT personnel. The IT project and technical personnel include 840 employees dedicated to NFS and NFS Ascent&#8482;, 197 employees dedicated to the joint venture with 1insurer and 125 employees supporting the regional offerings as well as IT consulting and services. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Neither a single company, nor a small number of companies, dominate the IT market in the space in which the Company competes. A substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those offered by NetSol. Some of these are large include computer manufacturers and computer consulting firms that have greater financial resources than NetSol and, in some cases, may have greater capacity to perform services similar to those provided by NetSol. 

&#160; 

In the NFS&#8482; business space, the barriers to entry are getting higher. The products are becoming more cutting-edge while richness in functionality is paramount. Older companies have prolonged the life of their legacy products by creating web-based front ends, while the core of the systems has not been re-engineered. In the case of NFS&#8482;, we compete chiefly against leading suppliers of IT solutions to the financial industry, including names such as White Clarke, Fimasys, International Decision Systems (IDS), Data Scan, CHP Consulting, 3i Infotech, Finnone and Nucleus Software. 

&#160; 

In the IT based business services areas, we compete with both smaller local firms and many global IT services providers, including names such as Wipro, InfoSys, Satyam Infoway, HCL and TCS (Tata Consulting). 

&#160; 

Many of the competitors of NetSol have longer operating history, larger client bases, and longer relationships with clients, greater brand or name recognition and significantly greater financial, technical, and public relations resources than NetSol. Existing or future competitors may develop or offer services that are comparable or superior to ours at a lower price, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

NetSol customers include world renowned auto manufacturers through their finance arms and large regional banks. In addition, NetSol provides offshore development and testing services to 1insurer, formerly Innovation Group Plc UK, and their blue chip global insurance customers through the NetSol-Innovation joint venture, which contributes about 12.64% of NetSol&#8217;s revenues. NetSol is also a strategic business partner for Daimler (which consists of a group of many companies in different countries), which accounts for 19.96% of our revenue. 

&#160; 

Global Operations and Geographic Data 

&#160; 

The Company divides its operations into three regions: the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. The regions consist of individual subsidiaries which operate as autonomous companies and are strategically managed on a regional basis.
