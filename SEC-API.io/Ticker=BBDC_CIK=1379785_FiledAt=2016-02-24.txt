Organization 

We are a Maryland corporation incorporated on October 10, 2006, for the purposes of acquiring 100% of the equity interests in Triangle Mezzanine Fund LLLP (&#8220;Triangle SBIC&#8221;) and its general partner, Triangle Mezzanine LLC (&#8220;TML&#8221;), raising capital in our initial public offering, which was completed in February 2007 (the &#8220;IPO&#8221;) and thereafter operating as an internally managed business development company (&#8220;BDC&#8221;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#8220;1940 Act&#8221;). On December 15, 2009, Triangle Mezzanine Fund II, LP (&#8220;Triangle SBIC II&#8221;) was organized as a limited partnership under the laws of the State of Delaware. Triangle SBIC&#8217;s Small Business Investment Company (&#8220;SBIC&#8221;) license from the United States Small Business Administration (the &#8220;SBA&#8221;) became effective on September 11, 2003 and Triangle SBIC II&#8217;s SBIC license became effective on May 26, 2010. Unless otherwise noted, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;Triangle&#8221; refer to Triangle SBIC prior to the IPO and to Triangle Capital Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II, after the IPO. Both we and Triangle SBIC individually are closed-end, non-diversified investment companies that have elected to be treated as BDCs under the 1940 Act.

Overview of our Business 

We are a specialty finance company that provides customized financing to lower middle market companies located primarily in the United States. We define lower middle market companies as those having annual revenues between $10.0 million and $250.0 million. Our investment objective is to seek attractive returns by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity related investments. Our investment strategy is to partner with business owners, management teams and financial sponsors to provide flexible financing solutions to fund growth, changes of control, or other corporate events. We invest primarily in subordinated debt securities secured by second lien security interests in portfolio company assets, coupled with equity interests. On a more limited basis, we also invest in senior debt securities secured by first lien security interests in portfolio company assets. We generally invest in securities that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Such below investment grade securities are often referred to as "high yield" or "junk." 

We focus on investments in companies with histories of generating revenues and positive cash flow, established market positions and proven management teams with strong operating discipline. Our target portfolio company has annual revenues between $20.0 million and $200.0 million and annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (&#8220;EBITDA&#8221;) between $3.0 million and $35.0 million. We believe that these companies have less access to capital and that the market for such capital is underserved relative to larger companies. Companies of this size are generally privately held and are less well known to traditional capital sources such as commercial and investment banks. 

Our investments generally range from $5.0 to $35.0 million per portfolio company. In certain situations, we have partnered with other funds to provide larger financing commitments. We operate Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II as SBICs and utilize the proceeds from the sale of SBA-guaranteed debentures, referred to herein as SBA leverage, to enhance returns to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2015 , we had investments in 92 portfolio companies, with an aggregate cost of approximately $1.0 billion . 

Our Business Strategy 

We seek attractive returns by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity related investments by: 

&#8226; 

Utilizing Long-Standing Relationships to Source Deals. Our senior management team maintains extensive relationships with entrepreneurs, financial sponsors, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers, commercial bankers and other non-bank providers of capital who refer prospective portfolio companies to us. These relationships historically have generated significant investment opportunities. We believe that our network of relationships will continue to produce attractive investment opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Focusing on Underserved Markets. The lower middle market has traditionally been underserved. We believe that operating margin and growth pressures, as well as regulatory concerns, have caused financial institutions to de-emphasize services to lower middle market companies in favor of larger corporate clients and more liquid capital market transactions. We believe these dynamics have resulted in the financing market for lower middle market companies to be underserved, providing us with greater investment opportunities. 

&#8226; 

Providing Customized Financing Solutions. We offer a variety of financing structures and have the flexibility to structure our investments to meet the needs of our portfolio companies. Typically we invest in subordinated debt securities, coupled with equity interests. We believe our ability to customize financing arrangements makes us an attractive partner to lower middle market companies. 

&#8226; 

Leveraging the Experience of Our Management Team. Our senior management team has extensive experience advising, investing in, lending to and operating companies across changing market cycles. The members of our management team have diverse investment backgrounds, with prior experience at investment banks, commercial banks, and privately and publicly held companies in the capacity of executive officers. We believe this diverse experience provides us with an in depth understanding of the strategic, financial and operational challenges and opportunities of the lower middle market companies in which we invest. We believe this understanding allows us to select and structure better investments and to efficiently monitor and provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. 

&#8226; 

Applying Rigorous Underwriting Policies and Active Portfolio Management. Our senior management team has implemented rigorous underwriting policies that are followed in each transaction. These policies include a thorough analysis of each potential portfolio company&#8217;s competitive position, financial performance, management team operating discipline, growth potential and industry attractiveness, which we believe allows us to better assess the company&#8217;s prospects. After investing in a company, we monitor the investment closely, typically receiving monthly, quarterly and annual financial statements. We analyze and discuss in detail the company&#8217;s financial performance with management in addition to participating in regular board of directors meetings. We believe that our initial and ongoing portfolio review process allows us to monitor effectively the performance and prospects of our portfolio companies. 

&#8226; 

Taking Advantage of Low Cost Debentures Guaranteed by the SBA. Our license to do business as an SBIC allows us to issue fixed-rate, low interest debentures which are guaranteed by the SBA and sold in the capital markets, potentially allowing us to increase our net interest income beyond the levels achievable by other BDCs utilizing traditional leverage. 

&#8226; 

Financing Our Investment Portfolio with Long-Term Capital. In addition to proceeds from sales of shares of our common stock and proceeds from issuance of SBA-guaranteed debentures by our SBIC subsidiaries, we have outstanding unsecured notes with original terms of seven to ten years. 

&#8226; 

Maintaining Portfolio Diversification. While we focus our investments in lower middle market companies, we seek to invest across various industries. We monitor our investment portfolio to ensure we have acceptable industry balance, using industry and market metrics as key indicators. By monitoring our investment portfolio for industry balance, we seek to reduce the effects of economic downturns associated with any particular industry or market sector. However, we may from time to time hold securities of a single portfolio company that comprise more than 5.0% of our total assets and/or more than 10.0% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company. For that reason, we are classified as a non-diversified management investment company under the 1940 Act. 

Investments 

Debt Investments 

We tailor the terms of our debt investments to the facts and circumstances of each transaction and prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that seeks to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. To that end, we typically seek board observation rights with each of our portfolio companies and offer managerial assistance. We also seek to limit the downside risks of our investments by negotiating covenants that are designed to protect our investments while affording our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protections, change of control provisions and put rights. We typically include a prepayment penalty structure to enhance our potential total return on our investments. 

We invest primarily in subordinated notes and, on a more limited basis, invest in senior secured debt. Subordinated notes are junior to senior secured debt. Our subordinated debt investments and senior secured debt investments generally have terms of three to seven years, do not have scheduled amortization and are due at maturity. Our subordinated debt investments generally provide for fixed interest rates between 10.0% and 15.0% per annum. In addition, our senior secured debt investments generally provide for variable interest at rates ranging from LIBOR plus 350 basis points to LIBOR plus 950 basis points per annum. Our subordinated debt investments generally are secured by a second priority security interest in the assets of the borrower and generally include an equity component, such as warrants to purchase common stock in the portfolio company. In addition, certain loan investments may have a form of interest that is not paid currently but is accrued and added to the loan balance and paid at the end of the term, referred to as payment-in-kind, or PIK, interest. In our negotiations with potential portfolio companies, we generally seek to minimize PIK interest as such income is taxable in the year accrued, and we may have to borrow money or raise additional capital in order to meet the requirement of generally having to pay out at least 90.0% of our taxable income to continue to qualify as a Regulated Investment Company, or RIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. At December 31, 2015 , the weighted average yield on our outstanding debt investments other than non-accrual debt investments was approximately 12.2% , the weighted average yield on all of our outstanding investments (including equity and equity-linked investments but excluding non-accrual debt investments) was approximately 10.6% &#32;and the weighted average yield on all of our outstanding investments (including equity and equity-linked investments and non-accrual debt investments) was approximately 10.2% . 

An SBIC may make investments in the form of loans, debt securities, which include an equity feature or equity only securities. Loans and debt securities must be issued for a term of not less than one year (except for bridge loans in anticipation of a permanent financing in which the SBIC intends to participate, or to protect its prior investment) and must have amortization not exceeding &#8220;straight line.&#8221; The permissible interest rate on Loans is the higher of (i) 19% or (ii) 11% over the higher of the SBIC&#8217;s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate. For debt securities, the permitted rate is the higher of (i) 14% or (ii) 6% over the higher of the SBIC&#8217;s weighted cost of debenture leverage or the current debenture rate. If a financing is in default, these maximums may increase by up to 7%. SBA Regulations define an SBIC&#8217;s weighted cost of debenture leverage and describe the permitted rate when more than one SBIC participates in the financing. 

Equity Investments 

We may acquire equity interests in portfolio companies. We generally seek to structure our equity investments as non-control investments to provide us with minority rights and event-driven or time-driven puts. We also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these investments, which may include demand and &#8220;piggyback&#8221; registration rights, board seats and board observation rights. Our investments have in the past and may in the future contain a synthetic equity position pursuant to a formula typically setting forth royalty rights we may exercise in accordance with such formula. 

Investment Criteria 

We utilize the following criteria and guidelines in evaluating investment opportunities. However, not all of these criteria and guidelines have been, or will be, met in connection with each of our investments. 

&#8226; 

Established Companies With Positive Cash Flow. We seek to invest in established companies with a history of generating revenues and positive cash flows. We typically focus on companies with a history of profitability and minimum trailing twelve month EBITDA of $3.0 million. We do not invest in start-up companies, distressed situations, &#8220;turn-around&#8221; situations or companies that we believe have unproven business plans. 

&#8226; 

Experienced Management Teams With Meaningful Equity Ownership. Based on our prior investment experience, we believe that a management team with significant experience with a portfolio company or relevant industry experience and meaningful equity ownership is essential to the long-term success of the portfolio company. We believe management teams with these attributes are more likely to manage the companies in a manner that protects our debt investment and enhances the value of our equity investment. 

&#8226; 

Strong Competitive Position. We seek to invest in companies that have developed strong positions within their respective markets, are well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities and compete in industries with barriers to entry. We also seek to invest in companies that exhibit a competitive advantage, which may help to protect their market position and profitability. 

&#8226; 

Varied Customer and Supplier Bases. We prefer to invest in companies that have varied customer and supplier bases. Companies with varied customer and supplier bases are generally better able to endure economic downturns, industry consolidation and shifting customer preferences. 

&#8226; 

Significant Invested Capital. We believe the existence of significant underlying equity value provides important support to investments. We look for portfolio companies that we believe have sufficient value beyond the layer of the capital structure in which we invest. 

Investment Committees 

Triangle Capital Corporation has an investment committee that is responsible for all aspects of our investment process relating to investments made by Triangle Capital Corporation or any of its subsidiaries, other than investments made by Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II. The members of the Triangle Capital Corporation investment committee are Messrs. E. Ashton Poole, Brent P.W. Burgess, Steven C. Lilly, Jeffrey A. Dombcik, Douglas A. Vaughn, Cary B. Nordan, Matthew A. Young and David F. Parker. 

Triangle SBIC has an investment committee that is responsible for all aspects of our investment process relating to investments made by Triangle SBIC. The members of Triangle SBIC&#8217;s investment committee are Messrs. E. Ashton Poole, Brent P.W. Burgess, Steven C. Lilly, Jeffrey A. Dombcik, Douglas A. Vaughn, Cary B. Nordan and David F. Parker. 

Triangle SBIC II has an investment committee that is responsible for all aspects of our investment process relating to investments made by Triangle SBIC II. The members of Triangle SBIC II&#8217;s investment committee are Messrs. E. Ashton Poole, Brent P.W. Burgess, Steven C. Lilly, Jeffrey A. Dombcik, Douglas A. Vaughn and Cary B. Nordan. For purposes of the discussion herein, any reference to the &#8220;investment committee&#8221; refers to the investment committees for each of Triangle Capital Corporation, Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II. 

Investment Process 

Our investment committee meets once a week and also meets on an as needed basis depending on transaction volume. Our investment committee has organized our investment process into five distinct stages: 

&#8226; 

Origination 

&#8226; 

Due Diligence and Underwriting 

&#8226; 

Approval 

&#8226; 

Documentation and Closing 

&#8226; 

Portfolio Management and Investment Monitoring 

Our investment process is summarized in the following chart: 

Origination 

The origination process for our investments includes sourcing, screening, preliminary due diligence, transaction structuring and negotiation. Our investment professionals utilize their extensive relationships with various financial sponsors, entrepreneurs, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and other non-bank providers of capital to source transactions with prospective portfolio companies. 

If a transaction meets our investment criteria, we perform preliminary due diligence, taking into consideration some or all of the following factors: 

&#8226; 

a comprehensive financial model that we prepare based on quantitative analysis of historical financial performance, financial projections and pro forma financial ratios assuming investment; 

&#8226; 

the competitive landscape surrounding the potential investment; 

&#8226; 

strengths and weaknesses of the potential investment&#8217;s business strategy and industry; 

&#8226; 

results of a broad qualitative analysis of the company&#8217;s management team, products or services, market position, market dynamics and customers and suppliers; and 

&#8226; 

potential investment structures, certain financing ratios and investment pricing terms. 

If the results of our preliminary due diligence are satisfactory, the origination team prepares a Summary Transaction Memorandum, which is presented to our investment committee. If our investment committee recommends moving forward, we issue a non-binding term sheet to the potential portfolio company. Upon execution of a term sheet, we begin our formal due diligence and underwriting process as we move toward investment approval. 

Due Diligence and Underwriting 

Our due diligence on a prospective investment is completed by a minimum of three investment professionals, which we refer to as the underwriting team. The members of the underwriting team work together to conduct due diligence and to understand the relationships among the prospective portfolio company&#8217;s business plan, operations and financial performance through various methods, including, among others, on-site visits with management, in-depth review of historical and projected financial data, interviews with customers and suppliers, evaluations of management and background checks, third-party accounting reports and review of any material contracts. 

In most circumstances, we utilize outside experts to review the legal affairs, accounting systems, and, where appropriate, we engage specialists to investigate issues like environmental matters and general industry outlooks. During the underwriting process, significant attention is given to sensitivity analysis and how companies might be expected to perform in a protracted &#8220;downside&#8221; operating environment. In addition, we analyze key financing ratios and other industry metrics, including total debt to EBITDA, EBITDA to fixed charges, EBITDA to total interest expense, total debt to total capitalization and total senior debt to total capitalization. 

Upon completion of a satisfactory due diligence review and as part of our evaluation of a proposed investment, the underwriting team prepares an Investment Memorandum. The Investment Memorandum includes information about the potential portfolio company such as its history, business strategy, potential strengths and risks involved, analysis of key customers, contracts and suppliers, third-party consultant findings, expected returns on investment structure, anticipated sources of repayment and exit strategies, analysis of historical financials, and potential capitalization and ownership. 

Approval 

The underwriting team for the proposed investment presents the Investment Memorandum to our investment committee for consideration and approval. After reviewing the Investment Memorandum, members of the investment committee may request additional due diligence or modify the proposed financing structure or terms of the proposed investment. Before we proceed with any investment, the investment committee must approve the proposed investment by the affirmative vote from a majority of the investment committee members. Upon receipt of transaction approval, the underwriting team proceeds to document the transaction. 

Documentation and Closing 

The underwriting team is responsible for all documentation related to investment closings. In addition, we rely on law firms with whom we have worked on multiple transactions to help us complete the necessary documentation associated with transaction closings. If a transaction changes materially from what was originally approved by the investment committee, the underwriting team requests a formal meeting of the investment committee to communicate the contemplated changes. The investment committee has the right to approve the amended transaction structure, to suggest alternative structures or not to approve the contemplated changes. 

Portfolio Management and Investment Monitoring 

Our investment professionals generally employ several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance of our portfolio companies, which, depending on the particular investment, may include the following specific processes, procedures and reports: 

&#8226; 

monthly and quarterly reviews of actual financial performance versus the corresponding period of the prior year and financial projections; 

&#8226; 

monthly and quarterly monitoring of all financial and other covenants; 

&#8226; 

reviews of senior lender loan compliance certificates, where applicable; 

&#8226; 

quarterly reviews of operating results and general business performance, including the preparation of a portfolio monitoring report which is distributed to members of our investment committee; 

&#8226; 

periodic face-to-face meetings with management teams and financial sponsors of portfolio companies; 

&#8226; 

attendance at portfolio company board meetings through board seats or observation rights; and 

&#8226; 

application of our investment rating system to each investment. 

In the event that our investment committee determines that an investment is underperforming, or circumstances suggest that the risk associated with a particular investment has significantly increased, we undertake to monitor more closely the affected portfolio company. The level of monitoring of an investment is determined by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, trends in the financial performance of the portfolio company, the investment structure and the type of collateral securing our investment, if any. 

Investment Rating System 

We monitor a wide variety of key credit statistics that provide information regarding our portfolio companies to help us assess credit quality and portfolio performance. We generally require our portfolio companies to have annual financial audits in addition to monthly and quarterly unaudited financial statements. Using these statements, we calculate and evaluate certain financing ratios. For purposes of analyzing the financial performance of our portfolio companies, we may make certain adjustments to their financial statements to reflect the pro forma results of the portfolio company consistent with a change of control transaction, to reflect anticipated cost savings resulting from a merger or restructuring, costs related to new product development, compensation to previous owners, and other acquisition or restructuring related items. 

As part of our valuation procedures we assign an investment rating to all of our investments in debt securities. Our investment rating system uses a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being the lowest probability of default and principal loss. This system is used to estimate the probability of default on our debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default. The system is also used to assist us in estimating the fair value of equity related securities. These types of systems are referred to as risk rating systems and are also used by banks and rating agencies. Our risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities we hold. 

Each portfolio company debt investment is rated based upon the following numeric investment rating system: &#160; 

&#160;

Valuation Process and Determination of Net Asset Value 

The most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our financial statements is the valuation of investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation on portfolio investments are recorded as increases or decreases in investments on the balance sheets and are separately reflected on the consolidated statements of operations in determining net increase or decrease in net assets resulting from operations. 

We have established and documented processes and methodologies for determining the fair values of portfolio company investments on a recurring (quarterly) basis in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#8220;FASB&#8221;) Accounting Standards Codification (&#8220;ASC&#8221;) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures &#32;(&#8220;ASC Topic 820&#8221;). ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. 

Under ASC Topic 820, a financial instrument is categorized within the ASC Topic 820 valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input to the valuation process that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of valuation inputs established by ASC Topic 820 are as follows: 

Level 1 Inputs &#32;&#8211; include quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2 Inputs &#32;&#8211; include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 3 Inputs &#32;&#8211; include inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 

Our investment portfolio is comprised of debt and equity instruments of privately held companies for which quoted prices or other inputs falling within the categories of Level 1 and Level 2 are generally not available. Therefore, we determine the fair value of our investments in good faith using Level 3 inputs, pursuant to a valuation policy and process that is established by our management with the assistance of certain third-party advisors and subsequently approved by our Board of Directors. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith, as fair value depends upon the specific circumstances of each individual investment. The recorded fair values of our investments may differ significantly from fair values that would have been used had an active market for the securities existed. In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned. For a discussion of the risks inherent in determining the value of securities for which readily available market values do not exist, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#8212; Our investment portfolio is and will continue to be recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors and, as a result, there is and will continue to be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments&#8221; included in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report. 

Our valuation process is led by our executive officers and managing directors. The valuation process begins with a quarterly review of each investment in our investment portfolio by our executive officers and our investment committee. Valuations of each portfolio security are then prepared by our investment professionals, who have direct responsibility for the origination, management and monitoring of each investment. Under our valuation policy, each investment valuation is subject to (i) a review by the lead investment officer responsible for the portfolio company investment and (ii) a peer review by a second investment officer or executive officer. Generally, any investment that is valued below cost is subjected to review by one of our executive officers. After the peer review is complete, we engage two independent valuation firms, including Duff &#38; Phelps, LLC, collectively, the "Valuation Firms," to provide third-party reviews of certain investments, as described further below. In addition, all investment valuations are provided to our independent registered public accounting firm in connection with quarterly review procedures and the annual audit of our financial statements. Finally, the Board of Directors has the responsibility for reviewing and approving, in good faith, the fair value of our investments in accordance with the 1940 Act. 

The Valuation Firms provide third-party valuation consulting services to us which consist of certain limited procedures that we identified and requested the Valuation Firms to perform, which we herein refer to as the Procedures. The Procedures are performed with respect to each portfolio company at least once in every calendar year and for new portfolio companies, at least once in the twelve-month period subsequent to the initial investment. In addition, the Procedures are generally performed with respect to a portfolio company when there has been a significant change in the fair value of the investment. In certain instances, we may determine that it is not cost-effective, and as a result is not in our stockholders&#8217; best interest, to request the Valuation Firms to perform the Procedures on one or more portfolio companies. Such instances include, but are not limited to, situations where the fair value of the investment in the portfolio company is determined to be insignificant relative to the total investment portfolio. Upon completion of the Procedures, the Valuation Firms reach a conclusion as to whether, with respect to each investment reviewed by each Valuation Firm, the fair value of those investments subjected to the Procedures appear reasonable. Our Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for determining the fair value of our investments in good faith. For a further discussion of the Valuation Firms&#8217; procedures, see the section entitled &#8220;Investment Valuation&#8221; included in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; included in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report. 

Investment Valuation Inputs 

Under ASC Topic 820, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between a willing buyer and a willing seller at the measurement date. For our portfolio securities, fair value is generally the amount that we might reasonably expect to receive upon the current sale of the security. Under ASC Topic 820, the fair value measurement assumes that the sale occurs in the principal market for the security, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the security. Under ASC Topic 820, if no market for the security exists or if we do not have access to the principal market, the security should be valued based on the sale occurring in a hypothetical market. The securities in which we invest are generally only purchased and sold in merger and acquisition transactions, in which case the entire portfolio company is sold to a third-party purchaser. As a result, unless we have the ability to control such a transaction, the assumed principal market for our securities is a hypothetical secondary market. The Level 3 inputs to our valuation process reflect management&#8217;s best estimate of the assumptions that would be used by market participants in pricing the investment in a transaction in a hypothetical secondary market. 

Enterprise Value Waterfall Approach 

In valuing equity securities (including warrants), we estimate fair value using an &#8220;Enterprise Value Waterfall&#8221; valuation model. We estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company and then allocate the enterprise value to the portfolio company&#8217;s securities in order of their relative liquidation preference. In addition, the model assumes that any outstanding debt or other securities that are senior to our equity securities are required to be repaid at par. Additionally, we estimate the fair value of a limited number of its debt securities using the Enterprise Value Waterfall approach in cases where we do not expect to receive full repayment. 

To estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company, we primarily use a valuation model based on a transaction multiple, which generally is the original transaction multiple, and measures of the portfolio company&#8217;s financial performance. In addition, we consider other factors, including but not limited to (i) offers from third-parties to purchase the portfolio company, (ii) the implied value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company, (iii) publicly available information regarding recent sales of private companies in comparable transactions and (iv) when management believes there are comparable companies that are publicly traded, a review of these publicly traded companies and the market multiple of their equity securities. For certain non-performing 

assets, we may utilize the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company's assets in our estimation of enterprise value. 

The significant Level 3 inputs to the Enterprise Value Waterfall model are (i) an appropriate transaction multiple and (ii) a measure of the portfolio company&#8217;s financial performance, which generally is either earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted, or Adjusted EBITDA, or revenues. Such inputs can be based on historical operating results, projections of future operating results, or a combination thereof. The operating results of a portfolio company may be unaudited, projected or pro forma financial information and may require adjustments for certain non-recurring items. In determining the operating results input, we utilize the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts available as of the valuation date. Management also consults with the portfolio company&#8217;s senior management to obtain updates on the portfolio company&#8217;s performance, including information such as industry trends, new product development, loss of customers and other operational issues. Additionally, we consider some or all of the following factors: 

&#8226; 

financial standing of the issuer of the security; 

&#8226; 

comparison of the business and financial plan of the issuer with actual results; 

&#8226; 

the size of the security held; 

&#8226; 

pending reorganization activity affecting the issuer, such as merger or debt restructuring; 

&#8226; 

ability of the issuer to obtain needed financing; 

&#8226; 

changes in the economy affecting the issuer; 

&#8226; 

financial statements and reports from portfolio company senior management and ownership; 

&#8226; 

the type of security, the security&#8217;s cost at the date of purchase and any contractual restrictions on the disposition of the security; 

&#8226; 

information as to any transactions or offers with respect to the security and/or sales to third parties of similar securities; 

&#8226; 

the issuer&#8217;s ability to make payments and the type of collateral; 

&#8226; 

the current and forecasted earnings of the issuer; 

&#8226; 

statistical ratios compared to lending standards and to other similar securities; 

&#8226; 

pending public offering of common stock by the issuer of the security; 

&#8226; 

special reports prepared by analysts; and 

&#8226; 

any other factors we deem pertinent with respect to a particular investment. 

Fair value measurements using the Enterprise Value Waterfall model can be sensitive to significant changes in one or more of the inputs. A significant increase in either the transaction multiple, Adjusted EBITDA or revenues for a particular equity security would result in a higher fair value for that security. 

Income Approach 

In valuing debt securities, we utilize an &#8220;Income Approach&#8221; model that considers factors including, but not limited to, (i) the stated yield on the debt security, (ii) the portfolio company&#8217;s current trailing twelve months, or TTM, Adjusted EBITDA as compared to the portfolio company&#8217;s historical or projected Adjusted EBITDA as of the date the investment was made and the portfolio company&#8217;s anticipated Adjusted EBITDA for the next twelve months of operations, (iii) the portfolio company&#8217;s current Leverage Ratio (defined as the portfolio company&#8217;s total indebtedness divided by Adjusted EBITDA) as compared to its Leverage Ratio as of the date the investment was made, (iv) publicly available information regarding current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed and executed investment transactions of private companies and (v) when management believes a relevant comparison exists, current pricing and credit metrics for similar proposed and executed investment transactions of publicly traded debt. In addition, we use a risk rating system to estimate the probability of default on the debt securities and the probability of loss if there is a default. This risk rating system covers both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the business and the securities held. 

We consider the factors above, particularly any significant changes in the portfolio company&#8217;s results of operations and leverage, and develop an expectation of the yield that a hypothetical market participant would require when purchasing the debt investment, which we refer to herein as the Required Rate of Return. The Required Rate of Return, along with the Leverage Ratio and Adjusted EBITDA are the significant Level 3 inputs to the Income Approach model. For investments where the Leverage Ratio and Adjusted EBITDA have not fluctuated significantly from the date the investment was made or have not fluctuated significantly from management&#8217;s expectations as of the date the investment was made, and where there have been no significant fluctuations in the market pricing for such investments, we may conclude that the Required Rate of Return is equal to the stated rate on the investment and therefore, the debt security is appropriately priced. In instances where we determine that the Required Rate of Return is different from the stated rate on the investment, we discount the contractual cash flows on the debt instrument using the Required Rate of Return in order to estimate the fair value of the debt security. 

Fair value measurements using the Income Approach model can be sensitive to significant changes in one or more of the inputs. A significant increase (decrease) in the Required Rate of Return or Leverage Ratio inputs for a particular debt security may result in a lower (higher) fair value for that security. A significant increase (decrease) in the Adjusted EBITDA input for a particular debt security may result in a higher (lower) fair value for that security. 

The fair value of our royalty rights are calculated based on specific provisions contained in the pertinent operating or royalty agreements. The determination of the fair value of such royalty rights is not a significant component of our valuation process. 

Determination of the fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates not susceptible to substantiation by auditing procedures. Accordingly, under current auditing standards, the notes to our financial statements will refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements. In addition, the SBA has established certain valuation guidelines for SBICs to follow when valuing portfolio investments. 

Quarterly Net Asset Value Determination 

We determine the net asset value per share of our common stock on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently if we are required to do so pursuant to an equity offering or pursuant to federal laws and regulations. The net asset value per share is equal to the value of our total assets minus total liabilities and any preferred stock outstanding divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding. 

Managerial Assistance 

As a BDC, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance typically involves, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. Our senior management team provides such services. We believe, based on our management team&#8217;s combined experience at investment banks, commercial banks, and operating in executive-level capacities in various operating companies, we offer this assistance effectively. We generally receive fees for these services. 

Exit Strategies/Refinancing 

While we generally exit most investments through the refinancing or repayment of our debt and redemption of our equity securities, we typically assist our portfolio companies in developing and planning exit opportunities, including any sale or merger of our portfolio companies. We may also assist in the structure, timing, execution and transition of these exit strategies. 

Competition 

We compete for investments with a number of investment funds (including private equity funds, mezzanine funds and other SBICs) and BDCs, as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of financing. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do. We believe we compete with these entities primarily on the basis of our willingness to make smaller investments, the experience and contacts of our management team, our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, our comprehensive suite of customized financing solutions and the investment terms we offer. 

We believe that some of our competitors make senior secured loans, junior secured loans and subordinated debt investments with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer. Therefore, we do not seek to compete primarily on the interest rates we offer to potential portfolio companies. 

Our competitors also do not always require equity components in their investments. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#8212; We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities&#8221; included in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report. 

Brokerage Allocation and Other Practices 

We did not pay any brokerage commissions during the three years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;in connection with the acquisition and/or disposal of our investments. We generally acquire and dispose of our investments in privately negotiated transactions; therefore, we infrequently use brokers in the normal course of our business. Our management team is primarily responsible for the execution of any publicly traded securities portion of our portfolio transactions and the allocation of brokerage commissions. We do not expect to execute transactions through any particular broker or dealer, but will seek to obtain the best net results for us, taking into account such factors as price (including the applicable brokerage commission or dealer spread), size of order, difficulty of execution, and operational facilities of the firm and the firm&#8217;s risk and skill in positioning blocks of securities. While we will generally seek reasonably competitive trade execution costs, we will not necessarily pay the lowest spread or commission available. Subject to applicable legal requirements, if we use a broker, we may select a broker based partly upon brokerage or research services provided to us. In return for such services, we may pay a higher commission than other brokers would charge if we determine in good faith that such commission is reasonable in relation to the services provided. 

Dividend Reinvestment Plan 

We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our distributions on behalf of our common stockholders, unless a common stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result, if our Board of Directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend, then our common stockholders who have not &#8220;opted out&#8221; of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash dividends. 

No action will be required on the part of a registered common stockholder to have his or her cash dividend reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered common stockholder may elect to receive an entire dividend in cash by notifying Computershare, Inc., the &#8220;Plan Administrator&#8221; and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing so that such notice is received by the Plan Administrator no later than the record date for dividends to common stockholders. The Plan Administrator will set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each common stockholder who has not elected to receive dividends in cash and hold such shares in non-certificated form. Upon request by a common stockholder participating in the plan, received in writing not less than 10 days prior to the record date, the Plan Administrator will, instead of crediting shares to the participant&#8217;s account, issue a certificate registered in the participant&#8217;s name for the number of whole shares of our common stock and a check for any fractional share. Those common stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election. 

We intend to use primarily newly issued shares to implement the plan, so long as our shares are trading at or above net asset value. If our shares are trading below net asset value, we intend to purchase shares in the open market in connection with our implementation of the plan. If we use newly issued shares to implement the plan, the number of shares to be issued to a common stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to such common stockholder by the market price per share of our common stock at the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, on the dividend payment date. Market price per share on that date will be the closing price for such shares on the NYSE or, if no sale is reported for such day, at the average of their reported bid and asked prices. If we purchase shares in the open market to implement the plan, the number of shares to be issued to a common stockholder is determined by dividing the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to such common stockholder by the average price per share for all shares purchased by the Plan Administrator in the open market in connection with the dividend. The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after giving effect to payment of the dividend cannot be established until the value per share at which additional shares will be issued has been determined and elections of our common stockholders have been tabulated. 

There will be no brokerage charges or other charges to common stockholders who participate in the plan. However, certain brokerage firms may charge brokerage charges or other charges to their customers. We will pay the Plan Administrator&#8217;s fees under the plan. If a participant elects by written notice to the Plan Administrator to have the Plan Administrator sell part or all of the shares held by the Plan Administrator in the participant&#8217;s account and remit the proceeds to the participant, the Plan Administrator is authorized to deduct a $15.00 transaction fee plus a $0.10 per share brokerage commission from the proceeds. 

Common stockholders who receive dividends in the form of stock generally are subject to the same federal, state and local tax consequences as are common stockholders who elect to receive their dividends in cash. A common stockholder&#8217;s basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of stock received in a dividend from us will be equal to the total dollar amount of the dividend payable to the common stockholder. Any stock received in a dividend will have a holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the U.S. common stockholder&#8217;s account. 

Participants may terminate their accounts under the plan by notifying the Plan Administrator via its website at www.computershare.com/investor, by filling out the transaction request form located at the bottom of their statement and sending it to the Plan Administrator at Computershare, Inc., P.O. Box 30170, College Station, Texas 77842-3170, or by calling the Plan Administrator at (866) 228-7201. 

We may terminate the plan upon notice in writing mailed to each participant at least 30 days prior to any record date for the payment of any dividend by us. All correspondence concerning the plan should be directed to the Plan Administrator by mail at Computershare, Inc., P.O. Box 30170, College Station, Texas 77842-3170. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed twenty-six individuals, including investment and portfolio management professionals, operations professionals and administrative staff. We expect to expand our management team and administrative staff in the future in proportion to our growth. 

Election to be Regulated as a Business Development Company and Regulated Investment Company 

Both we and Triangle SBIC individually are closed-end, non-diversified management investment companies that have elected to be treated as BDCs under the 1940 Act. In addition, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;). Our election to be regulated as a BDC and our election to be treated as a RIC for federal income tax purposes have a significant impact on our operations. Some of the most important effects on our operations of our election to be regulated as a BDC and our election to be treated as a RIC are outlined below. 

&#8226; 

We report our investments at market value or fair value with changes in value reported through our consolidated statements of operations. 

In accordance with the requirements of Article 6 of Regulation S-X, we report all of our investments, including debt investments, at market value or, for investments that do not have a readily available market value, at their &#8220;fair value&#8221; as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Changes in these values are reported through our statements of operations under the caption of &#8220;net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of investments.&#8221; See &#8220;Valuation Process and Determination of Net Asset Value&#8221; above. 

&#8226; 

We intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders. We generally will be required to pay income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income we do not distribute to stockholders (actually or constructively). 

As a RIC, so long as we meet certain minimum distribution, source-of-income and asset diversification requirements, we generally are required to pay U.S. federal income taxes only on the portion of our taxable income and gains we do not distribute (actually or constructively) and certain built-in gains. We intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our income. We may, however, make deemed distributions to our stockholders of any retained net long-term capital gains. If this happens, our stockholders will be treated as if they received an actual distribution of the net capital gains and reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in us. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim a tax credit (or, in certain circumstances, a tax refund) equal to their allocable share of the corporate-level U.S. federal income tax we pay on the deemed distribution. See &#8220;Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations.&#8221; We met the minimum distribution requirements for 2013 , 2014 &#32;and 2015 &#32;and continually monitor our distribution requirements with the goal of ensuring compliance with the Code. &#160; 

In addition, we have certain wholly-owned taxable subsidiaries, or the Taxable Subsidiaries, each of which holds a portion of one or more of our portfolio investments that are listed on the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. The Taxable Subsidiaries are consolidated for financial reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP, so that our consolidated financial statements reflect our investments in the portfolio companies owned by the Taxable Subsidiaries. The purpose of the Taxable Subsidiaries is to permit us to hold certain interests in portfolio companies that are organized as limited liability companies, or LLCs (or other forms of pass-through entities) and still satisfy the RIC tax requirement that at least 90.0% of our gross income for federal income tax purposes must consist of qualifying investment income. Absent the Taxable Subsidiaries, a proportionate amount of any gross income of a partnership or LLC (or other pass-through entity) portfolio investment would flow through directly to us. To the extent that such income did not consist of investment income, it could jeopardize our ability to qualify as a RIC and therefore cause us to incur significant amounts of corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes. Where interests in LLCs (or other pass-through entities) are owned by the Taxable Subsidiaries, however, the income from such interests is taxed to the Taxable Subsidiaries and does not flow through to us, thereby helping us preserve our RIC status and resultant tax advantages. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. This income tax expense, if any, is reflected in our Statement of Operations. 

&#8226; 

Our ability to use leverage as a means of financing our portfolio of investments is limited. 

As a BDC, we are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities of at least 200.0%. For this purpose, senior securities include all borrowings (other than SBA leverage and certain other short-term borrowings) and any preferred stock we may issue in the future. Additionally, our ability to continue to utilize leverage as a means of financing our portfolio of investments may be limited by this asset coverage test. Under current SBA regulations, our SBIC subsidiaries cannot have outstanding more than an aggregate of $300.0 million of debenture leverage guaranteed by the SBA. While use of debenture leverage from the SBA may enhance returns if we meet our investment objective, our returns may be reduced or eliminated if the returns on investments by Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II are less than the costs of operating them, including the costs of using debenture leverage. 

&#8226; 

We are required to comply with the provisions of the 1940 Act applicable to business development companies. 

As a BDC, we are required to have a majority of directors who are not &#8220;interested&#8221; persons under the 1940 Act. In addition, we are required to comply with other applicable provisions of the 1940 Act, including those requiring the adoption of a code of ethics, fidelity bonding and investment custody arrangements. See &#8220;Regulation of Business Development Companies&#8221; below. 

Exemptive Relief 

The 1940 Act prohibits certain transactions between us, Triangle SBIC, and Triangle SBIC II, as well as our and their affiliates, without first obtaining an exemptive order from the SEC. We and Triangle SBIC initially filed a joint exemptive application with the SEC in 2007 and then received exemptive relief to our amended exemptive application in 2008. In 2010, we jointly filed with Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II another amendment to the exemptive application requesting relief under various sections of the 1940 Act to permit us, as the BDC parent, our current SBIC subsidiaries and, to the extent applicable, any of our future wholly-owned subsidiaries, to operate effectively as one company for 1940 Act regulatory purposes. Specifically, the application requested relief to (a) engage in certain transactions with each other, (b) invest in securities in which the other is an investor and engage in transactions with portfolio companies that would not otherwise be prohibited as one company, (c) be subject to modified consolidated asset coverage requirements for senior securities issued by each of us and (d) where such reporting is required for one of Triangle Capital Corporation's current or future wholly-owned subsidiaries, allow such subsidiary to file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) on a consolidated basis with Triangle Capital Corporation. On October 22, 2010, the SEC issued an exemptive relief order approving our requests. 

In addition, under current SEC rules and regulations, BDCs may not grant options or restricted stock to directors who are not officers or employees of the BDC. Similarly, under the 1940 Act, BDCs cannot issue stock for services to their executive officers and employees other than options, warrants and rights to acquire capital stock. In March 2008, we received an exemptive relief order from the SEC that (a) permits us to grant restricted stock to our independent directors as a part of their compensation for service on our Board and (b) permits us to grant restricted stock in exchange for or in recognition of services by our executive officers and employees. In February 2013, the SEC issued a notice regarding our request for exemptive relief to amend this exemptive relief order to permit an increase in our annual grant of $30,000 of restricted stock to our non-employee directors to $50,000 of restricted stock based on the closing stock price of our common stock on the date of grant. On March 21, 2013, we received an order from the SEC granting such exemptive relief. We received stockholder approval for this amendment at the 2013 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 

Regulation of Business Development Companies 

The following is a general summary of the material regulatory provisions affecting BDCs. It does not purport to be a complete description of all of the laws and regulations affecting BDCs. 

Both we and Triangle SBIC individually have elected to be regulated as BDCs under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act contains prohibitions and restrictions relating to transactions between BDCs and their affiliates, principal underwriters and affiliates of those affiliates or underwriters. The 1940 Act requires that a majority of the directors 

be persons other than &#8220;interested persons,&#8221; as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. In addition, the 1940 Act provides that we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC unless approved by a majority of our outstanding voting securities. 

In addition, the 1940 Act defines &#8220;a majority of the outstanding voting securities&#8221; as the lesser of (i) 67.0% or more of the voting securities present at a meeting if the holders of more than 50.0% of our outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) 50.0% of our voting securities. 

Qualifying Assets 

Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70.0% of the company&#8217;s total assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are any of the following: 

(1) Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act and rules adopted pursuant thereto as any issuer which: 

(a) is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 

(b) is not an investment company (other than an SBIC wholly-owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for exclusions under the 1940 Act for certain financial companies such as banks, brokers, commercial finance companies, mortgage companies and insurance companies; and 

(c) satisfies any of the following: 

(i) does not have any class of securities with respect to which a broker or dealer may extend margin credit; 

(ii) is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; 

(iii) is a small and solvent company having total assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million; 

(iv) does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; or 

(v) has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250.0 million. 

(2) Securities in companies that were eligible portfolio companies when we made our initial investment if certain other requirements are satisfied. 

(3) Securities of any eligible portfolio company that we control. 

(4) Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance (other than conventional lending or financing arrangements). 

(5) Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60.0% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 

(6) Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (5) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 

(7) Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 

In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described in (1), (2), (3) or (4) above. 

Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 

In order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70.0% test, we must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above) significant managerial assistance; except that, where we purchase such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available &#8220;significant managerial assistance&#8221; means, among other things, any arrangement whereby we, through our directors, officers or employees, offer to provide, and, if accepted, do so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 

Temporary Investments 

Pending investment in other types of &#8220;qualifying assets,&#8221; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70.0% of our assets are qualifying assets. We may invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price that is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25.0% of our total assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the asset diversification tests required to maintain our qualification as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our management team will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

Senior Securities 

We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of debt and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200.0% immediately after each such issuance. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding (other than senior securities representing indebtedness issued in consideration of a privately arranged loan which is not intended to be publicly distributed), we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5.0% of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#8220;Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#8212; Because we intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders to maintain our status as a regulated investment company, we will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth and regulations governing our operation as a business development company will affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital and make distributions&#8221; included in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report. 

Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines 

We have adopted a code of ethics, which we call our &#8220;Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,&#8221; and corporate governance guidelines, which collectively cover ethics and business conduct. These documents apply to our directors, officers and employees. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and corporate governance guidelines are publicly available on the Investor Relations section of our website under "Corporate Governance" at http:// 

tcap.client.shareholder.com/governance.cfm . We will report any amendments to or waivers of a required provision of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and corporate governance guidelines on our website or in a Current Report on Form 8-K. You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You may obtain information regarding the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and you should not consider that information to be part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Compliance Policies and Procedures 

We have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the U.S. federal securities laws, and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and to designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering such policies and procedures. Steven C. Lilly serves as our Chief Compliance Officer. 

Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 

We vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in a manner which we believe will be in the best interest of our stockholders. We review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by us. Although we generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exists compelling long-term reasons to do so. 

Our proxy voting decisions are made by the investment professionals who are responsible for monitoring each of our investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we require that: (i) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our chief compliance officer any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (ii) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 

Stockholders may, without charge, obtain information regarding how we voted proxies with respect to our portfolio securities by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Chief Compliance Officer, 3700 Glenwood Avenue, Suite 530, Raleigh, North Carolina 27612 or by calling our investor relations department collect at (919) 719-4770.

We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our Board of Directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. 

We are periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 

We are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect us against larceny and embezzlement. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#8217;s office. 

We are required to adopt and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, review these policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and to designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. See &#8220;Compliance Policies and Procedures" above. 

Small Business Administration Regulations 

Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II are licensed by the Small Business Administration, or SBA, to operate as Small Business Investment Companies, or SBICs, under Section 301(c) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. Triangle SBIC&#8217;s SBIC license became effective on September 11, 2003 and Triangle SBIC II&#8217;s SBIC license became effective on May 26, 2010. 

SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under SBA regulations, SBICs may make loans to eligible small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services. Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II have typically invested in senior and subordinated debt, acquired warrants and/or made equity investments in qualifying small businesses. 

Under current SBA regulations, eligible small businesses generally include businesses that (together with their affiliates) have a tangible net worth not exceeding $19.6 million and have average annual net income after federal income taxes not exceeding $6.5 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, an SBIC must devote at least 25.0% of its investment activity to &#8220;smaller&#8221; concerns as defined by the SBA. A smaller concern generally includes businesses that have a tangible net worth not exceeding $6.0 million and have average annual net income after federal income taxes not exceeding $2.0 million (average net income to be computed without benefit of any net carryover loss) for the two most recent fiscal years. SBA regulations also provide alternative size standard criteria to determine eligibility for designation as an eligible small business or smaller concern, which criteria depend on the industry in which the business is engaged and are based on such factors as the number of employees and gross revenue. However, once an SBIC has invested in a company, it may continue to make follow-on investments in the company, regardless of the size of the portfolio company at the time of the follow-on investment, up to the time of the portfolio company&#8217;s initial public offering. 

The SBA prohibits an SBIC from providing funds to small businesses for certain purposes, such as relending and investment outside the United States, to businesses engaged in certain prohibited industries, and to certain &#8220;passive&#8221; (non-operating) companies. In addition, without prior SBA approval, an SBIC may not invest an amount equal to more than 30.0% of the SBIC&#8217;s regulatory capital (as defined by the SBA) in any one portfolio company. 

The SBA places certain limitations on the financing terms of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies (such as limiting the permissible interest rate on debt securities held by an SBIC in a portfolio company). Although prior regulations prohibited an SBIC from controlling a small business concern except in limited circumstances, regulations adopted by the SBA in 2002 now allow an SBIC to exercise control over a small business for a period of seven years from the date on which the SBIC initially acquires its control position. This control period may be extended for an additional period of time with the SBA&#8217;s prior written approval. 

The SBA restricts the ability of an SBIC to lend money to any of its officers, directors and employees or to invest in affiliates thereof. The SBA also prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a &#8220;change of control&#8221; of an SBIC or transfers that would result in any person (or a group of persons acting in concert) owning 10.0% or more of a class of capital stock of a licensed SBIC. A &#8220;change of control&#8221; is any event which would result in the transfer of the power, direct or indirect, to direct the management and policies of an SBIC, whether through ownership, contractual arrangements or otherwise. 

An SBIC (or group of SBICs under common control) can currently have outstanding at any time debentures guaranteed by the SBA in amounts up to two times (and in certain cases, up to three times) the amount of its regulatory capital, which generally is the amount raised from private investors. Debentures guaranteed by the SBA have a maturity of ten years, with interest payable semi-annually. As of December 31, 2015 , the maximum statutory limit on the dollar amount of outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures that may be issued by a single SBIC was $150.0 million and by a group of SBICs under common control was $350.0 million. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Triangle SBIC had issued $150.0 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures and Triangle SBIC II had issued $75.0 million in face amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures. The weighted average interest rate for all SBA-guaranteed debentures as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was 4.02%. As of December 31, 2015 , all SBA-guaranteed debentures were pooled. 

SBICs must invest idle funds that are not being used to make loans in investments permitted under SBA regulations in the following limited types of securities: (i) direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the United States government, which mature within 15 months from the date of the investment; (ii) repurchase agreements with federally insured institutions with a maturity of seven days or less (and the securities underlying the repurchase obligations must be direct obligations of or guaranteed by the federal government); (iii) certificates of deposit with a maturity of one year or less, issued by a federally insured institution; (iv) a deposit account in a federally insured institution that is subject to a withdrawal restriction of one year or less; (v) a checking account in a federally insured institution; or (vi) a reasonable petty cash fund. 

SBICs are periodically examined and audited by the SBA&#8217;s staff to determine their compliance with SBIC regulations and are periodically required to file certain forms with the SBA. Triangle SBIC and Triangle SBIC II were audited by the SBA during 2015 , and there were no unresolved findings from the audit. 

Neither the SBA nor the U.S. government or any of its agencies or officers has approved any ownership interest to be issued by us or any obligation that we or any of our subsidiaries may incur. 

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Sarbanes-Oxley Act Compliance 

We are subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of quarterly, annual and current reports, proxy statements and other required items. In addition, we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. For example: 

&#8226; 

pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 

&#8226; 

pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports are required to disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 

&#8226; 

pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, and separately, our independent registered public accounting firm audits our internal controls over financial reporting; and 

&#8226; 

pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 

The New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Regulations 

The NYSE has adopted corporate governance regulations that listed companies must comply with. We believe we currently are in compliance with such corporate governance listing standards. We intend to monitor our compliance with all future listing standards and to take all necessary actions to ensure that we stay in compliance. 

Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 

The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in our shares. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to us or to investors in such an investment. For example, we have not described tax consequences that we assume to be generally known by investors or certain considerations that may be relevant to certain types of holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including stockholders subject to the alternative minimum tax, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers in securities, pension plans and trusts, financial institutions, U.S. stockholders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons who mark-to-market our shares and persons who hold our shares as part of a &#8220;straddle,&#8221; &#8220;hedge&#8221; or &#8220;conversion&#8221; transaction. This summary assumes that investors hold shares of our common stock as capital assets (within the meaning of the Code). The discussion is based upon the Code, Treasury regulations, and administrative and judicial interpretations, each as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and all of which are subject to change, possibly retroactively, which could affect the continuing validity of this 

discussion. This summary does not discuss any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. It does not discuss the special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws that could result if we invested in tax-exempt securities or certain other investment assets. 

For purposes of our discussion, a &#8220;U.S. stockholder&#8221; means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: 

&#8226; 

a citizen or individual resident of the United States; 

&#8226; 

a corporation, or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia; 

&#8226; 

an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 

&#8226; 

a trust if (i) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person. 

For purposes of our discussion, a &#8220;Non-U.S. stockholder&#8221; means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is neither a U.S. stockholder nor a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes). 

If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes (a &#8220;partnership&#8221;) holds shares of our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner or member of the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner or member and the activities of the partnership. A prospective stockholder that is a partner or member in a partnership holding shares of our common stock should consult his, her or its tax advisors with respect to the purchase, ownership and disposition of shares of our common stock. 

Tax matters are very complicated and the tax consequences to an investor of an investment in our shares will depend on the facts of his, her or its particular situation. We encourage investors to consult their own tax advisors regarding the specific consequences of such an investment, including tax reporting requirements, the applicability of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax laws, eligibility for the benefits of any applicable tax treaty and the effect of any possible changes in the tax laws. 

Election to be Taxed as a RIC 

We have qualified and elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2007. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our tax earnings and profits. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, in order to obtain RIC tax treatment, we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#8220;investment company taxable income,&#8221; which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess, if any, of realized net short-term capital gain over realized net long-term capital loss, or the Annual Distribution Requirement. Even if we qualify as a RIC, we generally will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on our undistributed taxable income and could be subject to U.S. federal excise, state, local and foreign taxes. 

Taxation as a RIC 

Provided that we qualify as a RIC, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain (which we define as net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) that we timely distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gain not distributed (or deemed distributed) to our stockholders. 

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (i) 98.0% of our ordinary income for each calendar year, (ii) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year and (iii) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. 

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

&#8226; 

meet the Annual Distribution Requirement; 

&#8226; 

qualify to be treated as a BDC or be registered as a management investment company under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; 

&#8226; 

derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or other securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net income derived from an interest in a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership&#8221; (as defined in the Code), or the 90% Income Test; and 

&#8226; 

diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: 

&#8226; 

at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer (which for these purposes includes the equity securities of a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership&#8221;); and 

&#8226; 

no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. Government securities or securities of other RICs, (i) of one issuer (ii) of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable tax rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or (iii) of one or more &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnerships,&#8221; or the Diversification Tests. 

To the extent that we invest in entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes (other than a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership&#8221;), we generally must include the items of gross income derived by the partnerships for purposes of the 90% Income Test, and the income that is derived from a partnership (other than a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership&#8221;) will be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test only to the extent that such income is attributable to items of income of the partnership which would be qualifying income if realized by us directly. In addition, we generally must take into account our proportionate share of the assets held by partnerships (other than a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership&#8221;) in which we are a partner for purposes of the Diversification Tests. 

In order to meet the 90% Income Test, we have established several special purpose corporations, and in the future may establish additional such corporations, to hold assets from which we do not anticipate earning dividend, interest or other income under the 90% Income Test (the "Taxable Subsidiaries"). Any investments held through a Taxable Subsidiary generally are subject to U.S. federal income and other taxes, and therefore we can expect to achieve a reduced after-tax yield on such investments. 

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with payment-in-kind interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock. We anticipate that a portion of our income may constitute original issue discount or other income required to be included in taxable income prior to receipt of cash. 

Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of the accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. As a result, we may have difficulty meeting the annual distribution requirement necessary to obtain and maintain RIC tax treatment under the Code. We may have to sell some of our investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or forgo new investment opportunities 

for this purpose. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax. 

Furthermore, a portfolio company in which we invest may face financial difficulty that requires us to work-out, modify or otherwise restructure our investment in the portfolio company. Any such restructuring may result in unusable capital losses and future non-cash income. Any restructuring may also result in our recognition of a substantial amount of non-qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test, such as cancellation of indebtedness income in connection with the work-out of a leveraged investment (which, while not free from doubt, may be treated as non-qualifying income) or the receipt of other non-qualifying income. 

Gain or loss realized by us from warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 

Investments by us in non-U.S. securities may be subject to non-U.S. income, withholding and other taxes, and therefore, our yield on any such securities may be reduced by such non-U.S. taxes. Stockholders will generally not be entitled to claim a credit or deduction with respect to non-U.S. taxes paid by us. 

If we purchase shares in a &#8220;passive foreign investment company,&#8221; or PFIC, we may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any &#8220;excess distribution&#8221; or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend by us to our stockholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on us in respect of deferred taxes arising from such distributions or gains. If we invest in &#32; a PFIC and elect to treat the PFIC as a &#8220;qualified electing fund&#8221; under the Code, or QEF, in lieu of the foregoing requirements, we will be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gain of the QEF, even if such income is not distributed to it. Alternatively, we can elect to mark-to-market at the end of each taxable year our shares in a PFIC; in this case, we will recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it does not exceed prior increases included in income. Under either election, we may be required to recognize in a year income in excess of our distributions from PFICs and our proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and such income will nevertheless be subject to the Annual Distribution Requirement and will be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax. 

Under Section 988 of the Code, gain or loss attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the time we accrue income, expenses, or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such income or pay such expenses or liabilities are generally treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, gain or loss on foreign currency forward contracts and the disposition of debt denominated in a foreign currency, to the extent attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the acquisition and disposition dates, are also treated as ordinary income or loss. 

We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. Under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#8220;asset coverage&#8221; tests are met. See &#8220;Regulation of Business Development Companies &#8212; Qualifying Assets&#8221; and &#8220;Regulation of Business Development Companies &#8212; Senior Securities" above. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (i) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (ii) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 

If we fail to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a RIC in any taxable year, we will be subject to tax in that year on all of our taxable income, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. In that case, all of such income will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax, reducing the amount available to be distributed to our stockholders. See &#8220;Failure To Obtain RIC Tax Treatment" below. 

As a RIC, we are not allowed to carry forward or carry back a net operating loss for purposes of computing our investment company taxable income in other taxable years. U.S. federal income tax law generally permits a RIC to carry forward (i) the excess of its net short-term capital loss over its net long-term capital gain for a given year as 

a short-term capital loss arising on the first day of the following year and (ii) the excess of its net long-term capital loss over its net short-term capital gain for a given year as a long-term capital loss arising on the first day of the following year. Future transactions we engage in may cause our ability to use any capital loss carryforwards, and unrealized losses once realized, to be limited under Section 382 of the Code. Certain of our investment practices may be subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gain and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gain or ordinary income, (iii) convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (vii) produce income that will not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test. We will monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections in order to mitigate the effect of these provisions. 

As described above, to the extent that we invest in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the effect of such investments for purposes of the 90% Income Test and the Diversification Tests will depend on whether or not the partnership is a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership&#8221; (as defined in the Code). If the entity is a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership,&#8221; the net income derived from such investments will be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and will be &#8220;securities&#8221; for purposes of the Diversification Tests. If the entity is not treated as a &#8220;qualified publicly traded partnership,&#8221; however, the consequences of an investment in the partnership will depend upon the amount and type of income and assets of the partnership allocable to us. The income derived from such investments may not be qualifying income for purposes of the 90% Income Test and, therefore, could adversely affect our qualification as a RIC. We intend to monitor our investments in equity securities of entities that are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes to prevent our disqualification as a RIC. 

We may invest in preferred securities or other securities the U.S. federal income tax treatment of which may not be clear or may be subject to recharacterization by the IRS. To the extent the tax treatment of such securities or the income from such securities differs from the expected tax treatment, it could affect the timing or character of income recognized, requiring us to purchase or sell securities, or otherwise change our portfolio, in order to comply with the tax rules applicable to RICs under the Code. 

We may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of each stockholder. Under certain applicable provisions of the Code and the Treasury regulations, distributions payable in cash or in shares of stock at the election of stockholders are treated as taxable dividends. The Internal Revenue Service has issued private rulings indicating that this rule will apply even where the total amount of cash that may be distributed is limited to no more than 20% of the total distribution. Under these rulings, if too many stockholders elect to receive their distributions in cash, each such stockholder would receive a pro rata share of the total cash to be distributed and would receive the remainder of their distribution in shares of stock. If we decide to make any distributions consistent with these rulings that are payable in part in our stock, taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend (whether received in cash, our stock, or a combination thereof) as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for United States federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock. 

Taxation of U.S. Stockholders 

Whether an investment in shares of our common stock is appropriate for a U.S. stockholder will depend upon that person&#8217;s particular circumstances. An investment in shares of our common stock by a U.S. stockholder may have adverse tax consequences. The following summary generally describes certain U.S. federal income tax 

consequences of an investment in shares of our common stock by taxable U.S. stockholders and not by U.S. stockholders that are generally exempt from U.S. federal income taxation. U.S. stockholders should consult their own tax advisors before making an investment in our common stock. 

Distributions by us generally are taxable to U.S. stockholders as ordinary income or capital gain. Distributions of our &#8220;investment company taxable income&#8221; (which generally is our ordinary income excluding net capital gain) will be taxable as ordinary income to U.S. stockholders to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. To the extent such distributions paid by us to non-corporate U.S. stockholders (including individuals) are attributable to dividends from U.S. corporations and certain qualified foreign corporations, such distributions generally will be eligible for taxation at rates applicable to &#8220;qualifying dividends&#8221; at a maximum federal income tax rate of 20% provided that we properly report such distribution as &#8220;qualified dividend income&#8221; in a written statement furnished to our stockholders and certain holding period and other requirements are satisfied. In this regard, it is not anticipated that a significant portion of distributions paid by us will be attributable to qualifying dividends; therefore, our distributions generally will not qualify for the preferential rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Distributions of our net capital gain (which generally is our net long-term capital gain in excess of net short-term capital loss) properly designated by us as &#8220;capital gain dividends&#8221; will be taxable to a U.S. stockholder as long-term capital gain (at a maximum federal income tax rate of 20% in the case of individuals, trusts or estates), regardless of the U.S. stockholder&#8217;s holding period for his, her or its common stock and regardless of whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional common stock. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits first will reduce a U.S. stockholder&#8217;s adjusted tax basis in such stockholder&#8217;s common stock and, after the adjusted basis is reduced to zero, will constitute capital gain to such U.S. stockholder. 

Although we currently intend to distribute any long-term capital gain at least annually, we may in the future decide to retain some or all of our long-term capital gain, but designate the retained amount as a &#8220;deemed distribution.&#8221; In that case, among other consequences, we will pay tax on the retained amount, each U.S. stockholder will be required to include his, her or its proportionate share of the deemed distribution in income as if it had been actually distributed to the U.S. stockholder, and the U.S. stockholder will be entitled to claim a credit equal to his, her or its allocable share of the tax paid thereon by us. The amount of the deemed distribution net of such tax will be added to the U.S. stockholder&#8217;s tax basis for his, her or its common stock. Since we expect to pay tax on any retained capital gain at our regular corporate tax rate, and since that rate is in excess of the maximum rate currently payable by individuals on net capital gain, the amount of tax that individual stockholders will be treated as having paid and for which they will receive a credit will exceed the tax they owe on the retained net capital gain. Such excess generally may be claimed as a credit against the U.S. stockholder&#8217;s other U.S. federal income tax obligations or may be refunded to the extent it exceeds a stockholder&#8217;s liability for U.S. federal income tax. A stockholder that is not subject to U.S. federal income tax or otherwise required to file a U.S. federal income tax return would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return on the appropriate form in order to claim a refund for the taxes we paid. In order to utilize the deemed distribution approach, we must provide written notice to our stockholders prior to the expiration of 60 days after the close of the relevant taxable year. We cannot treat any of our investment company taxable income as a &#8220;deemed distribution.&#8221; 

We could be subject to the alternative minimum tax, or the AMT, but any items that are treated differently for AMT purposes must be apportioned between us and our stockholders and this may affect U.S. stockholders&#8217; AMT liabilities. Although regulations explaining the precise method of apportionment have not yet been issued, such items will generally be apportioned in the same proportion that distributions paid to each stockholder bear to our taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction), unless a different method for a particular item is warranted under the circumstances. 

For purposes of determining (i) whether the Annual Distribution Requirement is satisfied for any year and (ii) the amount of capital gain dividends paid for that year, we may, under certain circumstances, elect to treat a dividend that is paid during the following taxable year as if it had been paid during the taxable year in question. If we make such an election, the U.S. stockholder will still be treated as receiving the dividend in the taxable year in which the distribution is made. However, any dividend declared by us in October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in any such month and actually paid during 

January of the following year, will be treated as if it had been received by our U.S. stockholders on December 31 of the year in which the dividend was declared. 

If an investor purchases shares of our common stock shortly before the record date of a distribution, the price of the shares will include the value of the distribution, and the investor will be subject to tax on the distribution even though it represents a return of his, her or its investment. 

A U.S. stockholder generally will recognize taxable gain or loss if the stockholder sells or otherwise disposes of his, her or its shares of our common stock. The amount of gain or loss will be measured by the difference between such stockholder&#8217;s adjusted tax basis in the common stock sold and the amount of the proceeds received in exchange. Any gain arising from such sale or disposition generally will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder has held his, her or its shares for more than one year. Otherwise, it will be classified as short-term capital gain or loss. However, any capital loss arising from the sale or disposition of shares of our common stock held for six months or less will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of capital gain dividends received, or undistributed capital gain deemed received, with respect to such shares. In addition, all or a portion of any loss recognized upon a disposition of shares of our common stock may be disallowed if other substantially identical shares are purchased (whether through reinvestment of distributions or otherwise) within 30 days before or after the disposition. The ability to otherwise deduct capital loss may be subject to other limitations under the Code. 

In general, non-corporate U.S. stockholders, including individuals, trusts and estates, are subject to U.S. federal income tax at a maximum rate of 20% on their net capital gain, or the excess of realized net long-term capital gain over realized net short-term capital loss for a taxable year, including a long-term capital gain derived from an investment in our shares. Such rate is lower than the maximum rate on ordinary income currently payable by individuals. Corporate U.S. stockholders currently are subject to U.S. federal income tax on net capital gain at the maximum 35% rate also applied to ordinary income. Non-corporate stockholders with net capital loss for a year (which we define as capital loss in excess of capital gain) generally may deduct up to $3,000 of such losses against their ordinary income each year; any net capital loss of a noncorporate stockholder in excess of $3,000 generally may be carried forward and used in subsequent years as provided in the Code. Corporate stockholders generally may not deduct any net capital loss for a year, but may carry back such losses for three years or carry forward such losses for five years. 

Certain U.S. stockholders who are individuals, estates or trusts generally are subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax on, among other things, dividends on, and capital gain from the sale or other disposition of, shares of our common stock. 

A &#8220;publicly offered&#8221; RIC is a RIC whose shares are either (i) continuously offered pursuant to a public offering, (ii) regularly traded on an established securities market or (iii) held by at least 500 persons at all times during the taxable year. If we are not a publicly offered RIC for any period, a non-corporate stockholder&#8217;s pro rata portion of our affected expenses, including our management fees, will be treated as an additional dividend to the stockholder and will be deductible by such stockholder only to the extent permitted under the limitations described below. For non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, trusts, and estates, significant limitations generally apply to the deductibility of certain expenses of a non-publicly offered RIC, including advisory fees. In particular, these expenses, referred to as miscellaneous itemized deductions, are deductible only to individuals to the extent they exceed 2% of such a stockholder&#8217;s adjusted gross income, and are not deductible for AMT purposes. Because we anticipate that shares of our common stock will continue to be regularly traded on an established securities market, we believe that we will continue to qualify as a &#8220;publicly offered regulated investment company.&#8221; 

We will send to each of our U.S. stockholders, as promptly as possible after the end of each calendar year, a written statement detailing, on a per share and per distribution basis, the amounts includible in such U.S. stockholder&#8217;s taxable income for such year as ordinary income and as long-term capital gain. In addition, the U.S. federal tax status of each year&#8217;s distributions generally will be reported to the IRS. Distributions paid by us generally will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction or the preferential tax rate applicable to qualifying dividends. Distributions may also be subject to additional state, local and foreign taxes depending on a U.S. stockholder&#8217;s particular situation. 

We may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax, or backup withholding at a rate of 28%, from all taxable distributions to any non-corporate U.S. stockholder (i) who fails to furnish us with a correct taxpayer identification number or a certificate that such stockholder is exempt from backup withholding or (ii) with respect to whom the IRS notifies us that such stockholder has failed to properly report certain interest and dividend income to the IRS and to respond to notices to that effect. An individual&#8217;s taxpayer identification number is his or her social security number. Backup withholding tax is not an additional tax, and any amount withheld may be refunded or credited against the U.S. stockholder&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that proper information is timely provided to the IRS. 

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013, if certain disclosure requirements related to U.S. accounts or ownership are not satisfied, a U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate will be imposed on dividends received by U.S. stockholders that own their stock through foreign accounts or foreign intermediaries. In addition, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016, if certain disclosure requirements related to U.S. accounts or ownership are not satisfied, a U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate will be imposed on proceeds of sale in respect of our stock received by U.S. stockholders that own their stock through foreign accounts or foreign intermediaries. We will not pay any additional amounts in respect of any amounts withheld. 

Under U.S. Treasury regulations, if a stockholder recognizes a loss with respect to shares of our stock of $2 million or more for an individual, S corporation, trust or a partnership with at least one non-corporate partner or $10 million or more for a stockholder that is either a corporation or a partnership with only corporate partners in any single taxable year (or a greater loss over a combination of years), the stockholder must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886 (or successor form). Direct stockholders of portfolio securities in many cases are exempted from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, stockholders of a RIC are not exempted. Future guidance may extend the current exception from this reporting requirement to stockholders of most or all RICs. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer&#8217;s treatment of the loss is proper. Significant monetary penalties apply to a failure to comply with this reporting requirement. States may also have a similar reporting requirement. Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances. 

Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders 

Whether an investment in the shares is appropriate for a Non-U.S. stockholder will depend upon that person&#8217;s particular circumstances. An investment in the shares by a Non-U.S. stockholder may have adverse tax consequences. Non-U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisers before investing in our common stock. 

Distributions of our &#8220;investment company taxable income&#8221; to Non-U.S. stockholders that are not &#8220;effectively connected&#8221; with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. stockholder, will generally be subject to withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or lower rate provided by an applicable treaty) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, unless an applicable exception applies. 

Actual or deemed distributions of our net capital gain to a Non-U.S. stockholder, and gains realized by a Non-U.S. stockholder upon the sale of our common stock, that are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. stockholder, will generally not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax and generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless the Non-U.S. stockholder is a nonresident alien individual and is physically present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year and meets certain other requirements. However, withholding of U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% on capital gain of nonresident alien individuals who are physically present in the United States for more than the 182 day period only applies in exceptional cases because any individual present in the United States for more than 182 days during the taxable year is generally treated as a resident for U.S. income tax purposes; in that case, he or she would be subject to U.S. income tax on his or her worldwide income at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, rather than the 30% U.S. federal withholding tax. 

If we distribute our net capital gain in the form of deemed rather than actual distributions (which we may do in the future), a Non-U.S. stockholder will be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax credit or tax refund equal to the stockholder&#8217;s allocable share of the tax we pay on the capital gain deemed to have been distributed. In order to obtain the refund, the Non-U.S. stockholder must obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number and file a U.S. 

federal income tax return even if the Non-U.S. stockholder would not otherwise be required to obtain a U.S. taxpayer identification number or file a U.S. federal income tax return. Accordingly, investment in the shares may not be appropriate for a Non-U.S. stockholder. 

Distributions of our &#8220;investment company taxable income&#8221; and net capital gain (including deemed distributions) to Non-U.S. stockholders, and gain realized by Non-U.S. stockholders upon the sale of our common stock that is &#8220;effectively connected&#8221; with a U.S. trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. stockholder (or if an income tax treaty applies, attributable to a &#8220;permanent establishment&#8221; in the United States), will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the graduated rates applicable to U.S. citizens, residents and domestic corporations. Corporate Non-U.S. stockholders may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% imposed by the Code (or lower rate provided by an applicable treaty). In the case of a non-corporate Non-U.S. stockholder, we may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax from distributions that are otherwise exempt from withholding tax (or taxable at a reduced rate) unless the Non-U.S. stockholder certifies his or her foreign status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption. 

The tax consequences to a Non-U.S. stockholder entitled to claim the benefits of an applicable tax treaty may differ from those described herein. Non-U.S. stockholders are advised to consult their own tax advisers with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in our shares. 

A Non-U.S. stockholder who is a nonresident alien individual may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding of U.S. federal income tax on dividends unless the Non-U.S. stockholder provides us or the dividend paying agent with an IRS Form W-8BEN (or an acceptable substitute form) or otherwise meets documentary evidence requirements for establishing that it is a Non-U.S. stockholder or otherwise establishes an exemption from backup withholding. 

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013, if certain disclosure requirements related to U.S. accounts or ownership are not satisfied, a U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate will be imposed on dividends received by certain Non-U.S. stockholders. In addition, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016, if certain disclosure requirements related to U.S. accounts or ownership are not satisfied, a U.S. federal withholding tax at a 30% rate will be imposed on proceeds of sale in respect of shares of our common stock received by certain Non-U.S. stockholders. If payment of withholding taxes is required, Non-U.S. stockholders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding taxes with respect to such dividends and proceeds will be required to seek a refund from the IRS to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. We will not pay any additional amounts in respect of any amounts withheld. 

Non-U.S. persons should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal income tax and withholding tax, and state, local and foreign tax consequences of an investment in the shares. 

Failure to Obtain RIC Tax Treatment 

If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level federal taxes or to dispose of certain assets). 

If we were unable to obtain tax treatment as a RIC, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would they be required to be made. Distributions would generally be taxable to our stockholders as dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (in the case of non-corporate U.S. stockholders, generally at a maximum federal income tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income of 20%). Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#8217;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. 

If we fail to meet the RIC requirements for more than two consecutive years and then, seek to re-qualify as a RIC, we would be subject to corporate-level taxation on any built-in gain recognized during the succeeding 10-year 

period unless we made a special election to recognize all such built-in gain upon our re-qualification as a RIC and to pay the corporate-level tax on such built-in gain. 

Possible Legislative or Other Actions Affecting Tax Considerations 

Prospective investors should recognize that the present U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our stock may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process any by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect the tax consequences of an investment in our stock. 

State and Local Tax Treatment 

The state and local tax treatment may differ from federal income tax treatment. 

The discussion set forth herein does not constitute tax advice, and potential investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the tax considerations relevant to their particular situation.
