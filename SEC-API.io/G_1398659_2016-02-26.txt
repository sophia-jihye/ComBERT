 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Genpact stands for &#147;generating business impact.&#148; We are a global leader in digitally-powered business process management and services. We architect the Lean Digital SM enterprise through our patented Smart Enterprise Processes (SEP SM ) framework that reimagines our clients&#146; operating models end-to-end, including the middle and back offices. This creates Intelligent Operations SM that we help design, transform, and run. The impact on our clients is a high return on transformation investments through growth, efficiency, and business agility. For two decades, first as a General Electric division and later as an independent company, we have been passionately serving our clients. Today, we generate impact for a few hundred strategic clients, including approximately one fifth of the Fortune Global 500, and have grown to over 70,000 people in 25 countries, with corporate offices in New York City. The resulting business process and industry domain expertise and experience running complex operations are a unique heritage and focus that help us drive the best choices across technology, analytics, and organizational design. 

In 2015, we had net revenues of $2.461 billion, of which $2.001 billion, or 81.3%, was from clients other than GE, which we refer to as Global Clients, with the remaining $460 million, or 18.7%, coming from GE. 

Our business was initially conducted through various entities and divisions of GE. We began operating as an independent company in 2004, when GE placed our operations under a newly-formed Luxembourg company and sold indirect interests in us to our initial private equity investors . In 2007, we became a Bermuda company and completed our initial public offering. In 2012, affiliates of Bain Capital Investors, LLC, or Bain Capital, acquired the majority of our initial private equity investors&#146; interests. As of December 31, 2015, Bain Capital (through its affiliates) owned approximately 27% of our outstanding equity. 

We use the terms &#147;Genpact,&#148; &#147;Company,&#148; &#147;we&#148; and &#147;us&#148; to refer to both our predecessor company and its subsidiaries, and Genpact Limited and its subsidiaries. Our registered office is located at Canon&#146;s Court, 22 Victoria Street, Hamilton HM 12, Bermuda. 

Our Solution 

Our vision is to be the global leader in business process management, helping businesses make smarter decisions and realize better business outcomes through our digitally-driven solutions that draw on our deep domain expertise and understanding of process operations, analytics and advanced technology. We seek to build long-term client relationships with companies that wish to improve the ways in which they do business and to whom we can offer a full range of services. With our broad and deep capabilities and our global delivery platform, we deliver comprehensive and innovative solutions incorporating continuous process improvement to clients around the world. 

Our business focuses on industry verticals in banking and financial services, insurance, capital markets, consumer product goods, life sciences, infrastructure, manufacturing and services, healthcare and high tech. 

Our service offerings in these core verticals are driven by our broad end-to-end process expertise, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; finance and accounting (F&#38;A) services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; core industry operations services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; analytics and research; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; business consulting and enterprise risk consulting; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#149; &#160; transformation services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; supply chain and procurement services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; enterprise application services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; IT infrastructure management services; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; collections and customer services. 

We seek to deliver significant business impact for our clients by designing, transforming and running a combination of processes, as well as providing solutions that combine elements of several of our service offerings. In providing services across our global delivery platform, we draw on core capabilities in process expertise, analytics capabilities and technology expertise, as well as the operational insight we have acquired from our experience in managing thousands of processes for our clients. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Process Expertise. We have extensive experience in running a wide range of processes and use this expertise to continuously improve and update our patented Smart Enterprise Processes (SEP SM ) proprietary framework. We believe we have built a science of process through SEP SM &#151;a patented and highly granular approach to managing business processes. In addition to efficiency, SEP SM focuses on maximizing process effectiveness. We also apply the principles of Lean and Six Sigma to eliminate defects and variation and reduce inefficiency. Our Lean and Six Sigma process rigor also allows us to develop and track operational metrics to measure process performance as a means of monitoring service levels and enhancing productivity. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Analytics and Research Capabilities. Our analytics and research capabilities are central to our ability to improve business processes. They enable us to work with our clients and identify weaknesses in business processes and redesign and transform them to create additional business value. The confluence of big data, regulatory changes and social media are causing a major shift in the way businesses operate. We help our clients harness data to identify trends and issues, uncover new insights, identify and prevent future risks and fine-tune operations to make smarter decisions and meet business goals. We also rigorously apply analytical methodologies, which we use to measure and enhance performance of our client services. In addition, we apply these methodologies to measure and improve our own internal functions, including recruitment and retention of personnel. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Technology Expertise. Our information technology expertise includes extensive knowledge and integration of cloud-based advanced digital technologies, third-party hardware, partner solutions, network and computing infrastructure, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) and other software applications. We use technology to better manage the transition of processes, to automate and run processes more efficiently and to replace or redesign processes to enhance productivity. Our ability to combine our business process and IT expertise, along with our Lean and Six Sigma skills, helps our clients achieve the full potential of business intelligence platforms and web-based software platforms. Additionally, with the growing prevalence of digital technologies incorporated in our solutions, we are certifying a new group of digital black belts and digital master black belts. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Operational Insight. Our operational insight enables us to make the best use of our core capabilities. Operational insight starts with the ability to understand the business context of a process. We place great value on understanding not only the industry in which a client operates, but also the business culture and institutional parameters within which a process is performed. Operational insight also requires the judgment to determine the best way to improve a process in light of the knowledge of best practices across different industries, as well as an appreciation of what solutions can be fully implemented in the context of the particular business environment. 

&#160; 

Smart Enterprise Processes (SEP SM ) 

SEP SM is our patented and highly granular approach to dramatically improving the performance of business processes. In addition to efficiency, it focuses on maximizing process effectiveness. 

SEP SM and its more recent evolution, Digital SEP SM , is based on work done in the Genpact Process Innovation Lab, where we leverage our exposure to thousands of business processes and hundreds of millions of client transactions to map and analyze end-to-end processes at a granular level. This enables us to test the effectiveness of a client&#146;s processes by measuring opportunities for improvement across the value chain using best-in-class benchmarks gleaned from within and across industries and to apply our innovative process design, effective, market-leading technology, and analytical skills and tools to improve them. The result is a client-specific road map for maximizing process effectiveness. Benefits are delivered by combining our deep domain knowledge of process, key insights and best practices with execution support including focused IT applications and technology, targeted analytics, transformation services and global delivery services. 

Unlike other approaches, SEP SM focuses on measuring business outcomes, such as improving cash flow and margins, which make visible the effectiveness of a process in driving business results. The approach also takes an end-to-end, enterprise-wide view, working beyond traditional organizational silos. 

Genpact Digital 

Genpact&#146;s Digital practice helps clients reimagine their business operations with an innovative set of advanced technologies along with differentiated core IT services that drive transformative solutions for our clients. Our Systems of Engagement&#153; solutions provide an engagement layer of agile, nimble technologies that address end-to-end business processes and are built using social, mobility, big data and cloud-based technologies on our foundation of deep process experience and domain expertise. 

We recently introduced Lean Digital SM , our unique approach to reimagining companies&#146; middle and back offices using the full power of digital. Our Lean Digital SM solutions address what we view as the shortfalls that result from many companies either focusing their digital interventions only on front-end and customer-facing processes or digitizing broken or inadequate processes without considering enterprise-wide improvements and the related potential business outcomes. Leveraging our strong foundation in Lean and Six Sigma principles, Lean Digital SM incorporates automation and digital technologies in an end-to-end approach that transforms and digitizes companies&#146; middle and back-office processes, ensuring a seamless connection to the front end. 

Our Strategic Client Model 

We seek to create long-term relationships with our clients where they view us as an integral part of their organization and not just as a service provider. These relationships often begin with the outsourcing of discrete processes or with shorter-cycle engagements in analytics and research, business consulting, enterprise risk consulting or transformation services. Over time, these relationships typically expand to encompass multiple business processes across a broader set of functions and geographic areas. As clients adapt to constantly changing environments, many are increasingly turning to Genpact for support in transforming their operations to become more competitive and agile. These long-term transformative engagements are global and multi-tower, combining process, technology, and analytics. No matter how large or small the engagement, we strive to be a seamless extension of our client&#146;s operations. To achieve this goal, we developed the Genpact Virtual Captive SM model for service delivery, and we may implement all or some of its features in any given client relationship, depending on the client&#146;s needs. This approach provides clients with dedicated employees and management as well as dedicated infrastructure at our delivery centers to create virtual extensions of the client&#146;s own teams and environments. We train our personnel in the client&#146;s culture to be familiar not only with the process but with the business environment in which it is being executed. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

The specific elements of our strategy include the following: 

Enhance Targeted Vertical Industry and Domain Expertise 

Clients want partners who know their industry and processes at a granular level. We continue to enhance our industry and domain capabilities through acquisitions, strategic partnerships and by investing in experienced professionals in our targeted verticals and service areas to improve client intimacy and help us deliver end-to-end services that drive business impact. 

Guide Global Enterprises to Best-in-Class 

Our Smart Enterprise Processes (SEP SM ) framework, built on the foundation of thousands of Lean Six Sigma-based improvement ideas and benchmarks around granular process performance, builds deeper client relationships and delivers measurable business impact over time. We have recently begun integrating new digital technologies and data analytics into these frameworks to develop new Digital SEPs. Our differentiated framework is critical not only to extending client contracts but also to creating an expansive partnership with our clients. 

Differentiate our Solutions by Combining Process Expertise, Analytics and Technology 

Clients face an environment of uncertainty and change, which requires them to better leverage existing costs and investments, and make more informed decisions that address challenges around regulations and risk, while they continue to drive top-line growth and profitability. The insights we derive from our experience and expertise, combining smarter processes, analytics and technology, help us provide a differentiated solution to these challenges.

Our Services 

Our client solutions often combine several of our service offerings.

Core Industry Operations Services 

We help our clients design, transform and run core enterprise operations specific to their industries. On the foundation of domain expertise embedded in our SEP SM frameworks, we use our Lean Digital SM approach to leverage Systems of Engagement SM technologies and specialized analytics to power what we refer to as Intelligent Operations SM . We support our clients&#146; core operations in retail and commercial banking, capital markets, insurance, healthcare, life sciences, manufacturing, consumer goods and high tech. 

Analytics and Research 

We offer analytics services both on a standalone basis and as an integrated part of our other service offerings. We help our clients re-imagine their business operations in the context of analytics and technology through the delivery of Genpact Intelligent Operations SM fueled by our Lean Digital SM approach. Using our Systems of Engagement TM approach, we have built what we refer to as the Genpact Intelligent Process Insights Engine, a process-aware platform that embeds technology and analytics to deliver purpose-built analytics applications. Through our Data-to-Action SM Analytics approach, we help our clients harness data to assess business opportunities, mitigate risks, improve performance or otherwise help their businesses. Companies do not 

&#160; 

always recognize the inherent potential in data or do not have the capability to apply the rigorous analytical models that might reveal opportunities. Our domain-specific analytics prowess, along with a sophisticated innovation ecosystem, is increasingly embedded in all of our service offerings to help clients make timely, informed and fact-based decisions. By quantitatively and qualitatively scrutinizing data, we can deliver the insight necessary for our clients to assess new business opportunities, mitigate market risks, and make better business decisions. Our Smart Decision Lab was created to facilitate collaboration and innovation with clients and industry experts, leveraging the combination of data and analytics with process expertise.

We combine a design-thinking approach with our industry and domain expertise to create client offerings that apply cutting-edge digital technologies and analytics with a goal of driving fundamental shifts in clients&#146; business performance. 

Transformation Services 

Our transformation services help clients realize cost savings and/or increased revenues by improving or re-engineering business processes that are underperforming or designing processes that are needed to meet growth objectives. Clients engage our transformation teams to provide an end-to-end view of their organization and help determine business process needs at a strategic level as well as at the execution level. Strategically, we help clients achieve a comprehensive assessment of how well their enterprise-level processes, such as source-to-pay, order-to-cash, record-to-report, inquiry-to-order, new product introduction and sales force effectiveness, perform against industry benchmarks and best practices. At the execution level, we institutionalize the recommendations by deploying resources to train the client team and drive sustainable best practices.

Our customer services include account servicing and customer care services such as handling customer queries, general servicing and dispute resolution. We provide multi-channel voice and non-voice services, and we also provide origination and order management support. 

Our Clients 

Our clients include some of the best known companies in the world, many of which are leaders in their respective industries. 

GE has been our largest client since our inception and accounted for approximately 18.7% of our 2015 revenues. We currently provide services to most of GE&#146;s business units, including GE Capital, Power and Water, Oil and Gas, Energy Management, Renewables, Aviation, Healthcare, Transportation, Current, Digital and Corporate. The services we currently provide to GE are broad in their nature and are drawn from all of our service offerings. Although we have a single master services agreement, or MSA, with GE, we have many statements of work, or SOWs, with GE that cover in more detail the nature of the work we will perform and the amounts we will bill for the relevant services. Currently, as a general matter, each GE business unit makes its own decisions as to whether to enter into a SOW with us and as to the terms of any such SOW. Therefore, although some decisions may be made centrally at GE, our revenues from GE are generally attributable to a number of different businesses each with its own leader responsible for decision-making regarding our services. 

We have over 700 clients spread across a variety of industries and geographies. Our net revenues from Global Clients have grown rapidly in the last five years, from approximately $780 million in 2010 to approximately $2 billion in 2015, a compound annual growth rate of 20.7%. Our net revenues from Global Clients as a percentage of total net revenues increased from 62.0% in 2010 to 81.3% in 2015. See Item 7&#151;&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Classification of 

&#160; 

Certain Net Revenues.&#148; The majority of our Global Clients are based in the United States, and we also have Global Clients in Europe, Asia and Australia. 

Our contracts with our clients generally take the form of an MSA, which is a framework agreement that is then supplemented by SOWs. Our MSAs specify the general terms applicable to the services we will provide. For a description of our MSAs and SOWs, see Item 7&#151;&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Overview&#151;Revenues.&#148; 

We serve about one fifth of the Global Fortune 500, including AstraZeneca, Boeing, Citigroup, GE, GlaxoSmithKline, Heineken, Honeywell, Merck, Mondelez, Nissan, Walgreens and Wells Fargo. 

Our People 

Our people are critical to the success of our business. Our Chief Executive Officer and other members of our senior leadership team have been involved in our business since its commencement under GE resulting in an experienced and cohesive leadership team. Many members of our leadership team developed their management skills working within GE and many of them were involved in the founding of our business. They have built our business based on the experience gained in helping GE meet a wide range of challenges. As a result, we are an institutional embodiment of much of the wisdom and experience GE developed in improving and managing its own business processes. 

We have created, and constantly reinforced, a culture that emphasizes teamwork, constant improvement of our processes and, most importantly, dedication to the client. We manage this challenge through innovative human resource practices. These include broadening the employee pool by opening delivery centers in diverse locations, using innovative recruiting techniques to attract the best employees, emphasizing ongoing training, instilling a vibrant and distinctive culture and providing well-defined, long-term career paths. We also have programs modeled on GE management training programs to develop the next generation of leaders and managers of our business. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 72,000 employees. We monitor and manage our attrition rate very closely, and believe it is one of the lowest in the industry. We attribute this to our reputation, our ability to attract high quality applicants, our emphasis on maintaining our culture and the breadth of exposure, experience and opportunity for advancement that we provide to our employees. 

Lean and Six Sigma Methodologies 

Lean is a methodology for reducing waste or inefficiency in a process. Among other things, it is designed to measure and eliminate overproduction, over-processing and waiting, and to improve the flow of a process. Six Sigma is a method for improving process quality by removing variation, defects and their causes from business activities. We have Lean Six Sigma programs that train, test and grade employees in Lean and Six Sigma principles and award them Lean Six Sigma certifications. We recently launched a simplified transformation framework &#150; ProDG SM , a four-step method focused on driving outcomes leveraging Lean Six Sigma, transformation, change management, digital and design thinking tools The rankings of Lean Six Sigma qualifications from lowest to highest are green belt, black belt and master black belt. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had more than 15,000 employees with Six Sigma green belt training, over 600 employees with Six Sigma black belt training, and more than 42,000 Lean-trained employees. This large number of employees with Lean Six Sigma training helps infuse our organization with a disciplined, analytical approach to everything we do. 

Recruiting 

We face meaningful competition for skilled employees in every jurisdiction in which we operate. We have refined our talent acquisition strategy by organizing our recruiting teams by industry vertical and utilizing an 

&#160; 

internal executive recruiting team, social media platforms, online job portals and professional search firms to recruit globally. Our internal employee referral program has also become a key recruiting vehicle for us. We believe that our focus on our employees&#146; career development makes us attractive to candidates beyond our delivery center locations. As part of our global diversity and inclusion efforts, we have launched Career 2.0, a program to attract top female leaders who have just returned from the workforce after an extended break. 

Training and Development 

We believe in extensive and continuous training of our employees. We have the infrastructure to train approximately 5,200 people at any one time with 234 trainers. In 2015, we had more than 16,000 employees enrolled in part-time professional degree, e-learning and other non-degree programs provided internally or by universities and other third parties. Our training programs are designed to transfer the industry-specific knowledge and experience of our industry leaders to our employees to ensure we maintain our deep process and domain expertise across the industries and processes in which we work. Our training programs cover a large number of topics, including specific service offerings, key technical and IT skills, our different clients&#146; workplace cultures and Lean and Six Sigma methodologies. A large part of our continuous training is designed to impart the skills and knowledge required by our employees to move to positions of increasing responsibility within Genpact. 

Retention 

In order to meet our growth and service commitments, we are constantly striving to attract and retain employees. There is significant turnover of employees in the business process management and information technology sectors generally, particularly in India where the majority of our employees are currently based. Our attrition rate for all employees who have been employed by us for one day or more was 27% in 2015. We believe this rate is relatively low for our industry based on statistics published by industry associations such as NASSCOM. We attribute this low attrition rate to a number of factors, including our effective recruiting measures, extensive training and a strong culture of providing opportunities for growth and learning. Approximately 13% of our employees were promoted in 2015, and we filled a majority of new positions internally. 

We also take aggressive action to monitor and minimize potential attrition. Using Six Sigma principles we have developed an early warning system that tracks employees and gives us an insight into which employees are most likely to resign. These employees are automatically highlighted to management who can take action such as relocating the employee or enrolling the employee in continuing education programs to increase the likelihood of retention. 

As another measure designed to minimize attrition, we &#147;right-skill&#148; our employees to the tasks assigned to them. This means that we match the level of services required to the experience and qualification of the employee concerned and we avoid having over-qualified people in any particular job. This allows us to give our highly qualified and experienced people higher-value jobs and, coupled with the practice of up-skilling, ensures better career paths for all of our employees. 

Corporate Social Responsibility 

Genpact&#146;s approach to Corporate Social Responsibility focuses on three pillars that reflect our strengths and core expertise as well as causes that our employees are passionate about: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Education and employability 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Environment and sustainability 

&#160; &#149; &#160; Inclusion and community outreach 

&#160; 

We have institutionalized a culture of giving and volunteering through a number of global platforms, programs, projects and social initiatives. Our more than 14,000 employee volunteers have, among other things, helped underprivileged children and women to develop vocational skills, worked on environmental initiatives such as rejuvenating urban forest land and participating in cleaning drives, and participated in programs that address the health and nutritional needs of the poor. Additionally, more than 15,000 of our employees have participated in our payroll-based charitable donation programs. 

Our Alliances 

We have entered into and continue to pursue partnerships or alliances with companies whose capabilities complement ours in an effort to enhance our existing solutions or create new solutions to address market needs. Such alliances may be transaction or deal-specific, may be for the development of joint capabilities in a service line or may take the form of enterprise-wide transformational partnerships. For example, we have a joint venture with Markit Limited, KYC.com, to create a streamlined service to manage &#147;Know-Your-Customer&#148; information for clients in our capital markets vertical. 

We recently launched an incubation program designed to enrich our Lean Digital SM solutions by nurturing partnerships with established and emerging players and start-ups that specialize in leading-edge disruptive digital technologies. Our goal is to quickly transform business processes and operations to create a step change in companies&#146; competitiveness. A key ingredient in this ecosystem is our extensive work with our many clients across industries. Our innovation center will combine our partners&#146; solutions with our expertise and hands-on practical experience. 

Sales and Marketing 

We market our services to both existing and potential clients through our business development team. Members of this team are based around the globe, including in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia, and dedicate their time to expanding the services we provide to our existing clients as well as acquiring new clients. 

We have designated client partners or global relationship managers for each of our strategic relationships. The relationship manager is supported by process improvement, quality, transition, finance, human resources, information technology and industry/product subject matter expert teams to ensure the best possible solution is provided to our clients. We constantly measure our client satisfaction levels to ensure that we maintain high service levels for each client, using measures such as the Net Promoter Score. Our sales force is primarily organized by industry vertical teams that are supported by horizontal service offerings. 

The length of our selling cycle varies depending on the type of engagement. The sales cycle for project work is much shorter than the sales cycle for a large business process engagement. Our efforts may begin in response to our lead generation program, a perceived opportunity, a reference by an existing client, a request for proposal or otherwise. In addition to our business development personnel, the sales effort involves people from the relevant service areas, people familiar with that prospective client&#146;s industry, business leaders and Six Sigma resources. We may expend substantial time and resources in securing new business. See Item 7&#151;&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Overview&#151;Revenues.&#148; 

As our relationship with a client grows, the time required to win an engagement for additional services often gradually declines. In addition, as we become more knowledgeable about a client&#146;s business and processes, our ability to identify opportunities to create value for the client typically increases. For example, productivity benefits and greater business impact can often be achieved by applying our SEP SM methodology, by focusing on processes that are &#147;upstream&#148; or &#147;downstream&#148; from the processes we initially handle, or by applying our analytical and IT capabilities to re-engineer processes. In addition, clients often become more willing over time to turn over more complex and critical processes to us as we demonstrate our capabilities. 

&#160; 

We also strive to foster relationships between our senior leadership team and our clients&#146; senior management. These &#147;C-level&#148; relationships ensure that both parties are focused on establishing priorities, aligning objectives and driving client value from the top down. High-level executive relationships have been particularly constructive as a means of increasing business from our existing clients. It also provides us with a forum for addressing client concerns. Our governance methodology is designed to ensure that we are well connected at all levels of our clients&#146; organizations (executive, management and operations). 

Significant new business opportunities are reviewed by business and sales leaders from the applicable industry vertical, operations personnel, and members of our finance department. If they determine that the new business is aligned with our strategic objectives and a good use of our resources, then our business development team is authorized to pursue the opportunity. 

Global Delivery Platform 

A key differentiator for us is our global network of 72 delivery centers in 17 countries. We also have a number of employees who work directly in client locations or provide services from a virtual environment which offers flexibility for both clients and employees. Our presence in locations around the world provides us with multi-lingual capabilities, access to a larger talent pool, &#147;near-shoring&#148; capabilities to take advantage of time zones, as well as the ability to provide services from the United States. With this network, we manage complex processes in multiple geographic regions. We use different locations for different types of services depending on the specific client needs and the mix of skills and cost of employees available in each location. We choose the location of our delivery centers based on a number of factors, which include the available talent pool, infrastructure, government support and operating costs, as well as client demand. 

We have been a pioneer in our industry in opening centers in several cities in India as well as in some of the other countries in which we operate. We were one of the first companies in our industry to establish operating centers in certain locations, including Dalian, Foshan and Huaqiao in China; Bucharest, Romania; and Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Jaipur and Kolkata in India. We constantly evaluate new locations, including new countries and new cities within countries in which we currently operate, as potential sites for delivery centers and offices. Our delivery centers are located in Brazil, China, the Czech Republic, Guatemala, India, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we provided services in more than 30 languages. 

The large number of different countries from which we serve our clients differentiates us from a number of our competitors and enables us to take advantage of different languages and time zones which, in turn, enhances our ability to serve our clients. 

Intellectual Property 

Increasingly, the solutions we offer our clients include a range of proprietary methodologies, software, and reusable knowledge capital. We also develop intellectual property in the course of our business and our agreements with our clients regulate the ownership of such intellectual property. We regularly apply for patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and domain names to protect our intellectual property. Some of our intellectual property rights are trade secrets and relate to proprietary business process enhancements. 

At times, we use third-party software platforms and the software systems of our clients to provide our services. Our agreements with our clients normally include a license to use the client&#146;s proprietary systems to provide our services. Clients authorize us to access and use third party software licenses held by the client so that we may provide our services. 

&#160; 

It is our practice to enter into agreements with our employees and independent contractors that: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; ensure that all new intellectual property developed by our employees or independent contractors in the course of their employment or engagement is assigned to us; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; provide for employees&#146; and independent contractors&#146; cooperation in intellectual property protection matters even if they no longer work for us; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; include a confidentiality undertaking by our employees and independent contractors. 

Competition 

We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving global market. We have a number of competitors offering services that are the same as or similar to ours. Our competitors include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; large multinational service providers, such as Accenture plc, Capgemini S.A. and International Business Machines Corporation, and large multinational accounting firms, such as Deloitte Consulting LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; companies that are primarily business process service providers operating from low-cost countries, most commonly India, such as ExlService Holdings, Inc. and WNS Holdings Limited; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; companies that are primarily information technology service providers with some business process service capabilities, such as Cognizant Technology Solutions, Infosys Technologies Limited, Tata Consultancy Services Limited and Wipro Limited; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; smaller, niche service providers that provide services in a specific geographic market, industry or service area; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; in-house departments of companies that use their own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide. 

Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry include: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; skills and capabilities; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; technical and industry expertise; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; innovative service and product offerings; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; ability to add value, including through continuous process improvement; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; reputation and client references; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; contractual terms, including competitive pricing; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; scope of services; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; quality of services and solutions; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; ability to sustain long-term client relationships; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; global reach and scale. 

Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis. 

&#160; 

Regulation 

We are subject to regulation in many jurisdictions around the world as a result of the complexity of our operations and services, including at the federal, state and local level, particularly in the countries where we have operations and where we deliver services. We are also subject to regulation by regional bodies such as the European Union, or EU. 

In addition, the terms of our service contracts typically require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. In some contracts, we are contractually required to comply even if such laws and regulations apply to our clients, but not to us. In some of our service contracts, our clients require us to take specific steps intended to make it easier for our clients to comply with requirements that are applicable to them. In some of our other service contracts, our clients undertake the responsibility to inform us about laws and regulations that may apply to us in jurisdictions in which they are located. 

If we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we may be restricted in our ability to provide services, and may also be the subject of civil or criminal actions involving penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our clients generally have the right to terminate our contracts for cause in the event of regulatory failures, subject to notice periods. See Item 1A&#151;&#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to our Business&#151;Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violations of these laws and regulations could harm our business.&#148; If we fail to comply with contractual commitments to facilitate our clients&#146; compliance, we may be liable for contractual damages, and clients in regulated industries may be less willing to use our services. 

In the United States, we are either directly subject to, or contractually required to comply or facilitate our clients&#146; compliance with, laws and regulations arising out of our work for clients operating there, especially in the area of banking, financial services and insurance, such as the Financial Modernization Act (sometimes referred to as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Service Company Act, the Home Owners Loan Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Troubled Assets Relief Program, as well as regulation by U.S. agencies such as the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We are also subject to regulation under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the Communications Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and applicable regulations in the area of health and other personal information that we process as part of our services. 

Because of our debt collections work in the United States, we are also regulated by laws such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and related regulations. We are currently licensed to engage in debt collection activities in all jurisdictions in the United States where licensing is required. 

Because of our mortgage origination activities in the United States, in addition to the applicable regulations listed above, we are subject to laws such as the S.A.F.E. Mortgage Licensing Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Homeowners Protection Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and by regulatory bodies such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. We currently hold mortgage related licenses in 48 states and the District of Columbia and are regulated by each applicable state regulatory agency. 

Because of our insurance processing activities, we are currently licensed as a third party administrator in 41 states and are regulated by the department of insurance in each such state. In two other states, we qualify for regulatory exemption from licensing based on the insurance processing activities we provide. 

&#160; 

We are affected by laws in the United States, the United Kingdom and the EU that are intended to limit the impact of outsourcing on employees in those countries. See Item 1A&#151;&#147;Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to our Business&#151;Future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could significantly affect the ability or willingness of our clients and prospective clients to utilize our services.&#148; 

We are also subject to laws and regulations on direct marketing, such as the Telemarketing Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and rules promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, and the CAN-SPAM Act. 

We are subject to laws and regulations governing foreign trade, such as the Arms Export Control Act, as well as by government bodies such as the Commerce Department&#146;s Bureau of Industry and Security, the State Department&#146;s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Treasury Department&#146;s Office of Foreign Assets Control. 

Several of our service delivery centers, primarily located in India, China, the Philippines and Guatemala, benefit from tax incentives or concessional rates provided by local laws and regulations. The Indian Special Economic Zones Act of 2005, or SEZ legislation, introduced a tax holiday in certain situations for operations established in designated &#147;special economic zones,&#148; or SEZs. The SEZ tax benefits are available only for new business operations that are conducted at qualifying SEZ locations. We cannot predict what percentage of our operations or income in India or other jurisdictions in future years will be eligible for a tax holiday. See Item 7&#151;&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Overview&#151;Income Taxes.&#148; In addition to the tax holidays described above, certain benefits are also available to us under certain Indian state laws. These benefits include rebates and waivers in relation to payments for the transfer or registration of property (including for the purchase or lease of premises), waivers of conversion fees for land, exemption from state pollution control requirements, entry tax exemptions, labor law exemptions and commercial usage of electricity. 

Our hedging activities and currency transfer are restricted by regulations in certain countries, including India, Romania and China. 

Certain Bermuda Law Considerations 

As a Bermuda company, we are also subject to regulation in Bermuda. Among other things, we must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 1981 regulating the declaration and payment of dividends and the making of distributions from contributed surplus. 

We are classified as a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Pursuant to our non-resident status, we may engage in transactions in currencies other than Bermuda dollars. There are no restrictions on our ability to transfer funds in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to United States residents that are holders of our common shares. 

Under Bermuda law, &#147;exempted&#148; companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda from a principal place of business in Bermuda. As an exempted company, we may not, without a license granted by the Minister of Economic Development, participate in certain business transactions, including transactions involving Bermuda landholding rights and the carrying on of business of any kind, for which we are not licensed in Bermuda.
