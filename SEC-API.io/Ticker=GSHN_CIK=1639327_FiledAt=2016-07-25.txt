 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160; 

Gushen, Inc., a Nevada corporation (&#8220;the Company&#8221;) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 9, 2015. 

Gushen, Inc. is a holding Company operating through its wholly owned subsidiary, Gushen Holding Limited. 

&#160; 

Gushen Holding Limited was incorporated in Seychelles, however at this time any and all physical operations take place in Hong Kong. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s executive offices are located at Room 1701-1703, 17/F, The Metropolis Tower, 10 Metropolis Drive, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

&#160; 

Gushen is a developmental stage company that intends to provide managerial and IT support to start-ups as well as SME (small and medium enterprises) to assist them in their early stages of operations as they expand and grow their own company. The Company attempts to assist the SMEs which are recently established and at an early stage of operations, but will not participate in board of the SMEs or making business decision. 

&#160; 

Gushen will attempt to assist companies that are just getting off the ground and that are at an early stage of operations, but will not rule out business that are a little further along. The primary purpose behind focusing on companies at this early stage of development will be for Gushen to establish and nurture long-term lasting relationships with our clients as they grow and develop. Gushen will initially target companies located in Hong Kong. 

&#160; 

For business activities, the Company offers the following IT and managerial services to clients: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Information systems planning and design &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Computer hardware and software evaluation &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Selection and implementation of various technologies &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Internet and web site strategy &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Alternative to hiring full-time IT professionals &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Guidance and counsel related to management and business operations &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Assistance related to effective cost control &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Handling of minor business dilemmas &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Provision of education and training to clients&#8217; staff &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Advisory to clients&#8217; existing human resources department &#160; 

Business plan 

&#160; 

One of the largest hurdles for a new company to overcome on their path to profitability is inexperienced management. Many business owners have excellent ideas and a certain area of expertise, but that does not mean that they have the business experience to properly operate and head towards long term success without assistance. Gushen intends to provide that assistance in terms of the human capital necessary to cultivate the business and operations of clients so that they may reach a higher level of success and profitability. 

&#160; 

Gushen intends to provide business and technology services and solutions to capital and commodity market participants, intermediaries and regulators. Our offerings will help our clients to grow and enhance their organizations, create robust and transparent infrastructures, manage operating costs, and foster innovation. 

&#160; 

In order to achieve these goals Gushen intends to hire select candidates from a pool of highly qualified individuals with the experience and competency needed to succeed in a constantly changing business environment. In particular, the company will focus upon individuals who are bilingual in order to allow us to conduct operations both domestically and internationally. We believe that focusing upon a single nation is a mistake as business continue their push towards globalization. Gushen, Inc. intends to retain relevance by offering services to businesses of as many foreign countries as possible. In the interest of attracting and maintaining this diverse personnel Gushen intends to use job seeker websites and various other internet job search engines to fill the vacant positions within the company. 

&#160;

&#160; 

IT support services 

&#160; 

&#8220;A lower-level, in-house IT salary ranges from $50,000 to $80,000 with salaries considerably higher for specialized techs,&#8221; said Jason Kelly, director of customer success at security firm KnowBe4. &#8220;The break point for a company to hire an in-house IT person usually kicks in between 25 and 50 staff.&#8221;

&#160; 

We believe one of our most important services will be our small business IT support program. While it would be ideal to have IT professionals in-house to help with day-to-day computer support issues, it would also be prohibitively costly for many smaller companies. Gushen, Inc. offers an affordable alternative to hiring full-time IT professionals. Whether you need an IT support tech to diagnose a problem, or want expert IT management to develop a technology path forward for the company, Gushen intends to hire highly skilled information technology professionals who can serve as your business&#8217; IT team without the prohibitive costs associated with a full-time employee. We plan to provide top-tier, certified small business tech support without the high costs and hassle of managing things in-house. Our IT consulting services may include, but will not be limited to, information systems planning and design, computer hardware and software evaluation, selection and implementation of various technologies, and internet and web site strategy. 

&#160; 

Managerial support 

&#160; 

Our primary area of assistance will almost invariably be providing managerial assistance to our clients. There will likely be other areas of assistance included in every agreement but this is the one area around which all of our other services will revolve. Managerial assistance in these instances means, among other things, that through our directors, officers and employees we will provide significant guidance and counsel regarding the management, operations, business objectives, and policies of our client companies. That can include the preparation and implementation of business and marketing plans if desired. We will also place a heavy emphasis upon the operations process and workflow analysis. Oftentimes with a bit of direction from an experienced source a new company will skip the awkward learning stage commonly associated with an owner new to the business environment figuring out how to conduct operations. With Gushen, Inc. such worries will be alleviated by our planned skillful and professional team of individuals who can provide assistance to companies in virtually every field of business. 

&#160; 

Gushen intends to assist any future clients through various methods beyond just capital support, although that may be included. The Company believes that through offering exemplary service and professional assistance that we will be able to reduce the costs incurred by our clients and accelerate their progress towards bringing their business to the public marketplace. This will be done primarily through managerial assistance, marketing resources, and technological collaboration. In addition, Gushen intends to teach clients how to explore cost effective manners of achieving their goals and thereby increase profitability and save capital that could best be used to suit their other business purposes. 

&#160; 

Many smaller companies face the largely unanticipated hurdle of dealing with minor business dilemmas not associated with their core business operations. This can include providing services like receipt of letters and envelops, mailing, scheduling, accounting and payroll, preparation of minutes or resolutions, etc. Of course it is not limited to these examples, but overall the minor everyday details that can go into operating a small business are often completely unanticipated and business owners are not prepared to deal with them. Gushen, Inc. intends to provide the support for these clients and assist them in these everyday processes, or if desirable may even opt to handle these minor details for our clients. 

&#160; 

Sometimes just educating a managerial staff is not adequate to meet the high level of requirements many businesses in particularly competitive environments demand. In these cases, and upon request by other smaller business entities, we will assist with the education and training of various members of our clients&#8217; staff so that they may achieve the level of competence required to perform their tasks optimally. This will most likely be accomplished through connecting the employee with a third party educational institution, assisting with the selection of coursework and tailoring the program to the needs of the individual and company as a whole. 

&#160; 

For our more mid-sized clients we anticipate it will be necessary to shift our focus from broad managerial training to more specialized services. To this end we will have a unique offering in place to advise, and improve upon, the company&#8217;s existing human resources department. Unfortunately, so many companies fail because of lawsuits, human rights violations, harassment of various nature, and any number of offenses that could be prevented by a well informed and prepared human resources department. Through providing the tools necessary for human resources to educate their employees, and the knowledge base our future staff will provide to help human resource departments handle emerging problems in the most effective and expedient manner for their parent company we hope to minimize work related incidents and help our clients focus upon what should be most important: their business. 

&#160; 

In some cases, all that&#8217;s stopping a company from achieving the next level of profitability is the simple fact that they are struggling to raise the funds needed to progress their business. We know it can be intimidating to use a crowd funding source where shares of a company are sold to investors, but here at Gushen we aim to educate our clients and help them see why this may be the ideal solution to address all of their capital requirements. Our director&#8217;s know how to get a business on a crowd funding intermediary, how to ensure that management retains control of the company no matter how much common stock is sold, and how to maximize the profits of any equity offering. Our staff will be able to simplify the process significantly, and help any company make a strong attempt at meeting their capital requirements. At present, however, we do not have a formalized process through which we will take our clients on a crowdfunding platform and our assistance will be limited to an advisory capacity. 

&#160; 

It should be noted we are not engaging in any crowdfunding business and will not be profiting off of any monies raised through our future clients&#8217; potential crowdfunding campaigns. We may, however, in an advisor capacity, assist future clients with listing their Companies on such platforms in order to raise funds. The knowledge our current officers and directors have of crowdfunding is very limited and limited only to the research that they have conducted through online search engines as to how crowdfunding works on varying platforms. Our involvement as advisors to our future clients relating to crowdfunding is aspirational in nature. 

&#160; 

In short, Gushen is essentially going to be a one stop shop for all the needs of a growing or emerging business. We intend to assist by providing managerial training, IT support, education and training of staff, and so much more. In the ever evolving global marketplace it&#8217;s important to take any advantage you can to get your company&#8217;s name out there. While many competitors are struggling to find their footing and develop their path to success, here at Gushen we&#8217;ve done all the heavy lifting already and can give any existing business a leg up above the competition with the assistance of our skilled, highly educated, and professional staff of business experts.

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

In order to be successful and acquire clients Gushen intends to use various online marketing platforms to spread awareness of our services and find interested customers. In addition, we may use more traditional methods by placing advertisements in print and paper magazines and newspapers. Once a sizeable client base has been acquired it is important that every single one feel that they are a priority to our company and to that end we intend to increase our staff as our workload increases in order to ensure that every customer is receiving exemplary service and sufficient attention for their varying needs. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The industry in which Gushen competes is highly competitive. Many Companies offer similar services to assist with management and IT support. We may be at a substantial disadvantage to our competitors who have more capital than we do to carry out operations and marketing efforts. We hope to maintain our competitive advantage by utilizing the experience, knowledge, and expertise of our current staff as well as offering exemplary our customer service. 

&#160;

Customers 

&#160; 

For the year ended April 30, 2016, the Company has generated $3,800 revenue from one client under the ordinary course of business of Gushen. The revenue mainly represented the provision of IT consulting and support service based upon the customer&#8217;s specifications. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of April 30, 2016 we have two employees, one of which is our President, CEO, CFO and Director while the other is our second Director. 

&#160; 

Currently, our Officers and Directors each have the flexibility to work on our business up to 25 to 30 hours per week, but are prepared to devote more time if necessary. 

&#160; 

We do not presently have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing, or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt plans in the future. There are presently no personal benefits available to our officers/ or director. 

&#160; 

During the initial implementation of our business plan, we intend to hire independent consultants to assist in the development and execution of our business operations. 

&#160; 

Government regulation 

&#160; 

We are subject to the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which may include business licensing requirements, income taxes and payroll taxes. In general, the development and operation of our business is not subject to special regulatory and/or supervisory requirements.
