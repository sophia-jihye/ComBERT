Company Overview 

&#160;

Banjo &#38; Matilda was founded by Australian born Creative Director Belinda Storelli Macpherson in 2009, after an extensive career in publicity, fashion publishing and marketing. Prior company's where Belinda worked include Grazia, Harpers Bazaar and Maddison fashion magazines, major film studios including Warner Brothers, Universal Studios and Columbia Tri-Star Pictures; and, the Australian tourism industry marketing body Tourism Australia. Belinda also founded her own publicity firm "Global Artist" which she successfully sold to a larger group in 2002. 

&#160;

Belinda identified the emerging casualization of the luxury fashion market and combined her passion for cashmere, the Australian beach lifestyle and frustration over the lack of accessible quality cashmere to create a new, more relevant luxury brand. One that was born on line as a direct to consumer e-commerce model thereby eliminating the unnecessary margin's that department and specialty stores take, enabling the brand to focus on a luxury quality product, but without inflated luxury prices. 

&#160;

General Market issues; Market opportunity 

&#160;

The traditional apparel market sales model is experiencing significant changes due to the challenges physical store retailers are experiencing. This is negatively impacting fashion businesses which rely primarily on the traditional wholesale to retail sales due to lower sales, higher returns and discounts caused by struggling physical retailers. E-commerce spending in the apparel and luxury sectors has reached a critical mass which enables brands like Banjo &#38; Matilda to build a direct to consumer e-commerce model which cuts out the unnecessary retail mark up to department and specialty stores and build a successful brand/business. 

&#160;

Total global apparel sales reached $1.1T+ in 2014 with personal luxury goods spending accounting for $260B, equal to approximately 25% of apparel sales. Online luxury goods sales are growing 4 times faster than physical store sales, reaching $15B in 2014, and are expected to triple through 2019. 

&#160;

Banjo &#38; Matilda is known for luxury quality casual cashmere knitwear which retails for 1/3 rd of the price of a traditional luxury brand offering similar quality. Streamlining the production process by partnering with cashmere yarn producers in inner Mongolia (where 98% of the worlds cashmere originates), and manufacturing in specialist factories with deep knitting expertise, the company sells directly to customers online, avoiding the typical costs of wholesale/retailer mark-up -- conveniently delivering a luxury quality product at an accessible price point. &#160;

&#160; Our Products 

&#160;

Banjo &#38; Matilda offers a comprehensive line of luxury women's cashmere knitwear including sweaters and pants, and accessories such as cashmere scarves, slippers, eye-masks and travel blankets. Banjo &#38; Matilda also collaborates with high profile artists or celebrities to create exclusive limited edition pieces. In 2013, we collaborated with singer Bryan Adams and prior collaborations include prominent businesswoman, television host, model and actress Elle Macpherson, British artist Tracey Emin and Australian singer/songwriter, model and actress Natalie Imbrugila and most recently Gwyneth Paltrow's successful lifestyle blog GOOP. The company is planning to expand its product lines to include broader lifestyle offering of apparel items, home products, menswear, children's apparel, and gifts. 

&#160;

Product Manufacturing 

&#160;

Banjo &#38; Matilda use third party contract manufacturers rather than operating manufacturing facilities itself. All yarns and fabrics are sourced from reputable suppliers. Materials used are typically the highest grade that can be sourced. Banjo &#38; Matilda works with a number of manufacturers; during fiscal 2015; no single manufacturer produced more than 35% of our products. Our manufacturers provide us with the speed to market necessary to respond quickly to changing trends and increased demand. We have developed a solid relationship with our manufacturers and take great care to ensure that they share Banjo &#38; Matilda's commitment to quality and ethics. We do not, however, have any long-term agreements requiring us to use any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products in the long-term. We regularly secure and test new manufacturing partners and believe that the services of additional, or other, manufacturers and/or suppliers of our fabrics can continue to be obtained with little or no additional expense to us and/or delay in the timeliness of our production process. 

&#160;

Product Distribution 

&#160;

We commenced our business as an e-commerce only direct to consumer model. In fiscal 2013 year we embarked on a strategic wholesale program to assist driving brand awareness and revenue growth in the Northern Hemisphere markets. Through the 2015 period in conjunction with our relocation to the US we scaled the wholesale business and operations reaching 200+ retail outlets, stocked in major department stores and key independent boutiques. As a result of this scaling, lower gross margins from wholesale sales, and general market conditions we withdrew from the wholesale distribution channel in January 2016 to focus on our core e-commerce model and strategy. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

There is meaningful competition in the luxury apparel industry with emphasis on the brand image and recognition as well as product quality, style, and distribution. Banjo &#38; Matilda successfully competes thanks to a premium and unique brand, unique designs, and attainable price points previously not available in the luxury product sector. This enables the brand to acquire and keep customers which would not typically purchase traditional luxury products due to the much higher price points. There are limited entrants into the market with similar cashmere focused e-commerce offerings which directly compete in terms of product quality and price point. 

&#160;

Banjo &#38; Matilda has registered trademarks in Australia and the USA.
