 Item 1. Business. 

General 

We were incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada in 1984. In 2004, we changed our corporate jurisdiction from a British Columbia company to a Canadian corporation. In December 2011, we amended our articles to change our name from &#8220;i-minerals inc.&#8221; to &#8220;I-Minerals Inc.&#8221;

The company engaged in the development of our Helmer-Bovill industrial minerals property (the &#8220;Helmer-Bovill Property&#8221;). The Helmer-Bovill Property, in which we hold a 100% interest, is comprised of 11 mineral leases totaling 5,140.64 acres located approximately 6 miles southwest of Bovill, Latah County, Idaho.

We acquired the Helmer-Bovill Property from Idaho Industrial Minerals (&#8220;IIM&#8221;) pursuant to an Assignment Agreement with Contingent Right of Reverter (the &#8220;IIM Agreement&#8221;) dated August 12, 2002, as amended August 10, 2005, August 10, 2008 and January 21, 2010, between I-Minerals USA (formerly Alchemy Kaolin Corporation), our wholly owned subsidiary, and IIM. Under the terms of the IIM Agreement, we issued a total of 1,800,000 common shares to IIM. 

Our principal executive office is located at Suite 880, 580 Hornby Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and our telephone number is (877) 303-6573.

To date, we have not earned significant revenues from the operation of our mineral properties. Accordingly, we are dependent on debt and equity financing as its primary source of operating working capital. Our capital resources are largely determined by the strength of the junior resource markets and by the status of our projects in relation to these markets, and its ability to compete for investor support of its projects.

Our Principal Projects 

Our activities at the Helmer-Bovill Property are focused on developing the Bovill Kaolin Project and the WBL Tailings Project.

The Bovill Kaolin Project 

Our lead project, the Bovill Kaolin Project, is a strategically located long term resource of high purity quartz, potassium feldspar (&#8220;K-spar&#8221;), halloysite and kaolinite formed through weathering of a border phase of the Idaho Batholith causing all minerals to be contained within a fine white clay-sand mixture referred to as &#8220;primary clay.&#8221; The Bovill Kaolin Project is located within 3 miles of state highways with electricity and natural gas already at the property boundary.

Since 2010, our exploration work has focused diamond drilling on the Bovill Kaolin Project. To date, a total of 258 diamond drill holes have been drilled totaling 28,251 feet. As a result of these drill campaigns, four deposits have been identified: Kelly&#8217;s Hump, Kelly&#8217;s Hump South, Middle Ridge and WBL.

In June 2014, we completed an updated pre-feasibility study on the Bovill Kaolin Project (the &#8220;2014 PFS&#8221;) and on March 8, 2016, we announced the economic results of our full feasibility study (the &#8220;2016 FS&#8221;), which included the following highlights:

Updated Measured and Indicated Resource Estimate Measured Resources of 5.7 million tons containing 76.5% quartz/K-spar sand, 12.3% Kaolinite and 4.0% Halloysite. Indicated Resources of 15.5 million tons containing 57.0% quartz/K-spar sand, 15.5% Kaolinite and 2.8% Halloysite. 667,000 tons of contained halloysite, 3,119,000 tons of contained kaolinite and 13,235,000 tons of contained quartz/K-spar.

The full National Instrument (&#8220;NI&#8221;) 43-101 report was filed on www.sedar.com on April 20, 2016 and is available on the Company&#8217;s website. Going forward our focus is to complete the detailed engineering and commence efforts to raise the capital necessary to build the mine.

See &#8220;Properties &#8211; Helmer-Bovill Property &#8211; 2016 Feasibility Study&#8221;.

The WBL Tailings Project 

We also plan to continue limited seasonal mining operations at the WBL Tailings Project. The WBL Tailings Project is feldspathic sands deposited as tailings from clay mining operations during the period from 1961 to 1974. In September 2012, we received approval of our Mine Plan of Operations (&#8220;MPO&#8221;) from the Idaho Department of Lands. The MPO allows us to mine up to 50,000 tons per annum of feldspathic sands from June to October for a period of 10 years. From 2013 through 2015 approximately 5,000 tons of tailings was extracted and sold to a local cement company and a local contractor. 

Three Year History 

During the last three fiscal years, our operations have focused on completing an extensive diamond drill program on the Bovill Kaolin Project, acquiring a 100% interest in the Helmer-Bovill Property, completion of the 2016 FS and initial submittal of the mine permit application to the State of Idaho. 

Drill Programs at Bovill Kaolin Project 

We have completed two extensive diamond drill programs on the Helmer-Bovill Property for the Bovill Kaolin Project totaling over 25,000 feet, most recently in 2013 where 167 diamond drill holes totaling 17,811 feet were completed at the Middle Ridge, Kelly Hump and Kelly South deposits. These programs allowed us to better define our four key deposits at the Bovill Kaolin Project and complete both our 2014 PFS and 2016 FS. See &#8220;Properties &#8211; Helmer-Bovill Property&#8221;.

WBL Tailings Project 

In September 2012, we received approval of our MPO from the Idaho Department of Lands. The MPO allows us to mine up to 50,000 tons per annum from feldspathic sands from June to October for a period of 10 years. Shortly thereafter, we completed our first production and inaugural sales feldspathic sand from the WBL Tailings Project. 

In November 2013, we entered into an agreement with Pre-Mix, Inc. of Pullman Washington (&#8220;Pre-Mix&#8221;) pursuant to which we sold 3,000 tons of sand tailings to Pre-Mix. 

&#160; On April 28, 2014, we entered into a new contract with Pre-Mix for the sale of up to 30,000 tons per annum of screened K-spar / quartz sand. Under the terms of the contract, Pre-Mix is solely responsible for the operating costs to process and remove the K-spar / quartz sand. The term of the contract is until December 31, 2018 and may be extended for a further two years through the mutual consent of the parties. 

During 2014 and 2015 approximately 5,000 tons of sand tailings from our WBL Tailings Project were sold generating limited revenues to date due to associated road improvement costs. It is important to note that the State of Idaho permits that allow us to produce the feldspathic sands from the WBL Tailings Project are essentially the same permits as we have applied for to bring the much larger Bovill Kaolin Deposit into production.

Acquisition of Helmer-Bovill Property 

In January 2013, we acquired a 100% interest in our Helmer-Bovill Property. In order to acquire the Helmer-Bovill Property, we issued a total of 1,800,000 common shares, of which 1,300,000 common shares were issued as the final payment to IIM.

On December 2, 2015, we settled all lawsuits relating to the Helmer-Bovill Property pursuant to the terms of Global Settlement and Absolute Release Agreement (the &#8220;Settlement Agreement&#8221;) dated October 29, 2015 among us, Idaho Industrial Minerals, LLC (&#8220;IIM&#8221;), Hoodoo Resources, LLC (&#8220;Hoodoo&#8221;), the principal of Hoodoo, Robert Lemke (&#8220;Lemke&#8221;), Brent Thomson (&#8220;Thomson&#8221;), The Thomson Family Trust (the &#8220;Thomson Trust&#8221;) (IIM, Hoodoo, Lemke, Thomson and the Thomson Trust collectively referred to as the &#8220;Plaintiffs&#8221;), the Estate of Philip Nisbet (the &#8220;Nisbet Estate&#8221;), Allen Ball (&#8220;Ball&#8221;), the Allen Ball and Connie Ball Family Trust (the &#8220;Ball Trust&#8221;), Ball Ventures, LLC (&#8220;BV&#8221;) and BVNR Natural Resources LLC (&#8220;BVNR&#8221;) (Ball, the Ball Trust, BV and BVNR collectively referred to as the &#8220;Ball Entities&#8221;) and Northwest Kaolin, Inc. (&#8220;NWK&#8221;). Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we paid IIM the aggregate sum of $100,000 (the &#8220;I-Minerals Payment&#8221;) for the release of any and all claims made against us under the lawsuits by the Ball Entities and the Plaintiffs. In addition, IIM and NWK have expressly acknowledged and agreed that, upon receipt of the I-Minerals Payment, we have fulfilled all of our duties and obligations under the terms of the IIM Agreement relating to our Helmer-Bovill Property, and that any and all rights and claims of IIM and NWK to the mineral leases making up the Helmer-Bovill Property will be released and extinguished. See &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; below.

Industrial Minerals 

In carrying out our activities at the Bovill Kaolin Project, we are focused on the development and, based upon the positive results of the 2016 FS, raising sufficient capital to build the mine and commence the extraction of the industrial minerals set forth below.

Kaolin 

Kaolin is a raw material used in the ceramic industry, especially in fine porcelains. Large quantities of kaolin are used in paper coating, filler, paint, plastics, fiberglass, catalysts, and other specialty applications. It is also used as a key ingredient in natural pesticides that are suitable for organic farming applications.

When kaolin is heated to about 850&#176;, it is transformed into a dehydrated phase called "metakaolin." Metakaolin is considered a premium material as it adds strength and durability to cement based products. When metakaolin is added to cement-based mortars, it causes an aggressive reaction with calcium hydroxide (lime), turning the lime into a cementitious material yielding cement with enhanced performance characteristics including increased strength; reduced permeability; greater durability; effective control of efflorescence; and control of degradation caused by Alkali-Silica Reaction. A bridge deck in a northern climate where it is subject to the wear and tear associated with plowing and salting is a prime metakaolin application. We are continuing long term testing process of several metakaolin products produced from the Bovill Kaolin deposits and have received ASTM C-618 certification for two of our products indicating the Bovill Metakaolin is an accredited pozzolan that meets all strength and water consumption requirements. ASTM C-618 certification is a prerequisite for sales into the cement industry. Additional testing is focused on optimizing the fineness of the grind or particle size to create the metakaolin product that provides the greatest strength while meeting the water requirement criteria.

Our target market for metakaolin is the North American concrete and infrastructure industry. Premium white metakaolin is currently priced at $500 per ton in the Pacific Northwest due to the transportation costs to bring it from the southeastern USA. We are targeting applications where color is not as important and pricing used in the 2016 FS is $231 per ton. The 2016 FS forecasts average annual production of about 40,000 tons of Bovill Metakaolin and the Company has non-binding letters of interest from various cement and construction companies for tonnage well in excess of this amount.

&#160; Halloysite 

We plan to sell Halloysite on a worldwide basis. Halloysite is chemically identical to kaolin. When water is added to the kaolin chemistry its plate like structure takes on a tubular shape, identified as halloysite. Much of the value of halloysite is generated by its tubular shape which can only be seen through very powerful microscopes and are commonly referred to as halloysite nanotubes and abbreviated as HNTs. 

Historically, the primary use of halloysite has been in the manufacture of porcelain, bone china, and fine china where the combination of low iron and titanium content together with the hollow tubular shape of the mineral grains yields ceramic bodies with exceptional whiteness and translucency. However, the HNTs microscopic tubular shape is rapidly finding uses outside of the ceramics industry. Applications in commercial production would include use as a suspension agent in glaze preparations as well as in filters and inkjets, and as an ingredient in special paints applied to ships to prevent barnacles from growing on the ships&#8217; hull. HNTs are also being increasingly used in plastic and polymer applications where the addition of HNTs increases strength while reducing the weight of these compounds. Perhaps the most exciting uses for HNTs are in life science applications where the inside of the hollow tube can be filled with active ingredients and as the clay tube erodes the active ingredients are released. Used in this manner the HNTs are a delivery vector made of natural materials. 

The largest supplier of commercial halloysite product available at present is located in Maturi Bay, New Zealand. There is limited production in Poland, Turkey and China, and a development stage project in Utah with negligible commercial production. The largest halloysite supplier in the ceramics industry sells halloysite at a price from $135 to $3,000 per ton. The majority of imported halloysite in the United States for the ceramics industry is sold at a price of approximately $700 per ton.

Our halloysite is differentiated from those known halloysite deposits due to the high aspect ratio (the ratio of the length of the tube to the diameter of the tube) and by minimal levels of trace elements such as lead. We are not targeting ceramic applications with our halloysite and instead focusing on the life science and plastic and polymer applications. Third party research has indicated we have arguably the best halloysite for life science applications as the New Zealand deposit contains about 10% Cristobalite &#8211; a silica oxide that has been categorized as a carcinogen and the other deposits capable of meaningful commercial production have poorer aspect ratios and higher heavy metal / trace element content.

The Company is planning on producing two halloysite products. The first branded HalloPure will be about 70% halloysite and 30% kaolinite and will target the plastic and polymer and certain filtration applications. The second is branded ULTRA Hallopure and will be in excess of 90% halloysite and less than 10% kaolinite. Both are considered high value products. In the 2016 FS, halloysite production varied from about 10,000 tons to 15,000 tons per year, split equally between the two halloysite products. HalloPure was priced at about $700 per ton and ULTRA Hallopure at about $1,400 per ton. 

To date we have received interest in our HNTs from a number of companies in a wide range of industries including: personal care products, nano-composites, fire retardants, biocides, plastic fillers, animal feed, paint, and ceramics. Most of these companies have received samples of our products produced at recent pilot plants with some companies receiving up to 50 kg for bench scale product testing. We have also provided samples free of charge to several universities to help with the development of other new HNT applications. Currently the Company has non-binding expressions of interest approximately equal to forecast production. 

Quartz 

Quartz (SiO 2 or silicon dioxide) is crystalline silica, the second most common mineral in the crust of the earth. It is known for its hardness and is well known for its use in glass. However, different types of glass require different SiO 2 purity levels with some types of glass requiring the SiO 2 content in quartz to have purity levels in the 97-99% range to be suitable. Although silicon dioxide is abundant, not all deposits are chemically identical, with the SiO 2 purity and the levels of various trace element impurities varying across different deposits. Contamination of quartz can be from mineral and fluid inclusions and non-silica elements entering atomic sites usually occupied by silicon and oxygen. Our quartz operations at the Bovill Kaolin Project will focus on two levels of purity in excess of 99.8% SiO 2 and is prepared to introduce a third product as market conditions warrant. 

The Company has branded the quartz products TrueQ. The least pure product is True Q1 where the &#8220;1&#8221; indicates the material has been processed once through flotation. The high purity product is True Q3 where the &#8220;3&#8221; indicates the material has been floated three times to remove the maximum amount of impurities possible. Bench scale production at the recent pilot plant indicates the True Q1 will grade 99.86% SiO 2 or higher and the True Q3 99.97% SiO 2 or higher. The True Q1 will be offered in three different grinds or particle size: 50 mesh, 200 mesh and 325 mesh. &#8220;Mesh&#8221; references the number of openings in a 1 inch by 1 inch screen. As additional work and expense is required to further grind the basic 50 mesh product into finer grained products (200 or 325 mesh products), the finer grind products sell at higher prices than the basic 50 mesh product. 

&#160; The 2016 FS foresees total quartz production (True Q1 and True Q3) of approximately 108,000 tons per year. The higher value True Q3 markets will be harder to enter due to more stringent testing and competition. Accordingly, the 2016 FS does not foresee reaching full True Q3 production capacity until the third year of production with a significant discount offered to gain business in the first year. Pricing for the True Q1 ranges from $100 to $350 per ton depending on the fineness of grind (particle size) together with the customer&#8217;s volume and delivery method. Once markets for the True Q3 have been established (2 year delay) the 2016 FS contemplates a price of approximately $600 per ton. Currently the Company has non-binding expressions of interest equal to two or three times production capacity from producers of sodium silicate, paint, solar glass, optical glass, art glass, glass bulbs, and liquid crystal display (&#8220;LCD&#8221;) glass in North American and Asia. 

Potassium-Feldspar (&#8220;K-spar&#8221;) 

K-spar is primarily used in ceramic bodies and glazes. We have run several pilot plants to produce K-spar. Grades have varied between 12.2% K 2 O and 13.1% K 2 O with low iron and high alumina. A high quality K-spar product has high K 2 O, high alumina and low iron. Iron tends to cause a darkening of the glaze when the ceramics are heated to high temperatures in a kiln. The quality of the K-spar produced in the pilot plant exceeds virtually all other commercially available K-spar products. The North American market is currently in short supply and the sole producer is offering a product of 9.5% - 10.0% K 2 O and about twice the iron (Fe) content of our K-spar. The shortage is driven by the largest producer in the United States shut down production at its Georgia operations in December 2014 when it ran out of reserves after 57 years of production. This company is attempting to service the North American market with a more expensive European K-spar product. The ceramics industry has extensively tested our K-spar product and it has been favorably written up in trade publications. Interest in the K-spar product that will be marketed under the brand name Fortispar is very strong.

Similar to quartz, we will offer our Fortispar in three grinds or particle sizes; a basic 30 mesh product as well as 200 and 325 mesh fine grind products. Fortispar will be sold primarily into K-spar North American ceramics and glass industries. We also plan to focus on producers of high clarity glass, ceramics, sanitary ware, tableware, and paint. Industrial and marine paint manufacturers also use an ultra-fine grind variety of feldspar. Pricing of our Fortispar product in the 2016 FS ranged from $217 per ton for the basic 30 mesh product up to $400 per ton for small quantiles of the fine ground product. We currently have non-binding expressions of interest in our K-spar product in excess of our production capacity.

Competition 

With the completion of the 2016 FS, upon receipt of our mine permit, we will be a development stage company. We compete with other mineral resource exploration and development companies for financing. Many of the mineral resource exploration and development companies with whom we compete have greater financial and technical resources than we do. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisitions of mineral properties of merit, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater geological expertise in the targeting and exploration of mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance additional exploration and development. This competition could adversely impact our ability to finance further exploration and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop our mineral properties.

Government Regulations 

Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. We will obtain the licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required to conduct our exploration program. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations passed thereunder in Idaho and the United States.

In Idaho, our exploration activities are regulated by the Idaho Department of Lands (&#8220;IDL&#8221;) pursuant to the Idaho Rules Governing Exploration Surface Mining and Closure of Cyanidation Facilities pursuant to the Idaho Administrative Procedure Act. In order to carry out surface exploration and drilling activities, a company is required to file a Notification of Exploration with the IDL. In 2000, we filed our original Notification of Exploration with the IDL, which has been subsequently amended, for our surface exploration and drilling programs on the Helmer-Bovill Property. 

&#160; In order to carry out mining activities, we are required to obtain a Mine Plan for Operations and Reclamation Plan (&#8220;MPO&#8221;). In 2012, we completed a MPO for the extraction of sand tailings on the WBL Tailings Project. The MPO permits us to mine the sand tailings between May to October for a period of 10 years (2012 &#8211; 2022). In May of 2016 we applied for an MPO for mining activities on the Bovill Kaolin Project. The IDL has responded to our initial submission and we are in the final stages of responding to the IDL inquiries. Management believes that receipt of the MPO in the third calendar quarter of 2016 is a reasonable expectation.

All leases are subject to rental fees of US$1.00 per acre each year and a production royalty of 5.0% based on gross proceeds. The production royalty is prepaid at a rate of US$500 per lease for the first five years and increases to US$1,000 per lease for the second five years of the lease.

Mining operations are also regulated by Mine and Safety Health Administration (&#8220;MSHA&#8221;). MSHA inspectors will periodically visit projects to monitor health and safety for the workers, and to inspect equipment and installations for code requirements. Although we are not engaged in mining operations, we require all of our workers to have completed safety training courses when working on our project.

Other regulatory requirements monitor the following:

(a) Explosives and explosives handling. (b) Use and occupancy of site structures associated with mining. (c) Hazardous materials and waste disposal. (d) State Historic site preservation. (e) Archaeological and paleontological finds associated with mining. We believe that we are in compliance with all laws and plans to continue to comply with the laws in the future. We believe that compliance with the laws will not adversely affect its business operations. There is however no assurance that any change in government regulation in the future will not adversely affect our business operations.

Environmental Liability 

We will have to sustain the cost of reclamation and environmental remediation for all exploration work undertaken. Both reclamation and environmental remediation refer to putting disturbed ground back as close to its original state as possible. Other potential pollution or damage must be cleaned up and renewed along standard guidelines outlined in the usual permits. Reclamation is the process of bringing the land back to its natural state after completion of exploration activities. Environmental remediation refers to the physical activity of taking steps to remediate, or remedy, any environmental damage caused. The amount of these costs is not known at this time as we do not know the extent of the exploration program that will be undertaken beyond completion of the recommended work program. Because there is presently no information on the size, tenor, or quality of any resource or reserve at this time, it is impossible to assess the impact of any capital expenditures on earnings, our competitive position or us in the event that a potentially economic deposit is discovered.

In the application for the MPO, costs are estimated for reclamation after 12 months of work, which would include construction, and for reclamation of the entire project and the IDL must agree to those costs. Once the MPO is granted, I-Minerals must submit a surety or cash bond for the first 12 months to begin activities. After the first 12 months, the bond is increased to the full costs estimated to clean up the entire project.

Permits and regulations will control all aspects of the production program if the project continues to that stage. Examples of regulatory requirements include:

&#160; (i) Water discharge will have to meet drinking water standards; &#160; (ii) Dust generation will have to be minimal or otherwise re-mediated; &#160; (iii) Dumping of material on the surface will have to be re-contoured and re-vegetated with natural vegetation; &#160; (iv) An assessment of all material to be left on the surface will need to be environmentally benign; &#160; (v) Ground water will have to be monitored for any potential contaminants; &#160; (vi) The socio-economic impact of the project will have to be evaluated and if deemed negative, will have to be re-mediated; and &#160; (vii) There will have to be an impact report of the work on the local fauna and flora including a study of potentially endangered species. A reclamation bond of US$7,600 has been posted to cover the current plan of operations. The Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) has been publicly noted without objection as of November 16, 2012. The Company does not view the current environmental liability to be material as of April 30, 2016 as the amount is estimated to be below $5,000.

&#160; Employees
