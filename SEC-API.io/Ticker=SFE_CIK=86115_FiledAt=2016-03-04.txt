 Item 1. Business 

Business Overview 

Safeguard&#8217;s charter is to build value in early- and growth-stage businesses by providing capital as well as strategic, operational and management resources. Safeguard participates in early- and growth-stage financings. Our vision is to be the preferred capital source for entrepreneurs and management teams in well-defined industry sectors. Throughout this document, we use the term &#8220;partner company&#8221; to generally refer to those companies in which we have an equity interest and in which we are actively involved, influencing development through board representation and management support, in addition to the influence we exert through our equity ownership. From time to time, in addition to these partner companies, we also hold relatively small equity interests in other enterprises where we do not exert significant influence and do not participate in management activities. In some cases, these interests relate to former partner companies and in some cases they relate to entities which may later become partner companies. 

We strive to create long-term value for our shareholders by helping our partner companies increase their market penetration, grow revenue and improve cash flow. Safeguard focuses principally on companies with initial capital requirements between $5 million and $15 million, and follow-on financing needs of between $5 million and $10 million, with a total anticipated deployment of up to $25 million from Safeguard. We will occasionally provide certain early-stage financing in amounts generally up to $1 million to promising young companies with the goal to provide more capital once certain development milestones are achieved. Safeguard principally targets companies that operate in two sectors: 

Healthcare &#160;&#8212; companies focused principally on medical technology (&#8220;MedTech&#8221;), including diagnostics and devices; and healthcare technology (&#8220;HealthTech&#8221;). Within these areas, Safeguard targets companies that have lesser regulatory risk and have achieved or are near commercialization; and 

Technology &#160;&#8212; companies focused principally on digital media; financial technology (&#8220;FinTech&#8221;); and enterprise software including mobile technology, cloud, &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; and big data. Within these areas, Safeguard targets companies that have transaction-enabling applications with a recurring revenue stream. 

In 2015 , our management team continued to focus on the following objectives: 

&#8226; 

Deploy capital in companies within our strategic focus; 

&#8226; 

Build value in partner companies by developing strong management teams, growing the companies organically and through acquisitions, and positioning the companies for liquidity at premium valuations; 

&#8226; 

Realize the value of partner companies through selective, well-timed exits to maximize risk-adjusted value; and 

&#8226; 

Provide the tools needed for investors to fully recognize the shareholder value that has been created by our efforts. 

To meet our strategic objectives during 2016 , Safeguard will continue to focus on: 

&#8226; 

Finding opportunities to deploy our capital in additional partner companies within our target sectors; 

&#8226; 

Helping partner companies achieve additional market penetration, revenue growth, cash flow improvement and growth in long-term value; and 

&#8226; 

Realizing value in our partner companies if and when we believe doing so will maximize value for our shareholders. 

We incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1953. Our corporate headquarters are located at 170 North Radnor-Chester Road, Suite 200, Radnor, Pennsylvania 19087.

Our Strategy 

Founded in 1953, Safeguard has a distinguished track record of building market leaders by providing capital and operational support to entrepreneurs across an evolving and innovative spectrum of industries. Today, Safeguard principally targets healthcare companies focusing on medical technology and healthcare technology; and technology companies focusing on financial technology, digital media, and enterprise software including mobile technology, cloud, &#8220;Internet of Things&#8221; and big data. 

As a visionary for the development of early- and growth-stage healthcare and technology companies, Safeguard is a proven partner for entrepreneurs looking to accelerate growth and build long-term value in their businesses. Leveraging Safeguard&#8217;s history of building market leaders, along with our team&#8217;s collective operational expertise and successful entrepreneurial endeavors, Safeguard has built a powerful &#8212; and actionable &#8212; platform of resources to support our partner companies with the strategies and relationships that are most vital for success. We provide value that extends beyond capital and work as a team to foster growth. 

Our corporate staff of approximately 30 employees is dedicated to creating long-term value for our shareholders by helping our partner companies build value and pursuing selective, well-timed exits of our partner companies. 

Identifying Partner Company Opportunities 

Safeguard&#8217;s go-to-market strategy, marketing and sourcing activities within our target sectors (Healthcare and Technology) are designed to generate a large volume of high-quality opportunities to acquire significant shareholder positions in partner companies. Our principal focus is to acquire positions in early- and growth-stage companies with attractive growth prospects in the healthcare and technology sectors. Generally, we prefer to deploy capital into companies: 

&#8226; 

operating in large and/or growing markets; 

&#8226; 

with barriers to entry by competitors, such as proprietary technology and intellectual property, or other competitive advantages; 

&#8226; 

with initial capital requirements between $5 million and $15 million, and follow-on financing needs of between $5 million and $10 million, with the total anticipated deployment of up to $25 million from Safeguard; and 

&#8226; 

with a compelling growth strategy. 

Our sourcing efforts are targeted primarily in the eastern United States. However, in-bound deal leads generate opportunities throughout the United States, and we do not limit our sourcing to a particular geographic area within the United States. Leads come from a variety of sources, including investment bankers, syndication partners, existing partner companies and advisory board members. 

In Healthcare, we currently target companies principally in MedTech and HealthTech that have lesser regulatory risk and have achieved or are near commercialization. 

In Technology, we currently target companies principally in digital media, FinTech, and enterprise software that have transaction-enabling applications with a recurring revenue stream. 

We believe there are many opportunities within these business models and vertical markets, and our sourcing activities are focused on finding candidate companies and evaluating how well they align with our criteria. However, we recognize we may have difficulty identifying candidate companies and completing transactions on terms we believe appropriate. As a result, we cannot be certain how frequently we will enter into transactions with new or existing partner companies. 

Competition. We face intense competition from other companies that acquire or provide capital to healthcare and technology businesses. Competitors include venture capital and, occasionally, private equity investors, as well as companies seeking to make strategic acquisitions. Many providers of growth capital also offer strategic guidance, networking access for recruiting and general advice. Nonetheless, we believe we are an attractive capital provider to potential partner companies because our strategy and capabilities offer: 

&#8226; 

responsive operational assistance, including strategy design and execution, business development, corporate development, sales, marketing, finance, risk management, talent recruitment and legal support; 

&#8226; 

the flexibility to structure transactions, with or without debt; 

&#8226; 

occasional liquidity opportunities for founders and existing investors; 

&#8226; 

a focus on maximizing risk-adjusted value growth, rather than absolute value growth within a narrow or predetermined time frame; 

&#8226; 

interim C-level management support, as needed; and 

&#8226; 

opportunities to leverage Safeguard&#8217;s balance sheet for borrowing and stability. 

Helping Our Partner Companies Build Value 

We offer operational and management support to each of our partner companies through our deep domain expertise from our management team's careers as entrepreneurs, board members, financiers and operators. Our employees have expertise in business strategy, sales and marketing, operations, finance, legal and transactional support. We provide hands-on assistance to the management teams of our partner companies to support their growth. We believe our strengths include: 

&#8226; 

applying our expertise to support a partner company&#8217;s introduction of new products and services; 

&#8226; 

leveraging our market knowledge to generate additional growth opportunities; 

&#8226; 

leveraging our business contacts and relationships; and 

&#8226; 

identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and providing capital to pursue potential acquisitions to accelerate growth. 

Strategic Support. By helping our partner companies&#8217; management teams remain focused on critical objectives through the provision of human, financial and strategic resources, we believe we are able to accelerate their development and success. We play an active role in developing the strategic direction of our partner companies which include: 

&#8226; 

defining short and long-term strategic goals; 

&#8226; 

identifying and planning for the critical success factors to reach these goals; 

&#8226; 

identifying and addressing the challenges and operational improvements required to achieve the critical success factors and, ultimately, the strategic goals; 

&#8226; 

identifying and implementing the business measurements that we and others will apply to measure a company&#8217;s success; and 

&#8226; 

providing capital to drive growth. 

Management and Operational Support. We provide management and operational support, as well as ongoing planning and development assessment. Our executives and advisory board members provide mentoring, advice and guidance to develop partner company management. Our executives serve on the boards of directors of our partner companies, working with them to develop and implement strategic and operating plans. We measure and monitor achievement of these plans through regular review of operational and financial performance measurements. We believe these services provide our partner companies with significant competitive advantages within their respective markets. 

Realizing Value 

In general, we will hold our position in a partner company as long as we believe the risk-adjusted value of that position is maximized by our continued ownership and effort. From time to time, we engage in discussions with other companies interested in our partner companies, either in response to inquiries or as part of a process we initiate. To the extent we believe that a partner company&#8217;s further growth and development can best be supported by a different ownership structure or if we otherwise believe it is in our shareholders&#8217; best interests, we may sell some or all of our position in the partner company. These sales may take the form of privately negotiated sales of stock or assets, mergers and acquisitions, public offerings of the partner company&#8217;s securities and, in the case of publicly traded partner companies, sales of their securities in the open market. In the past, we have taken partner companies public through rights offerings and directed share subscription programs. We will continue to consider these (or similar) programs to maximize partner company value for our shareholders. We expect to use proceeds from these sales (and sales of other assets) primarily to pursue opportunities to deploy capital in new and existing partner companies, or for working capital purposes, either with existing partner companies or at Safeguard.
