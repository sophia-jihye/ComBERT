 ITEM 1. &#160; BUSINESS

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

&#160; 

We are a New York City-based company, incorporated in the Marshall Islands in 2004. We transport iron ore, coal, grain, steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels. Our fleet currently consists of 70 drybulk carriers, including 13 Capesize, eight Panamax, four Ultramax, 21 Supramax, six Handymax and 18 Handysize drybulk carriers, with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately 5,158,000 deadweight tons (&#147;dwt&#148;). The average age of our current fleet is approximately 9.4 years. All of the vessels in our fleet were built in shipyards with reputations for constructing high-quality vessels. Of the vessels in our fleet, 39 are currently on spot market-related time charters, and ten are on fixed-rate time charter contracts. Additionally, 21 of the vessels in our fleet are operating in vessel pools. Under a pool arrangement, the vessels operate under a time charter agreement whereby the cost of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the pool and operating costs including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel. Since the members of the pool share in the revenue generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool, and the pool operates in the spot market, the revenue earned by vessels in vessel pools are subject to the fluctuations of the spot market. Most of our vessels are chartered to well-known charterers, including Cargill International S.A. and its subsidiaries (&#147;Cargill&#148;), Swissmarine Services S.A. and its subsidiaries (&#147;Swissmarine&#148;) and the Clipper Logger Pool and Clipper Sapphire Pool, in which Clipper Group acts as the pool manager (&#147;Clipper&#148;). 

&#160; 

See pages 7 - 10 for a table of all vessels that have been delivered to us. 

&#160; 

On April 7, 2015, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with our indirect, partially-owned subsidiary Baltic Trading Limited (&#147;Baltic Trading&#148;) under which we agreed to acquire Baltic Trading in a stock-for-stock transaction (the &#147;Merger&#148;). Under the terms of the agreement, Baltic Trading became our indirect wholly owned subsidiary, and Baltic Trading shareholders (other than Genco Shipping &#38; Trading Limited (&#147;GS&#38;T&#148;) and its subsidiaries) received 0.216 shares of our common stock for each share of Baltic Trading&#146;s common stock they owned at closing, with fractional shares that were settled in cash. Upon consummation of the transaction on July 17, 2015, our shareholders owned approximately 84.5% of the combined company, and Baltic Trading&#146;s shareholders (other than the GS&#38;T and its subsidiaries) owned approximately 15.5% of the combined company. Shares of Baltic Trading&#146;s Class B stock (all of which we owned) were canceled in the Merger. Our stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange after consummation of the transaction on July 20, 2015 under the symbol &#147;GNK.&#148; 

&#160; 

Our Board of Directors and Baltic Trading&#146;s Board of Directors established independent special committees to review the transaction and negotiate the terms on behalf of their respective companies. Both independent special committees unanimously approved the transaction. The Boards of Directors of both companies approved the merger by unanimous vote of directors present and voting, with Peter C. Georgiopoulos, Chairman of the Board of each company, recused for the vote. The Merger was approved on July 17, 2015 at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the &#147;Annual Meeting&#148;). 

&#160; 

Prior to the Merger, as of June 30, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary Genco Investments LLC owned 6,356,471 shares of Baltic Trading&#146;s Class B Stock, which represented a 10.85% ownership interest in Baltic Trading and 64.60% of the aggregate voting power of Baltic Trading&#146;s outstanding shares of voting stock at June 30, 2015. Baltic Trading is consolidated, as we also controlled a majority of the voting interest in Baltic Trading prior to the Merger. Management&#146;s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition includes the results of Baltic Trading. 

&#160; 

We report financial information and evaluate our operations by charter revenues and not by the length of ship employment for our customers, i.e., spot or time charters. Each of our vessels serve the same type of customer, have similar operations and maintenance requirements, operate in the same regulatory environment, and are subject to similar economic characteristics. Based on this, we have determined that we operate in one reportable segment, after the effective date of the Merger on July 17, 2015, in which we are engaged in the ocean transportation of drybulk cargoes worldwide through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels. Therefore, the totals previously reported for the two segments (GS&#38;T and Baltic Trading) is the total for the single reportable segment effective upon the Merger. 

&#160; 

Additionally, on April 7, 2015, we entered into an agreement under which we acquired all of the shares of two single-purpose entities that were wholly owned by Baltic Trading, each of which owns one Capesize drybulk vessel, for an aggregate purchase price of $68.5 million, subject to reduction for $40.6 million of outstanding first-mortgage debt of such single-purpose entities that is to be guaranteed by the Company and an adjustment for the difference between such single-purpose entities&#146; current assets and total liabilities as of the closing date. Through the transactions, which closed on April 8, 2015, we acquired the vessels known as the Baltic 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Lion and the Baltic Tiger. The independent special committees of both companies&#146; Boards of Directors reviewed and approved this transaction. 

&#160; 

We entered into a long-term management agreement (the &#147;Management Agreement&#148;) with Baltic Trading pursuant to which we apply our expertise and experience in the drybulk industry to provide Baltic Trading with commercial, technical, administrative and strategic services. The Management Agreement was for an initial term of approximately 15 years. Baltic Trading paid us for the services we provided it as well as reimbursed us for our costs and expenses incurred in providing certain of these services. Management fee income we earned from the Management Agreement net of any allocated shared expenses, such as salary, office expenses and other general and administrative fees, were taxable to us. Upon consolidation with Baltic Trading, any management fee income earned was eliminated for financial reporting purposes. The Management Agreement was terminated as of July 18, 2015. 

&#160; 

Our management team and our other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet. Commercial management includes the negotiation of charters for vessels, managing the mix of various types of charters, such as time charters, voyage charters and spot market-related time charters, and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters. Strategic management includes locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels. We currently contract with three independent technical managers to provide technical management of our fleet at a lower cost than we believe would be possible in-house. Technical management involves the day-to-day management of vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies. Members of our New York City-based management team oversee the activities of our independent technical managers. 

&#160; 

We hold an investment in the capital stock of Jinhui Shipping and Transportation Limited (&#147;Jinhui&#148;) and Korea Line Corporation (&#147;KLC&#148;). Jinhui is a drybulk shipping owner and operator focused on the Supramax segment of drybulk shipping. KLC is a marine transportation service company which operates a fleet of carriers which includes carriers for iron ore, liquefied natural gas and tankers for oil and petroleum products. 

&#160; 

We provide technical services for drybulk vessels purchased by Maritime Equity Partners LLC (&#147;MEP&#148;) under an agency agreement between us and MEP. These services include oversight of crew management, insurance, drydocking, ship operations and financial statement preparation, but do not include chartering services. The services were initially provided for a fee of $750 per ship per day plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs and will be provided for an initial term of one year. MEP has the right to cancel provision of services on 60 days&#146; notice with payment of a one-year termination fee upon a change of our control. We may terminate provision of the services at any time on 60 days&#146; notice. Peter C. Georgiopoulos, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, is a director of and has a minority interest in MEP. Our arrangement with MEP was approved by an independent committee of our Board of Directors. On September 30, 2015, under the oversight of an independent committee of our Board of Directors Genco Management (USA) Limited and MEP entered into certain agreements under which MEP paid $2.2 million of the amount of service fees in arrears (of which $0.3 million was paid in 2016 by the new owners of five of the MEP vessels sold in January 2016 as described below) and the daily service fee was reduced from $750 to $650 per day effective on October 1, 2015. During January 2016, five of MEP&#146;s vessels were sold to third parties, upon which these vessels were no longer subject to the agency agreement. Based upon the September 30, 2015 agreement, termination fees were due in the amount $0.3 million, which was assumed by the new owners of the five MEP vessels that were sold. The amount of these termination fees has been paid in full. The daily service fee earned for the months of January and February 2016 has also been paid in full.

&#160; 

Bankruptcy Reorganization 

&#160; 

On April 21, 2014 (the &#147;Petition Date&#148;), Genco Shipping &#38; Trading Limited and its subsidiaries other than Baltic Trading and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Debtors&#148;) filed voluntary cases (the &#147;Chapter 11 Cases&#148;) under the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the &#147;Bankruptcy Court&#148;). The Debtors continued to operate their businesses in the ordinary course as &#147;debtors-in-possession&#148; under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Through the Chapter 11 Cases, the Debtors implemented our Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization of the Debtors Pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (as amended, the &#147;Prepack Plan&#148;) for which the Company solicited votes from certain classes of its creditors prior to commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases in accordance with the Restructuring Support Agreement that the Debtors entered into with certain of its creditors on April 3, 2014. The Company subsequently emerged from bankruptcy on July 9, 2014.

&#160; 

On July 2, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the &#147;Confirmation Order&#148;), confirming the Prepack Plan. On July 9, 2014 (the &#147;Effective Date&#148;), the Debtors completed their financial restructuring and emerged from Chapter 11 through a series of transactions contemplated by the Prepack Plan, and the Prepack Plan became effective pursuant to its terms. References to &#147;Successor Company&#148; refer to the Company after July 9, 2014, after giving effect to the application of fresh-start reporting (refer to Note 1 &#151; General Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements). References to &#147;Predecessor Company&#148; refer to the Company prior to July 9, 2014. For key components of the Prepack Plan, refer to Note 1 &#151; General Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Going Concern 

&#160; 

Persistent weak drybulk industry conditions and historically low charter rates have negatively impacted our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity and may continue to do so in the future. The negative impact on our liquidity, together with a continued decline in vessel values, presents difficulties for remaining in compliance with our credit facility covenants relating to minimum cash, leverage ratios, and collateral maintenance (refer to &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148;), which could potentially result in defaults and acceleration of the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. These factors, as well as recurring losses from operations and negative working capital, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and extinguishment of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other things, our ability to: (i) develop and successfully implement a plan to address these factors, which may include refinancing our existing credit agreements, or obtaining waivers or modifications to our credit agreements from our lenders, or raising additional capital through selling assets (including vessels), reducing or delaying capital expenditures, or pursuing other options that may be available to us, which may include pursuing strategic opportunities and equity or debt offerings; (ii) return to profitability, (iii) generating sufficient cash flow from operations, (iv) remaining in compliance with our credit facility covenants, as the same may be modified, and (v) obtaining financing sources to meet our future obligations. The realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities are subject to uncertainty. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any direct adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities or any other adjustments that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern, except the classification of outstanding indebtedness. Refer to Note 1 &#151; General Information in the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

&#160; 

Risks and Uncertainties 

&#160; 

Our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon, among other things, our ability: (i) to develop and successfully implement a plan to address the factors described in the preceding paragraph; (ii) to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; (iii) to reach an acceptable outcome from our discussions with our lenders; and (iv) to obtain financing to meet our future obligations. We believe the consummation of a successful plan is critical to our continued viability and long-term liquidity. While we are working towards achieving these objectives, there can be no certainty that we will be successful in doing so. 

&#160; 

We urge that appropriate caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any of our liabilities and/or our securities. See &#147;Part I&#151;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#148;

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to manage and expand our fleet in a manner that maximizes our cash flows from operations. To accomplish this objective, we intend to: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Strategically expand the size of our fleet &#151; We may acquire additional modern, high-quality drybulk carriers through timely and selective acquisitions in a manner that is accretive to our cash flows. If we make such acquisitions, we may consider additional debt or equity financing alternatives.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Continue to operate a high-quality fleet &#151; We intend to maintain a modern, high-quality fleet that meets or exceeds stringent industry standards and complies with charterer requirements through our technical managers&#146; rigorous and comprehensive maintenance program. In addition, our technical managers maintain the quality of our vessels by carrying out regular inspections, both while in port and at sea.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Pursue an appropriate combination of time and spot charters &#151; All of our 70 vessels operate under time charters, spot market-related time charters or pool agreements. Charters under fixed rate contracts provide us with relatively stable revenues, and charterers under spot market-related time charters provide us with market revenues, both of which provide us with a high fleet utilization. We may in the future pursue other market opportunities for our vessels to capitalize on market conditions, including arranging longer or shorter charter periods and entering into short-term time charters, voyage charters and use of vessel pools. Our charter strategy in the current unfavorable market has been focused on signing short-term or spot market-related contracts with multinational charterers in order to preserve our ability to capitalize on possible future rate increases.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Maintain low-cost, highly efficient operations &#151; During 2015, we outsourced technical management of our fleet, to Wallem Shipmanagement Limited (&#147;Wallem&#148;), Anglo-Eastern Group (&#147;Anglo&#148;), and V.Ships Limited (&#147;V.Ships&#148;), third-party independent technical managers, at a cost we believe is lower than what we could achieve by performing the function in-house. Our management team actively monitors and controls vessel operating expenses incurred by the independent technical managers by overseeing their activities. We intend to consolidate our technical management with Wallem and Anglo during 2016. Finally, we seek to maintain low-cost, highly efficient operations by capitalizing on the cost savings and economies of scale that result from operating sister ships.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Capitalize on our management team&#146;s reputation &#151; We seek to capitalize on our management team&#146;s reputation for high standards of performance, reliability and safety, and maintain strong relationships with major international charterers, many of whom consider the reputation of a vessel owner and operator when entering into time charters. We believe that our management team&#146;s track record improves our relationships with high quality shipyards and financial institutions, many of which consider reputation to be an indicator of creditworthiness.

FLEET MANAGEMENT 

&#160; 

Our management team and other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet. Commercial management involves negotiating charters for vessels, managing the mix of various types of charters, such as time 

&#160; 

&#160; 

charters, voyage charters, vessel pools and spot market-related time charters, and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters. Strategic management involves locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels. 

&#160; 

We utilize the services of reputable independent technical managers for the technical management of our fleet. We currently contract with Wallem, Anglo and V.Ships, independent technical managers, for our technical management. Technical management involves the day-to-day management of vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies. Members of our New York City-based management team oversee the activities of our independent technical managers. The head of our technical management team has over 25 years of experience in the shipping industry. 

&#160; 

Wallem, founded in 1971, Anglo, founded in 1974 and V.Ships, founded in 1984, are among the largest ship management companies in the world. These technical managers are known worldwide for their agency networks, covering all major ports in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore. These technical managers provide services to over 1,000 vessels of all types, including Capesize, Panamax, Ultramax, Supramax, Handymax and Handysize drybulk carriers that meet strict quality standards. 

&#160; 

Under our technical management agreements, our technical manager is obligated to: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; provide personnel to supervise the maintenance and general efficiency of our vessels;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; arrange and supervise the maintenance of our vessels to our standards to assure that our vessels comply with applicable national and international regulations and the requirements of our vessels&#146; classification societies;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; select and train the crews for our vessels, including assuring that the crews have the correct certificates for the types of vessels on which they serve;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; check the compliance of the crews&#146; licenses with the regulations of the vessels&#146; flag states and the International Maritime Organization, or IMO;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; arrange the supply of spares and stores for our vessels; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; report expense transactions to us, and make its procurement and accounting systems available to us.

&#160; 

OUR CHARTERS 

&#160; 

As of March 15, 2016, we employed 39 of our 70 drybulk carriers under spot market-related time charters, which are time charters with rates based on published Baltic Indices. These types of charters are similar to time charters with the exception of having a variable rate over the term of the time charter agreement. As such, the revenue earned by these 39 vessels is subject to the fluctuations of the spot market. Additionally, as of March 15, 2016, we employed ten of our 70 drybulk carriers under fixed-rate time charters. A time charter involves the hiring of a vessel from its owner for a period of time pursuant to a contract under which the vessel owner places its ship (including its crew and equipment) at the disposal of the charterer. Under a time charter, the charterer periodically pays a fixed daily charterhire rate to the owner of the vessel and bears all voyage expenses, including the cost of bunkers (fuel), port expenses, agents&#146; fees and canal dues. 

&#160; 

The remaining 21 of our drybulk carriers are currently in vessel pools. We believe that vessel pools provide cost-effective commercial management activities for a group of similar class vessels. The pool arrangement provides the benefits of a large-scale operation and chartering efficiencies that might not be available to smaller fleets. Under the pool arrangement, the vessels operate under a time charter agreement whereby the cost of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the charterer and operating costs including crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel. Since the members of the pool share in the revenue generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool, and the pool operates in the spot market, the revenue earned by these 21 vessels is subject to the fluctuations of the spot market. 

&#160; 

Subject to any restrictions in the contract, the charterer determines the type and quantity of cargo to be carried and the ports of loading and discharging. Our vessels operate worldwide within the trading limits imposed by our insurance terms. The technical operation and navigation of the vessel at all times remains the responsibility of the vessel owner, which is generally responsible for the vessel&#146;s operating expenses, including the cost of crewing, insuring, repairing and maintaining the vessel, costs of spares and consumable stores, tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses. 

&#160; 

Each of our current time charters, spot market-related time charters and vessel pool agreements expire within a range of dates (for example, a minimum of 11 and maximum of 13 months following delivery), with the exact end of the time charter left unspecified 

&#160; 

&#160; 

to account for the uncertainty of when a vessel will complete its final voyage under the time charter. The charterer may extend the charter period by any time that the vessel is off-hire. If a vessel remains off-hire for more than 30 consecutive days, the time charter may be cancelled at the charterer&#146;s option. 

&#160; 

In connection with the charter of each of our vessels, we incur commissions generally ranging from 1.25% to 6.25% of the total daily charterhire rate of each charter to third-parties, depending on the number of brokers involved with arranging the relevant charter. 

&#160; 

We monitor developments in the drybulk shipping industry on a regular basis and strategically adjust the charterhire periods for our vessels according to market conditions as they become available for charter. 

&#160; 

During the beginning of 2009, the Genco Cavalier, a 2007-built Supramax vessel, was on charter to Samsun Logix Corporation (&#147;Samsun&#148;), when Samsun filed for the equivalent of bankruptcy protection in South Korea, otherwise referred to as a rehabilitation application. On February 5, 2010, the rehabilitation plan submitted by Samsun was approved by the South Korean courts. As part of the rehabilitation process, our claim of approximately $17.2 million will be settled in the following manner: 34%, or approximately $5.9 million, will be paid in cash in annual installments on December 30 of each year from 2010 through 2019 ranging in percentages from eight to 17; the remaining 66%, or approximately $11.3 million, converted to Samsun shares at a specified value per share. During the period from July 9 to December 31, 2014, we recorded $0.5 million as Other operating income of which $0.3 million represents 50% of the portion (9%) of the cash settlement that was due on December 30, 2012 and $0.2 million which represents 50% of the portion (8%) of the cash settlement that was due on December 30, 2013. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2013 and the period from January 1 to July 9, 2014, there were no payments remitted by Samsun. On July 3, 2015, Samsun filed for rehabilitation proceedings for the second time with the South Korean courts due to financial distress. The rehabilitation plan is still under review by the South Korean courts, and a proposed rehabilitation plan has not yet been implemented. A meeting for resolution on the proposed rehabilitation plan is expected to be held on March 11, 2016.

&#160; 

During January 2011, the Genco Success, a 1997-built Handymax vessel, was on charter to Korea Line Corporation (&#147;KLC&#148;) when KLC filed for a rehabilitation application. On July 3, 2012, the original rehabilitation plan submitted by KLC was approved by the South Korean courts. As part of the rehabilitation process, our claim of approximately $0.8 million will be settled in the following manner: 37%, or approximately $0.3 million, will be paid in cash in annual installments on December 30 of each year from 2012 through 2021 ranging in percentages from 0.5 to 43; the remaining 63%, or approximately $0.5 million, converted to KLC shares at a specified value per share. The final rehabilitation plan was amended and approved by the South Korean courts on October 4, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we received a final cash settlement and shares of KLC stock as our final settlement which resulted in operating income of $0.1 million.

The extension is expected to begin after completion of drydocking for scheduled maintenance.

&#160; 

&#160; 

CLASSIFICATION AND INSPECTION 

&#160; 

All of our vessels have been certified as being &#147;in class&#148; by the American Bureau of Shipping (&#147;ABS&#148;), DNVGL or Lloyd&#146;s Register of Shipping (&#147;Lloyd&#146;s&#148;). Each of these classification societies is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies. Every commercial vessel&#146;s hull and machinery is evaluated by a classification society authorized by its country of registry. The classification society certifies that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#146;s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. Each vessel is inspected by a surveyor of the classification society in three surveys of varying frequency and thoroughness: every year for the annual survey, every two to three years for the intermediate survey and every four to five years for special surveys. Special surveys always require drydocking. Vessels that are 15 years old or older are required, as part of the intermediate survey process, to be drydocked every 24 to 30 months for inspection of the underwater portions of the vessel and for necessary repairs stemming from the inspection.

&#160; 

In addition to the classification inspections, many of our customers regularly inspect our vessels as a precondition to chartering them for voyages. We believe that our well-maintained, high-quality vessels provide us with a competitive advantage in the current environment of increasing regulation and customer emphasis on quality. 

&#160; 

We have implemented the International Safety Management Code, which was promulgated by the International Maritime Organization, or IMO (the United Nations agency for maritime safety and the prevention of marine pollution by ships), to establish pollution prevention requirements applicable to vessels. We obtained documents of compliance for our offices and safety management certificates for all of our vessels, which are required by the IMO. 

&#160; 

CREWING AND EMPLOYEES 

&#160; 

Each of our vessels is crewed with 21 to 24 officers and seamen. Our technical managers are responsible for locating and retaining qualified officers for our vessels. The crewing agencies handle each seaman&#146;s training, travel and payroll, and ensure that all the seamen on our vessels have the qualifications and licenses required to comply with international regulations and shipping conventions. We typically man our vessels with more crew members than are required by the country of the vessel&#146;s flag in order to allow for the performance of routine maintenance duties. 

&#160; 

As of March 15, 2016, we employed 34 shore-based personnel and approximately 1,575 seagoing personnel on our vessels. 

&#160; 

CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

Our assessment of a charterer&#146;s financial condition and reliability is an important factor in negotiating employment for our vessels. We generally charter our vessels to major trading houses (including commodities traders), major producers and government-owned entities rather than to more speculative or undercapitalized entities. Our customers include national, regional and international companies, such as Cargill, Swissmarine, Pioneer Navigation Ltd. and Clipper. For the year ended December 31, 2015, three of our charterers, Swissmarine, Clipper and Pioneer Navigation Ltd., each accounted for more than 10% of our voyage revenue, or 56.49%, in the aggregate. 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

Our business fluctuates in line with the main patterns of trade of the major drybulk cargoes and varies according to changes in the supply and demand for these items. We operate in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand. We compete for charters on the basis of price, vessel location and size, age and condition of the vessel, as well as on our reputation as an owner and operator. We compete with other owners of drybulk carriers in the Capesize, Panamax, Ultramax, Supramax, Handymax and Handysize class sectors, some of whom may also charter our vessels as customers. Ownership of drybulk carriers is highly fragmented and is divided among approximately 1,990 independent drybulk carrier owners. 

&#160; 

PERMITS AND AUTHORIZATIONS 

&#160; 

We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations with respect to our vessels. The kinds of permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations required for each vessel depend upon several factors, including the commodity transported, the waters in which the vessel operates, the nationality of the vessel&#146;s crew and the age of the vessel. We believe that we have all material permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, additional laws and regulations, environmental or otherwise, may be adopted which could limit our ability to do business or increase the cost of our doing business. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

INSURANCE 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The operation of any drybulk vessel includes risks such as mechanical failure, collision, property loss, cargo loss or damage and business interruption due to political circumstances in foreign countries, piracy, hostilities and labor strikes. In addition, there is always an inherent possibility of marine disaster, including oil spills and other environmental mishaps, and the liabilities arising from owning and operating vessels in international trade. The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, which imposes virtually unlimited liability upon owners, operators and demise charterers of vessels trading in the U.S.-exclusive economic zone for certain oil pollution accidents in the United States, has made liability insurance more expensive for ship owners and operators trading in the U.S. market. 

&#160; 

While we maintain hull and machinery insurance, war risks insurance, protection and indemnity cover, and freight, demurrage and defense cover and loss of hire insurance for our fleet in amounts that we believe to be prudent to cover normal risks in our operations, we may not be able to achieve or maintain this level of coverage throughout a vessel&#146;s useful life. Furthermore, while we believe that our present insurance coverage is adequate, not all risks can be insured, and there can be no guarantee that any specific claim will be paid, or that we will always be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates. 

&#160; 

Hull and Machinery, War Risks, Kidnap and Ransom Insurance 

&#160; 

We maintain marine hull and machinery, war risks and kidnap and ransom insurance which cover the risk of actual or constructive total loss, for all of our vessels. Our vessels are each covered up to at least fair market value with deductibles, which depend primarily on the class of the insured vessel and are subject to change. We are covered, subject to limitations in our policy, to have the crew released in the case of kidnapping due to piracy in the Gulf of Aden / Somalia. 

&#160; 

Protection and Indemnity Insurance 

&#160; 

Protection and indemnity insurance is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations, or P&#38;I Associations, which insure our third-party liabilities in connection with our shipping activities. This includes third-party liability and other related expenses resulting from the injury or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, the loss or damage to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels, damage to other third-party property, pollution arising from oil or other substances and salvage, towing and other related costs, including wreck removal. Protection and indemnity insurance is a form of mutual indemnity insurance, extended by protection and indemnity mutual associations, or &#147;clubs.&#148; Subject to the &#147;capping&#148; discussed below, our coverage, except for pollution, is unlimited. 

&#160; 

We maintain protection and indemnity insurance coverage for pollution of $1 billion per vessel per incident. The 13 P&#38;I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world&#146;s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association&#146;s liabilities. We are a member of P&#38;I Associations, which are members of the International Group. As a result, we are subject to calls payable to the associations based on the group&#146;s claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual associations and members of the pool of P&#38;I Associations comprising the International Group. 

&#160; 

Loss of Hire Insurance 

&#160; 

We maintain loss of hire insurance, which covers business interruptions and related losses that result from the loss of use of a vessel. Our loss of hire insurance has a 14-day deductible and provides claim coverage for up to 90 days or 180 days, depending on the vessel. 

&#160; 

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATION 

&#160; 

Government regulation significantly affects the ownership and operation of our vessels. We are subject to international conventions and treaties, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may operate or are registered relating to safety and health and environmental protection including the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of hazardous and non-hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination and liability for damage to natural resources. Compliance with such laws, regulations and other requirements entails significant expense, including vessel modifications and implementation of certain operating procedures. 

&#160; 

A variety of governmental and private entities subject our vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include the local port authorities, (applicable national authorities such as the U.S. Coast Guard and harbor masters), classification societies, flag state administrations (countries of registry) and charterers. Some of these entities require us to obtain permits, licenses, certificates and other authorizations for the operation of our vessels. Our failure to maintain necessary permits, licenses, certificates or authorizations could require us to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend the operation of one or more of our vessels. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

In recent periods, heightened levels of environmental and operational safety concerns among insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers have led to greater inspection and safety requirements on all vessels and may accelerate the scrapping of older vessels throughout the drybulk shipping industry. Increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to the stricter environmental standards. We believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all material permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations. However, because such laws and regulations are frequently changed and may impose increasingly stricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. In addition, a future serious marine incident, such as one comparable to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, that results in significant oil pollution or otherwise causes significant adverse environmental impact could result in additional legislation or regulation that could negatively affect our profitability.

&#160; 

International Maritime Organization (IMO) 

&#160; 

The United Nations International Maritime Organization (the &#147;IMO&#148;) has adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (collectively referred to as MARPOL 73/78 and herein as &#147;MARPOL&#148;). MARPOL entered into force on October 2, 1983. It has been adopted by over 150 nations, including many of the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate. MARPOL is broken into six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of pollution. Annex I relates to oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried, in bulk, in liquid or packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV and V relate to sewage and garbage management, respectively; and Annex VI, lastly, relates to air emissions. Annex VI was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997. 

&#160; 

In 2013, the IMO&#146;s Maritime Environment Protection Committee (&#147;MEPC&#148;) adopted by resolution amendments to the MARPOL Annex I Conditional Assessment Scheme (&#147;CAS&#148;). These amendments, which became effective on October 1, 2014, pertain to revising references to the inspections of bulk carriers and tankers after the 2011 International Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers (&#147;ESP Code&#148;), which enhances the programs of inspections. We may need to make certain financial expenditures to comply with these amendments which we do not anticipate to be material. 

&#160; 

Air Emissions 

&#160; 

In September of 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution. Effective May 2005, and as subsequently revised, Annex VI sets limits on nitrogen oxide emissions from ships whose diesel engines were constructed (or underwent major conversions) on or after January 1, 2000. It also prohibits &#147;deliberate emissions&#148; of &#147;ozone depleting substances,&#148; defined to include certain halons and chlorofluorocarbons. &#147;Deliberate emissions&#148; are not limited to times when the ship is at sea; they can for example include discharges occurring in the course of the ships repair and maintenance. Emissions of &#147;volatile organic compounds&#148; from certain tankers, and the shipboard incineration (from incinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) are also prohibited. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions, known as Emission Control Areas (&#147;ECAs&#148;) (see below). 

&#160; 

The MEPC, adopted amendments to Annex VI on October 10, 2008, which entered into force on July 1, 2010. The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among other things, implementing a progressive reduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships. As of January 1, 2012, the amended Annex VI requires that fuel oil contain no more than 3.50% sulfur (from the previous cap of 4.50%). By January 1, 2020, sulfur content outside sulfur emission control areas must not exceed 0.50%, subject to a feasibility review to be completed no later than 2018. 

&#160; 

Sulfur content standards are even stricter within certain ECAs. As of July 1, 2010, ships operating within an ECA were not permitted to use fuel with sulfur content in excess of 1.0%, which was further reduced to 0.10% on January 1, 2015. Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. The Baltic Sea and the North Sea have been so designated. Effective August 1, 2012, certain coastal areas of North America were designated ECAs, and as of January 1, 2014 the applicable areas of the United States Caribbean Sea were designated ECAs. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) or the states where we operate, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures or otherwise increase the costs of our operations. 

&#160; 

As of January 1, 2013, MARPOL made mandatory certain measures relating to energy efficiency for ships in part to address greenhouse gas emissions. All new ships are required to utilize the Energy Efficiency Design Index (&#147;EEDI&#148;) and all ships must use a Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (&#147;SEEMP&#148;). Our fleet is already compliant with this requirement. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Amended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for new tier III marine engines, depending on their date of installation. The EPA promulgated equivalent (and in some senses stricter) emissions standards in late 2009. 

&#160; 

Safety Management System Requirements 

&#160; 

The IMO also adopted the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974 (&#147;SOLAS Convention&#148;) and the International Convention on Load Lines (&#147;LL Convention&#148;), which impose a variety of standards that regulate the design and operational features of ships. The IMO periodically revises the SOLAS Convention and LL Convention standards. The SOLAS Convention amendments that relate to the safe manning of vessels were adopted by the IMO in May 2012 and entered in force as of January 1, 2014. The Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (&#147;LLMC&#148;) was recently amended, and the amendments went into effect on June 8, 2015. The foregoing amendments alter the limits of liability for loss of life or personal injury and property claims against ship owners. 

&#160; 

Under Chapter IX of the SOLAS Convention, the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (&#147;ISM Code&#148;), our operations are also subject to environmental standards and requirements. The ISM Code requires the owner of a vessel, or any person who has taken responsibility for operation of a vessel, to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. We rely upon the safety management system that we and our technical manager have developed for compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a ship owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. 

&#160; 

The ISM Code requires that vessel operators also obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel&#146;s management with code requirements for a safety management system. No vessel can obtain a certificate unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, issued by each flag state, under the ISM Code. We believe that we have all material requisite documents of compliance for our managers&#146; offices and safety management certificates for all of our vessels for which such certificates are required by the IMO. We renew these documents of compliance and safety management certificates as required. 

&#160; 

Pollution Control and Liability Requirements 

&#160; 

The IMO has negotiated international conventions that impose liability for pollution in international waters and the territorial waters of the nation&#146;s signatory to such conventions. The IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships&#146; Ballast Water and Sediments (&#147;BWM Convention&#148;) in February 2004. The BWM Convention&#146;s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits. The BWM Convention will not become effective until 12 months after it has been adopted by 30 states, the combined merchant fleets of which represent not less than 35% of the gross tonnage of the world&#146;s merchant shipping. To date, the BWM Convention has not yet been ratified, but proposals regarding implementation have recently been submitted to the IMO. Many of the implementation dates in the BWM Convention have already passed, so that once the BWM Convention enters into force, the period of installation of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements would be extremely short, with several thousand ships a year needing to install ballast water management systems (&#147;BWMS&#148;). For this reason, on December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly passed a resolution revising the application dates of the BWM Convention so that they are triggered by the entry into force date and not the adoption date in the BWM Convention. This, in effect, makes all vessels constructed before the entry into force date &#147;existing vessels&#148; and allows for the installation of a BWMS on such vessels at the first IOPP (International Oil Pollution Prevention) renewal survey following entry into force of the convention. Furthermore, in October 2014 the MEPC met and adopted additional resolutions concerning the BWM Convention&#146;s implementation. Once mid-ocean ballast exchange ballast water treatment requirements become mandatory, the cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers and the costs of ballast water treatments may be material. However, many countries already regulate the discharge of ballast water carried by vessels from country to country to prevent the introduction of invasive and harmful species via such discharges. The United States for example requires vessels entering its waters from another country to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange, or undertake some alternate measure, and to comply with certain reporting requirements. The system specification requirements for trading in the United States have not been formalized, but we believe the ballast water treatment systems will range from $0.7 million to $1.0 million each, primarily dependent on the size of the vessel. 

&#160; 

Many countries have ratified and follow the liability plan adopted by the IMO and set out in the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, as amended by different Protocols in 1976, 1984, and 1992, and amended in 2000 (the &#147;CLC&#148;). Under the CLC and depending on whether the country in which the damage results is a party to the 1992 Protocol to the CLC, a vessel&#146;s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain exceptions. The 1992 Protocol changed certain limits on liability, expressed using the International Monetary Fund currency unit of Special Drawing Rights. The limits on liability have since been amended so that the 

&#160; 

&#160; 

compensation limits on liability were raised. The right to limit liability is forfeited under the CLC where the spill is caused by the ship owner&#146;s personal fault and under the 1992 Protocol where the spill is caused by the ship owner&#146;s personal act or omission by intentional or reckless conduct where the ship owner knew pollution damage would probably result. The CLC requires ships covered by it to maintain insurance covering the liability of the owner in a sum equivalent to an owner&#146;s liability for a single incident. We believe that our protection and indemnity insurance will cover the liability under the plan adopted by the IMO.

&#160; 

The IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (the &#147;Bunker Convention&#148;), to impose strict liability on ship owners for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel. The Bunker Convention requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, as amended). With respect to non-ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of oil carried as fuel in ship&#146;s bunkers typically is determined by the national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur. 

&#160; 

Noncompliance with the ISM Code or other IMO regulations may subject the vessel owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. The U.S. Coast Guard and European Union authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code by the applicable deadlines will be prohibited from trading in U.S. and European Union ports, respectively. As of the date of this report, each of our vessels is ISM Code certified. However, there can be no assurance that such certificates will be maintained in the future. 

&#160; 

Anti-Fouling Requirements 

&#160; 

In 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships (the &#147;Anti-fouling Convention&#148;). The Anti-fouling Convention prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of vessels. The exteriors of vessels constructed prior to January 1, 2003 that have not been in drydock must, as of September 17, 2008, either not contain the prohibited compounds or have coatings applied to the vessel exterior that act as a barrier to the leaching of the prohibited compounds. Vessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages must obtain an International Anti-fouling System Certificate and undergo a survey before the vessel is put into service or when the anti-fouling systems are altered or replaced. We have obtained Anti-fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti-fouling Convention. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 &#160; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act 

&#160; 

The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#147;OPA&#148;) established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects all &#147;owners and operators&#148; whose vessels trade in the United States, its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in U.S. waters, which includes the U.S. territorial sea and the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the U.S. The United States has also enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#147;CERCLA&#148;) which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances other than oil, except in limited circumstances, whether on land or at sea. OPA and CERCLA both define &#147;owner or operator&#148; &#147;in the case of a vessel as any person owning, operating or chartering by demise, the vessel.&#148; Accordingly, both OPA and CERCLA impact our operations. 

&#160; 

Under OPA, vessel owners and operators are &#147;responsible parties&#148; and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels. OPA defines these other damages broadly to include: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; injury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed or lost;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; net cost of increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil, such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards, and loss of subsistence use of natural resources.

&#160; 

OPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages; such caps do not apply to direct cleanup costs. Effective December 21, 2015, the U.S. Coast Guard adjusted the limits of OPA liability for non-tanker vessels to the greater of $1,100 per gross ton or $939,800 (subject to periodic adjustment for inflation). These limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party&#146;s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The limitation on liability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (i) report the incident where the responsibility party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (ii) reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under the Federal Water Pollution Act (Section 311 (c), (e)) or the Intervention on the High Seas Act. 

&#160; 

CERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damage for injury to, or destruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing same, and health assessments or health effects studies. There is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $500,000 for any other vessel. These limits do not apply (rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations. The limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA. 

&#160; 

OPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law. 

&#160; 

OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the U.S. Coast Guard (the &#147;USCG&#148;) evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject. Vessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance, a surety bond, qualification as a self-insurer or a guarantee. We plan to comply with the U.S. Coast Guard&#146;s financial responsibility regulations by providing a certificate of responsibility evidencing sufficient insurance. 

&#160; 

The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may also result in additional regulatory initiatives or statutes, including the raising of liability caps under OPA. For example, on August 15, 2012, the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (&#147;BSEE&#148;) implemented a final drilling safety rule for offshore oil and gas operations that strengthens the requirements for safety equipment, well control systems, and blowout prevention practices. A new rule issued by the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (&#147;BOEM&#148;) that increased the limits of liability of damages for offshore facilities under OPA based on inflation took effect in January 2015. In April 2015, it was announced that new regulations are expected to be imposed in the United States regarding offshore oil and gas drilling. In December 2015, the BSEE announced a new pilot inspection program for offshore facilities. Compliance with any new requirements of OPA may substantially impact our cost of operations or require us to incur additional expenses to comply with any new regulatory initiatives or statutes. Additional legislation, regulations, or other requirements applicable to the operation of our vessels that may be implemented in the future could adversely affect our business.

&#160; 

While we do not carry oil as cargo, we do carry bunkers in our drybulk carriers. We currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1 billion per incident for each of our vessels. If the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our insurance coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends. 

&#160; 

Other United States Environmental Regulations 

&#160; 

The U.S. Clean Water Act (&#147;CWA&#148;) prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly-issued permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA. In addition, many U.S. states that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law. 

&#160; 

The EPA has enacted rules requiring a permit regulating ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within U.S. waters under the Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Operation of vessels (the &#147;VGP&#148;). For a new vessel delivered to an owner or operator after September 19, 2019 to be covered by the VGP, the owner must submit a Notice of Intent (&#147;NOI&#148;) at least 30 days before the vessel operates in U.S. waters. On March 28, 2013, the EPA re-issued the VGP for another five years; this 2013 VGP took effect December 19, 2013. The 2013 VGP contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in U.S. waters, more stringent requirements for exhaust gas scrubbers and the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants. We will submit NOIs for our vessels where required.

&#160; 

The USCG regulations adopted under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act (the &#147;NISA&#148;) also impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering or operating in U.S. waters that require the installation of equipment to treat ballast water before it is discharged in U.S. waters or, in the alternative, the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures. Vessels not complying with these regulations are restricted from entering U.S. waters. The USCG must approve any technology before it is placed on a vessel. 

&#160; 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, as of January 1, 2014, vessels are technically subject to the phasing-in of these standards. As a result, the USCG has provided waivers to vessels which cannot install the as-yet unapproved technology. The EPA, on the other hand, has taken a different approach to enforcing ballast discharge standards under the VGP. On December 27, 2013, the EPA issued an enforcement response policy in connection with the new VGP in which the EPA indicated that it would take into account the reasons why vessels do not have the requisite technology installed, but will not grant any waivers. 

&#160; 

It should also be noted that in October 2015, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that directed the EPA to redraft the sections of the 2013 VGP that address ballast water. However, the Second Circuit stated that 2013 VGP will remain in effect until the EPA issues a new VGP. It presently remains unclear how the ballast water requirements set forth by the EPA, the USCG, and IMO BWM Convention, some of which are in effect and some which are pending, will co-exist. 

&#160; 

The USCG&#146;s revised ballast water standards are consistent with requirements under the BWM Convention. Compliance with the EPA and the USCG regulations could require the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures at potentially substantial cost, or may otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters. In addition, certain states have enacted more stringent discharge standards as conditions to their required certification of the VGP. 

&#160; 

The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970, including its amendments of 1977 and 1990 (the &#147;CAA&#148;), requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. The CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans (&#147;SIPs&#148;) designed to attain national health-based air quality standards in primarily major metropolitan areas and/or industrial areas. To the extent applicable to our vessels, the operation of our vessels is in compliance with the CAA. 

&#160; 

European Union Regulations 

&#160; 

In October 2009, the European Union amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship-source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. Member States were required to enact laws or regulations to comply with the directive by the end of 2010. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims. The directive applies to all types of vessels, irrespective of their flag, but certain exceptions apply to warships or where human safety or that of the ship is in danger. 

&#160; 

The European Union has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high-risk ships, as determined by type, age, and flag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The European Union also adopted and then extended a ban on substandard ships and enacted a minimum ban period and a definitive ban for repeated offenses. The regulation also provided the European Union with greater authority and control over classification societies by imposing more requirements on classification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that failed to comply. 

&#160; 

Greenhouse Gas Regulation 

&#160; 

Currently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 2015 United Nations Convention on Climate Change Conference in Paris did not result in an agreement that directly limited greenhouse gas emissions from ships. As of January 1, 2013, all new ships must comply with two new sets of mandatory requirements, which were adopted by MEPC in July 2011, to address greenhouse gas emissions from ships. Currently operating ships will be required to develop SEEMPs, and minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile will apply to new ships, as defined by the EEDI. These requirements could cause us to incur additional compliance costs. The IMO is also planning to implement market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships at an upcoming MEPC session. In April 2015, a regulation was adopted requiring that large ships (over 5,000 gross tons) 

&#160; 

&#160; 

calling at European Union ports from January 2018 collect and publish data on carbon dioxide emissions and other information. In the United States, the EPA has issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger the public health and safety and has adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources and large stationary sources. The EPA enforces both the CAA and the international standards found in Annex VI of MARPOL concerning marine diesel emissions, and the sulfur content found in marine fuel. Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, European Union, the U.S. or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures, including capital expenditures to upgrade our vessels, which we cannot predict with certainty at this time.

&#160; 

International Labour Organization 

&#160; 

The International Labour Organization (ILO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The ILO has adopted the Maritime Labor Convention 2006 (&#147;MLC 2006&#148;). A Maritime Labor Certificate and a Declaration of Maritime Labor Compliance will be required to ensure compliance with the MLC 2006 for all ships above 500 gross tons in international trade. The MLC 2006 entered into force on August 20, 2013. The MLC 2006 requires us to develop new procedures to ensure full compliance with its requirements. 

&#160; 

Vessel Security Regulations 

&#160; 

Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security. On November 25, 2002, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (&#147;MTSA&#148;) came into effect. To implement certain portions of the MTSA, in July 2003, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The regulations also impose requirements on certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA. 

&#160; 

Similarly, in December 2002, amendments to the SOLAS Convention created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security. The new Chapter XI-2 became effective in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, and mandates compliance with the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code (the &#147;ISPS Code&#148;). The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate (&#147;ISSC&#148;) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel&#146;s flag state. Among the various requirements are: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; on-board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety-related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship&#146;s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; on-board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the development of vessel security plans;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel&#146;s hull;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel&#146;s history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship&#146;s identification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; compliance with flag state security certification requirements.

&#160; 

A ship operating without a valid certificate may be detained at port until it obtains an ISSC, or may be expelled from port or refused entry at port. 

&#160; 

The USCG regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt from MTSA vessel security measures non-U.S. vessels that have on board, as of July 1, 2004, a valid ISSC attesting to the vessel&#146;s compliance with the SOLAS Convention security requirements and the ISPS Code. We have implemented the various security measures addressed by the MTSA, the SOLAS Convention and the ISPS Code. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Inspection by Classification Societies 

&#160; 

Every oceangoing vessel must be &#145;&#145;classed&#146;&#146; by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the vessel is &#145;&#145;in class,&#146;&#146; signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel&#146;s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned.

&#160; 

The classification society also undertakes on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned. 

&#160; 

For maintenance of the class certification, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classes are required to be performed as follows: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Annual Surveys : For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant, and where applicable for special equipment classed, within three months before or after each anniversary date of the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Intermediate Surveys : Extended annual surveys are referred to as intermediate surveys and typically are conducted two and one-half years after commissioning and each class renewal. Intermediate surveys are to be carried out at or between the occasion of the second or third annual survey.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Class Renewal Surveys: Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship&#146;s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and for any special equipment classed, at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. At the special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined, including audio-gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the classification society would prescribe steel renewals. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey every four or five years, depending on whether a grace period was granted, a vessel owner has the option of arranging with the classification society for the vessel&#146;s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five-year cycle. Upon a vessel owner&#146;s request, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal.

&#160; 

All areas subject to survey as defined by the classification society are required to be surveyed at least once per class period, unless shorter intervals between surveys are prescribed elsewhere. The period between two subsequent surveys of each area must not exceed five years. 

&#160; 

Most vessels are also drydocked every 30 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a &#147;recommendation,&#148; which must be rectified by the vessel owner within prescribed time limits. 

&#160; 

Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as &#147;in class&#148; by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (&#147;IACS&#148;). In December 2013, the IACS adopted new harmonized Common Structural Rules, which apply to oil tankers and bulk carriers constructed on or after July 1, 2015. All of our vessels have been certified as being &#147;in class&#148; by ABS, DNVGL or Lloyd&#146;s. All new and secondhand vessels that we purchase must be certified prior to their delivery under our standard agreements. 

&#160; 

SEASONALITY 

&#160; 

We operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in demand and, as a result, charter rates. We seek to mitigate the risk of these seasonal variations by entering into long-term time charters for our vessels, where possible. However, this seasonality may result in quarter-to-quarter volatility in our operating results, depending on when we enter into our time charters or if our vessels trade on the spot market. The drybulk sector is typically stronger in the fall and winter months in anticipation of increased consumption of coal and raw materials in the northern hemisphere during the winter months. As a result, our revenues could be weaker during the fiscal quarters ended June 30 and September 30, and conversely, our revenues could be stronger during the quarters ended December 31 and March 31. 

&#160; 

&#160;
