 Item 1. 

Business 

Provident Financial Services, Inc. 

The Company is a Delaware corporation which became the holding company for The Provident Bank (the &#8220;Bank&#8221;) on January 15, 2003, following the completion of the conversion of the Bank to a New Jersey-chartered capital stock savings bank. On January 15, 2003, the Company issued an aggregate of 59,618,300 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share in a subscription offering, and contributed $4.8 million in cash and 1,920,000 shares of its common stock to The Provident Bank Foundation, a charitable foundation established by the Bank. As a result of the conversion and related stock offering, the Company raised $567.2 million in net proceeds, of which $293.2 million was utilized to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of the Bank. The Company owns all of the outstanding common stock of the Bank, and as such, is a bank holding company subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. 

On April 1, 2015, Beacon Trust Company ("Beacon"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank, completed its acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of The MDE Group, Inc. and the equity interests of Acertus Capital Management, LLC (together "MDE"), both Morristown, New Jersey-based registered investment advisory firms that manage assets for affluent and high net-worth clients. MDE was acquired with both cash and contingent consideration. The Company recognized goodwill of $18.3 million and a customer relationship intangible of $7.0 million related to the acquisition. The Company recognized a contingent consideration liability at its fair value of $338,000. The contingent consideration arrangement requires the Company to pay additional cash consideration to MDE&#8217;s former stakeholders four years after the closing of the acquisition if certain revenue targets are met. The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The acquisition agreement limits the total payment to a maximum of $12.5 million, to be determined based on actual future results. 

On October 31, 2014, Beacon acquired the fiduciary account relationships of Suffolk County National Bank, a subsidiary of Suffolk Bancorp, in Suffolk County, New York. 

On May 30, 2014, the Company completed its acquisition of Team Capital Bank ("Team Capital"), which, after purchase accounting adjustments, added $964.0 million to total assets, $631.2 million to loans, and $769.9 million to deposits. Total consideration paid for Team Capital was $115.1 million: $31.6 million in cash and 4.9 million shares of common stock valued at $83.5 million on the acquisition date. Team Capital was merged with and into the Company's subsidiary, The Provident Bank as of the close of business on the date of acquisition. 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company had total assets of $8.91 &#32;billion, loans of $6.54 &#32;billion, total deposits of $5.92 &#32;billion, and total stockholders&#8217; equity of $1.20 &#32;billion. The Company&#8217;s mailing address is 239 Washington Street, Jersey City, New Jersey 07302, and the Company&#8217;s telephone number is (732) 590-9200. 

Capital Management. &#32;The Company paid cash dividends totaling $41.3 &#32;million and repurchased 108,589 shares of its common stock at a cost of $2.0 million in 2015 . At December 31, 2015 , 3.3 million shares were eligible for repurchase under the board 

approved stock repurchase program. The Company and the Bank were &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; at December 31, 2015 &#32;under current regulatory standards.

The Provident Bank 

Established in 1839, the Bank is a New Jersey-chartered capital stock savings bank currently operating 87 full-service branch offices in the New Jersey counties of Hudson, Bergen, Essex, Mercer, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Monmouth, Morris, Ocean, Passaic, Somerset, Union and Warren, as well as in Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania. As a community- and customer-oriented institution, the Bank emphasizes personal service and customer convenience in serving the financial needs of the individuals, families and businesses residing in its primary market areas. The Bank attracts deposits from the general public and businesses primarily in the areas surrounding its banking offices and uses those funds, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, to originate commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, residential mortgage loans, and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in mortgage-backed securities and other permissible investments. 

The following are highlights of The Provident Bank&#8217;s operations: 

Diversified Loan Portfolio. &#32;To improve asset yields and reduce its exposure to interest rate risk, the Bank continues to diversify its loan portfolio and has emphasized the origination of commercial real estate loans, multi-family loans and commercial business loans. These loans generally have adjustable rates or shorter fixed terms and interest rates that are higher than the rates applicable to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. However, these loans generally have a higher risk of loss than one- to four- family residential mortgage loans. 

Asset Quality. &#32;As of December 31, 2015 , non-performing assets were $55.1 &#32;million or 0.62% &#32;of total assets, compared to $59.0 &#32;million or 0.69% &#32;of total assets at December 31, 2014 . The Bank&#8217;s non-performing asset levels continued to decline from higher levels reported in prior years as local and national economic conditions have gradually improved. The Bank continues to focus on conservative underwriting criteria and on active and timely collection efforts. 

Emphasis on Relationship Banking and Core Deposits. &#32;The Bank emphasizes the acquisition and retention of core deposit accounts, consisting of savings and demand deposit accounts, and expanding customer relationships. Core deposit accounts totaled $5.18 &#32;billion at December 31, 2015 , representing 87.5% &#32;of total deposits, compared with $4.97 &#32;billion, or 85.7% &#32;of total deposits at December 31, 2014 . The Bank also focuses on increasing the number of households and businesses served and the number of banking products per customer. 

Non-Interest Income. &#32;The Bank&#8217;s focus on transaction accounts and expanded products and services has enabled the Bank to generate non-interest income. Fees derived from core deposit accounts are a primary source of non-interest income. The Bank also offers investment, wealth and asset management services through its subsidiaries to generate non-interest income. Total non-interest income was $55.2 &#32;million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared with $41.2 &#32;million for the year ended December 31, 2014 , of which fee income was $26.3 &#32;million for the year ended December 31, 2015 , compared with $21.9 &#32;million for the year ended December 31, 2014 . 

Managing Interest Rate Risk. &#32;The Bank manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the origination and retention of adjustable rate and shorter-term loans, and its investments in securities. In addition, the Bank uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Bank making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. At December 31, 2015 , 57.7% of the Bank&#8217;s loan portfolio had a term to maturity of one year or less, or had adjustable interest rates. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank&#8217;s securities portfolio totaled $1.52 billion &#32;and had an expected average life of 4.40 years. to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. 

MARKET AREA 

The Company and the Bank are headquartered in Jersey City, which is located in Hudson County, New Jersey. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank operated a network of 87 full-service banking offices throughout thirteen counties in northern and central New Jersey, as well as in Bucks, Lehigh and Northampton counties in Pennsylvania. The Bank maintains its administrative 

offices in Iselin, New Jersey and satellite loan production offices in Convent Station, Flemington, Paramus, Princeton and West Orange, New Jersey, as well as in Bethlehem and Newtown, Pennsylvania. The Bank&#8217;s lending activities, though concentrated in the communities surrounding its offices, extend predominantly throughout New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. 

The Bank&#8217;s primary market area includes a mix of urban and suburban communities, and has a diversified mix of industries including pharmaceutical, manufacturing companies, network communications, insurance and financial services, healthcare, and retail. According to the U.S. Census Bureau&#8217;s most recent population data, the Bank&#8217;s New Jersey market area has a population of 6.9 million, which was 74.6% of the state&#8217;s total population. The Bank&#8217;s Pennsylvania market area has a population of 1.3 million, which was 10.0% of that state&#8217;s total population. Because of the diversity of industries within the Bank&#8217;s market area and, to a lesser extent, its proximity to the New York City financial markets, the area&#8217;s economy can be significantly affected by changes in national and international economies. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in New Jersey was 5.1% at December 31, 2015 , a decrease from 6.2% at December 31, 2014 . The unemployment rate in Pennsylvania remained unchanged at 4.8% for December 31, 2015 , compared to December 31, 2014 . 

Within its primary market areas in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, the Bank had an approximate 2.13% and 0.85% share of bank deposits as of June 30, 2015, respectively, the latest date for which statistics are available. On a statewide basis, the Bank had an approximate 1.57% deposit share of the New Jersey market and an approximate 0.07% deposit share of the Pennsylvania market. 

COMPETITION 

The Bank faces intense competition in originating and retaining loans and attracting deposits. The northern and central New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania market areas have a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks, credit unions, investment brokerage firms and insurance companies. The Bank faces direct competition for loans from each of these institutions as well as from mortgage companies and other loan origination firms operating in its market area. The Bank&#8217;s most direct competition for deposits has come from several commercial banks and savings banks in its market area. Certain of these banks have substantially greater financial resources than the Bank. In addition, the Bank faces significant competition for deposits from the mutual fund and investment advisory industries and from investors&#8217; direct purchases of short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities. 

The Bank competes in this environment by maintaining a diversified product line, including mutual funds, annuities and other investment services made available through its investment subsidiaries. Relationships with customers are built and maintained through the Bank&#8217;s branch network, its deployment of branch ATMs, and its mobile, telephone and web-based banking services. 

LENDING ACTIVITIES 

The Bank originates commercial real estate loans, commercial business loans, fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans collateralized by one- to four-family residential real estate and other consumer loans, for borrowers generally located within its primary market area. 

Residential mortgage loans are primarily underwritten to standards that allow the sale of the loans to the secondary markets, primarily to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&#8220;FHLMC&#8221; or &#8220;Freddie Mac&#8221;), the Federal National Mortgage Association (&#8220;FNMA&#8221; or &#8220;Fannie Mae&#8221;) and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ("FHLBNY"). To manage interest rate risk, the Bank generally sells fixed-rate residential mortgages that it originates with terms greater than 15 years. The Bank commonly retains biweekly payment fixed-rate residential mortgage loans with a maturity of 30 years or less and a majority of the originated adjustable rate mortgages for its portfolio. 

The Bank originates commercial real estate loans that are secured by income-producing properties such as multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings, and retail and industrial properties. Generally, these loans have maturities of either 5 or 10 years. For loans greater than $5.0 million originated with maturities in excess of 7 years, the Bank generally requires loan-level interest rate swaps. 

The Bank has historically provided construction loans for both single family and condominium projects intended for sale and commercial projects, including residential for rent projects, that will be retained as investments by the borrower. The Bank underwrites most construction loans for a term of three years or less. The majority of these loans are underwritten on a floating rate basis. The Bank recognizes that there is higher risk in construction lending than permanent lending. As such, the Bank takes certain precautions to mitigate this risk, including the retention of an outside engineering firm to perform plan and cost reviews and to review all construction advances made against work in place and a limitation on how and when loan proceeds are advanced. In most cases, for the single family and condominium projects, the Bank limits its exposure against houses or units that are not under contract. Similarly, commercial construction loans usually have commitments for significant pre-leasing, or funds are held 

back until the leases are finalized. Funding requirements and loan structure for residential for-rent projects vary depending on whether such projects are vertical or horizontal construction. 

The Bank originates consumer loans that are secured, in most cases, by a borrower&#8217;s assets. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit that are secured by a first or second mortgage lien on the borrower&#8217;s residence comprise the largest category of the Bank&#8217;s consumer loan portfolio. 

Commercial loans are made to businesses of varying size and type within the Bank&#8217;s market. The Bank lends to established businesses, and the loans are generally secured by business assets such as equipment, receivables, inventory, real estate or marketable securities. On a limited basis, the Bank makes unsecured commercial loans. Most commercial lines of credit are made on a floating interest rate basis and most term loans are made on a fixed interest rate basis, usually with terms of five years or less. 

Loan Portfolio Composition. &#32;Set forth below is selected information concerning the composition of the loan portfolio by type, including Purchased Credit Impaired ("PCI") loans, (after deductions for deferred fees and costs, unearned discounts and premiums and allowances for losses) at the dates indicated.

Residential Mortgage Loans . &#32;The Bank originates residential mortgage loans secured by first mortgages on one- to four-family residences, generally located in the State of New Jersey and the eastern part of Pennsylvania. The Bank originates residential mortgages primarily through commissioned mortgage representatives and through the Internet. The Bank originates both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. As of December 31, 2015 , $1.26 &#32;billion or 19.4 % of the total portfolio consisted of residential real estate loans. Of the one- to four-family loans at that date, 62.7% were fixed-rate and 37.3% were adjustable-rate loans. 

The Bank originates fixed-rate fully amortizing residential mortgage loans with the principal and interest due each month, that typically have maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. The Bank also originates fixed-rate residential mortgage loans with maturities of 10, 15, 20 and 30 years that require the payment of principal and interest on a biweekly basis. Fixed-rate jumbo residential mortgage loans (loans over the maximum that one of the government-sponsored agencies will purchase) are originated with maturities of up to 30 years. The Bank currently offers adjustable-rate mortgage loans with a fixed-rate period of 5, 7 or 10 years prior to the first annual interest rate adjustment. The standard adjustment formula is the one-year constant maturity Treasury rate plus 2.75%, adjusting annually after its first re-set period, with a 2% maximum annual adjustment and a 6% maximum adjustment over the life of the loan. 

Residential mortgage loans are primarily underwritten to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae standards. The Bank&#8217;s standard maximum loan to value ratio is 80%. However, working through mortgage insurance companies, the Bank underwrites loans for sale to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae programs that will finance up to 95% of the value of the residence. Generally all fixed-rate loans with terms of 20 years or more are sold into the secondary market with servicing rights retained. Fixed-rate residential mortgage loans retained in the Bank&#8217;s portfolio generally include loans with a term of 15 years or less and biweekly payment residential mortgage loans with a term of 30 years or less. The Bank retains the majority of the originated adjustable-rate mortgages for its portfolio. 

Loans are sold without recourse, generally with servicing rights retained by the Bank. The percentage of loans sold into the secondary market will vary depending upon interest rates and the Bank&#8217;s strategies for reducing exposure to interest rate risk. In 2015 , $3.9 million or 3.3% of residential real estate loans originated were sold into the secondary market. All of the loans sold in 2015 &#32;were long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. 

The retention of adjustable-rate mortgages, as opposed to longer-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans, helps reduce the Bank&#8217;s exposure to interest rate risk. However, adjustable-rate mortgages generally pose credit risks different from the credit risks inherent in fixed-rate loans primarily because as interest rates rise, the underlying debt service payments of the borrowers rise, thereby increasing the potential for default. The Bank believes that these credit risks, which have not had a material adverse effect on the Bank to date, generally are less onerous than the interest rate risk associated with holding 20- and 30-year fixed-rate loans in its loan portfolio. 

For many years, the Bank has offered discounted rates on residential mortgage loans to low- to moderate-income individuals. Loans originated in this category over the last five years have totaled $21.8 million. The Bank also offers a special rate program for first-time homebuyers under which originations have totaled over $7.6 million for the past five years. The Bank does not originate or purchase sub-prime or option ARM loans. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans. &#32;The Bank originates loans secured by mortgages on various commercial income producing properties, including multi-family apartment buildings, office buildings and retail and industrial properties. Commercial real estate loans were 26.5 % of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 . A substantial majority of the Bank&#8217;s commercial real estate loans are secured by properties located in the State of New Jersey. 

The Bank originates commercial real estate loans with adjustable rates and with fixed interest rates for a period that is generally five to ten years or less, which may adjust after the initial period. Typically these loans are written for maturities of ten years or less and generally have an amortization schedule of 20 or 25 years. As a result, the typical amortization schedule will result in a substantial principal payment upon maturity. The Bank generally underwrites commercial real estate loans to a maximum 75% advance against either the appraised value of the property, or its purchase price (for loans to fund the acquisition of real estate), whichever is less. The Bank generally requires minimum debt service coverage of 1.20 times. There is a potential risk that the borrower may be unable to pay off or refinance the outstanding balance at the loan maturity date. The Bank typically lends to experienced owners or developers who have knowledge and contacts in the commercial real estate market. 

Among the reasons for the Bank&#8217;s continued emphasis on commercial real estate lending is the desire to invest in assets bearing interest rates that are generally higher than interest rates on residential mortgage loans and more sensitive to changes in market interest rates. Commercial real estate loans, however, entail significant additional credit risk as compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment experience on commercial real estate loans secured by income-producing properties is typically dependent on the successful operation of the related real estate project and thus may be more significantly impacted by adverse conditions in the real estate market or in the economy generally. 

The Bank performs more extensive due diligence in underwriting commercial real estate loans than loans secured by owner-occupied one- to four-family residential properties due to the larger loan amounts and the riskier nature of such loans. The Bank assesses and mitigates the risk in several ways, including inspection of all such properties and the review of the overall financial condition of the borrower and guarantors, which may include, for example, the review of the rent rolls and the verification of income. If applicable, a tenant analysis and market analysis are part of the underwriting. Generally, for commercial real estate secured loans in excess of $1.0 million and for all other commercial real estate loans where it is deemed appropriate, the Bank requires environmental professionals to inspect the property and ascertain any potential environmental risks. 

In accordance with regulatory guidelines, the Bank requires a full independent appraisal for commercial real estate properties. The appraiser must be selected from the Bank&#8217;s approved list, or otherwise approved by the Chief Credit Officer in instances such as out-of-state or special use property. The Bank also employs an independent review appraiser to ensure that the appraisal meets the Bank&#8217;s standards. Financial statements are also required annually for review. The Bank&#8217;s policy also requires that a property inspection of commercial mortgages over $2.5 million be completed at least every 18 months, or more frequently when warranted. 

The Bank&#8217;s largest commercial mortgage loan as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was a $27.4 million loan secured by a first mortgage lien on a 378 room, full service hotel and a 422 car parking garage located in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The loan has a risk rating of &#8220;4&#8221; (loans rated 1-4 are deemed to be &#8220;acceptable quality&#8221;&#8212;see discussion of the Bank&#8217;s nine-point risk rating system for loans under &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses&#8221; in the &#8220;Asset Quality&#8221; section) and was performing in accordance with its terms and conditions as of December 31, 2015 . 

Multi-family Loans. &#32;The Bank underwrites loans secured by apartment buildings that have five or more units. The Bank considers multi-family lending a component of the commercial real estate lending portfolio. The underwriting standards and procedures that are used to underwrite commercial real estate loans are used to underwrite multi-family loans, except the loan-to-value ratio shall not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property, the debt-service coverage should be a minimum of 1.15 times and an amortization period of up to 30 years may be used. 

The Bank&#8217;s largest multi-family loan as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was a $41.0 million loan secured by a first lease-hold mortgage lien on a newly renovated 129-unit, six story class A luxury rental apartment building with 12,000 square feet of office/retail space located in Morristown, New Jersey. The project sponsor is one of the largest privately-held real estate owner/developers in the United States, and has extensive experience and a successful track record in the development and management of multi-family projects. The loan has a risk rating of &#8220;3&#8221; (loans rated 1-4 are deemed to be &#8220;acceptable quality&#8221;&#8212;see discussion of the Bank&#8217;s nine-point risk rating system for loans under &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses&#8221; in the &#8220;Asset Quality&#8221; section) and was performing in accordance with its terms and conditions as of December 31, 2015 . 

Construction Loans. &#32;The Bank originates commercial construction loans. Commercial construction lending includes both new construction of residential and commercial real estate projects and the reconstruction of existing structures. 

The Bank&#8217;s commercial construction financing includes projects constructed for investment purposes (rental property), projects for sale (single family/condominiums) and to a lesser extent owner-occupied business properties. To mitigate the speculative nature of construction loans, the Bank generally requires significant pre-leasing on rental properties; requires that a percentage of the for-sale single-family residences or condominiums be under contract to support construction loan advances; and requires other covenants on residential for rent projects depending on whether the project is vertical or horizontal construction. 

The Bank underwrites construction loans for a term of three years or less. The majority of the Bank&#8217;s construction loans are floating-rate loans with a maximum 75% loan-to-value ratio for the completed project. The Bank employs professional engineering firms to assist in the review of construction cost estimates and make site inspections to determine if the work has been completed prior to the advance of funds for the project. 

Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk than commercial real estate or multi-family lending. Repayment of a construction loan is, to a great degree, dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject project and the successful marketing of the sale or lease of the project. Construction delays, slower than anticipated absorption or the financial impairment of the builder may negatively affect the borrower&#8217;s ability to repay the loan. 

For all construction loans, the Bank requires an independent appraisal, which includes information on market rents and/or comparable sales for competing projects. The Bank also obtains personal guarantees and conducts environmental due diligence as appropriate. 

The Bank also employs other means to mitigate the risk of the construction lending process. On commercial construction projects that the developer maintains for rental, the Bank typically holds back funds for tenant improvements until a lease is executed. For single family and condominium financing, the Bank generally requires payment for the release of a unit that exceeds the amount of the loan advance attributable to such unit. 

The Bank&#8217;s largest construction loan at December 31, 2015 &#32;was a $23.8 million loan secured by a first mortgage lien on a 138,600 square foot freezer warehouse which is under construction in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The loan had an outstanding balance of $2.5 million at December 31, 2015 . Construction of the project is approximately 30% complete. The building is 100% pre-leased. The project's sponsors have extensive experience and a successful track record in the development and management of commercial real estate. The loan has a risk rating of &#8220;4&#8221; (loans rated 1-4 are deemed to be &#8220;acceptable quality&#8221;-see discussion of the Bank&#8217;s nine-point risk rating system for loans under &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses&#8221; in the &#8220;Asset Quality&#8221; section) and was performing in accordance with its terms and conditions as of December 31, 2015 . 

Commercial Loans. &#32;The Bank underwrites commercial loans to corporations, partnerships and other businesses. Commercial loans represented 22.1 % of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 . The majority of the Bank&#8217;s commercial loan customers are local businesses with revenues of less than $50.0 million. The Bank primarily offers commercial loans for equipment purchases, lines of credit for working capital purposes, letters of credit, asset-based lines of credit and real estate loans where the borrower is the primary occupant of the property. Most commercial loans are originated on a floating-rate basis and the majority of fixed-rate commercial term loans are fully amortized over a five-year period. Owner-occupied commercial real estate loans are generally underwritten to terms consistent with those utilized for commercial real estate; however, the maximum loan-to-value ratio for owner-occupied commercial real estate loans is 80%. 

The Bank also underwrites Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) guaranteed loans and guaranteed or assisted loans through various state, county and municipal programs. These governmental guarantees are typically used in cases where the borrower requires additional credit support. The Bank has &#8220;Preferred Lender&#8221; status with the SBA, allowing a more streamlined application and approval process. 

The underwriting of a commercial loan is based upon a review of the financial statements of the prospective borrower and guarantors. In most cases the Bank obtains a general lien on accounts receivable and inventory, along with the specific collateral such as real estate or equipment, as appropriate. 

Commercial loans generally bear higher interest rates than mortgage loans, but they also involve a higher risk of default since their repayment is generally dependent on the cash flow of the borrower&#8217;s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment. 

The Bank&#8217;s largest commercial loan as of December 31, 2015 &#32;was a $38.0 million line of credit to a general contracting company specializing in bridge and highway construction with a risk rating of "3" (loans rated 1-4 are deemed &#8220;acceptable quality&#8221;-see discussion of the Bank&#8217;s nine-point risk rating system for loans under &#8220;Allowance for Loan Losses&#8221; in the &#8220;Asset Quality&#8221; section). The line is used primarily for bid bonding and working capital purposes. The Bank sold a participation interest of $10.0 million in the line of credit to another financial institution, which reduced the Bank&#8217;s exposure to $28.0 million. As of December 31, 2015 , the line of credit did not have an outstanding balance. 

Consumer Loans. &#32;The Bank offers a variety of consumer loans on a direct basis to individuals. Consumer loans represented 8.7 % of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 . Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit constituted 93.7% of the consumer loan portfolio and indirect marine loans constituted 3.3% of the consumer loan portfolio as of December 31, 2015 . The remaining 3% of the consumer loan portfolio includes personal loans and unsecured lines of credit, direct auto loans and recreational vehicle loans. 

Interest rates on home equity loans are fixed for a term not to exceed 20 years and the maximum loan amount is $650,000. A portion of the home equity loan portfolio includes &#8220;first lien product loans,&#8221; under which the Bank has offered special rates to borrowers who refinance first mortgage loans on the home equity (first lien) basis. As of December 31, 2015 , there was $282.4 &#32; million of first-lien home equity loans outstanding. The Bank&#8217;s home equity lines are made at floating interest rates and the Bank provides lines of credit of up to $500,000. The approved home equity lines and utilization amounts as of December 31, 2015 &#32;were $506.3 million and $212.8 million, respectively, representing utilization of 42.0%. 

Consumer loans generally entail greater credit risk than residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of home equity loans and lines of credit secured by second lien positions, consumer loans that are unsecured or that are secured by assets that tend to depreciate, such as automobiles, boats and recreational vehicles. Collateral repossessed by the Bank from a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance, and the remaining deficiency may warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent upon the borrower&#8217;s continued financial stability, and which is more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount the Bank can recover on such loans.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. &#32;The Bank&#8217;s Board of Directors approves the Lending Policy on an annual basis as well as on an interim basis as modifications are warranted. The Lending Policy sets the Bank&#8217;s lending authority for each type of loan. The Bank&#8217;s lending officers are assigned dollar authority limits based upon their experience and expertise. All loan approvals require joint lending authority. 

The largest individual lending authority is $10.0 million, which is only available to the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Lending Officer. The authority of the Chief Lending Officer may be increased to $15.0 million for permanent commercial real estate loans when combined with the additional approval of the Chief Credit Officer. Loans in excess of these limits, or which when combined with existing credits of the borrower or related borrowers exceed these limits, are presented to the management Credit Committee for approval. The Credit Committee currently consists of eight senior officers including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Lending Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Credit Officer, and requires a majority vote for credit approval. 

While the Bank discourages loan policy exceptions, from time to time, based upon reasonable business considerations exceptions to the policy may be warranted. The business reason and mitigants for the exception must be noted on the loan approval document. The policy exception requires the approval of the Chief Lending Officer or the Department Manager of the lending department responsible for the underlying loan, if it is within his or her approval authority limit. All other policy exceptions must be approved by the Credit Committee. The Credit Administration Department reports the type and frequency of loan policy 

exceptions to the Credit Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if necessary. 

The Bank has adopted a risk rating system as part of the credit risk assessment of its loan portfolio. The Bank&#8217;s commercial real estate and commercial lending officers are required to assign a risk rating to each loan in their portfolio at origination. When the lender learns of important financial developments, the risk rating is reviewed accordingly. Risk ratings are subject to review by the Credit Administration Department. Similarly, the Credit Committee can adjust a risk rating. Quarterly, management&#8217;s Credit Risk Management Committee meets to review all loans rated a &#8220;watch&#8221; ("5") or worse. In addition, a loan review examination is performed by an independent third party which validates the risk ratings on a sample basis. The Bank requires an annual review be performed for commercial and commercial real estate loans above certain dollar thresholds, depending on loan type, to help determine the appropriate risk ratings. The risk ratings play an important role in the establishment of the loan loss provision and to confirm the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. 

Loans to One Borrower. &#32;The regulatory limit on total loans to any borrower or attributed to any one borrower is 15% of the Bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. As of December 31, 2015 , the regulatory lending limit was $114.8 million. The Bank&#8217;s current internal policy limit on total loans to a borrower or related borrowers that constitute a group exposure is up to $80.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "2" or better, up to $70.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "3", and up to $50.0 million for loans with a risk rating of "4". Maximum group exposure limits may be lower depending on the type of loans involved. The Bank reviews these group exposures on a quarterly basis. The Bank also sets additional limits on size of loans by loan type. 

At December 31, 2015 , the Bank&#8217;s largest group exposure with an individual borrower and its related entities was $81.2 million, consisting of 15 commercial permanent mortgage loans totaling $69.2 million, secured by 10 first mortgage liens and five second mortgage liens on 10 commercial real estate properties located in northern New Jersey with an average risk rating of &#8220;3&#8221;, as well as a $12.0 million acquisition and renovation loan secured by a first mortgage lien on a 135,500 square foot retail shopping center in Little Ferry, New Jersey with a risk rating of "3". As of December 31, 2015, this loan had an outstanding balance of $8.0 million. The borrower, headquartered in New Jersey, is an experienced real estate owner and developer in the state of New Jersey. Management has determined that this exception to the internal group exposure policy limit is manageable and is mitigated by the borrower&#8217;s diverse revenue mix, as well as its reputation and proven successful track record. This lending relationship was approved as an exception to the internal policy limits by the management Credit Committee and reported to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, and conformed to the regulatory limit applicable to the Bank at the time the loan was originated. As of December 31, 2015 , all of the loans in this lending relationship were performing in accordance with their respective terms and conditions. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank had $1.9 billion in loans outstanding to its 50 largest borrowers and their related entities. 

ASSET QUALITY 

General. &#32;One of the Bank&#8217;s key objectives has been and continues to be to maintain a high level of asset quality. In addition to maintaining sound credit standards for new loan originations, the Bank employs proactive collection and workout processes in dealing with delinquent or problem loans. The Bank actively markets properties that it acquires through foreclosure or otherwise in the loan collection process. 

Collection Procedures. &#32;In the case of residential mortgage and consumer loans, the collections personnel in the Bank&#8217;s Asset Recovery Department are responsible for collection activities from the sixteenth day of delinquency. Collection efforts include automated notices of delinquency, telephone calls, letters and other notices to delinquent borrowers. Foreclosure proceedings and other appropriate collection activities such as repossession of collateral are commenced within at least 90 to 120 days after a loan is delinquent provided a plan of repayment to cure the delinquency cannot be reached with the borrower. Periodic inspections of real estate and other collateral are conducted throughout the collection process. The Bank&#8217;s collection procedures for Federal Housing Association (&#8220;FHA&#8221;) and Veteran&#8217;s Administration (&#8220;VA&#8221;) one- to four-family mortgage loans follow the collection guidelines outlined by those agencies. 

Real estate and other assets acquired through foreclosure or in connection with a loan workout are held as foreclosed assets. The Bank carries other real estate owned and other foreclosed assets at the lower of their cost or their fair value less estimated selling costs. The Bank attempts to sell the property at foreclosure sale or as soon as practical after the foreclosure sale through a proactive marketing effort. 

The collection procedures for commercial real estate and commercial loans include sending periodic late notices and letters to a borrower once a loan is past due. The Bank attempts to make direct contact with a borrower once a loan is 16 days past due, usually by telephone. The Chief Lending Officer and Chief Credit Officer review all commercial real estate and commercial loan delinquencies on a weekly basis. Generally, delinquent commercial real estate and commercial loans are transferred to the Asset Recovery Department for further action if the delinquency is not cured within a reasonable period of time, typically 90 days. The 

Chief Lending Officer and Chief Credit Officer have the authority to transfer performing commercial real estate or commercial loans to the Asset Recovery Department if, in their opinion, a credit problem exists or is likely to occur. 

Loans deemed uncollectible are proposed for charge-off on a monthly basis. Any charge-off recommendation of $500,000 or greater is submitted to Executive Management for approval. 

Delinquent Loans and Non-performing Loans and Assets. &#32;The Bank&#8217;s policies require that the Chief Credit Officer continuously monitor the status of the loan portfolios and report to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. These reports include information on impaired loans, delinquent loans, criticized and classified assets, and foreclosed assets. An impaired loan is defined as a non-homogenous loan greater than $1.0 million for which it is probable, based on current information, that the Bank will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings (&#8220;TDRs&#8221;). A loan is deemed to be a TDR when a modification resulting in a concession is made by the Bank in an effort to mitigate potential loss arising from a borrower&#8217;s financial difficulty. Smaller balance homogeneous loans including residential mortgages and other consumer loans are evaluated collectively for impairment and are excluded from the definition of impaired loans, except for TDRs. Impaired loans are individually identified and reviewed to determine that each loan&#8217;s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the related collateral or the present value of the expected future cash flows. As of December 31, 2015 , there were 148 impaired loans totaling $50.9 million, of which 143 loans totaling $43.9 million were TDRs. Included in this total were 122 TDRs to 120 borrowers totaling $26.0 million that were performing in accordance with their restructured terms and which continued to accrue interest at December 31, 2015 . 

Interest income stops accruing on loans when interest or principal payments are 90 days in arrears or earlier when the timely collectability of such interest or principal is doubtful. When the accrual of interest on a loan is stopped, the loan is designated as a non-accrual loan and the outstanding unpaid interest previously credited is reversed. A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist, the loan has been brought current and the borrower demonstrates some period (generally six months) of timely contractual payments. 

Federal and state regulations as well as the Bank&#8217;s policy require the Bank to utilize an internal risk rating system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets. Under this system, the Bank classifies problem and potential problem assets as &#8220;substandard,&#8221; &#8220;doubtful&#8221; or &#8220;loss&#8221; assets. An asset is considered &#8220;substandard&#8221; if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. &#8220;Substandard&#8221; assets include those characterized by the &#8220;distinct possibility&#8221; that the Bank will sustain &#8220;some loss&#8221; if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as &#8220;doubtful&#8221; have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified &#8220;substandard&#8221; with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make &#8220;collection or liquidation in full,&#8221; on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, &#8220;highly questionable and improbable.&#8221; Assets classified as &#8220;loss&#8221; are those considered &#8220;uncollectible&#8221; and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess potential weaknesses, are designated &#8220;special mention.&#8221; 

Management estimates the amount of loan losses for groups of loans by applying quantitative loss factors to loan segments at the risk rating level, and applying qualitative adjustments to each loan segment at the portfolio level. Quantitative loss factors give consideration to historical loss experience by loan type based upon an appropriate look back period and adjusted for a loss emergence period. Qualitative adjustments give consideration to other qualitative or environmental factors such as trends and levels of delinquencies, impaired loans, charge-offs, recoveries and loan volumes, as well as national and local economic trends and conditions. Qualitative adjustments reflect risks in the loan portfolio not captured by the quantitative loss factors and, as such, are evaluated from a risk level perspective relative to the risk levels present over the look back period. The reserves resulting from the application of both of these sets of loss factors are combined to arrive at the allowance for loan losses. When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as &#8220;substandard&#8221; or &#8220;doubtful,&#8221; the Bank may establish a specific allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management. When the Bank classifies one or more assets, or portions thereof, as &#8220;loss,&#8221; the Bank is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of the amount of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. 

The Bank&#8217;s determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of the valuation allowances is subject to review by the FDIC and the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance, each of which can require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. The FDIC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, issued an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses. The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of the board of directors and management for the maintenance of adequate allowances, and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation allowances. Generally, the policy statement reaffirms that institutions should have effective loan review systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; that loans deemed uncollectible are promptly charged off; and that the institution&#8217;s process for determining an adequate level for its valuation allowance is based on a comprehensive, adequately documented, and consistently applied analysis of the 

institution&#8217;s loan and lease portfolio. While management believes that on the basis of information currently available to it, the allowance for loans losses is adequate as of December 31, 2015 , actual losses are dependent upon future events and, as such, further additions to the level of allowances for loan losses may become necessary. 

Loans are classified in accordance with the risk rating system described previously. At December 31, 2015 , $77.8 &#32;million of loans were classified as &#8220;substandard,&#8221; which consisted of $20.7 &#32;million in commercial and multi-family mortgage loans, $38.7 &#32;million in commercial loans, $12.0 &#32;million in residential loans, $2.4 &#32;million in construction loans and $4.1 &#32;million in consumer loans. At that same date, loans classified as &#8220;doubtful&#8221; totaled $8,000 , which consisted of one commercial loan. There were no loans classified as &#8220;loss&#8221; at December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , $113.5 &#32;million of loans were designated &#8220;special mention.&#8221;

Non-Accrual Loans and Non-Performing Assets . The following table sets forth information regarding non-accrual loans and other non-performing assets. At December 31, 2015 , there were 21 TDRs totaling $18.0 million that were classified as non-accrual, compared to 20 non-accrual TDRs which totaled $26.9 million at December 31, 2014 . Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when they become 90 days or more past due or if they have been identified as presenting uncertainty with respect to the collectability of interest or principal.

Non-performing commercial mortgage loans decreased $18.8 &#32;million to $1.3 &#32;million at December 31, 2015 , from $20.0 &#32;million at December 31, 2014 . At December 31, 2015 , the Company held 8 non-performing commercial mortgage loans. The largest non-performing commercial mortgage loan was a $609,000 loan secured by a first mortgage on a mixed-use property located in Franklin Township, New Jersey. The loan is presently in default. There is no contractual commitment to advance additional funds to this borrower. 

Non-performing commercial loans increased $11.5 &#32;million, to $23.9 &#32;million at December 31, 2015 , from $12.3 &#32;million at December 31, 2014 . Non-performing commercial loans at December 31, 2015 &#32;consisted of 27 loans. The largest non-performing commercial loan relationship consisted of four loans to a health and fitness club with total outstanding balances of $6.8 million at December 31, 2015 . All of the loans are secured by liens on a commercial property. The loans are presently in default. 

Non-performing constructions loans amounted to $2.4 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 . Non-performing construction loans consisted of a single loan to a health and fitness club, which combined with four non-performing commercial loans comprises a $9.2 million loan relationship with this borrower. This non-performing construction loan is presently in default. There were no non-performing construction loans at December 31, 2014 . 

Non-performing residential mortgage loans decreased $5.2 &#32;million to $12.0 &#32;million at December 31, 2015 , from $17.2 &#32;million at December 31, 2014 . Gross charge-offs of residential loans were $1.3 &#32;million for the year ended December 31, 2015 . 

At December 31, 2015 , the Company held $10.5 &#32;million of foreclosed assets, compared with $5.1 &#32;million at December 31, 2014 . Foreclosed assets at December 31, 2015 &#32;are carried at fair value based on recent appraisals and valuation estimates, less estimated selling costs. Foreclosed assets consisted of $5.2 million of residential properties, $5.1 million of commercial real estate, and $274,000 of marine vessels at December 31, 2015 . 

Non-performing assets totaled $55.1 &#32;million, or 0.62% &#32;of total assets at December 31, 2015 , compared to $59.0 &#32;million, or 0.69% &#32;of total assets at December 31, 2014 . If the non-accrual loans had performed in accordance with their original terms, interest income would have increased by $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 . The amount of cash basis interest income that was recognized on impaired loans during the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;was not material. 

Allowance for Loan Losses. &#32;The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects an evaluation of the probable losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income. Charge-offs against the allowance for loan losses are taken on loans where it is determined the collection of loan principal is unlikely. Recoveries made on loans that have been charged-off are credited to the allowance for loan losses. 

Management&#8217;s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses includes the review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured. For residential mortgage and consumer loans, this is determined primarily by delinquency and collateral values. For commercial real estate and commercial loans, an extensive review of financial performance, payment history and collateral values is conducted on a quarterly basis. 

As part of the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, each quarter management prepares an analysis that categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type (residential mortgage, commercial mortgage, construction, commercial, etc.) and loan risk rating. 

When assigning a risk rating to a loan, management utilizes the Bank&#8217;s internal nine-point risk rating system. Loans deemed to be &#8220;acceptable quality&#8221; are rated 1 through 4, with a rating of 1 established for loans with minimal risk. Loans that are deemed to be of &#8220;questionable quality&#8221; are rated 5 (watch) or 6 (special mention). Loans with adverse classifications (substandard, doubtful or loss) are rated 7, 8 or 9, respectively. Commercial mortgage, commercial, multi-family and construction loans are rated individually, and each lending officer is responsible for risk rating loans in his or her portfolio. These risk ratings are then reviewed by the department manager and/or the Chief Lending Officer and by the Credit Administration Department. The risk ratings for loans requiring Credit Committee approval are periodically reviewed by the Credit Committee in the credit approval or renewal process. The risk ratings are also confirmed through periodic loan review examinations, which are currently performed by an independent third party. Reports by the independent third party are presented directly to the Audit and Risk Committees of the Board of Directors. 

Each quarter, the lending groups prepare individual Credit Risk Management Reports for the Credit Administration Department. These reports review all commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans that have been determined to involve above-average risk (risk rating of 5 or worse). The Credit Risk Management Reports contain the reason for the risk rating assigned to each loan, status of the loan and any current developments. These reports are submitted to a committee chaired by the Chief Credit Officer. Each loan officer reviews the loan and the corresponding Credit Risk Management Report with the committee and the risk rating is evaluated for appropriateness. 

Management estimates the amount of loan losses for groups of loans by applying quantitative loss factors to loan segments at the risk rating level, and applying qualitative adjustments to each loan segment at the portfolio level. Quantitative loss factors give consideration to historical loss experience by loan type based upon an appropriate look back period and adjusted for a loss emergence period; these factors are evaluated at least annually. The most recent periodic review and recalculation of quantitative loss factors was completed in the third quarter of 2015 using historical loss data through June 30, 2015 and was applied effective September 30, 2015. Qualitative adjustments give consideration to other qualitative or environmental factors such as: 

&#8226; 

levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; 

&#8226; 

levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; 

&#8226; 

trends in volume and terms of loans; 

&#8226; 

effects of any changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; 

&#8226; 

changes in the quality or results of the Bank&#8217;s loan review system; 

&#8226; 

experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; 

&#8226; 

national and local economic trends and conditions; 

&#8226; 

industry conditions; 

&#8226; 

effects of changes in credit concentration; and 

&#8226; 

changes in collateral values. 

Qualitative adjustments reflect risks in the loan portfolio not captured by the quantitative loss factors and, as such, are evaluated from a risk level perspective relative to the risk levels present over the look back period; qualitative adjustments are recalibrated at least annually and evaluated at least quarterly. The range of adjustments to historical loss rates applicable to qualitative factors were updated in the third quarter of 2015 in conjunction with the review and recalculation of quantitative loss factors. The reserves resulting from the application of both of these sets of loss factors are combined to arrive at the general allowance for loan losses. 

The reserve factors applied to each loan risk rating are inherently subjective in nature. Reserve factors are assigned to each of the risk rating categories. This methodology permits adjustments to the allowance for loan losses in the event that, in management&#8217;s judgment, significant conditions impacting the credit quality and collectability of the loan portfolio as of the evaluation date are not otherwise adequately reflected in the analysis. 

The provision for loan losses is established after considering the allowance for loan loss analysis, the amount of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the total loan balance, loan portfolio growth, loan portfolio composition, loan delinquency trends and peer group analysis. As a result of this process, management may establish an unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses. The unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses accounts for the inherent impression of the overall loss estimation process, including the periodic updating of appraisals, commercial loan risk ratings, and economic uncertainty that may not be fully captured in the Bank's loss history or the qualitative factors. 

Management believes the primary risks inherent in the portfolio are a decline in the economy, generally, a decline in real estate market values, rising unemployment or a protracted period of unemployment at elevated levels, increasing vacancy rates in commercial investment properties and possible increases in interest rates in the absence of economic improvement. Any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect borrowers&#8217; ability to repay the loans, resulting in increased delinquencies, loan losses and future levels of provisions. Accordingly, the Company has provided for loan losses at the current level to address the current risk in its loan portfolio. Management considers it important to maintain the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans at an acceptable level given current economic conditions, interest rates and the composition of the portfolio. Management will continue to review the entire loan portfolio to determine the extent, if any, to which further additional loan loss provisions may be deemed necessary. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that represents management&#8217;s best estimate of probable losses related to specifically identified loans as well as probable losses inherent in the remaining loan portfolio. There can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses that may in fact be realized in the future or that additional provisions for loan losses will not be required.

Allocation of Allowance for Loan Losses. &#32;The following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated. This allocation is based on management&#8217;s assessment, as of a given point in time, of the risk characteristics of each of the component parts of the total loan portfolio and is subject to changes as and when the risk factors of each such component part change. The allocation is neither indicative of the specific amounts or the loan categories in which future charge-offs may be taken, nor is it an indicator of future loss trends. The allocation of the allowance to each category does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.

INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES 

General. &#32;The Board of Directors annually approves the Investment Policy for the Bank and the Company. The Chief Financial Officer and the Treasurer are authorized by the Board to implement the Investment Policy and establish investment strategies. Each of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer is authorized to make investment decisions consistent with the Investment Policy. Investment transactions for the Bank are reported to the Board of Directors of the Bank on a monthly basis. 

The Investment Policy is designed to generate a favorable rate of return, consistent with established guidelines for liquidity, safety, duration and diversification, and to complement the lending activities of the Bank. Investment decisions are made in accordance with the policy and are based on credit quality, interest rate risk, balance sheet composition, market expectations, liquidity, income and collateral needs. 

The Investment Policy does not currently permit the purchase of any securities that are below investment grade. 

The investment strategy is to maximize the return on the investment portfolio consistent with the Investment Policy. The investment strategy considers the Bank&#8217;s and the Company&#8217;s interest rate risk position as well as liquidity, loan demand and other factors. Acceptable investment securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, collateralized mortgage obligations (&#8220;CMOs&#8221;), corporate debt obligations, municipal bonds, mortgage-backed securities, commercial paper, mutual funds, bankers&#8217; acceptances and Federal funds. Securities purchased for the investment portfolio require a minimum credit rating of &#8220;A&#8221; by Moody&#8217;s or Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s at the time of purchase. 

Securities in the investment portfolio are classified as held to maturity, available for sale or held for trading. Securities that are classified as held to maturity are securities that the Bank or the Company has the intent and ability to hold until their contractual maturity date and are reported at cost. Securities that are classified as available for sale are reported at fair value. Available for sale securities include U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, U.S. Agency and privately-issued CMOs, corporate debt obligations and equities. Sales of securities may occur from time to time in response to changes in market rates and liquidity needs and to facilitate balance sheet reallocation to effectively manage interest rate risk. At the present time, there are no securities that are classified as held for trading. 

Management conducts a periodic review and evaluation of the securities portfolio to determine if any securities with a market value below book value were other-than-temporarily impaired. If such an impairment were deemed other-than-temporary, management would measure the total credit-related component of the unrealized loss, and the Company would recognize that portion of the loss as a charge to current period earnings. The remaining portion of the unrealized loss would be recognized as an 

adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value of the securities portfolio is significantly affected by changes in interest rates. In general, as interest rates rise, the fair value of fixed-rate securities decreases and as interest rates fall, the fair value of fixed-rate securities increases. The market for non-investment grade, privately issued mortgage-backed securities remains illiquid and prices have not appreciated despite favorable movements in interest rates. The Company evaluates if it has the intent to sell these securities and if it is more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities before the anticipated recovery. 

CMOs are a type of debt security issued by a special-purpose entity that aggregates pools of mortgages and mortgage-related securities and creates different classes of CMO securities with varying maturities and amortization schedules as well as a residual interest with each class possessing different risk characteristics. In contrast to pass-through mortgage-backed securities from which cash flow is received (and prepayment risk is shared) pro rata by all securities holders, the cash flow from the mortgages or mortgage-related securities underlying CMOs is paid in accordance with predetermined priority to investors holding various tranches of such securities or obligations. A particular tranche of CMOs may therefore carry prepayment risk that differs from that of both the underlying collateral and other tranches. Accordingly, CMOs attempt to moderate risks associated with conventional mortgage-related securities resulting from unexpected prepayment activity. In declining interest rate environments, the Bank attempts to purchase CMOs with principal lock-out periods, reducing prepayment risk in the investment portfolio. During rising interest rate periods, the Bank&#8217;s strategy is to purchase CMOs that are receiving principal payments that can be reinvested at higher current yields. Investments in CMOs involve a risk that actual prepayments will differ from those estimated in pricing the security, which may result in adjustments to the net yield on such securities. Additionally, the fair value of such securities may be adversely affected by changes in the market interest rates. Management believes these securities may represent attractive alternatives relative to other investments due to the wide variety of maturity, repayment and interest rate options available. 

At December 31, 2015 , the Bank held $3.7 million in privately-issued CMOs in the investment portfolio. The Bank and the Company do not invest in collateralized debt obligations, mortgage-related securities secured by sub-prime loans, or any preferred equity securities. 

Amortized Cost and Fair Value of Securities. &#32;The following table sets forth certain information regarding the amortized cost and fair values of the Company&#8217;s securities as of the dates indicated.

SOURCES OF FUNDS 

General. &#32;Primary sources of funds consist of principal and interest cash flows received from loans and mortgage-backed securities, contractual maturities on investments, deposits, Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (&#8220;FHLBNY&#8221;) advances and proceeds from sales of loans and investments. These sources of funds are used for lending, investing and general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and common stock repurchases. 

Deposits. &#32;The Bank offers a variety of deposits for retail and business accounts. Deposit products include savings accounts, checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, money market deposit accounts and certificate of deposit accounts at varying interest rates and terms. The Bank also offers IRA and KEOGH accounts. Business customers are offered several checking account and savings plans, cash management services, remote deposit capture services, payroll origination services, escrow account management and business credit cards. The Bank focuses on relationship banking for retail and business customers to enhance the customer experience. Deposit activity is influenced by state and local economic conditions, changes in interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. Deposits are primarily obtained from the areas surrounding the Bank&#8217;s branch locations. To attract and retain deposits, the Bank offers competitive rates, quality customer service and a wide variety of products and services that meet customers&#8217; needs, including online and mobile banking. 

Deposit pricing strategy is monitored monthly by the management Asset/Liability Committee and Pricing Committee. Deposit pricing is set weekly by the Bank&#8217;s Treasury Department. When setting deposit pricing, the Bank considers competitive market rates, FHLBNY advance rates and rates on other sources of funds. Core deposits, defined as savings accounts, interest and non-interest bearing checking accounts and money market deposit accounts represented 87.5% &#32;of total deposits at December 31, 2015 &#32;and 85.7% &#32;of total deposits at December 31, 2014 . As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and December 31, 2014 , time deposits maturing in less than one year amounted to $499.2 &#32;million and $568.5 million , respectively.

Borrowed Funds. &#32;At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had $1.71 &#32;billion of borrowed funds. Borrowed funds consist primarily of FHLBNY advances and repurchase agreements. Repurchase agreements are contracts for the sale of securities owned or borrowed by the Bank, with an agreement to repurchase those securities at an agreed-upon price and date. The Bank uses wholesale repurchase agreements, as well as retail repurchase agreements as an investment vehicle for its commercial sweep checking product. Bank policies limit the use of repurchase agreements to collateral consisting of U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. government agency obligations or mortgage-related securities. 

As a member of the FHLBNY, the Bank is eligible to obtain advances upon the security of the FHLBNY common stock owned and certain residential mortgage loans, provided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met. FHLBNY advances are available pursuant to several credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. 

The following table sets forth the maximum month-end balance and average balance of FHLBNY advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase for the periods indicated.

REGULATION and SUPERVISION 

General 

As a bank holding company controlling the Bank, the Company is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;), and the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA. The Company is also subject to the provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the &#8220;New Jersey Banking Act&#8221;) and the regulations of the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (&#8220;Commissioner&#8221;) under the New Jersey Banking Act applicable to bank holding companies. The Company and the Bank are required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner. The Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner conduct periodic examinations to assess the Company&#8217;s compliance with various regulatory requirements. The Company files certain reports with, and otherwise complies with, the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws and the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. 

The Bank is a New Jersey chartered savings bank, and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;). The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Commissioner as the issuer of its charter, and by the FDIC as its deposit insurer. The Bank files reports with the Commissioner and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition, and it must obtain regulatory approval prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other depository institutions and opening or acquiring branch offices. The Commissioner and the FDIC conduct periodic examinations to assess the Bank&#8217;s compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 

Any change in applicable laws and regulations, whether by the Commissioner, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or through legislation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their operations. 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) made extensive changes in the regulation of depository institutions and their holding companies. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are impacting the Company and the Bank. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has the authority to impose new requirements. However, institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and are subject to the enforcement authority of their principal regulator, although the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has back-up authority to examine and enforce consumer protection laws against all institutions, including those with less than $10 billion in assets. 

The material laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank are summarized below and elsewhere in the Form 10-K. 

New Jersey Banking Regulation 

Activity Powers. &#32;The Bank derives its lending, investment and other activity powers primarily from the applicable provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act and its related regulations. Under these laws and regulations, savings banks, including the Bank, generally may, subject to certain limits, invest in: 

(1) 

real estate mortgages; 

(2) 

consumer and commercial loans; 

(3) 

specific types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies; 

(4) 

certain types of corporate equity securities; and 

(5) 

certain other assets. 

A savings bank may also invest pursuant to a &#8220;leeway&#8221; power that permits investments not otherwise permitted by the New Jersey Banking Act, subject to certain restrictions imposed by the FDIC. &#8220;Leeway&#8221; investments must comply with a number of limitations on the individual and aggregate amounts of &#8220;leeway&#8221; investments. A savings bank may also exercise trust powers upon the approval of the Commissioner. New Jersey savings banks may exercise those powers, rights, benefits or privileges authorized for national banks or out-of-state banks or for federal or out-of-state savings banks or savings associations, provided that before exercising any such power, right, benefit or privilege, prior approval by the Commissioner by regulation or by specific authorization is required. The exercise of these lending, investment and activity powers is limited by federal law and the related regulations. See &#8220;Federal Banking Regulation&#8212;Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Bank&#8221; below. 

Loans-to-One-Borrower Limitations. &#32;With certain specified exceptions, a New Jersey chartered savings bank may not make loans or extend credit to a single borrower and to entities related to the borrower in an aggregate amount that would exceed 15% of the bank&#8217;s capital funds. A New Jersey chartered savings bank may lend an additional 10% of the bank&#8217;s capital funds if secured by collateral meeting the requirements of the New Jersey Banking Act. The Bank currently complies with applicable loans-to-one-borrower limitations. 

Dividends. &#32;Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a stock savings bank may declare and pay a dividend on its capital stock only to the extent that the payment of the dividend would not impair the capital stock of the savings bank. In addition, a stock savings bank may not pay a dividend unless the savings bank would, after the payment of the dividend, have a surplus of not less than 50% of its capital stock, or the payment of the dividend would not reduce the surplus. Federal law may also limit the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank. 

Minimum Capital Requirements. &#32;Regulations of the Commissioner impose on New Jersey chartered depository institutions, including the Bank, minimum capital requirements similar to those imposed by the FDIC on insured state banks. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank was considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under FDIC guidelines. 

Examination and Enforcement. &#32;The New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance may examine the Company and the Bank whenever it deems an examination advisable. The Department examines the Bank at least every two years. The Commissioner may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any director, officer, attorney or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Commissioner has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Commissioner why such person should not be removed. 

Federal Banking Regulation 

Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These capital requirements are the result of a final rule implementing recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, and were effective January 1, 2015. 

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders&#8217; equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution&#8217;s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary. 

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 

The following table shows the Bank&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage ratio, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, at December 31, 2015 :

As of December 31, 2015 , the Bank was considered &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under FDIC guidelines. 

Activity Restrictions on State-Chartered Banks. &#32;Federal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC. 

Before making a new investment or engaging in a new activity that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured bank must seek approval from the FDIC to make such investment or engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the bank meets its minimum capital requirements and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a &#8220;financial subsidiary&#8221; are subject to additional restrictions. 

Federal law permits a state-chartered savings bank to engage, through financial subsidiaries, in any activity in which a national bank may engage through a financial subsidiary and on substantially the same terms and conditions. In general, the law permits a national bank that is well-capitalized and well-managed to conduct, through a financial subsidiary, any activity permitted for a financial holding company other than insurance underwriting, insurance investments, real estate investment or development or merchant banking. The total assets of all such financial subsidiaries may not exceed the lesser of 45% of the bank&#8217;s total assets or $50 billion. The bank must have policies and procedures to assess the financial subsidiary&#8217;s risk and protect the bank from such risk and potential liability, must not consolidate the financial subsidiary&#8217;s assets with the bank&#8217;s and must exclude from its own assets and equity all equity investments, including retained earnings, in the financial subsidiary. The Bank currently meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. &#32;The Bank is a member of the FHLB system which consists of twelve regional FHLBs, each subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (&#8220;FHFA&#8221;). The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the FHLB of New York, the Bank is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount as required by that FHLB&#8217;s capital plan and minimum capital requirements. The Bank is in compliance with these requirements. The Bank has received dividends on its FHLBNY stock, although no assurance can be given that these dividends will continue to be paid. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , dividends paid by the FHLBNY to the Bank totaled $3.1 million. 

Deposit Insurance. &#32;As a member institution of the FDIC, deposit accounts at the Bank are generally insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor. 

Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. The FDIC may adjust the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of its federal deposit insurance assessment. 

The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution&#8217;s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. 

On February 7, 2011, the FDIC issued a final rule that established a target size for the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) at 2 percent of insured deposits as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule also implements a lower assessment rate schedule when the DIF reaches 1.15 percent of total insured deposits. The FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution&#8217;s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank&#8217;s deposit insurance. 

Enforcement. &#32;The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured savings banks, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist orders and to remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of law and to unsafe or unsound practices. 

Transactions with Affiliates. &#32;Transactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulations. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution, financial subsidiary or other entity defined by the regulation generally is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for purposes of Sections 23A and 23B. 

Section 23A: 

&#8226; 

limits the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank&#8217;s capital stock and retained earnings, and limits all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and retained earnings; and 

&#8226; 

requires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 

The term &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amounts. In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate. 

Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. &#32;Banks are subject to statutory prohibitions on certain tying arrangements. A depository institution is prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or that the customer not obtain services of a competitor of the institution. 

Privacy Standards. &#32;FDIC regulations require the Company and the Bank to disclose their privacy policies, including identifying with whom they share &#8220;non-public personal information&#8221; to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. 

The FDIC regulations also require the Company and the Bank to provide their customers with initial and annual notices that accurately reflect their privacy policies and practices. In addition, the Company and the Bank are required to provide their customers with the ability to &#8220;opt-out&#8221; of having the Company and the Bank share their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties before they can disclose such information, subject to certain exceptions. 

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. &#32;All FDIC insured institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a state chartered savings bank, the FDIC is required to assess the institution&#8217;s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. Among other things, the current Community Reinvestment Act regulations rate an institution based upon its actual performance in meeting community needs. In particular, the current evaluation system focuses on three tests: 

&#8226; 

a lending test, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s record of making loans in its service areas; 

&#8226; 

an investment test, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low- or moderate-income individuals and businesses; and 

&#8226; 

a service test, to evaluate the institution&#8217;s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs and other offices. 

An institution&#8217;s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities, including, but not limited to, engaging in acquisitions and mergers. The Bank received an &#8220;Outstanding&#8221; Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed federal examination, which was conducted by the FDIC as of December 2014. 

In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. An institution&#8217;s failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 

Safety and Soundness Standards. &#32;Each federal banking agency, including the FDIC, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal stockholder. 

In addition, FDIC regulations require a bank that is given notice by the FDIC that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the FDIC. If, after being so notified, a bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan, the FDIC may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; provisions discussed below. If a bank fails to comply with such an order, the FDIC may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties. 

Prompt Corrective Action. &#32;Federal law requires the FDIC and the other federal banking regulators to promptly resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. Federal law also establishes five categories, consisting of &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; and &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; The FDIC&#8217;s regulations define the five capital categories as follows: 

An institution will be treated as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; if: 

&#8226; 

its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 10%; 

&#8226; 

its ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 8%; 

&#8226; 

its ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 6.5%; and 

&#8226; 

its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level. 

An institution will be treated as &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; if: 

&#8226; 

its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 8%; or 

&#8226; 

its ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 6%; 

&#8226; 

its ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 4.5%; and 

&#8226; 

its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4% and it is not a well-capitalized institution. 

An institution will be treated as &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; if: 

&#8226; 

its total risk-based capital is less than 8%; or 

&#8226; 

its Tier 1 risk-based-capital is less than 6%; 

&#8226; 

its ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is less than 4.5%; or 

&#8226; 

its leverage ratio is less than 4% 

An institution will be treated as &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; if: 

&#8226; 

its total risk-based capital is less than 6%; 

&#8226; 

its Tier 1 capital is less than 4%; 

&#8226; 

its ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets is less than 3%; or 

&#8226; 

its leverage ratio is less than 3%. 

An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% would be deemed &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state bank if that bank is critically undercapitalized. The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured state bank on the basis of the institution&#8217;s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including: 

&#8226; 

insolvency, or when the assets of the bank are less than its liabilities to depositors and others; 

&#8226; 

substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; 

&#8226; 

existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; 

&#8226; 

likelihood that the bank will be unable to meet the demands of its depositors or to pay its obligations in the normal course of business; and 

&#8226; 

insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will substantially deplete all of the institution&#8217;s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without federal assistance. 

The previously discussed final rule that increased capital requirements effective January 1, 2015 adjusted the prompt action categories as reflected above. 

Loans to a Bank&#8217;s Insiders 

Federal Regulation. &#32;A bank&#8217;s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of 10% or more of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider&#8217;s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Regulation O. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider&#8217;s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks, which is comparable to the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to loans by the Bank. All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders&#8217; related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer&#8217;s children and certain loans secured by the officer&#8217;s residence may not exceed at any one time the higher of 2.5% of the bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus or $25,000, but in no event more than $100,000. Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested directors not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider&#8217;s related interests, would exceed either (1) $500,000; or (2) the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank&#8217;s unimpaired capital and surplus. 

Generally, loans to insiders must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for, comparable transactions with other persons, and not involve more than the normal risk of payment or present other unfavorable features. An exception may be made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank. 

In addition, federal law prohibits extensions of credit to a bank&#8217;s insiders and their related interests by any other institution that has a correspondent banking relationship with the bank, unless such extension of credit is on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and does not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. 

The Bank does not, as a matter of policy, make loans to its directors or to their immediate family members and related interests. 

New Jersey Regulation. &#32;Provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act impose conditions and limitations on the liabilities owed to a savings bank by its directors and executive officers and by corporations and partnerships controlled by such persons that are comparable in many respects to the conditions and limitations imposed on the loans and extensions of credit to insiders and their related interests under Regulation O, as discussed above. The New Jersey Banking Act also provides that a savings bank that is in compliance with Regulation O is deemed to be in compliance with such provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act. 

Federal Reserve System 

Under Federal Reserve Board regulations, the Bank is required to maintain non-interest earning reserves against its transaction accounts. The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves of 3% must be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts over $15.2 million and up to $110.2 million, and 10% against that portion of total transaction accounts in excess of up to $110.2 million. The first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempted from the reserve requirements. The Bank is in compliance with these requirements. These requirements are adjusted annually by the Federal Reserve Board. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank or a pass-through account as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce the Bank&#8217;s interest-earning assets. The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank discount window. 

Internet Banking 

Technological developments continue to significantly alter the ways in which financial institutions conduct their business. The growth of the Internet has caused banks to adopt and refine alternative distribution and marketing systems. The federal bank regulatory agencies have targeted various aspects of internet banking, including the security and systems. There can be no assurance that the bank regulatory agencies will adopt new regulations that will not materially affect the Bank&#8217;s Internet operations or restrict any such further operations. 

The USA PATRIOT Act 

The USA PATRIOT Act gives the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act included measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III imposed affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 

The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with these requirements. In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies must consider the effectiveness of financial institutions engaging in a merger transaction in combating money laundering activities. The Bank has adopted policies and procedures which are in compliance with these requirements. 

Holding Company Regulation 

Federal Regulation. &#32;The Company is regulated as a bank holding company, and as such, is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis. 

The Dodd-Frank Act directed the Federal Reserve Board to issue consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are not less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to 

institutions themselves. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implemented the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks applied to bank holding companies (with greater than $1 billion of assets) as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 2016 and 2019. As of December 31, 2015 , the Company&#8217;s regulatory capital ratios exceed these minimum capital requirements. 

The following table shows the Company&#8217;s Tier 1 leverage capital ratio, common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and the total risk-based capital ratio as of December 31, 2015

For purposes of calculating regulatory Tier 1 leverage capital, assets are based on adjusted total leverage assets. In calculating common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital, assets are based on total risk-weighted assets. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Company was &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under Federal Reserve Board guidelines. 

Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner. Federal Reserve Board policies generally provide that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention in the holding company appears consistent with the organization&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Federal Reserve Board guidance sets forth the supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with Federal Reserve Board staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the Federal Reserve Board and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company&#8217;s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Under the prompt corrective action provisions discussed above, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank would be directed to guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of such an undercapitalized bank. If the undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividends or making any other form of capital distribution without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. 

As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval will be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after giving effect to such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank or bank holding company. 

A bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months will be equal to 10% or more of the company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that would be treated as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, is well-managed, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. 

In addition, a bank holding company which does not opt to become a financial holding company under applicable federal law is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring direct or indirect control of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be permissible. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking as to be permissible are: 

&#8226; 

making or servicing loans; 

&#8226; 

performing certain data processing services; 

&#8226; 

providing discount brokerage services; or acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; 

&#8226; 

leasing personal or real property; 

&#8226; 

making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and 

&#8226; 

acquiring a savings and loan association. 

Bank holding companies that qualify and opt to become a financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident to activities which are financial in nature. Financial holding companies may engage in a broader array of activities including insurance and investment banking. The Company filed an election to qualify as a financial holding company under federal regulations on January 31, 2014 which was deemed effective by the Federal Reserve Board on March 5, 2015. 

Bank holding companies may qualify to become a financial holding company if at the time of the election and on a continuing basis: 

&#8226; 

each of its depository institution subsidiaries is &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;; 

&#8226; 

each of its depository institution subsidiaries is &#8220;well managed&#8221;; and 

&#8226; 

each of its depository institution subsidiaries has at least a &#8220;Satisfactory&#8221; Community Reinvestment Act rating at its most recent examination. 

Under federal law, depository institutions are liable to the FDIC for losses suffered or anticipated by the FDIC in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the FDIC to such an institution in danger of default. This law would potentially be applicable to the Company if it ever acquired as a separate subsidiary, a depository institution in addition to the Bank. 

New Jersey Regulation. &#32;Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a savings bank is regulated as a bank holding company. The New Jersey Banking Act defines the terms &#8220;company&#8221; and &#8220;bank holding company&#8221; as such terms are defined under the BHCA. Each bank holding company controlling a New Jersey chartered bank or savings bank must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner. 

Acquisition of Control. &#32;Under federal law and under the New Jersey Banking Act, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control from the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner. 

Federal Securities Laws. &#32;The Company&#8217;s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 

Investment Adviser Regulation 

Each of Beacon Investment Advisory Services, Inc. and Acertus Capital Management, LLC are investment advisers registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As such, they are required to make certain filings with and are subject to periodic examination by, the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Delaware Corporation Law 

The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. As a result, the rights of its stockholders are governed by the Delaware General Corporate Law and the Company&#8217;s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. 

TAXATION 

Federal Taxation 

General. &#32;The Company is subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company. 

Method of Accounting. &#32;For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns. 

Bad Debt Reserves. &#32;Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996 (the &#8220;1996 Act&#8221;), the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at taxable income. The Bank was required to use the direct charge-off method to compute its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal income tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve). 

Taxable Distributions and Recapture. &#32;Prior to the 1996 Act, bad debt reserves created prior to January 1, 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income should the Bank fail to meet certain asset and definitional tests. Federal legislation has eliminated these recapture rules. Retained earnings at December 31, 2015 &#32;included approximately $51.8 million for which no provisions for income tax had been made. This amount represents an allocation of income to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only. Events that would result in taxation of these reserves include failure to qualify as a bank for tax purposes, distributions in complete or partial liquidation, stock redemptions and excess distributions to shareholders. At December 31, 2015 , the Bank had an unrecognized tax liability of $20.1 million with respect to this reserve. 

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax. &#32;The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT) at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences (alternative minimum taxable income or AMTI). The AMT is payable to the extent such AMTI is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of AMTI. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. The Company has not been subject to the alternative minimum tax and has no such amounts available as credits for carryover. 

Net Operating Loss Carryovers. &#32;Under the general rule, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2015 , the Company had approximately $3,000,000 of Federal Net Operating Losses ("NOLs"). These NOLs were generated by entities the Company acquired in previous years and are subject to an annual Code Section 382 limitation. 

Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction. &#32;The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. 

State Taxation 

New Jersey State Taxation. &#32;The Company and the Bank file New Jersey Corporation Business Tax returns. Generally, the income of financial institutions in New Jersey, which is calculated based on federal taxable income subject to certain adjustments, is subject to New Jersey tax. The Company and the Bank are currently subject to the corporate business tax (&#8220;CBT&#8221;) at 9% of apportioned taxable income. 

New Jersey tax law does not and has not allowed for a taxpayer to file a tax return on a combined or consolidated basis with another member of the affiliated group where there is common ownership. However, if the taxpayer cannot demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the tax filing discloses the true earnings of the taxpayer on its business carried on in the State of New Jersey, the Director of the New Jersey Division of Taxation may, at the director&#8217;s discretion, require the taxpayer to file a consolidated return of the entire operations of the affiliated group or controlled group, including its own operations and income. 

Pennsylvania State Taxation. &#32;As a result of the acquisition of Team Capital in 2014, the Bank is now subject to Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax. Mutual thrift institutions tax is imposed at the rate of 11.5 percent on net taxable income of mutual thrift institutions in Pennsylvania, including savings banks without capital stock, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, and savings institutions having capital stock.
