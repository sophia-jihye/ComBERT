 ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

History of the Company

The Company was initially organized in Utah in 1916 under a name later changed to Onasco Companies, Inc. In 1995, the Company changed its name from Onasco Companies, Inc. by merging into Tengasco, Inc., a Tennessee corporation, formed by the Company solely for this purpose. At the Company&#8217;s Annual Meeting held on June 11, 2011, the stockholders of the Company approved an Agreement and Plan of Merger adopted by the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors which provided for the merger of the Company into a wholly-owned subsidiary formed in Delaware for the purpose of changing the Company&#8217;s state of incorporation from Tennessee to Delaware. The merger became effective on June 12, 2011 and the Company is now a Delaware corporation.

OVERVIEW

&#160;

The Company is in the business of exploration for and production of oil and natural gas. The Company&#8217;s primary area of oil exploration and production is in Kansas. The Company&#8217;s primary area of natural gas production had been the Swan Creek Field in Tennessee. The Company sold all its oil and gas leases and producing assets in Tennessee on August 16, 2013.

The Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Tengasco Pipeline Corporation (&#8220;TPC&#8221;) owned and operated a 65-mile intrastate pipeline which it constructed to transport natural gas from the Company&#8217;s Swan Creek Field to customers in Kingsport, Tennessee. The Company sold all its pipeline-related assets on August 16, 2013.

The Company&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, Manufactured Methane Corporation (&#8220;MMC&#8221;) operates treatment and delivery facilities in Church Hill, Tennessee for the extraction of methane gas from a landfill for eventual sale as natural gas and for the generation of electricity.

General

&#160;

1. The Kansas Properties

The Company&#8217;s operated properties in Kansas are located in central Kansas and as of December 31, 2015 include 180 producing oil wells, 28 shut-in wells, and 39 active disposal wells (the &#8220;Kansas Properties&#8221;). The Company has onsite production management and field personnel working out of the Hays, Kansas office.

The leases for the Kansas Properties provide for a landowner royalty of 12.5%. Some wells are subject to an overriding royalty interest from 0.5% to 9%. The Company maintains a 100% working interest in most of its wells and undrilled acreage in Kansas. The terms for most of the Company&#8217;s newer leases in Kansas are from three to five years.

During 2015, the Company drilled 1 gross well which resulted in a dry hole. All of the Company&#8217;s current reserve value, production, oil and gas revenue, and future development objectives result from the Company&#8217;s ongoing interest in Kansas. By using 3-D seismic evaluation on the Company&#8217;s existing locations, the Company has historically added proven direct offset locations and will continue using 3-D seismic evaluation techniques in the future.

A. Kansas Ten Well Drilling Program

On September 17, 2007, the Company entered into a ten well drilling program with Hoactzin Partners, L.P. (&#8220;Hoactzin&#8221;), consisting of three wildcat wells and seven developmental wells to be drilled on the Company&#8217;s Kansas Properties (the &#8220;Program&#8221;). Peter E. Salas, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company, is the controlling person of Hoactzin and Dolphin Offshore Partners, L.P., the Company&#8217;s largest shareholder. Under the terms of the Program, Hoactzin paid the Company $0.4 million for each producing well and $0.25 million for each dry hole. The terms of the Program also provided that Hoactzin would receive all the working interest in the producing wells, and would pay an initial fee to the Company of 25% of its working interest revenues net of operating expenses, referred to as a management fee. The fee paid to the Company by Hoactzin would increase to 85% of its working interest revenues net of operating expenses when net revenues received by Hoactzin reach an agreed payout point of approximately 1.35 times Hoactzin&#8217;s purchase price (the &#8220;Payout Point&#8221;). The Payout Point was reached effective with production in February 2014, at which time the management fee for the Program increased from 25% to 85%.

In 2015, the wells from the Program produced total gross production of 11.2 MBbl of which the revenues from 8.3 MBbl were net to the Company. During the 4 th quarter of 2015, total gross production from these wells averaged 28 barrels per day, of which the revenues from 21 barrels per day were net to the Company.

The reserve information for the parties&#8217; respective Ten Well Program interests as of December 31, 2015 is indicated in the table below. Reserve reports are obtained annually and estimates related to those reports are updated upon receipt of the report. These calculations were made using commodity prices based on the twelve month arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period January through December 2015 as required by SEC regulations. The table below reflects values realized at a price of $43.98 per barrel which was used in the December 31, 2015 reserve report.

B. Kansas Production

The Company&#8217;s gross oil production in Kansas decreased by 28 MBbl from 186 MBbl in 2014 to 158 MBbl in 2015. This decrease was primarily the result of natural declines and increase in shut-in wells during 2015. The increase in shut-in wells primarily related to cost to repair exceeding future cash flows at current prices, therefore making it uneconomic to bring the well back on until prices increase. The capital projects undertaken by the Company in 2015 were originally funded by borrowings from the Company&#8217;s credit facility, a portion of which was repaid through use of the Company&#8217;s operating cash flows.

2. The Tennessee Properties

In the early 1980&#8217;s Amoco Production Company owned numerous acres of oil and gas leases in the Eastern Overthrust in the Appalachian Basin, including the area now referred to as the Swan Creek Field. In the mid-1980&#8217;s, however, development of this field was cost prohibitive due to a decline in worldwide oil and gas prices and the high cost of constructing a pipeline to deliver gas to the closest market. In July 1995, the Company acquired the Swan Creek leases and began development of the field. In 2001, the Company completed construction of a 65 mile pipeline from the Swan Creek Field to several meter stations in Kingsport, Tennessee.

The Company evaluated in recent years whether continued development would add additional reserves and the likelihood of realizing additional revenues from transportation of third party gas through the Company&#8217;s pipeline assets. The Company determined that current wells would be able to produce the remaining oil and gas reserves and that the Company was unable to attract any additional third party gas without substantial capital investment. As a result, the Company elected to sell its Swan Creek oil and gas assets and its pipeline assets and focus on its oil production from its Kansas Properties.

On March 1, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with Swan Creek Partners LLC to sell all of the Company&#8217;s oil and gas leases and producing assets in Tennessee as well as the Company&#8217;s pipeline assets for $1.5 million. The Company closed this sale on August 16, 2013.

The associated revenues and expenses net of taxes of the Company&#8217;s pipeline assets have been classified as discontinued operations in the Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. As the Swan Creek oil and gas assets represented only a small portion of the Company&#8217;s full cost pool, the associated revenues and expenses were classified in continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.

During 2013, prior to the closing of the sale of the Tennessee oil and gas assets, the Company had 14 producing gas wells and 6 producing oil wells in the Swan Creek Field. Gross gas production volumes from the Swan Creek Field during 2013 until the sale of the properties averaged approximately 226 Mcfd. Gross oil sales volumes from the Swan Creek field during 2013 until the sale of the properties averaged approximately 16.7 BOPD.

3. Manufactured Methane Facilities

On October 24, 2006, the Company signed a twenty-year Landfill Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) with predecessors in interest of Republic Services, Inc. (&#8220;Republic&#8221;). The Company assigned its interest in the Agreement to MMC. The Agreement provided that MMC would purchase the entire naturally produced gas stream being collected at the Carter Valley municipal solid waste landfill owned and operated by Republic in Church Hill, Tennessee and located about two miles from the Company&#8217;s pipeline. The Company&#8217;s pipeline was sold on August 16, 2013. The Company installed a proprietary combination of advanced gas treatment technology to extract the methane component of the purchased gas stream. The Company constructed a pipeline to deliver the extracted methane gas to the Company&#8217;s then existing pipeline (the &#8220;Methane Project&#8221;).

MMC declared startup of commercial operations of the Methane Project on April 1, 2009. The total cost for the Methane Project through startup, including pipeline construction, was approximately $4.5 million.

On August 27, 2009, the Company entered into a five-year fixed price gas sales contract with Atmos Energy Marketing, LLC, (&#8220;AEM&#8221;) in Houston, Texas, a nonregulated unit of Atmos Energy Corporation (NYSE: ATO) for the sale of the methane component of landfill gas produced by MMC at the Carter Valley Landfill. The agreement provided for the sale of up to 600 MMBtu per day. The contract was effective beginning with September 2009 gas production and ended July 31, 2014. The agreed contract price of over $6 per MMBtu was a premium to the then current five-year strip price for natural gas on the NYMEX futures market.

In April 2011, MMC purchased from Parkway Services Group of Lafayette, Louisiana a Caterpillar genset which was delivered in late 2011 and installed at the plant site for generation of electricity. Total cost of the generator including installation and interconnection with the power grid was approximately $1.1 million.

On January 25, 2012, MMC commenced sales of electricity generated at the Carter Valley site. The electricity generated is sold under a ten year firm price contract with Holston Electric Cooperative, Inc., the local distributor, and Tennessee Valley Authority through TVA&#8217;s Generation Partners program. That program accepted generated renewable power up to 999KW; MMC&#8217;s generation equipment is rated at 974 KW to maximize revenues under the favorable electricity pricing under the Generation Partners program. The price provision under this contract pays MMC the current retail price charged monthly to small commercial customers by Holston Electric Cooperative, plus a &#8220;green&#8221; premium of 3 cents per kilowatt hour (KWH). Current price paid to MMC is approximately $.129 per KWH. In December 2013, the contract was extended by agreement between the Company, Holston Electric Cooperative, and TVA for an additional ten years beginning in January 2022 at the current price rate less the three-cent &#8220;green&#8221; premium. A one-eighth royalty on electricity revenues is paid to the landfill owner.

During 2013, the Methane Project was online approximately 29% of the time resulting in gas sales net revenues net of royalty of $117,000 and the electric generation was online approximately 27% of the time resulting in electric sales net revenues of $263,000. The significant downtime during 2013 was primarily a result of consistent high levels of oxygen included in the gas coming from the landfill, causing the equipment to shut down until lower oxygen levels on a consistent basis were achieved. As result of this significant down time, the Company reconfigured the fuel supply, added some additional electric generation related equipment, and began an electric generation only program at the Carter Valley site. The cost of the reconfiguration and addition equipment was approximately $274,000 and was operational in late February 2014. During 2014, the electric generation was online approximately 56% of the time resulting in electric sales net revenues of approximately $524,000. Approximately $518,000 of the 2014 revenues were realized during the period March 2014 through December 2014 during which the electric generation was online approximately 66% of the time. During 2015, the electric generation was online approximately 67% of the time resulting in electric sales net revenues of approximately $533,000.

On September 17, 2007, Hoactzin, simultaneously with subscribing to participate in the Ten Well Program (the &#8220;Program&#8221;), pursuant to a separate agreement with the Company was conveyed a 75% net profits interest in the Methane Project. Because the Payout Point was reached in February 2014 as described above, Hoactzin&#8217;s net profits interest in the Methane Project has decreased to 7.5%. The agreed method of calculation of net profits takes into account specific costs and expenses as well as gross gas revenues for the project. As a result of the startup costs, ongoing operating expenses, and reduced production levels discussed above, no net profits as defined have been realized during the period from the project startup in April, 2009 through December 31, 2015 for payment to Hoactzin under the net profits interest. All payments applied to reaching the Payout Point have been generated from the Program.

4. Management Agreement with Hoactzin

On December 18, 2007, the Company entered into a Management Agreement with Hoactzin to manage on behalf of Hoactzin all of its working interest in certain oil and gas properties owned by Hoactzin and located in the onshore Texas Gulf Coast, and offshore Texas and offshore Louisiana. As part of the consideration for the Company&#8217;s agreement to enter into the Management Agreement, Hoactzin granted to the Company an option to participate in up to a 15% working interest on a dollar for dollar cost basis in any new drilling or workover activities undertaken on Hoactzin&#8217;s managed properties during the term of the Management Agreement. The Management Agreement expired on December 18, 2012. The Company has entered into a transition agreement with Hoactzin whereby the Company will no longer perform operations, but will administratively assist Hoactzin in becoming operator of record of these wells and administratively assist Hoactzin in the transfer of the corresponding bonds from the Company to Hoactzin. This assistance is primarily related to signing the necessary documents to effectuate this transition. Hoactzin and its controlling member are indemnifying the Company for any costs or liabilities incurred by the Company resulting from such assistance, or the fact that the Company is the operator of record on certain of these wells. As of the date of this Report, the Company continues to administratively assist Hoactzin with this transition process. The transition was anticipated to be completed by this time, and the transition agreement provides that the Company may hold Hoactzin&#8217;s drilling programs funds in suspense until the transition process has been completed. As of December 31, 2015, the Company was holding approximately $634,000 of such funds. In January 2016, the Company paid these held funds to Hoactzin.

During the term of the Management Agreement, the Company became the operator of certain properties owned by Hoactzin. The Company obtained from IndemCo, over time, bonds in the face amount of approximately $10.7 million for the purpose of covering plugging and abandonment obligations for Hoactzin&#8217;s operated properties located in federal offshore waters in favor of the BSEE, as well as certain private parties. In connection with the issuance of these bonds the Company signed a Payment and Indemnity Agreement with IndemCo whereby the Company guaranteed payment of any bonding liabilities incurred by IndemCo. Dolphin Direct Equity Partners, LP also signed the Payment and Indemnity Agreement, thereby becoming jointly and severally liable with the Company for the obligations to IndemCo. Dolphin Direct Equity Partners, L.P. is a private equity fund controlled by Peter E. Salas that has a significant economic interest in Hoactzin. Hoactzin had provided $6.6 million in cash to IndemCo as collateral for these potential obligations. As of May 15, 2014, all bonds issued by IndemCo and subject to the Payment and Indemnity Agreement have been released by the BSEE and have been cancelled by IndemCo. Accordingly, the exposure to the Company under any of the now cancelled IndemCo bonds or the indemnity agreement relating to those now cancelled bonds has decreased to zero.

As part of the transition process, Hoactzin secured new bonds from Argonaut Insurance Company to replace the IndemCo bonds. Also as part of the transition to Hoactzin becoming operator of its own properties, right-of-use and easement (&#8220;RUE&#8221;) bonds in the amount of $1.55 million were required by the regulatory process to be issued by Argonaut in the Company&#8217;s name as current operator. Hoactzin is in the process of transferring these RUE bonds from the Company to Hoactzin. Hoactzin and Dolphin Direct signed an indemnity agreement with Argonaut as well as provided the required collateral for the new Argonaut bonds, including 100% cash collateral for the RUE bonds issued in the Company&#8217;s name. The Company is not party to the indemnity agreement with Argonaut and has not provided any collateral for any of the Argonaut bonds issued. When the transfer of the RUE&#8217;s and associated bonds is approved, the transfer of operations to Hoactzin would be complete and the Company&#8217;s involvement in the Hoactzin properties will be ended.

As operator, the Company routinely contracted in its name for goods and services with vendors in connection with its operation of the Hoactzin properties. In practice, Hoactzin directly paid these invoices for goods and services that were contracted in the Company&#8217;s name. During late 2009 and early 2010, Hoactzin undertook several significant operations, for which the Company contracted in the ordinary course. As a result of the operations performed in late 2009 and early 2010, Hoactzin had significant past due balances to several vendors, a portion of which were included on the Company&#8217;s balance sheet. Payables related to these past due and ongoing operations remained outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014 in the amount of $159,000. The Company has recorded the Hoactzin-related payables and the corresponding receivable from Hoactzin as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 in its Consolidated Balance Sheets under &#8220;Accounts payable &#8211; other&#8221; and &#8220;Accounts receivable &#8211; related party&#8221;. The outstanding balance of $159,000 should not increase in the future. However, Hoactzin has not made payments to reduce the $159,000 of past due balances from 2009 and 2010 since the second quarter of 2012. Based on these circumstances, the Company has elected to establish an allowance in the amount of $159,000 for the balances outstanding at December 31, 2015 and 2014. This allowance was recorded in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets under &#8220;Accounts receivable &#8211; related party&#8221;. The resulting balances recorded in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets under &#8220;Accounts receivable &#8211; related party, less allowance for doubtful accounts of $159&#8221; are $0 at December 31, 2015 and 2014.

The Company as designated operator of the Hoactzin properties was administratively issued an &#8220;Incident of Non-Compliance&#8221; by BSEE during the quarter ended September 30, 2012 concerning one of Hoactzin&#8217;s operated properties. This action calls for payment of a civil penalty of $386,000 for failure to provide, upon request, documentation to the BSEE evidencing that certain safety inspections and tests had been conducted in 2011. In the 4th quarter of 2012, the Company filed an administrative appeal with the Interior Board of Land Appeals (&#8220;IBLA&#8221;) of this action in order to attempt to significantly reduce the civil penalty. This appeal required a fully collateralized appeal bond to postpone the payment obligation until the appeal was determined. The Company posted and collateralized this bond with RLI Insurance Company. If the bond was not posted, the appeal would have been administratively denied and the order to the Company as operator to pay the $386,000 penalty would have become final. On June 23, 2014, the IBLA affirmed the civil penalty without reduction. On September 22, 2014, the Company sought judicial review of the June 23, 2014 agency action in the federal district court in the Eastern District of Louisiana at New Orleans. As a result of the determination by the IBLA, the Company recorded a liability of $386,000 in the Company&#8217;s Consolidated Balance Sheets under &#8220;Accrued and other current liabilities&#8221; and an expense in its Consolidated Statements of Operations under &#8220;Production costs and taxes&#8221; for the year ended December 31, 2014. On July 14, 2015, the federal district court in the Eastern District of Louisiana affirmed the determination by the IBLA without reduction. The Company determined that further appeal of the determination was not likely to reduce the penalty and the Company did not further appeal. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company paid the civil penalty affirmed on appeal and statutory interest thereon from funds borrowed under its credit facility. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company received a return of the cash collateral previously provided to RLI Insurance Company. The Company has not advanced any funds to pay any obligations of Hoactzin and no borrowing capability of the Company has been used in connection with its obligations under the Management Agreement, except for those funds used to pay the civil penalty and interest thereon.

During the second quarter of 2015, the Company received from Hoactzin a copy of an internal analysis prepared by Hoactzin setting out certain issues that Hoactzin may consider to form the basis of operational and other claims against the Company primarily under the Management Agreement. This analysis raised issues other than the &#8220;Incident of Non-Compliance&#8221; discussed previously. The Company is discussing this analysis, as well as the civil penalty discussed previously, with Hoactzin in an effort to determine whether there is possibility of a reasonable resolution of some or all of these matters on a negotiated basis.

5. Other Areas of Development

Although focused on development of its current Kansas holdings, the Company will continue to review potential transactions involving producing properties and undeveloped acreage in Kansas and the surrounding states.

Governmental Regulations

The Company is subject to numerous state and federal regulations, environmental and otherwise, that may have a substantial negative effect on its ability to operate at a profit. For a discussion of the risks involved as a result of such regulations, see, &#8220;Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on Business and Costs and Effects of Compliance with Environmental Laws&#8221; hereinafter in this section.

Principal Products or Services and Markets

The principal markets for the Company&#8217;s crude oil are local refining companies. At present, crude oil produced by the Company in Kansas is sold at or near the wells to Coffeyville Resources Refining and Marketing, LLC (&#8220;Coffeyville&#8221;) in Kansas City, Kansas and to CHS McPherson Refinery (&#8220;CHS&#8221;) in McPherson, Kansas. Both Coffeyville and CHS are solely responsible for transportation to their refineries of the oil they purchase. The Company may sell some or all of its production to one or more additional refineries in order to maximize revenues as purchases prices offered by the refineries fluctuate from time to time.

Gas from the Company&#8217;s Methane Facility had been sold at the tailgate of the plant to Atmos Energy Marketing. The contract with Atmos expired in July 2014. Electricity generated at the site is sold to Holston Electric Cooperative. The contract with Holston Electric had a ten year initial commitment and has been extended for an additional ten years as described above. The contract with Holston Electric will expire in January 2032.

Drilling Equipment

The Company does not currently own a drilling rig or any related drilling equipment. The Company obtains drilling services as required from time to time from various drilling contractors in Kansas.

Distribution Methods of Products or Services

Crude oil is normally delivered to refineries in Kansas by tank truck. Natural gas sold from the Company&#8217;s Methane Facility had been distributed and transported by pipeline. Electricity generated at the Company&#8217;s Methane Facility is distributed into the electric grid.

Competitive Business Conditions, Competitive Position in the Industry and Methods of Competition

The Company&#8217;s contemplated oil and gas exploration activities in the State of Kansas will be undertaken in a highly competitive and speculative business atmosphere. In seeking any other suitable oil and gas properties for acquisition, the Company will be competing with a number of other companies, including large oil and gas companies and other independent operators with greater financial resources. Management does not believe that the Company&#8217;s competitive position in the oil and gas industry will be significant as the Company currently exists.

There are numerous producers in the area of the Kansas Properties. Some of these companies are larger than the Company and have greater financial resources. These companies are in competition with the Company for lease positions in the known producing areas in which the Company currently operates, as well as other potential areas of interest.

Although management does not foresee any difficulties in procuring contracted drilling rigs, several factors, including increased competition in the area, may limit the availability of drilling rigs, rig operators and related personnel and/or equipment in the future. Such limitations would have a natural adverse impact on the profitability of the Company&#8217;s operations.

The Company anticipates no difficulty in procuring well drilling permits in any state. The Company generally does not apply for a permit until it is actually ready to commence drilling operations.

The prices of the Company&#8217;s products are controlled by the world oil market and the United States natural gas market. Thus, competitive pricing behaviors are considered unlikely; however, competition in the oil and gas exploration industry exists in the form of competition to acquire the most promising acreage blocks and obtaining the most favorable process for transporting the product.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

Excluding the development of oil and gas reserves and the production of oil and gas, the Company&#8217;s operations are not dependent on the acquisition of any raw materials.

Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers

At present, crude oil from the Kansas Properties is being purchased at the well and trucked by Coffeyville and CHS, which are responsible for transportation of the crude oil purchased. The Company may sell some or all of its production to one or more additional refineries in order to maximize revenues as purchase prices offered by the refineries fluctuate from time to time.

In 2015 and 2014, no gas was produced or sold from the Methane Project. If any gas is produced from the Methane Project in the future, the Company is dependent upon a small number of customers for the sale of gas from the Methane Project. These customers are principally gas marketing companies, utility districts, and industrial customers in the Kingsport area with which the Company may enter into gas sales contracts.

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts, Including Duration

On October 19, 2010, the Company&#8217;s subsidiary MMC was granted United States Patent No. 7,815,713 for Landfill Gas Purification Method and System, pursuant to application filed January 10, 2007. The patent term is for twenty years from filing date plus adjustment period of 595 days due to the length of the review process resulting in grant of the patent. The patent is for the process designed and utilized by MMC at the Carter Valley landfill facility. The patent may result in a competitive advantage to MMC in seeking new projects, and in the receipt of licensing fees for other projects that may be using or wish to use the process in the future. However, the limited number of high Btu projects currently existing and operated by others, the variety of processes available for use in high Btu projects, and the effects of current gas markets and decreasing or inapplicable green energy incentives for such projects in combination cause the materiality of any licensing opportunity presented by the patent to be difficult to determine or estimate, and thus the licensing fees from the patent, if any are received, may not be material to the Company&#8217;s overall results of operations.

Need For Governmental Approval of Principal Products or Services

None of the principal products offered by the Company require governmental approval, although permits are required for drilling oil or gas wells.

Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulations on Business

Exploration and production activities relating to oil and gas leases are subject to numerous environmental laws, rules and regulations. The Federal Clean Water Act requires the Company to construct a fresh water containment barrier between the surface of each drilling site and the underlying water table. This involves the insertion of steel casing into each well, with cement on the outside of the casing. The Company has fully complied with this environmental regulation, the cost of which is approximately $10,000 per well.

As part of the Company&#8217;s purchase of the Kansas Properties, the Company acquired a statewide permit to drill in Kansas. Applications under such permit are applied for and issued within one to two weeks prior to drilling. At the present time, the State of Kansas does not require the posting of a bond either for permitting or to insure that the Company&#8217;s wells are properly plugged when abandoned. All of the wells in the Kansas Properties have all permits required and the Company believes that it is in compliance with the laws of the State of Kansas.

The Company&#8217;s exploration, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. The Company has made and will continue to make expenditures in its efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations. Further, the oil and gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase these costs. These regulations affect the Company&#8217;s operations and limit the quantity of hydrocarbons it may produce and sell. Other regulated matters include marketing, pricing, transportation and valuation of royalty payments. The Company&#8217;s operations are also subject to numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. For example, in May 2014 the Company become subject to regulations under the federal Endangered Species Act relating to the protection of the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species. To avoid stringent penalties for violation of those regulations, the Company entered into a state-operated voluntary agreement avoiding those penalties provided certain protective methods are followed in drilling operations and remediation fees are paid by the Company for any wells determined to be likely to interfere with the habitat of the threatened species. These fees may increase the Company&#8217;s costs to drill in Kansas by approximately $40,000 per well. The Company owns or leases, and has in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used for the exploration and production of oil and gas and these properties and the wastes disposed on these properties may be subject to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and analogous state laws. Under such laws, the Company could be required to remove or remediate previously released wastes or property contamination.

Laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent and, may in some cases, impose &#8220;strict liability&#8221; for environmental damage. Strict liability means that the Company may be held liable for damage without regard to whether it was negligent or otherwise at fault. Environmental laws and regulations may expose the Company to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties.

While management believes that the Company&#8217;s operations are in substantial compliance with existing requirements of governmental bodies, the Company&#8217;s ability to conduct continued operations is subject to satisfying applicable regulatory and permitting controls. The Company&#8217;s current permits and authorizations and ability to get future permits and authorizations may be susceptible, on a going forward basis, to increased scrutiny, greater complexity resulting in increased costs or delays in receiving appropriate authorizations.

The Company maintains an Environmental Response Policy and Emergency Action Response Policy Program. A plan was adopted which provides for the erection of signs at each well containing telephone numbers of the Company&#8217;s office. A list is maintained at the Company&#8217;s office and at the home of key personnel listing phone numbers for fire, police, emergency services and Company employees who will be needed to deal with emergencies.

The foregoing is only a brief summary of some of the existing environmental laws, rules and regulations to which the Company&#8217;s business operations are subject, and there are many others, the effects of which could have an adverse impact on the Company. Future legislation in this area will be enacted and revisions will be made in current laws. No assurance can be given as to the effect these present and future laws, rules and regulations will have on the Company&#8217;s current and future operations.
