 Item 1. Business 

We are a geographically diversified homebuilder with active operations in 13 states within three geographic regions in the United States: the West, East and Southeast. Our homes are designed to appeal to homeowners at different price points across various demographic segments, and are generally offered for sale in advance of their construction. Our objective is to provide our customers with homes that incorporate exceptional value and quality, while seeking to maximize our return on invested capital over the course of a housing cycle. 

Beazer Homes USA, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1993. Our principal executive offices are located at 1000 Abernathy Road, Suite 260, Atlanta, Georgia 30328, and our main telephone number is (770) 829-3700. We also provide information about our company, including active communities, through our Internet website located at www.beazer.com. Information on our website is not a part of this Form 10-K and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference. 

Industry Overview and Current Market Conditions 

The sale and production of new homes has been, and will likely remain, a large industry in the United States for four primary reasons: (1) historical growth in both population and households; (2) demographic patterns that indicate an increased likelihood of home ownership as age and income increase; (3) job creation within geographic markets that necessitate new home construction; and (4) consumer demand for home features that can be more easily provided in a new home than an existing home. 

In any year, the demand for new homes is dependent on a variety of factors, including job growth, changes in population and demographics, the availability and cost of mortgage financing, the supply of new and existing homes and consumer confidence. These factors all fluctuate over time at both a national and a more localized market level. Consumer confidence is perhaps the most important of these variables and is the hardest one to predict accurately because it is a function of, among other things, consumers' views of their employment and income prospects, recent and likely home price trends, localized new and existing home inventory, the level of current and anticipated mortgage interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, valuations in stock and bond markets and other factors. While we believe there are multiple factors that point to further improvement in the homebuilding market in the next several years, such as attractive affordability, rising levels of household formation and continued job growth, there are several risks that could significantly impact our business. These risks include fragile consumer confidence, continued volatility in our domestic and international stock markets and adverse weather conditions, as well as a variety of local market risks where we do business. 

We believe that we are well positioned in key homebuilding markets, and that the underlying fundamentals that drive home purchases are supportive. Solid traffic levels in our new home models and sales centers provide confidence that the homebuilding sales environment will continue to be relatively positive, with occasional fluctuations, particularly in markets in which we operate. 

Long-Term Business Strategy 

Our long-term business strategy is focused on a balance between achieving and surpassing our &#8220;2B-10&#8221; goals and reducing our debt levels, both of which are discussed below. 

&#8220;2B-10&#8221; Plan 

In November 2013, we introduced a multi-year &#8220;2B-10&#8221; plan, which provided a roadmap of revenue and margin metrics to achieve $2 billion in revenue with a 10% Adjusted EBITDA margin. Taken together, reaching &#8220;2B-10&#8221; would result in Adjusted EBITDA of at least $200 million. In November 2015, we refined the specific metrics we expect will lead us to our &#8220;2B-10&#8221; objectives by providing ranges to each metric instead of point estimates as follows: 

&#8226; 

improve and maintain our sales per community per month to a range of 2.8 to 3.2; 

&#8226; 

increase and maintain an active community count between a range of 170 and 175; 

&#8226; 

increase our average selling price (ASP) to a range of $330 thousand to $340 thousand; 

&#8226; 

continue to improve our homebuilding gross margin to be within a range of 21% to 22% (excluding impairments and abandonments and interest amortized to homebuilding cost of sales); and 

&#8226; 

drive cost leverage, as measured by selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue, to a range of 11% to 12%. 

Since we rolled out our &#8220;2B-10&#8221; plan, we have consistently noted that there are a number of paths to achieving our underlying goal of $200 million of EBITDA, and we continue our commitment to reaching these objectives as soon as possible. For a further discussion of our &#8220;2B-10&#8221; plan, refer to our &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations&#8221; in this Form 10-K. 

Underlying our &#8220;2B-10&#8221; plan, we have developed a long-term business strategy that focuses on the following elements in order to provide a wide range of homebuyers with quality homes, while maximizing return on our invested capital over the course of a housing cycle: 

Geographic Diversification in Growth Markets. We compete in a large number of geographic markets across the United States (U.S.) in an attempt to reduce our exposure to any particular regional economy. Within these markets, we build homes in a variety of new home communities. We continually review our selection of markets based on both aggregate demographic information and our own operating results. We use the results of these reviews to re-allocate our investments to those markets where we believe we can maximize our profitability and return on capital. During the second quarter of 2015, this review led us to the decision that we would not continue to invest in new homebuilding assets in New Jersey. 

Diversity of Product Offerings. Our product strategy aims to address the needs of our target buyers. Within each of our markets, we determine the profile of buyers we hope to target and design neighborhoods, product types and individual homes with the specific needs of those buyers in mind. Depending on the market, we attempt to address one or more of the following categories of home buyers: entry-level, move-up or retirement-oriented. Within these buyer groups, we have developed detailed targeted buyer profiles based on demographic and psychographic data, including information about their marital and family status, employment, age, affluence, special interests, media consumption and distance moved. Recognizing that our customers want to choose certain components of their new home, we offer a limited number of free structural options on most homes (&#8220;Choice Plans TM &#8221;), as well as other paid structural options, and utilize design studios in most of our markets that enable our customers to further personalize their home by allowing them to select certain non-structural options such as cabinetry, flooring, fixtures, appliances and wall coverings. 

Differentiated Process. Our sales strategy has three specific tenets: lender choice (&#8220;Mortgage Choices&#8221;), personalization (Choice Plans TM ) and energy efficiency (refer to section entitled &#8220;Differentiating Beazer Homes&#8221; for a further discussion). To address the homebuyers&#8217; perceived challenge of securing a mortgage, we facilitate the process by making available a small number of preferred lenders who offer a comprehensive set of mortgage products, competitive rates and outstanding customer service. In response to consumers&#8217; desire to reflect their personal preferences and lifestyle in their homes, we continue to evolve our floor plans based on market opportunity and demand. We create base plans that meet most homebuyers&#8217; needs, but also give the homebuyer the flexibility to change how the home lives through choices in structural and design options at no additional cost. We engineer our homes for energy-efficiency, resulting in cost savings and comfort. Using the ENERGYSTAR &#174; &#32;standards as our minimum performance criteria, our homes reduce the impact on the environment while decreasing our homebuyers&#8217; annual operating costs. 

Consistent Use of National Brand. Our homebuilding and marketing activities are conducted under the name of Beazer Homes in each of our markets. We believe that the Beazer Homes&#174; trademark has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our homebuilding activities and business. We utilize a single brand name across our markets in order to better leverage our national and local marketing activities. Using a single brand has allowed us to execute successful national marketing campaigns and online marketing practices. 

Operational Scale Efficiencies. Beyond marketing advantages, we attempt to create both national and local scale efficiencies as a result of the size and scope of our operations. On a national basis, we are able to achieve volume purchasing advantages in certain product categories; share best practices in land development and construction, marketing and planning and design among our markets; respond to telephonic and online customer inquiries; and leverage our fixed costs in ways that improve profitability. On a local level, while we are not generally the largest builder within our markets, we do attempt to be a major participant within our selected submarkets and with our targeted buyer profiles. There are further design, construction and cost advantages associated with having strong market positions within particular markets. 

Debt Reduction. We will continue to take steps to further reduce our leverage, reflecting our view that doing so in a strong housing market will create long-term shareholder value. During our fiscal 2016, we established aggressive debt reduction targets, and delevered our balance sheet by nearly $157 million. We will continue to focus on this strategy, and plan to further reduce our debt by at least $100 million through our fiscal 2018. 

Balanced Land Policies. We seek to maximize our return on capital by carefully managing our investment in land, so that our debt reduction targets can be achieved while maintaining and growing our community count. To reduce the risks associated with these investments and to maximize our capital base, we sometimes use options to control land. We may acquire lots from various development and land banking entities pursuant to purchase and option agreements. We generally do not speculate in land that does not have the benefit of entitlements providing basic development rights to the owner. Additionally, we have continued to activate certain parcels of land held for future development so that these assets can begin to generate revenue for the Company. For a further discussion of our land policies, refer to section entitled &#8220;Land Acquisition and Development.&#8221;

Seasonal and Quarterly Variability 

Our homebuilding operating cycle generally reflects higher levels of new home order activity in our second and third fiscal quarters, and increased closings in our third and fourth fiscal quarters. However, during periods of economic downturn in the industry, decreased revenues and closings will typically reduce seasonal patterns. 

Markets and Product Description 

We evaluate a number of factors in determining which geographic markets to enter and remain in, as well as which consumer segments to target with our homebuilding activities. We attempt to anticipate changes in economic and real estate conditions by evaluating statistical information, such as the historical and projected growth of the population; the number of new jobs created or projected to be created; the number of housing starts in previous periods; building lot availability and price; housing inventory; level of competition; and home sale absorption rates. 

We generally seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition in a particular market with respect to customer service, product type, incorporating energy-efficient features into the homes we build and design and construction quality. We maintain the flexibility to alter our product mix within a given market, depending on market conditions. In determining our product mix, we consider demographic trends, demand for a particular type of product, consumer preferences, margins, timing and the economic strength of the market. Although some of our homes are priced at the upper end of the market and we offer a selection of amenities and home customization options, we generally do not build &#8220;custom homes.&#8221; We aim to create efficiencies by using standardized design plans whenever possible. In all of our home offerings, we attempt to maximize customer satisfaction by incorporating quality and energy-efficient materials, distinctive design features, convenient locations and competitive prices. 

Operational Overview 

Corporate Operations 

We perform the following functions at our corporate office to promote standardization and operational excellence: 

&#8226; 

evaluate and select geographic markets; 

&#8226; 

allocate capital resources to particular markets for land acquisitions; 

&#8226; 

maintain and develop relationships with lenders and capital markets to create and maintain access to financial resources; 

&#8226; 

maintain and develop relationships with national product vendors; 

&#8226; 

perform certain accounting, finance, legal, risk and marketing functions to support our field operations; 

&#8226; 

operate and manage information systems and technology support operations; and 

&#8226; 

monitor the operations of our divisions and partners. 

We allocate capital resources necessary for new investments in a manner consistent with our overall business strategy. We will vary our capital allocation based on market conditions, results of operations and other factors. Capital commitments are determined through consultation among selected executive and operational personnel who play an important role in ensuring that new investments are consistent with our strategy. Financial controls are also maintained through the centralization and standardization of accounting and finance activities, policies and procedures. 

Field Operations 

The development and construction of each new home community is managed by our operating divisions, each of which is generally led by a market leader who reports through to our Chief Executive Officer. Within our operating divisions, our field teams are equipped with the skills needed to complete the functions of identifying land acquisition opportunities, land entitlement, land development, home construction, marketing, sales, warranty service and certain purchasing and planning/design functions. However, the accounting and accounts payable functions of our field operations are concentrated in our national accounting center, which we consider to be part of our corporate operations. 

Land Acquisition and Development 

Generally, the land we acquire is purchased only after necessary entitlements have been obtained so that we have the right to begin development or construction as market conditions dictate. The term &#8220;entitlements&#8221; refers to subdivision approvals, development agreements, tentative maps or recorded plats, depending on the jurisdiction in which the land is located. Entitlements generally give a developer the right to obtain building permits upon compliance with conditions that are usually within the developer's control. Although entitlements are ordinarily obtained prior to the purchase of land, we are still required to obtain a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process. In limited circumstances, we will purchase property without all necessary entitlements where we have identified an opportunity to build on such property in a manner consistent with our strategy. 

We select land for development based upon a variety of factors, including: 

&#8226; 

internal and external demographic and marketing studies; 

&#8226; 

suitability for development during the time period of one to five years from the beginning of the development process to the last closing; 

&#8226; 

financial review as to the feasibility of the proposed project, including profit margins and returns on capital employed; 

&#8226; 

the ability to secure governmental approvals and entitlements; 

&#8226; 

environmental and legal due diligence; 

&#8226; 

competition in the area; 

&#8226; 

proximity to local traffic corridors and amenities; and 

&#8226; 

management's judgment of the real estate market and economic trends and our experience in a particular market. 

We generally purchase land or obtain an option to purchase land, which, in either case, requires certain site improvements prior to construction. Where required, we then undertake or, in the case of land under option, the grantor of the option then undertakes, the development activities (through contractual arrangements with local developers, general contractors and/or subcontractors), which include site planning and engineering, as well as constructing road, sewer, water, utilities, drainage and recreational facilities and other amenities. When available in certain markets, we also buy finished lots that are ready for home construction. During our fiscal 2016 &#32;and 2015 , we continued to pursue land acquisition opportunities, spending approximately $184.0 million &#32;and $223.7 million , respectively, for land acquisition and $152.9 million &#32;and $229.6 million , respectively, for land development. 

We strive to develop a design and marketing concept for each of our communities, which includes determination of the size, style and price range of the homes, layout of streets, layout of individual lots and overall community design. The product line offered in a particular new home community depends upon many factors, including the housing generally available in the area, the needs of a particular market and our cost of lots in the new home community. 

Option Contracts 

We acquire certain lots by means of option contracts from various sellers, including land banking entities. Option contracts generally require the payment of a cash deposit or issuance of a letter of credit for the right to acquire lots during a specified period of time at a fixed or variable price. 

Under option contracts, purchase of the underlying properties is contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements by us and the sellers. Our liability under option contracts is generally limited to forfeiture of the non-refundable deposits, letters of credit and other non-refundable amounts incurred, which totaled approximately $80.5 million &#32;as of September 30, 2016 . The total remaining purchase price, net of cash deposits, committed under all land option contracts was $446.4 million &#32;as of September 30, 2016 . 

We expect to exercise, subject to market conditions and seller satisfaction of contract terms, most of our option contracts. Various factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as market conditions, weather conditions and the timing of the completion of development activities, will have a significant impact on the timing of option exercises or whether lot options will be exercised at all.

Investments in Unconsolidated Entities and Marketable Securities 

We participate in a number of joint ventures and other unconsolidated entities in which we have less than a controlling interest. We enter into the majority of these investments with land developers, other homebuilders and financial partners to acquire attractive land positions, to manage our risk profile and to leverage our capital base. The underlying land positions are developed into finished lots for sale to the unconsolidated entity&#8217;s members or other third parties. We account for our interest in unconsolidated entities under the equity method. &#32; 

Our unconsolidated entities periodically obtain secured acquisition and development financing. As of &#32; September 30, 2016 , our unconsolidated entities had borrowings outstanding totaling &#32; $14.7 million . In the past, we and our partners have provided varying levels of guarantees of debt or other obligations for our unconsolidated entities. However, as of September 30, 2016, we had no repayment guarantees outstanding related to the debt of our unconsolidated entities. See Note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further information. &#32; 

Our consolidated balance sheets include investments in unconsolidated entities totaling $10.5 million &#32;and $13.7 million &#32;as of September 30, 2016 &#32;and September 30, 2015 , respectively. &#32; 

During the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2014, the Company acquired shares of American Homes 4 Rent (AMH) in exchange for the Company's interest in a real estate investment trust (REIT). The shares, which represented marketable equity securities with a readily available fair value, were sold in March 2015 at a loss of $1.8 million. 

Construction 

We typically act as the general contractor for the construction of our new home communities. Our project development activities are controlled by our operating divisions, whose employees supervise the construction of each new home community by coordinating the activities of subcontractors and suppliers, subjecting their work to quality and cost controls and ensuring compliance with zoning and building codes. We specify that quality, durable materials be used in the construction of our homes. Our subcontractors follow design plans prepared by architects and engineers who are retained or directly employed by us, and whose designs are geared to the local market. Our home plans are created in a collaborative effort with industry leading architectural firms, allowing us to stay current in our home designs with changing trends, as well as to expand our focus on value engineering without losing design value to our customers. 

Agreements with our subcontractors and materials suppliers are generally entered into after a competitive bidding process during which we obtain information from prospective subcontractors and vendors with respect to their financial condition and ability to perform their agreements with us in accordance with the specifications we provide. Subcontractors typically are retained on a project-by-project basis to complete construction at a fixed price. We do not maintain significant inventories of construction materials, except for materials being utilized for homes under construction. We have numerous suppliers of raw materials and services used in our business, and such materials and services have been, and continue to be, available. However, material prices may fluctuate due to various factors, including demand or supply shortages, which may be beyond the control of us or our vendors. Whenever possible, we enter into regional and national supply contracts with certain of our vendors. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers and subcontractors are good. 

Construction time for our homes depends on the availability of labor, materials and supplies, product type and location. Homes are designed to promote efficient use of space and materials and to minimize construction costs and time. In all of our markets, construction of a home is typically completed within three to six months following commencement of construction. As of September 30, 2016 , excluding models, we had 1,826 &#32;homes at various stages of completion, of which 1,358 &#32;were under contract and included in backlog at such date and 468 &#32;homes ( 178 &#32;were substantially completed and 290 &#32;under construction) were not under a sales contract, either because the construction of the home was begun without a sales contract or because the original sales contract had been canceled (known as &#8220;speculative&#8221; or &#8220;spec&#8221; homes). 

Warranty Program 

We currently provide a limited warranty (ranging from one to two years) covering workmanship and materials per our defined standards of performance. In addition, we provide a limited warranty for up to ten years covering only certain defined structural element failures. For certain homes sold through March 31, 2004 (and in certain markets through July 31, 2004), we self-insured our warranty obligations through our wholly-owned risk retention group. We continue to maintain reserves to cover potential claims on homes covered under this warranty program. Beginning with homes sold on or after April 1, 2004 (August 1, 2004 in certain markets), our warranties have been issued, administered and insured, subject to applicable self-insured retentions, by independent third parties. 

Since we subcontract our homebuilding work to subcontractors whose contracts generally include an indemnity obligation and a requirement that certain minimum insurance requirements be met, including providing us with a certificate of insurance prior to receiving payments for their work, many claims relating to workmanship and materials are the primary responsibility of our subcontractors. 

In addition, we maintain third-party insurance, subject to applicable self-insured retentions, for most construction defects that we encounter in the normal course of business. We believe that our warranty and litigation accruals and third-party insurance are adequate to cover the ultimate resolution of our potential liabilities associated with known and anticipated warranty and construction defect related claims and litigation. Please see &#32; Note 9 of notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for additional information. However, there can be no assurance that the terms and limitations of the limited warranty will be effective against claims made by homebuyers; that we will be able to renew our insurance coverage or renew it at reasonable rates; that we will not be liable for damages, the cost of repairs, and/or the expense of litigation surrounding possible construction defects, soil subsidence or building related claims; or that claims will not arise out of events or circumstances not covered by insurance and/or not subject to effective indemnification agreements with our subcontractors. 

Marketing and Sales 

We make extensive use of digital and traditional marketing vehicles and other promotional activities, including our websites (www.beazer.com and www.beazerenespanol.com), mobile site (m.beazer.com), real estate listing sites, online advertising (including search engine marketing and display advertising), social media, video, brochures, direct marketing and out-of-home advertising (including billboards and signage) located in the immediate areas of our developments, as well as additional activities. In connection with these marketing vehicles, we have registered or applied for registration of trademarks and Internet domain names, including Beazer Homes&#174; and Choice Plans TM , for use in our business. 

Our best practice is to build, decorate, furnish and landscape model homes for each community we build and maintain on-site sales offices. As of September 30, 2016 , we maintained and owned 243 &#32;model homes. We believe that model homes play a particularly important role in our selling efforts, and we are continuously innovating within our model homes to provide a unique, memorable and hands-on experience for our customers (i.e. digital kiosks, interactive site maps/plans, interactive magnetic floor plan boards, signage and more). The selection of interior features is also a principal component of our marketing and sales efforts. 

Our homes are customarily sold through commissioned new home sales counselors (who work from the sales offices located in the model homes used in the community), as well as through independent brokers. Our sales counselors and extended sales team are available to assist prospective homebuyers by providing them with floor plans, price information, tours of model homes, the community's unique selling proposition, detailed explanations of our three differentiators, discussed below, and associated savings opportunities. Sales personnel are trained by us and participate in a structured training program focused on sales techniques, product enhancements, competitive products in the area, construction schedules and Company policies around compliance, which management believes results in a sales force with extensive knowledge of our operating policies and housing products. Our policy also stipulates that sales personnel must be licensed real estate agents where required by law. 

We sometimes use various sales incentives in order to attract homebuyers. The use of incentives depends largely on local economic and competitive market conditions. 

Depending on market conditions, we also at times begin construction on a number of homes for which no signed sales contract exists. This speculative inventory satisfies demand by providing near ready or move in ready homes targeted at relocated personnel, first-time buyers and independent brokers who require a completed home within 60 days. 

Differentiating Beazer Homes 

We know that our buyers have many choices when purchasing a home. To help us become a builder of choice and thereby achieve the operational objectives we have outlined, we have identified the following three strategic pillars that differentiate Beazer's homes from both resale homes and other newly built homes: 

Mortgage Choices &#32;- Most of our buyers need to arrange financing in order to purchase a new home. Unlike many of our major competitors, we do not have an in-house mortgage company. Instead, for every Beazer community, we have identified a group of preferred lenders that provide a comprehensive product portfolio, competitive rates and fees and outstanding customer service. We encourage those lenders to compete for our customers&#8217; business, which is a unique program among national homebuilders and enables our customers to secure the mortgage program that best fits their needs. 

Choice Plans TM - Every family lives in their home differently, which is why we created Choice Plans TM . Choice Plans TM &#32;allow buyers to choose how primary living areas, like the kitchen and master bathroom, are configured at no extra 

cost. Whether our buyers choose an office or an expanded family room, our plans are designed for the way a buyer wants to live. 

Energy Efficiency &#32;- Nearly all newly-built homes afford buyers a substantial reduction in utility bills due to their modern, energy-efficient construction and materials. That's a feature most used homes cannot provide. At Beazer, we go even further by ensuring our homes are built to the latest ENERGY STAR &#174; &#32;standards and providing every buyer with an energy rating for their home, completed by a qualified third-party rating company. Used homes typically have an energy rating (on a scale in which a lower score is better) of 130, while new homes that are built to code typically score around 100. The average new Beazer home has an energy rating of 65. 

Customer Financing 

As previously mentioned, we do not provide mortgage origination services. Unlike many of our peers, we have no ownership interest in any lender, and are able to promote competition among lenders on behalf of our customers. Approximately 92% &#32;of our fiscal 2016 &#32;customers elected to finance their home purchase. 

Competition 

The development and sale of residential properties is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete for residential sales on the basis of a number of interrelated factors, including location, reputation, amenities, design, quality and price with numerous large and small homebuilders, including some homebuilders with nationwide operations and greater financial resources and/or lower costs than us. We also compete for residential sales with individual resales of existing homes and available rental housing. 

We utilize our experience within our geographic markets and the breadth of our product line to vary our regional product offerings to reflect changing market conditions. We strive to respond to market conditions and to capitalize on the opportunities for advantageous land acquisitions in desirable locations. To further strengthen our competitive position, we rely on quality design, construction and service to provide customers with a higher measure of home. 

Government Regulation and Environmental Matters 

In most instances, our land is purchased with entitlements, giving us the right to obtain building permits upon compliance with specified conditions, which generally are within our control. The length of time necessary to obtain such permits and approvals affects the carrying costs of unimproved property acquired for the purpose of development and construction. In addition, the continued effectiveness of permits already granted is subject to factors such as changes in policies, rules and regulations and their interpretation and application. Many governmental authorities have imposed impact fees as a means of defraying the cost of providing certain governmental services to developing areas. To date, these governmental approval processes have not had a material adverse effect on our development activities, and all homebuilders in a given market face the same fees and restrictions. However, there can be no assurance that these and other restrictions will not adversely affect us in the future. 

We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums, &#8220;slow-growth&#8221; or &#8220;no-growth&#8221; initiatives or building permit allocation ordinances, which could be implemented in the future in the markets in which we operate. Substantially all of our land is entitled and, therefore, the moratoriums generally would only adversely affect us if they arose from health, safety and welfare issues such as insufficient water or sewage facilities. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for communities in their jurisdictions. However, these fees are normally established when we receive recorded final maps and building permits. We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. These laws may result in delays, cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas. Our communities in California are especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws, particularly surrounding water usage due to continuing drought conditions within that region. 

In order to provide homes to homebuyers qualifying for Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured or Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgages, we must construct homes in compliance with FHA and VA regulations. These laws and regulations include provisions regarding operating procedures, investments, lending and privacy disclosures and premiums. 

In some states, we are required to be registered as a licensed contractor and comply with applicable rules and regulations. Also, in various states, our new home counselors are required to be licensed real estate agents and to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to real estate agents. 

Failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations, where applicable, could result in loss of licensing and a restriction of our business activities in the applicable jurisdiction. 

Bonds and Other Obligations 

In connection with the development of our communities, we are frequently required to provide letters of credit and performance, maintenance and other bonds in support of our related obligations with respect to such developments. The amount of such obligations outstanding at any time varies in accordance with our pending development activities. In the event any such bonds or letters of credit are drawn upon, we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of such bonds or letters of credit. As of September 30, 2016 , we had approximately $50.3 million &#32;and $207.6 million &#32;of outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds, respectively, primarily related to our obligations to local governments to construct roads and other improvements in various developments. We have an immaterial amount of outstanding letters of credit related to our land option contracts as of September 30, 2016 . 

Employees and Subcontractors 

As of September 30, 2016 , we employed approximately 1,100 persons, of whom 365 &#32;were sales and marketing personnel and 255 &#32;were construction personnel. Although none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, at times certain of the subcontractors engaged by us may be represented by labor unions or may be subject to collective bargaining arrangements. We believe that our relations with our employees and subcontractors are good.
