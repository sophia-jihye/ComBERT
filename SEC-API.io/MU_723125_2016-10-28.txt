Overview 

Micron Technology, Inc., including its consolidated subsidiaries, is a global leader in advanced semiconductor systems. Our broad portfolio of high-performance memory technologies, including DRAM, NAND Flash, and NOR Flash, is the basis for solid-state drives, modules, multi-chip packages, and other system solutions. Our memory solutions enable the world's most innovative computing, consumer, enterprise storage, networking, mobile, embedded, and automotive applications. We market our products through our internal sales force, independent sales representatives, and distributors primarily to original equipment manufacturers and retailers located around the world. We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market and in order to remain competitive we must continuously develop and implement new technologies and decrease manufacturing costs. Our success is largely dependent on market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor products, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development of advanced product and process technologies, and generating a return on R&#38;D investments. 

We obtain products for sale to our customers from our wholly-owned manufacturing facilities and our joint ventures. In recent years, we have increased our manufacturing scale and product diversity through strategic acquisitions and various partnering arrangements. 

We make significant investments to develop the proprietary product and process technologies that are implemented in our worldwide manufacturing facilities and joint ventures. We generally reduce the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through advancements in product and process technologies, such as our leading-edge line-width process technology. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density. To leverage our significant investments in R&#38;D, we have formed, and may continue to form, strategic joint ventures that allow us to share the costs of developing memory product and process technologies with joint venture partners. In addition, from time to time, we also sell and/or license technology to other parties. We continue to pursue additional opportunities to monetize our investment in intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. 

Proposed Acquisition of Inotera 

In the second quarter of 2016, we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in Inotera for 30 New Taiwan dollars per share in cash (equivalent to approximately $0.95 &#32;per share, assuming 31.7 &#32;New Taiwan dollars per U.S. dollar, the exchange rate as of September 1, 2016). As of September 1, 2016, we held a 33% ownership interest in Inotera, Nanya and certain of its affiliates held a 32% ownership interest, and the remaining ownership interest in Inotera was publicly held. Based on the exchange rate as of September 1, 2016, we estimate the aggregate consideration payable for the 67% &#32;of Inotera shares not owned by us would be approximately $4.1 billion . 

On March 29, 2016, the transaction was approved by the shareholders of Inotera, including Nanya and certain of Nanya's affiliates (which approval was provided pursuant to voting and support agreements). Under the voting and support agreements, the parties have further agreed not to transfer any of their Inotera shares so long as the voting and support agreements are in effect. These agreements will terminate automatically upon the termination of the agreement to purchase the Inotera shares. On October 11, 2016, the Inotera board set the date for the closing of the transaction to be December 6, 2016. There can be no assurance that the Inotera transaction will be consummated, which is subject to certain termination rights and various conditions, including but not limited to: 

&#32;1 

&#8226; 

the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals from authorities in Taiwan, which have been received; 

&#8226; 

the consummation and funding of the Term Loan Facility (described below); and 

&#8226; 

unless we determine otherwise, the consummation and funding of the Private Placement (described below). 

Acquisition Financing : &#32;&#32; On October 11, 2016, we and Inotera, as co-borrowers, entered into a single-draw term loan facility (the "Term Loan Facility"), from which proceeds will be used to pay a portion of the acquisition consideration and any related transaction costs and to provide working capital for Inotera. In the second and third quarters of 2016, we entered into agreements with Nanya pursuant to which we have the option to issue a combination of shares of our common stock (the "Micron Shares") and 2.00% convertible senior notes due 2021 (the "2021 Convertible Notes") to Nanya, which is subject to regulatory approvals and various other conditions. 

&#160; 

Term Loan Facility : The Term Loan Facility can be made in a single draw on or prior to July 10, 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, up to a maximum aggregate borrowing amount of 80 billion New Taiwan dollars in cash (equivalent to $2.5 billion). The loan will bear interest at a variable rate equal to the three-month or six-month TAIBOR, at our or Inotera's option, plus a margin of 2.05% per annum, payable monthly in arrears. The loan will mature five years from the date it is made and principal is payable in six equal semi-annual installments, commencing thirty months after such loan is made. 

The Term Loan Facility will be collateralized by certain assets including a real estate mortgage on Inotera's main production facility and site, a chattel mortgage over certain equipment of Inotera, all of the stock of our MSTW subsidiary and the approximately 80% of the stock of Inotera held by MSTW following the consummation of the acquisition. Micron will guarantee all of Inotera's and MSTW's obligations under the Term Loan Facility. 

The Term Loan Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which are customary for financings of this type, including covenants that limit or restrict the ability to create liens in or dispose of collateral securing obligations under the Term Loan Facility, mergers involving MSTW and/or Inotera, loans or guarantees to third parties by Inotera and/or MSTW, and MSTW's distribution of cash dividends (subject to satisfaction of certain financial conditions). The Term Loan Facility also contains financial covenants as follows, which are tested semi-annually: 

&#8226; 

MSTW must maintain a consolidated ratio of total debt to EBITDA not higher than 5.50x in 2017 and 2018; and not higher than 4.50x through 2019 to 2021. 

&#8226; 

MSTW must maintain consolidated tangible net worth of not less than 4 billion New Taiwan dollars (equivalent to $126 million) in 2017 and 2018; not less than 6.5 billion New Taiwan dollars (equivalent to $205 million) in 2019 and 2020; and not less than 12 billion New Taiwan dollars (equivalent to $378 million) in 2021. 

&#8226; 

On a consolidated basis, we must maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA not higher than 3.50x in 2017; not higher than 3.00x in 2018 and 2019; and not higher than 2.50x in 2020 and 2021. 

&#8226; 

On a consolidated basis, we must maintain tangible net worth not less than $9 billion in 2017; not less than $12.5 billion in 2018 and 2019; and not less than $16.5 billion in 2020 and 2021. 

If one or more of the required financial ratios is not maintained at the time the ratios are tested, the interest rate will be increased by 0.25% until such time as the required financial ratios are maintained. In addition, if MSTW fails to maintain a required financial ratio for two consecutive semi-annual periods, such failure will constitute an event of default that could result in all obligations owed under the Term Loan Agreement being accelerated to be immediately due and payable. Our failure to maintain a required consolidated financial ratio will only result in an increase to the applicable interest rate and will not constitute an event of default under the Term Loan Facility. The Term Loan Facility also contains customary events of default. 

Micron Shares : We have the option to issue Micron Shares in an amount up to 31.5 billion &#32;New Taiwan dollars (equivalent to $991 million ) (the "Private Placement"), which would be used to fund a portion of the acquisition consideration. The per-share selling price for the Micron Shares would be equal to the greater of the New Taiwan dollar equivalent of (i) the average of the closing sale price of our common stock during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on and including the 30 th &#32;calendar day prior to the consummation of the Inotera acquisition or (ii) $10.00 . 

2021 Convertible Notes : We have the option to issue 12.6 billion &#32;New Taiwan dollars (equivalent to $396 million ) in 2021 Convertible Notes in lieu of a corresponding value of Micron Shares so long as we also issue Micron Shares to Nanya of at least 6.3 billion &#32;New Taiwan dollars (equivalent to $198 million ) pursuant to the Private Placement. 

&#32;2 

Technology Transfer and License Agreements with Nanya : &#32;&#32; In the second quarter of 2016, we entered into technology transfer and license agreements pursuant to which Nanya has the option to require us to transfer to Nanya certain technology and deliverables related to the next DRAM process node generation (the "1X Process Node") after our 20nm process node and the next DRAM process node generation after the 1X Process Node for Nanya's use. Under the terms of the agreements, Nanya would pay royalties to us for a license to the transferred technology based on revenues from products utilizing the technology, subject to an agreed cap, and we would also receive an equity interest in Nanya upon the achievement of certain milestones. Nanya's option becomes exercisable upon the closing of the Inotera acquisition transaction.

Products 

DRAM 

DRAM products are high-density, low-cost-per-bit, random access memory devices that provide high-speed data storage and retrieval with a variety of performance, pricing, and other characteristics. Sales of DRAM products were 58%, 64%, and 68% of our total net sales in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. 

DDR3 and DDR4 DRAM are standardized, high-density, high-volume, DRAM products, which offer high speed and high bandwidth at a relatively low cost. DDR3 and DDR4 products are primarily targeted at computers, servers, networking devices, communications equipment, consumer electronics, automotive, and industrial applications. In 2016, we offered DDR3 and DDR4 products in 1Gb to 8Gb densities. Sales of DDR4 products increased significantly in 2016 and we expect further increases in 2017 as they replace DDR3 DRAM products in many applications. Sales of DDR3 and DDR4 DRAM products were 31%, 38%, and 40% of our total net sales in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. 

LPDRAM products offer lower power consumption relative to other DRAM products and are used primarily in smartphones, tablets, automotive applications, laptop computers, and other mobile consumer devices that require low power consumption. We offer DDR4, DDR3, DDR2, and DDR versions of LPDRAM. Sales of LPDRAM products were 18%, 18%, and 20% of our total net sales in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. 

We also offer other DRAM products targeted to specialty markets including DDR2 DRAM, DDR DRAM, GDDR5 and GDDR5X DRAM, SDRAM, and RLDRAM. These products are used primarily in networking devices, servers, consumer electronics, communications equipment, computer peripherals, automotive and industrial applications, and computer memory upgrades. We offer HMC products, which are semiconductor memory devices where vertical stacks of DRAM die that are connected using through-silicon-via interconnects are placed above a small, high-speed logic layer. HMC enables ultra-high system performance and is targeted primarily at networking and high performance computing applications. 

&#32;3 

Non-Volatile Memory 

Non-Volatile Memory includes NAND Flash and 3D XPoint&#8482; memory. Through 2016, substantially all of our Non-Volatile Memory sales were from NAND Flash products. NAND Flash products are electrically re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off. NAND Flash sales were 37%, 33%, and 27% of our total net sales in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. NAND Flash is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density, and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memories. Embedded NAND Flash-based storage devices are utilized in smartphones, SSDs, tablets, computers, automotive and industrial applications, networking, and other consumer applications. Removable storage devices, such as USB and Flash memory cards, are used with applications such as PCs, digital still cameras, and smartphones. The market for NAND Flash products has grown rapidly and we expect it to continue to grow due to increased demand for these and other embedded and removable storage devices. 

Our NAND Flash products feature a small cell structure that enables higher densities for demanding applications. We offer high-speed SLC, MLC, and TLC planar NAND Flash products that are compatible with advanced interfaces in 1Gb to 128Gb densities. MLC and TLC products have two and three times, respectively, the bit density of SLC products. In 2016, we began selling commercial volumes of new products featuring our new 3D NAND Flash technology, which stacks layers of data storage cells vertically to create storage devices with three times higher capacity than competing planar NAND Flash technologies. This enables more storage in a smaller space, bringing significant cost savings, low power usage and high performance to a range of mobile consumer devices as well as the most demanding enterprise deployments. We are currently in production of MLC and TLC versions of 3D NAND Flash and we expect 3D NAND to be the majority of our NAND Flash output beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Our current 3D NAND Flash products feature 32 layers and we expect to offer next generation 3D NAND Flash products with 64 layers in 2017. 

We offer client and enterprise SSDs which feature higher performance, reduced-power consumption, and enhanced reliability as compared to typical hard disk drives. Our client SSDs are targeted at notebooks, desktops, workstations, and other consumer applications. Increasingly our SSDs are being utilized in large scale cloud environments. Using our 3D NAND Flash process technology, our SSDs deliver read and write speeds that help improve boot and application load times and deliver higher performance than hard disk drives. Our client SSDs, including our newest line of 3D NAND SSDs, deliver world-class data storage, endurance, power efficiency, reliability, and performance for corporate users and are offered in a 2.5-inch, M.2, SATA, and PCIe NVMe solutions, with densities up to 2 terabytes. Our enterprise SSDs are targeted at server and storage applications and incorporate our Extended Performance and Enhanced Reliability Technology ("XPERT") architecture, which closely incorporates the storage and controller through highly optimized firmware algorithms and hardware enhancements. The end result is a set of market-focused enterprise features that deliver ultra-low latencies, improved data transfer time, power-loss protection, and cost-effectiveness, along with higher capacities and power efficiency. We offer enterprise SSDs with PCIe NVMe, SAS, and SATA interfaces and capacities up to 3.2 terabytes. We expect that demand for both client and enterprise SSDs will continue to increase significantly over the next several years. 

We also offer MCP products, which incorporate our NAND Flash. We offer MCP products that combine NAND Flash with LPDRAM to enable small form-factor solutions that combine storage and execution memory. We also offer managed NAND Flash MCP products including e-MMC, e-MCP, and embedded USB. Our e-MMC products combine NAND Flash with a logic controller that performs media management and Error Code Correction ("ECC"), which provides reduced ECC complexity, better system performance, improved reliability, easy integration, and lower overall system costs. Our e-MCP products combine e-MMC with LPDRAM on the same substrate, which improves overall functionality and performance while simplifying system design. MCP products are used in smartphone, automotive, industrial, and other consumer applications. 

Through our Lexar &#174; &#32;brand, we sell high-performance digital media products and other flash-based storage products through retail and original equipment manufacturer channels. Our digital media products include a variety of flash memory cards and JumpDrive &#174; &#32;products with a range of speeds, capacities, and value-added features. We offer flash memory cards in a variety of speeds and capacities and in all major media formats, including CompactFlash &#174; , Memory Stick &#174; , and Secure Digital ("SD") formats. CompactFlash and Memory Stick products sold by us incorporate our patented controller technology. Other products, including SD memory cards and some JumpDrive products, incorporate third-party controllers. We also manufacture products that are sold under other brand names and resell flash memory products that are purchased from other NAND Flash suppliers. 

In 2015, we introduced 3D XPoint technology, a new category of non-volatile memory. 3D XPoint memory's innovative, transistor-less, cross point architecture creates a three-dimensional checkerboard where memory cells sit at the intersection of word lines and bit lines, allowing the cells to be addressed individually. As a result, data can be written and read in small sizes, leading to fast and efficient read/write processes. We began production of 3D XPoint memory products in 2016 and expect to significantly increase production in 2017. 

&#32;4 

Other 

Other products included primarily NOR Flash, which are electrically re-writeable, semiconductor memory devices that offer fast read times and are used in automotive, industrial, connected home, and consumer applications.

IMFT : &#32;We partner with Intel for the design, development, and manufacture of NAND Flash and 3D XPoint memory products. In connection therewith, we formed the IMFT joint venture with Intel to manufacture NAND Flash and 3D XPoint memory products exclusively for the use of the members. The members share the output of IMFT generally in proportion to their investment. We sell a portion of our products to Intel through IMFT at long-term negotiated prices approximating cost. We generally share with Intel the costs of product design and process development activities for NAND Flash memory and 3D XPoint memory. The IMFT joint venture agreement extends through 2024 and includes certain buy-sell rights. Commencing in January 2016, Intel can put to us, and commencing in January 2019, we can call from Intel, Intel's interest in IMFT, in either case, for an amount equal to the noncontrolling interest balance attributable to Intel at that time. If Intel elects to exercise its put right, we can elect to set the closing date of the transaction to be any time within two years following such election by Intel and can elect to receive financing of the purchase price from Intel for one to two years from the closing date. (See "Part II &#8211; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Equity &#8211; Noncontrolling Interests in Subsidiaries &#8211; IMFT.") 

(2) 

Inotera : &#32;We partner with Nanya for the manufacture of DRAM products by Inotera, a Taiwan DRAM memory company. Effective beginning on January 1, 2016, the price for DRAM products purchased by us is based on a formula that equally shares margin between Inotera and us and has an initial three-year term, followed by a three-year wind-down period. Upon termination of the initial three-year term, the share of Inotera's capacity we would purchase would decline over the wind-down period. In 2016, we entered into agreements to acquire the remaining interest in Inotera. (See "Part II &#8211; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Equity Method Investments &#8211; Inotera" and "Proposed Acquisition of Inotera.") 

(3) 

Tera Probe : &#32;We have an approximate 40% ownership interest in Tera Probe, an entity that provides semiconductor wafer testing and probe services to us and others. 

&#32;5 

Manufacturing 

Our manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. Inotera has a wafer fabrication facility in Taiwan. Nearly all of our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. A significant portion of our semiconductor equipment is generally replaced every five to seven years with increasingly advanced equipment. DRAM, NAND Flash, 3D XPoint memory, and NOR Flash products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technologies and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines. In 2015, we began construction of a significant expansion of our wafer fabrication facilities in Singapore for production of NAND Flash memory and we began utilizing a portion of the facility for production in the second half of 2016. 

Our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex, involving a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test. Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effective deployment of these techniques across multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, number of mask layers, number of fabrication steps, and number of good die produced on each wafer. Other factors that contribute to manufacturing costs are wafer size, cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, and cleanliness of the manufacturing environment. We continuously enhance our production processes, reducing die sizes, and transitioning to higher density products. In the second half of 2016, the majority of our DRAM production was manufactured on our 20nm line-width process technologies. We expect to ramp volume production of 1Xnm process node DRAM in 2017. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we expect a majority of our NAND Flash production to be manufactured using our first generation 3D NAND technology. In 2017, we expect to ramp our second generation 64-layer 3D NAND technology and we expect triple-level-cell to become the majority of our 3D NAND output. 

Wafer fabrication occurs in a highly controlled, clean environment to minimize dust and other yield and quality-limiting contaminants. Despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may need to be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, and dust particles. Success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. In this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. We are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality. 

We test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, perform high temperature burn-in on finished products, and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow. In addition, we use our proprietary AMBYX&#8482; line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor memory die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data, and reducing testing time and cost. We use subcontractors to perform certain testing services. 

We sell semiconductor products in both packaged and unpackaged (i.e. "bare die") forms. Our packaged products include memory modules, SSDs, MCPs, managed NAND, memory cards, USB devices, and HMCs. We assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services where we can reduce costs and minimize our capital investment. We subcontract assembly services for the production of certain memory modules, SSDs, MCPs, memory cards, and USB devices. 

In recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing operations. Although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our overall cost efficiency can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume parts, and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines. 

&#32;6 

Availability of Raw Materials and Use of Service Providers 

Our operations require raw materials that meet exacting standards. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our raw materials; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain raw materials that meet our standards. In some cases, materials are provided by a single supplier. Various factors could reduce the availability and increase the cost of raw materials such as silicon wafers, photomasks, chemicals, gases, photoresist, lead frames, and molding compound. Shortages may occur from time to time in the future. We and our suppliers could be affected by laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, which could increase the cost and limit the supply of our raw materials. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of raw materials. Lead times for the supply of raw materials have been extended in the past. If our supply of raw materials is disrupted or our lead times extended, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. 

Our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. We have made significant investments in supply chain risk monitoring and management to mitigate our risks associated with raw materials and service providers. 

Marketing and Customers 

Market concentrations from 2016 &#32;net sales were approximately as follows: 20% &#32;for compute and graphics (including desktop PCs, notebooks, and workstations); 20% &#32;for mobile; 20% &#32;for SSD and other storage; 15% &#32;for automotive, industrial, medical, and other embedded; and 10% &#32;for server. Sales to Intel, including Non-Volatile Memory through IMFT, were 14% &#32;of our net sales in 2016 , 8% &#32;of our net sales in 2015 , and 8% &#32;of our net sales in 2014 . Sales to Kingston, primarily DRAM, were 7% &#32;of our net sales in 2016 , 11% &#32;of our net sales in 2015 , and 10% &#32;of our net sales in 2014 . 

Our semiconductor memory products are offered under the Micron &#174; , Lexar, Crucial &#174; , SpecTek &#174; , and Elpida &#174; &#32;brand names and private labels. We market our semiconductor memory products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. We sell Lexar-branded NAND Flash memory products primarily through retail channels and our Crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. Our products are also offered through independent sales representatives and distributors. Independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us and are compensated on a commission basis. We make shipments against these orders directly to the customer. Distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. We maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products. Many of our customers require a thorough review or qualification of semiconductor products, which may take several months. 

Backlog 

Because of volatile industry conditions, customers are reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. Accordingly, new order volumes for our semiconductor products fluctuate significantly. We typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the date of shipment. For these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period. 

Product Warranty 

Because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with customer specifications, contain defects, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. In accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products are in compliance with our specifications existing at the time of delivery. Under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. Under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions. 

&#32;7 

Competition 

We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory market from a number of companies, including Intel; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK Hynix Inc.; Toshiba Corporation; and Western Digital Corporation. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, some governments, such as China, have provided, and may continue to provide, significant financial assistance to some of our competitors or to new entrants. Our competitors seek to increase silicon capacity, improve yields, reduce die size, and minimize mask levels in their product designs resulting in significant increases in the worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory also result from semiconductor memory fab capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We and some of our competitors have plans to or are constructing or ramping production at new fabrication facilities. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory, if not accompanied by commensurate increases in demand, would lead to further declines in average selling prices for our products and would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Many of our high-volume memory products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and as such have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. For these high-volume memory products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including: operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size, and form factors. For our other memory products, the aforementioned performance characteristics generally take precedence over pricing. 

Research and Development 

Our process technology R&#38;D efforts are focused primarily on development of process technologies that enable successively smaller line-widths, additional 3D memory layers, and additional bits per cell (i.e., cell levels). We are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages, which are designed to facilitate our transition to next generation memory products. Additional process technology R&#38;D efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing and mobile memory architectures, the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise, and the development of new manufacturing materials. Product design and development efforts include our high density DDR4 and DDR5 DRAM and LPDRAM products as well as high density and mobile 3D NAND Flash memory (including TLC and QLC technologies), 3D XPoint memory, SSDs (including firmware and controllers), Managed NAND, specialty memory, NOR Flash memory, and other memory technologies and systems. 

Our R&#38;D expenses were $1.62 billion , $1.54 billion , and $1.37 billion &#32;in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively. We generally share with Intel the costs of product design and process development activities for NAND Flash memory and 3D XPoint memory. Our R&#38;D expenses reflect net reductions of $208 million, $231 million, and $162 million in 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 , respectively, as a result of reimbursements under our cost-sharing arrangements with Intel and others. 

To compete in the semiconductor memory industry, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. We believe that expansion of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for specific memory solutions. Our process, design, and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world, with our largest R&#38;D center located in Boise, Idaho, and other significant R&#38;D centers in Japan, China, Italy, Singapore and other sites in the U.S. In 2016, we commenced construction on an expansion of our R&#38;D facility in Boise. 

R&#38;D expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. We deem development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. R&#38;D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.

Sales to customers outside the United States totaled $13.63 billion &#32;for 2015 &#32;and $13.81 billion &#32;for 2014 . As of September 1, 2016 , we had net property, plant, and equipment of $5.44 billion &#32;in Singapore, $3.89 billion &#32;in the United States, $2.69 billion &#32;in Japan, $2.08 billion &#32;in Taiwan, $491 million &#32;in China, and $97 million &#32;in other countries. (See "Part II &#8211; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Geographic Information" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors.") 

Patents and Licenses 

In recent years, we have been recognized as a leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. As of September 1, 2016 , we owned approximately 16,100 U.S. patents and 4,300 foreign patents. In addition, we have thousands of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Our patents have various terms expiring through 2036. 

We have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have from time to time licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. We may need to obtain additional patent licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms. 

Employees 

As of September 1, 2016 , we had approximately 31,400 employees. 

Environmental Compliance 

Government regulations impose various environmental controls on raw materials and discharges, emissions, and solid wastes from our manufacturing processes. In 2016, our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of ISO 14001 certification. To continue certification, we must meet annual requirements in environmental policy, compliance, planning, management, structure and responsibility, training, communication, document control, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, record keeping, and management review. While we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in the regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations, or other compliance actions. 

Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant 

Our executive officers are appointed annually by the Board of Directors and our directors are elected annually by our shareholders. Any directors appointed by the Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board serve until the next election by the shareholders. All officers and directors serve until their successors are duly chosen or elected and qualified, except in the case of earlier death, resignation, or removal.
