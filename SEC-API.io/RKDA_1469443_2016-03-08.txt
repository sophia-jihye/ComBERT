 Item 1. Business. 

Overview

We are a leading agricultural biotechnology trait company with an extensive and diversified portfolio of late-stage yield and product quality traits addressing multiple crops that supply the global food and feed markets. Our traits are focused on high-value enhancements that increase crop yields by enabling plants to more efficiently manage environmental and nutrient stresses, and that enhance the quality and value of agricultural products. Our traits increase value not only for farmers, but also for users of agricultural products throughout the supply chain. We have a robust pipeline of products in development incorporating our traits, including products that are in advanced stages of development or on the market.

Our crop yield traits are being utilized by our commercial partners to develop higher yielding seeds for the most widely grown global crops, including wheat, rice, soybean, corn, and sugarcane, as well as for other crops such as cotton, turf, and trees. Our business model positions us at the nexus of basic research and commercial product development, as we apply our strong product development and regulatory capabilities to collaborate with, and leverage the skills and investments of, upstream basic research institutions and downstream commercial partners. We believe our approach significantly reduces risk and capital requirements, while simplifying and expediting the product development process. We also believe that our collaboration strategy leverages our internal capabilities, enabling us to capture much higher value than would otherwise be the case, and enabling our commercial partners to develop and commercialize products more cost-effectively.

In recent decades, agricultural biotechnology has been a major driving force for improving farm economics by introducing genetically modified, or GM, seeds, with traits that reduce the cost of managing crop biotic stresses such as weeds, insects, and microbial pests. The first agricultural biotechnology traits, herbicide tolerance and insect resistance, were developed primarily by companies with deep expertise and a long heritage in crop protection chemistry and pest management. Seeds with these traits have achieved rapid growth and strong commercial success, reaching market share in excess of 90% in key crops and countries as of 2013.

We believe the next generation of advancements in agricultural biotechnology involves increasing yields by making crops which perform significantly better under a wide range of abiotic stresses, including drought, heat, salinity, and variable availability of key nutrients such as nitrogen. Our target market is the $40.5 billion global seed market. Our goal is to increase the value of this market significantly by increasing yields in the more than $1.0 trillion market for the five largest global crops, and to capture a portion of the increased value.

Our business model focuses on creating value by leveraging collaborator investments and capabilities upstream in basic research, and downstream in product development and commercialization. We bridge the gap between basic research and commercial development, reducing risk and adding value as a result. We reduce risk and avoid most of the costs associated with basic research by acquiring trait technologies that have already completed initial feasibility screening, thus achieving proof of concept, through basic research carried out elsewhere. We further develop these technologies by optimizing function and validating performance through intensive field trial testing in multiple crops. We then form collaborations with major seed and consumer product companies who develop and commercialize products incorporating our traits. In select instances, we also work with our commercial partners to make any regulatory filings required to support commercial launch of the trait in order to increase our share of the value created by the trait.

By licensing later stage de-risked technologies to our commercial partners, we expect to achieve significantly greater value than generally earned for access to early stage traits. Our license agreements typically include upfront and annual license fees, as well as multiple milestone payments for key product development stages such as demonstration of greenhouse efficacy, demonstration of field efficacy, regulatory submission, regulatory approval, and commercial launch. Following commercialization of a product utilizing one or more of our traits, we share in the value of the traits realized by our commercial partners. We believe that this broad and balanced approach diversifies and reduces risk, allowing us to address multiple end markets through strong established channels.

We use both GM and non-GM technologies to develop our traits, which enable us to select the approach most suited for the particular trait, crop and market. Our agricultural yield traits are designed to substantially increase crop yields and farmer income. They do so either by improving efficiency in the use of key inputs, such as fertilizer and water, or by increasing tolerance to environmental stresses, such as drought, heat and salinity. Our current portfolio of agricultural yield traits includes Nitrogen Use Efficiency, or NUE, Water Use Efficiency, or WUE, Drought Tolerance, Salinity Tolerance, Heat Tolerance, and Herbicide Tolerance. Field trial results have demonstrated significant yield improvements resulting from our ag ricultural yield traits in multiple crops and geographies. As one example, field trials in multiple environments conducted by an independent testing organization with our NUE trait in rice resulted in a consistent yield improvement that on average was 30% above the controls over a four-year period from 2012 to 2015. Rice is the world&#8217;s most valuable crop, with a harvest value of $316 billion in 2014, and the third most widely grown crop, according to the FAO. Our agricultural product quality traits increase the value of harvested products by improving specific compositional qualities of oilseeds and grains. These traits include Enhanced Nutrition Grains and High Value Nutritional Oils, including Sonova 400 GLA safflower oil and Sonova Ultra GLA safflower oil , which we refer to as our Sonova products. 

We have formed strategic partnerships and developed strong relationships with global agricultural leaders for development and commercialization of our traits in major crops and consumer products. Our collaborators include Limagrain (Vilmorin &#38; Cie), Mahyco (Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company Limited), Dow AgroSciences, DuPont Pioneer (E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company), SES Vanderhave, Genective (a joint venture between Limagrain and KWS SAAT), Scotts, U.S. Sugar, Abbott, Ardent Mills, Bioceres, and others. Additionally, in order to increase our participation in the value of two major crops, wheat and soybean, we have formed two joint ventures. Limagrain Cereal Seeds LLC is our joint venture with Limagrain for the development and commercialization of wheat products for North America. Limagrain is the world&#8217;s fourth-largest seed company. Verdeca LLC is our joint venture with Bioceres for the development and deregulation of soybean traits globally. Bioceres is an agricultural investment and development company owned by approximately 250 shareholders, including some of South America&#8217;s largest soybean growers. 

The strength of our internal capabilities and collaboration strategy enables us to quickly identify and develop valuable traits and bring them to market, as we have demonstrated through commercializing Sonova 400 GLA safflower oil in less than six years from technology acquisition to commercial launch. Sonova 400 GLA safflower oil is a key ingredient in multiple branded nutritional supplements marketed through GNC stores and other U.S. retailers.

Our Strengths 

We believe we are strategically positioned to capitalize on the need to increase crop yields and quality of agricultural products globally. Our competitive strengths include:

&#160;

&#183; 

We hold a competitive position in an attractive and fast-growing industry. According to Phillips McDougall, during 2014 the overall value of the commercial seed market increased by 2.8% to reach an estimated $40.5 billion. Within this overall outcome, the global market for genetically modified seeds increased by 4.7% to $21 billon. The GM seed sector has shown year-on-year growth since its inception, and in 2014 represented 51.9% of the global seed market. We believe that addressing opportunities to increase yield in the much larger market for agricultural products will dramatically expand the size of the GM seed market, and that we are well-positioned to take advantage of this with our portfolio of late-stage, high-value traits, and our ability to reduce product development risk and leverage the capabilities of our licensees and partners. We believe the yield-enhancing benefits of our agricultural yield traits provide significant value to farmers, based on field trials to date. We carefully select our collaborators and partners and license our traits to leading seed and consumer product companies. This allows us to leverage their substantial development capabilities and market presence, creating a highly scalable and capital light platform. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We have a broad and diverse portfolio of products and partners. Our product portfolio consists of a wide variety of traits that are applicable to major crops in key geographic markets and address agricultural yield and product quality. The applicability of our product portfolio to these major crops provides us access to multiple large end markets that we believe have demonstrated or have the potential for high growth, such as soybeans in North and South America and wheat and rice globally. We believe 

&#160;

that o ur established relationships with multiple global agricultural and consumer product leaders, such as Limagrain, Mahyco, Dow AgroSciences, DuPont Pioneer, SES Vanderhave, Abbott, Ardent Mills, and others, improve our ability to monetize the benefits of our traits. Importantly, in most cases our technologies and traits are additive to, rather than competitive with, the efforts of our collaborators. As a result, we and our collaborators mutually benefit from a strong alignment of interests. Additionally, we ha ve entered into a number of collaborations and joint ventures with regard to major crops, such as wheat, soybean and corn. Limagrain Cereal Seeds LLC is our joint venture with Limagrain for the development and commercialization of wheat products for North America. Verdeca LLC is our joint venture with Bioceres for the development and deregulation of soybean traits globally. In April 2015, we entered into a strategic collaboration with Dow AgroSciences and Bioceres under which our Verdeca joint venture will collaborate with Dow AgroSciences on the development and deregulation of soybean traits on a global basis. In December 2015, Arcadia announced a strategic collaboration with Dow AgroSciences to develop and commercialize traits in corn. 

&#160;

&#183; 

The development stage of our products substantially reduces the risk and time to market. We reduce risk and avoid most of the costs associated with basic research by acquiring trait technologies that have already achieved proof of concept and have started Phase 2 of development through basic research carried out elsewhere. We then optimize and validate trait performance through intensive field trials in multiple crops, and license the further de-risked traits to selected collaborators globally. The majority of the products being developed with our traits, including those based on NUE and WUE trait technologies, are in Phase 2, Phase 3, or later stages of development. The efficacy of these traits has been demonstrated through field testing over multiple years in a variety of major crops. According to the Monsanto 2011 Investor Toolkit, products in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of development have a 50% and 75% probability of reaching commercialization, respectively, and this metric is used commonly in the industry. Commercial launch of the first seed products containing our proprietary agricultural yield traits is expected within the next few years. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We have demonstrated independent product development and regulatory capabilities. Our execution risk is significantly reduced by our in-house scientific and product development expertise, which affords us substantial control over the product development process. Our regulatory expertise enables us to capture additional value in selected instances, and also to expedite the development of products containing our traits. For example, we independently developed and commercialized our first commercial product, Sonova 400 GLA safflower oil, in less than six years from technology acquisition. This is significantly less than the 13 years it takes, on average, to commercialize a seed using advanced breeding or biotechnology, according to Phillips McDougall. Our regulatory team&#8217;s expertise in bringing traits through the regulatory process quickly and cost-effectively is a key differentiating factor. For example, by working closely with federal and state regulatory authorities, we have designed and implemented robust protocols for conducting field trials in California with GM rice. To our knowledge, we are the only company currently permitted to conduct such trials. Coupled with strong in-house intellectual property law expertise, our technology development process has resulted in a portfolio of over 130 issued patents that are either owned or exclusively controlled by us. 

&#160;

&#183; 

We have a seasoned executive team with a diverse blend of technical and commercial experience. Our executive team has extensive experience specific to agricultural biotechnology, including management of research, regulatory matters, business development, product commercialization, finance and intellectual property. Several members of our executive team previously worked at Calgene and Monsanto, and all of our executive team members have worked together for more than ten years. Our executive team has a strong track record of acquiring and developing valuable trait technologies and forging sustainable partnerships. Our scientific advisory board brings substantial, relevant experience in the analysis, research and development, regulatory review, and commercialization of next generation seed traits. 

Our Growth Strategy 

We believe that there are significant opportunities to grow our business globally by executing the following elements of our strategy:

&#160;

&#183; 

Accelerate and broaden the commercialization of our high-impact agricultural yield traits. One of our highest priorities is to accelerate and broaden the commercialization of our key agricultural yield traits, such as NUE, WUE, and Drought Tolerance, that are in advanced stages of development with our commercial partners and joint ventures. We intend to do this by working with our collaborators to expand the scope of development activities and execute against predetermined technical and regulatory milestones in our joint work plans. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase the value we capture in selected crops by managing and investing in the regulatory process. For certain crops, including wheat, soybean, cotton, and sugarbeets, we have the opportunity to invest incrementally in the management of regulatory activities. By doing so, we will increase our share of the trait value from a base range of 15 to 20% to a range of 37 to 50%, depending on the specific crop and trait. We believe that investment in the regulatory process is highly de-risked because it occurs after clear evidence of trait efficacy has been demonstrated and, as a result, will bring highly favorable economic returns. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Execute on a range of near-term opportunities in areas that we believe will be materially beneficial. In addition to developing agricultural yield traits for major global crops, we develop such traits for secondary crops, and also develop product quality traits. Our product quality trait programs, including specialty oils and improved grains, provide opportunities for near-term revenue growth. In particular, our programs for nutritional oils and resistant starch wheat are at advanced development stages and we intend to accelerate our efforts in these programs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue to build our pipeline of next generation and innovative traits. We maintain strong relationships with leading basic research institutions and other industry participants, and will continue to partner with them to gain access to new traits and technologies with demonstrated efficacy. Our independence, broad technical product development, and regulatory expertise position us to collaborate effectively with parties throughout the value chain to reduce risk and leverage the resources. We have a strong track record of working effectively and transparently with third parties and are a sought-after partner for independent trait development and regulatory work. We believe that opportunities exist to expand such relationships in the future. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Continue to invest in our human resources and technology infrastructure on a global basis. Our highly-skilled and technical employees are critical to our success, and we will continue to invest in development and retention in order to build upon this strength. We will continue to invest in best-in-class technology and research and development capabilities that will enable us to continue advancing our position in the agricultural biotechnology marketplace. 

Our Products and Product Development Pipeline

We currently have a robust pipeline of products in development incorporating our traits, including products that are either in advanced stages of development or on the market. Our use of both GM and non-GM technologies to develop our traits enables us to select the approach most suited for the particular trait, crop, and market. Our agricultural yield traits are designed to substantially increase crop yields and farmer income. They do so either by improving efficiency in the use of key inputs, such as fertilizer and water, or by increasing tolerance to environmental stresses, such as drought, heat, and salinity. Our existing portfolio of agricultural yield traits includes NUE, WUE, Drought Tolerance, Salinity Tolerance, Heat Tolerance, and Herbicide Tolerance as further described below. Our traits are developed as individual offerings and as stacks that incorporate several different traits, and can be designed for use in a variety of crops and end markets.

The following table summarizes our current commercial product and our pipeline of products in development.

Agricultural Yield Traits

Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) 

Our NUE technology enables plants to absorb and utilize nitrogen fertilizer much more efficiently than conventional plants. This allows crops to achieve significantly higher yields under normally applied levels of nitrogen fertilizer, or to achieve the same yields as conventional crops while using 30 to 50% less nitrogen fertilizer.

Nitrogen fertilizer is a primary plant nutrient and key driver of crop yield. Nitrogen fertilizer is a significant component of crop production cost and was a $104.6 billion product within the $183.3 billion market for all fertilizers in 2012, according to an industry-specific report by MarketLine. Research published in Plant Biotechnology Journal reported that only 30 to 50% of added nitrogen fertilizer is taken up by agricultural crops, with the remainder left unutilized and potentially becoming a significant environmental pollutant.

Our NUE technology platform was initially based on a trait discovered at the University of Alberta (Canada), and we hold an exclusive, global license to the technology for use in all crops, with unlimited sublicense rights. Efficacy of this NUE technology has been demonstrated in field-grown rice, wheat, and canola by multiple groups. NUE cotton lines will be field tes ted in the United States in 2016, and related NUE cotton lines are expected to be field tested in India in the near term. 

Our research team has also been developing and evaluating a number of different and novel genetic traits to effect NUE in crop plants. Three of these candidate technologies have been introduced into wheat and were first planted in 2015. We expect to review the first yield data in the spring of 2016. These traits also have been engineered into rice, and these materials will be evaluated as well. 

Most recently, we have collaborated with Dow AgroSciences on development of NUE in corn, which we announced in December 2015. Dow AgroSciences is currently evaluating this technology by means of multiple-location U.S. field efficacy tests in hybrid corn. We anticipate having those results collected and analyzed later this year. 

Positive field test results for our Dow AgroSciences corn collaboration will help our research team determine whether to apply this NUE technology to additional crops like wheat and soybean. We plan to use a combination of our original and proven NUE technology platform with one or more of the new NUE traits in stacks that will help us maintain and extend our technical and commercial advantage for this important trait area.

The target crops and markets for NUE include all major agricultural crops and markets. Our NUE technology has now been incorporated, or is under development by our commercial partners, in major global crops, including rice, wheat, soybean, cotton, canola, sugarbeets, sugarcane, vegetables, turf grass, and multiple forestry species. Specific crops, collaborators, stages of development, and target markets for our NUE technology are shown in the following table.

&#160;

Field trial data to date in multiple major commodity crops has shown yield improvements attributable to our NUE trait of greater than 10%. For example, we and Limagrain have independently conducted field trials of NUE in wheat at multiple locations across multiple crop seasons, and the leading NUE wheat line has shown an average yield improvement relative to the control of 10%.

In another exam ple, multiple research partners including the International Center for Tropical Agriculture, or CIAT, have conducted field trials of NUE in a major type of rice for four years (2012-2015) under both lowland (flood irrigated) and upland (rain irrigated) loc ations. Of the six NUE rice lines tested, two consistently showed significant yield benefits across all field trials and treatments. The leading line out-yielded the control by an average of 30% over four years for the two locations and for three rates of nitrogen fertilizer in the lowland location. The table below summarizes the average yield increase over four years, relative to the control, for the two lead lines, as reported by CIAT.

We have also created a methodology to quantify and document changes in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from changes in nitrogen use. This methodology, approved by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2012, is the first of its kind to link crop genetics with carbon emissions. We believe this may encourage the adoption of crops with NUE technology by enabling farmers to further increase revenue through the sale of carbon credits.

Water Use Efficiency (WUE)/Drought Tolerance

Our WUE trait technology enables plants to better tolerate two distinct types of stress: reduced or inconsistent water and severe drought. The WUE trait has been demonstrated to improve crop yield under conditions of episodic water stress and to help crops recover from severe drought conditions. A related but distinct technology, Drought Tolerance, helps plants maintain yields under conditions of prolonged water stress. 

In 2012, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO, reported that modern agriculture is highly water intensive, using approximately 70% of world water withdrawals. UNESCO also estimates that future global agricultural water consumption will increase by about 19% by 2050 and could be even higher if crop yields and the efficiency of agricultural production do not improve dramatically. The irregular availability of suitable water is one the leading causes of reduced crop yield globally. Loss due to drought in the United States, as reported to the USDA Risk Management Agency, averaged $4.7 billion from 2009 through 2013 and was $12.9 billion in 2012. 

Water-limiting conditions can result from prolonged drought, leading to severe reductions in crop yields, or can result from periodic dry conditions, leading to reduced crop yields. Whenever water limitations occur, economic losses and impairment of the food supply result. 

Our WUE trait technology was jointly discovered by researchers at the University of California, Davis and Technion&#8212;Israel Institute of Technology. We hold an exclusive, global license to the technology, with sublicense rights, for use in all crops. Target crop markets for WUE technology include most major crops, such as rice, wheat, corn, soybean, sugarcane, cotton, and canola. Target geo graphies are global, based on regions where water availability can limit productivity in the target crops. Our Drought Tolerance technology was discovered by researchers at National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Argentina), and further develop ed by Bioceres, S.A. We hold an exclusive license to this technology for use in wheat globally outside of South America. Verdeca, our joint venture with Bioceres, Inc., holds exclusive global rights and is developing and commercializing this technology in soybeans. Our WUE technology has now been incorporated, or is under development by our commercial partners, in major global and secondary crops, including those shown in the following table. Our Drought Tolerance technology is being applied in wheat, and s oybeans with this technology are in the regulatory approval process in Argentina. Specific crops, collaborators, stages of development, and target markets for our WUE and Drought Tolerance technologies are shown in the following table.

Greenhouse and field trials of our WUE traits have been completed in agronomic crops such as rice, cotton, peanuts and alfalfa. We are currently working with collaborators in additional crops, including wheat, sugarbeets, sugarcane, and multiple t ree species. Recent collaborator results in rice show significant yield improvement under water-limited conditions. Our Drought Tolerance technology is most advanced in soybeans under our Verdeca joint venture. Multiple seasons of field trials under reduce d yield conditions that represent the average yield of soybean production in North and South America have shown yield improvements relative to controls of up to 14%, with no decrease in yield under optimal conditions, as illustrated in the following chart. The Early Food Safety Evaluation process has been completed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the plant protein responsible for our Drought Tolerance trait. The trait event has full approval for food safety and international commerce i n Argentina from the National Advisory Commission on Agricultural Biotechnology and the Biotechnology Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries, in conjunction with the Servicio Nacional de Sanidad y Calidad Agoalimentaria and the Agricultural Market Directorate. Additionally, regulatory approval applications have been submitted in Uruguay and are pending final approval.

&#160;

Salinity Tolerance 

Our Salinity Tolerance trait allows plants to produce increased yields under conditions of elevated salinity and is applicable to a wide range of crops, including wheat, rice, soybean, cotton, and vegetables. Our salt-tolerant plants have also been demonstrated to bind excess salt from the soil into the plant, potentially providing the benefit of rehabilitating salinized land over time.

The global cost of lost crop yield to salt-induced land degradation is estimated to be $27.3 billion according to the United Nations Natural Resources Forum. Of the current 230.0 million hectares of irrigated land, 45.0 million hectares, or about 20%, are salt-affected. Crops grown under salt-affected conditions may be inhibited in two ways. First, the presence of salt in the soil reduces the ability of the plant to take up water, leading to reductions in growth rate. Second, if excessive amounts of salt enter the plant, there can be injury to the cells, which may cause further reductions in growth. Modern agriculture is highly water intensive and the ability to manage crops in saline environments will reduce agricultural demand on critical fresh water supplies.

Our most advanced Salinity Tolerance trait technology is being developed based on basic research conducted at the University of Toronto, the University of California, Davis, and the National Ins titute of Agrobiological Sciences (Japan), all of which have granted us exclusive licenses for all crops. We are conducting early stage research on additional salinity tolerance genes under a funded research agreement with the United States Agency for Inte rnational Development, or USAID. 

Target markets for the Salinity Tolerance trait are those areas where water or soil salinity decrease crop yield. Such areas occur globally where irrigation is prevalent, where ground water supplies are salinized due to seawater intrusion, and where soils are salinized due to mineral deposits. Such areas are common in North America, India, China, additional countries in Asia, Australia, and other major crop production countries. Our Salinity Tolerance trait has been licensed to partners for use in rice, wheat, corn, cotton, canola, sugarcane, and vegetable crops. Specific crops, collaborators, stages of development, and target markets for our Salinity Tolerance technologies are shown in the following table.

Crops with tolerance to soil and water salinity are in different degrees of development with our primary licensee and partner for the Salinity Tolerance trait technology. Our partner previously had tested the most promising rice lines with our trait in a field in which controlled amounts of salt were applied to the replicated plots. In 2015, a field trial was executed on naturally high saline farmlands in India, where grain yields typically are very low, and we saw results similar to those in prior trials. Our partner has developed wheat lines that show significant salinity tolerance under greenhouse conditions, with some lines outperforming the controls by more than 30%, and additional wheat lines are in development to expand the scope of our partner&#8217;s first field evaluations. For salt tolerant cotton, our partner is preparing to conduct outdoor field trials in India, and we are making concurrent preparations in the United States with a U.S. cotton variety.

&#160;

Heat Tolerance 

Our Heat Tolerance technology program is carrying out discovery research funded by USAID in collaboration with the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center, or CIMMYT, and the Indian National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, or NBPGR. Our work targets metabolic approaches to reduce the heat sensitivity of starch synthesis in wheat and increase membrane thermostability. We are pyramiding the CIMMYT-identified natural genetic diversity that affects membrane thermostability and induced genetic diversity in starch synthesis, developed by us, in order to improve wheat heat adaptation in a fundamental way.

Among major staple crops, global wheat yields may be the most impacted by climate change, according to a number of climate change models. And while wheat is the most drought-adapted of major crops, improving heat adaptation would make wheat a climate resilient staple. Developing countries are both significant producers and importers of wheat. According to CIMMYT, an estimated 1.2 billion poor people depend on wheat and 81% of wheat in the developing world is produced and consumed in the same country. At the same time, wheat accounts for 43% of food imports in developing countries, underscoring the importance of global wheat trade to food security. CIMMYT estimates that demand for wheat will increase by 60% by 2050 in developing countries. As we saw with the global food price crisis in 2008, poor yields in major wheat exporting countries such as Australia can have a significant impact on global prices.

Wheat has been shown to lose three to four percent of yield per degree Celsius above the optimum daytime temperature of 15 C. Since the 1980s, global wheat productivity is estimated to have been reduced by as much as five percent due to increasing temperature, and wheat yields in South Asia could decline about 50% by 2050. Recent research in India suggests that most crop models have u nderestimated the impact of extreme heat on yield losses by as much as 50%. 

This technology is being developed in collaboration with CIMMYT and NBPGR, under funding provided by USAID and is currently in the discovery stage. The initial target crop for this technology is wheat, where the impacts from heat stress are among the most severe of all major crops. Target commercial geographies are global. It is expected that discoveries under this program are likely to lead to improvements in heat stability of major crops other than wheat as well.

Herbicide Tolerance 

Our Herbicide Tolerance program is currently focused on wheat and we have developed a non-GM source of tolerance to glyphosate, a widely used non-selective herbicide. We believe that the discoveries under this program are likely to result in similar opportunities in other major crops.

According to ISAAA, from 1996 to 2013, herbicide tolerant crops consistently occupied the largest planting area of biotech crops. In 2013 alone, herbicide tolerant crops occupied 99.4 million hectares, or 57%, of the 175.2 million hectares of biotech crops planted globally. For the first 17 years of commercialization (1996 to 2012), benefits from herbicide tolerant crops were valued at $47.7 billion, which accounted for 41% of global biotech crop value. For 2012 alone, herbicide tolerant crops were valued at $6.6 billion or 35% of global biotech crop value.

Our Herbicide Tolerance technology is in Phase 3 of development and was developed using our proprietary non-GM research platform, TILLING, which enabled us to find and further develop valuable rare genes within our wheat genetic diversity collection. This work is fully funded by a collaborator who has the option to obtain a non-exclusive commercial license to this trait in certain countries. We retain the right to further license this technology to additional collaborators in global wheat markets.

Testing results have shown tolerance in multiple wheat lines to levels of glyphosate herbicide, which may be sufficient to control many weed species in wheat production. Individual glyphosate tolerant wheat lines are being combined via plant breeding to combine sources of tolerance and create products with increasing levels of tolerance.

Agronomic Trait Stacks

Trait stacks are combinations of multiple individual traits. Trait stacks can be made by using conventional plant breeding to cross plants with different traits, and can also be made by combining multiple traits in a molecular stack that is then inserted into a target crop. Our collaborators are generally allowed to combine multiple traits of ours either by breeding or molecular stacks. Deep portfolios of agronomic stress tolerance traits are rare in the industry, and the ability to pyramid multiples of such traits is even rarer. In order to validate the efficacy of particular trait stacks, we carry out our own research and field trials.

We have developed three mol ecular trait stacks, and have field-tested them in example crops, as shown in the table below. Efficacy of a trait stack in one crop suggests the probability that the stack will also work in other key crops. The history of single traits functioning in mult iple crops, along with the evidence of stacked traits working in more than one crop, suggest that stacked traits are likely to function in multiple crops. Thus, we believe that our trait stacks have market opportunities well beyond the specific demonstrati on crops and geographies shown in the table.

Our most advanced and tested trait stack&#8212;the combination of NUE, WUE, and Salinity Tolerance&#8212;has been field tested in rice over multiple seasons. We have tested this trait stack under varying levels of nitrogen, water availability, and salinity. Rice plants with this stack out-yielded control plants by five to 22% under different levels of nitrogen fertilizer, by 19 to 32% under different types of water stress, and by 27 to 42% under high salinity conditions. The table below summarizes the results from a field trial conducted by us in 2012, with similar results obtained in a field trial conducted in 2013.

&#160;

We have a strategic collaboration to develop and commercialize new yield traits and trait stacks in corn with Dow AgroSciences. Under the collaboration, we and Dow AgroSciences will jointly develop and commercialize agronomic yield traits, such as nutrient efficiency and water use efficiency, including several traits that already have completed advanced field trials in corn. These traits would then be combined with Dow AgroSciences&#8217; input traits to create highly competitive trait stacks. As part of the agreement, we can use the agronomic traits in other major crops. 

&#160;

Agricultural Product Quality Traits

Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) Oil

Under the license agreement we have with Abbott, we developed a new source of vegetable oil with very high levels of gamma linolenic acid, or GLA, an omega-6 fatty acid. Our GLA safflower oil product has the highest concentration of GLA available in any plant oil at 65%; conventional plant oils range from 10 to 22% GLA. We sell the oil in the United States and Canada to manufacturers of nutritional supplements, medical foods, and other products. Our key customers include significant participants in those markets, such as GNC, Lindora Nutrition, and others.

GLA has multiple clinically-demonstrated nutritional and medical benefits, including anti-inflammation effects, improved skin condition, and healthy weight management. Multiple parties have expressed commercial interest in incorporating an enhanced GLA oil into their foods, dietary supplements, or medical products where conventional sources of GLA are not sufficiently concentrated to deliver amounts that are cost- and performance-effective. 

Against a commercial target of 40% GLA concentration, we developed, deregulated, and commercialized GLA safflower oil containing up to 65% GLA concentration in less than six years. This is significantly less than the 13 years it takes, on average, to commercialize a seed using advanced breeding or biotechnology, according to Phillips McDougall. We produce GLA safflower oil by contracting with farmers in Idaho and process the seed under contract with a manufacturer in California to make refined oil. We sell GLA safflower oil under the brand name Sonova with multiple concentrations and formulations.

&#160;

Arachidonic Acid (ARA) Oil 

Our Arachidonic Acid (ARA) Oil has high levels of the fatty acid ARA, which is a key ingredient in more than 90% of U.S. infant nutrition products. ARA contributes to benefits such as fostering infant eye and brain development. We estimate the global market for ARA at $160 million and believe that our ARA product will cost significantly less than currently available sources of ARA.

Our ARA Oil is being developed under agreements with Abbott and DuPont Pioneer, each of which licensed intellectual property to us for this program. In exchange for licenses to intellectual property, these agreements provide product access rights to Abbott and DuPont Pioneer, as well as certain royalty payments on product sales to third parties.

Our ARA Oil is in Phase 3 of development. We have multiple safflower lines with oil compositions that offer the opportunity of being direct replacements for current sources of ARA in infant nutrition products.

&#160;

Enhanced Quality Grains

We have multiple programs aimed at developing wheat and other small grains with improved nutritional qualities. One such program generated bread and pasta wheat lines with high levels of resistant starch. Resistant starch increases the total dietary fiber content of wheat and reduces its glycemic index, which are both desirable nutritional qualities that are important in the management of diabetes and healthy blood glucose levels. In 2012, the average American consumed 40% of the recommended level of daily dietary fiber, with whole grain consumption representing only 15% of targeted fiber intake and 80% of teenagers eating no whole grains. A second program increases specific quality targets in wheat, and is funded by Ardent Mills, which combines the operations of ConAgra Mills and Horizon Milling, a Cargill-CHS joint venture. A third program, funded by the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, is aimed at reducing gluten in wheat and other grains. All three of these programs utilize our proprietary TILLING platform, and the resulting products are non-GM.

Our resistant starch wheat provides a source of wheat with inherently high levels of resistant starch, increasing the total dietary fiber content of resulting food products without the need for fiber additives from other sources such as corn, potato and cassava. Resistant starch is a key product in two market segments: dietary fi ber additives and modified starch additives. According to MarketsandMarkets, the fiber additives market was estimated to be $2.2 billion in 2013 and the modified starch market was estimated to be $12.8 billion in 2012, with food and beverage applications a ccounting for approximately 50% of this market. Major growth in these markets is being driven by the convenience health food sector and functional food sector. Flour from our resistant starch wheat lines has resistant starch levels that are 12 to 20 times higher than the control wheat, and total dietary fiber, or TDF, which is more than eight times higher than the control. Resistant starch wheat flour has been tested in applications in bread, where loaf quality was comparable to bread made with conventional wheat flour, and pasta, where it had the highest consumer preference rankings in tests carried out by a major consumer products company.

&#160;

Resistant starch wheat flour is currently being tested in a range of additional bakery products with industrial partners. We have several resistant starch wheat lines that are being evaluated for optimal quality and agronomic characteristics.

The global gluten-free market was estimated to be $2.1 billion in 2014 by Euromonitor, with the United States representing approximately 24%, or $500.0 million, of this market. This figure only includes products that have been formulated to replace wheat flour and does not include products that are naturally gluten-free or have undergone minor formulation changes. Consumers in this market are composed of people with celiac disease (approximately 1% of the population), people with non-celiac gluten intolerance (approximately 6% of the population) and people who choose to eat less gluten because they are in households with individuals with a gluten-free diet or choose to eat gluten- free food. According to Euromonitor, in 2014 bakery products and pasta represented 78% of all gluten-free sales, with a forecasted CAGR in this category in North America and Australasia of eight to 16%. Our wheat with reduced gluten will provide options for wheat products in the low gluten product category and additional options for blending wheat flour to meet the FDA standard for gluten-free products.

Post Harvest Quality 

Our post harvest quality program for tomatoes has resulted in tomato lines with significantly increased post harvest storage life. These tomato lines were developed using our proprietary TILLING platform and are non-GM. Our early research program was funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, due to their interest in being able to procure quantities of fresh fruit with extended storage life for deployment on board ships and submarines and for overseas missions. The global market for fresh tomatoes is estimated by the FAO at $84.5 billion per year. Our initial collaborator for this product is Bioseed, a vegetable seed company based in India, and the product is in Phase 4 of development. Additional collaborations in North America are in development.

&#160;

Identification of New Technology P rograms 

Because our business model is based on leveraging upstream investment in basic research to expand our product development pipeline, we actively seek out and participate in collaborative programs with external partners for the early-stage exploration and identification of promising plant technologies, particularly those related to abiotic stress tolerance in plants. The results of these collaborations directly feed innovation and often drive the progress of our ongoing programs. Some of these key early-stage collaborations include programs with the ARC Centre of Excellence in Plant Cell Walls (Australia), the University of Adelaide (Australia), CIMMYT (Mexico), the University of California, Davis (United States), Tulane University (United States), the University of California, Berkeley (United States), the International Center for Research in Semi-Arid Tropics (India), the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (Bangladesh), and ICABIOGRAD (Indonesia). Many of these collaborative programs are funded by U.S. government grants that we have secured either ourselves or in connection with our collaboration partners, including grants by USAID, the NIH, the National Science Foundation, and the USDA. Other early-stage technologies are introduced to us by commercial entities engaged in basic research who may be seeking to partner with us to advance their discoveries to further validation and product development. In some cases, such commercial entities are technology start-ups, and in other cases they include some of the largest companies involved in agricultural and food technology research. The diagram below illustrates our technology development model.

&#160;

We have a formal team and process for evaluating new technology opportunities. This team has multi-disciplinary membership, and reviews promising new technologies with regard to mission fit, scientific feasibility, intellectual property, business opportunity, and other considerations. Generally, we accept less than 10% of the potential opportunities we evaluate. Once a promising new trait technology has been accepted, we negotiate an agreement with the technology provider that, at a minimum, enables us to further evaluate the technology for a suitable period of time, or, in some cases, secures rights that enable full research and commercial exploitation of the technology.

Technology Evaluation 

Our technology program teams include scientists who are leaders in their respective fields. These teams contribute to the initial evaluation of new technologies and are responsible for development of technologies brought onboard. Each of our technology programs involves multiple gene, trait, and crop targets, and our process focuses on rapid development of the most promising combinations. In the development of any particular technology, we carry out a series of steps including the direct evaluation of target gene function, and the specific evaluation of results in key representative crop species. While common core scientific services are provided by specialized groups, the technology program team manages overall progress and remains directly involved throughout the development cycle, internally as well as externally with our collaborators.

GM and Non-GM Product Development Platforms 

Transformation&#8212;GM Traits. For projects involving GM traits, the genetic construct for insertion into plants is designed and built by the relevant program team, and then the gene transfer step is accomplished by our plant transformation functional group. This group consists of six members with more than 100 years of combined experience in plant transformation. The group has developed a complete physical and methodological infrastructure at our laboratory facility in Davis, California to efficiently transfer genetic materials into key crop species. Our plant transformation team has demonstrated transformation capabilities in all primary and some secondary agricultural crops, including rice (japonica, indica, and NERICA types), wheat, corn, canola, cotton, soybean, safflower, barley, sorghum, alfalfa, tomato, and grapes. 

Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes (TILLING)&#8212;Non-GM Traits. Our proprietary TILLING platform enables us to develop value-added crops without the use of GM methods. The TILLING platform is primarily managed by a dedicated team of scientists at our laboratory in Seattle, Washington. TILLING technology was originally invented by a member of our science team and utilizes specialized laboratory equipment to carry out high-throughput allele screening of DNA samples from genetic diversity populations created in major crops. Our populations include wheat, rice, soybean, canola, tomato, and lettuce. These populations include numerous native and induced gene function alterations, which can be discovered and exploited rapidly at low cost and with minimal regulatory requirements. While the TILLING approach is also practiced elsewhere, we believe that the combination of our specialized background in the technology, highly refined skills in developing and screening genetic diversity plant populations, and proprietary TILLING software makes us the leader in commercial applications of TILLING. 

Controlled Growth Operation. Our controlled growth operations group manages our growth chamber facility, where plants transitioning out of the plant transformation group are grown under precisely controlled conditions, and our greenhouse facility, consisting of approximately 26,000 square feet of high quality greenhouse space, both at our headquarters in Davis, California. The controlled growth operations group uses these facilities to manage plant experiments and grow-outs under rigorously controlled conditions. They also carry out the initial seed increases and first stages of plant breeding for some projects. For certain projects, such as those relating to oil quality and resistant starch wheat, this group also manages crop breeding programs to develop plant varieties for the production of commercial products. 

Field Trials and Commercial Production. Our trait evaluation and development group is based in Davis, California and manages remote field operations in American Falls, Idaho and Brawley, California. The group conducts field trials throughout the United States with specialized contractors, and elsewhere globally with our collaborators and joint venture partners. The trait evaluation and development group has extensive field and specialized statistical analytical capabilities that we deploy to support their field trial execution and data analysis internally and with our collaborators. 

Our agricultural operations group manages late-stage and regulatory field trials and, in the case of GLA safflower, commercial crop production. Late-stage field trials are intended to develop extensive data on a limited number of potential commercial plant varieties. These trials may be used to test new varieties developed by our collaborators containing our traits, and to test our own commercial varieties for oil quality and grain quality programs. Similarly, regulatory trials develop data for use in submissions for regulatory review and may involve plant varieties developed by our collaborators or our own oil quality and grain quality programs.

Regulatory Data Generation. Our Analytical Services and Regulatory Science , or ASRS, group is located in Davis, California and provides automated DNA preparations, genomic blot analyses, lipid profiling, metabolomics, and protein purification services and develops data for use in product selection and validation, certification o f Sonova product specifications, and regulatory submissions. These data support regulatory submissions and provide core trait regulatory packages to our collaborators for use in their crop-specific regulatory applications. 

Biological Materials Inventory and Tracking. Our proprietary Pedigree and Inventory Management System, or PIMS, tracks the genetic, phenotypic, and location information for all of our plant materials. PIMS encompasses genetic elements such as genes and promoters, GM seeds, and plant material received by us, as well as seeds and plants developed by us and used in trait development. The performance of our plant materials is recorded through a variety of laboratory and field observations, and the data are stored within PIMS. The location of all plant materials is tracked throughout the plant life cycle. This includes specific seeds planted within a specific plot of a specific field trial, harvest, seed storage location, and use by, or distribution of plant material to, our collaborators or elsewhere. PIMS interfaces with our Biotechnology Quality Management System, or BQMS, to manage all movement and release of regulated GM plant materials. This ensures that all of our plant materials are accounted for, tracked, and inventoried, which enables us to maintain control over and documentation of all plant materials. 

Regulatory Matters 

Our regulatory management group provides regulatory services for all of our product development programs, as well as for joint ventures and selected collaborations. These services include establishing protocols, completing regulatory permits as necessary, and monitoring regulatory and stewardship compliance for all products at all stages. Our regulatory group includes key employees who are directly responsible for leading all regulatory agency interactions and providing tactical and strategic regulatory direction. Our group collectively has more than 70 years of regulatory experience, with nearly 60 years of direct involvement in the development and approvals of GM crops. Members of our regulatory group were responsible for completing the first FDA and USDA deregulation of a GM whole food. The interactions and processes associated with these first USDA and FDA processes established benchmarks for the regulation of GM products that remain applicable today.

Our regulatory management and compliance activities encompass three broad categories: stewardship, authorization, and deregulation. In the United States, these activities are regulated by various government agencies, including the USDA, the FDA, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA.

Stewardship 

Stewardship, or the careful and responsible management of assets, forms the foundation of our regulatory compliance programs associated with GM plants. Our stewardship framework for GM plants is defined by government regulations and related internal policies. The USDA requirements and internal procedures for regulatory stewardship are embodied in our Biotechnology Quality Management System, or BQMS, which was developed by us and approved by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Biotechnology Regulatory Service.

Our BQMS program was developed to address all conditions required under USDA authority to ensure containment of regulated plant material. The BQMS includes standard operating procedures, or SOPs, recording and reporting forms, instructions for managing all compliance related activities, and training requirements for all individuals handling GM plant materials. SOPs are highly detailed and consider all elements of each relevant activity or process. Each field trial site is accompanied by a field compliance guide and record containing multiple SOPs and associated forms for each activity. For example, a GM wheat trial requires 19 SOPs and associated verification forms.

Our BQMS is audited annually both internally and independently by an auditor trained and supervised by the USDA. Since our BQMS program was first recognized by the USDA in 2011, each annual independent audit has confirmed that our program is functioning as intended. Our BQMS manager has attended BQMS training programs at the request of the USDA to assist in training personnel at other companies, to share our experience and the SOPs that form the basis of our program.

Compliance with the specific parameters of regulatory requirements is only one element of stewardship. Additional activities within each functional group throughout the company are integral to the overall stewardship program. Each of our employees is trained on, and must com ply with, relevant stewardship guidelines as defined and described in our BQMS. 

Authorization 

The USDA Biotechnology Regulatory Service, or BRS, has legal and regulatory authority over the movement and release of GM plants and seeds. &#8220;Movement&#8221; includes movement of regulated GM plant material between states and the importation of regulated GM plant material from outside the United States. &#8220;Release&#8221; includes field trials of any size and any other use of regulated GM plant material outside of contained greenhouses.

We have obtained more than 200 authorizations from the BRS for the movement, importation or release of GM plants under development. General and specific conditions to maintain containment during all activities associated with the movement or release are a requirement of each authorization. These conditions are defined and applied in the context of the BQMS.

Deregulation 

Our business is subject to regulations related to agriculture, food, and the environment. Plant products produced using GM technology are subject to laws and regulations in countries where the plants are grown and in countries where the GM plant-derived food and feed are consumed by humans or animals. Commodity products utilizing our GM traits may require approvals in multiple countries prior to commercialization, whereas our identity-preserved GM products (for example, GLA safflower and resulting Sonova products) may require approvals only in the limited geographies where the products are marketed and sold. Such products must be appropriately channeled in the food and feed markets to ensure that the products are not exported to geographies where necessary approvals have not been obtained.

U.S. Regulatory Agencies 

U.S. Department of Agriculture. We must obtain USDA authorizations and permits in order to conduct the field releases of regulated materials that are necessary to advance the development of GM crops. Obtaining such authorizations and permits is generally routine and delays impacting the planned movement or release of GM material are uncommon. The USDA provides detailed regulations and guidance for obtaining a so-called &#8220;Determination of Deregulated Status,&#8221; which authorizes the commercial and uncontained growing of GM plants. For regulated GM plants, the USDA requires that a company petition the agency to demonstrate that the product is unlikely to pose a risk. Based on the information provided, the USDA prepares an Environmental Assessment, or EA, and/or an Environmental Impact Statement, or EIS, in order to make its determination. These procedures afford the public an opportunity to submit written comments on the draft EA or EIS for consideration by the USDA before the final version of the EA or EIS is published. For any GM plant product, there may be delays or requests for additional information based on the USDA&#8217;s review or the public comments. Submissions received by the USDA from all applicants in August 2011 and thereafter averaged 27 months to completion; however, the USDA has announced proposed rules intended to significantly shorten this time period. 

U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is responsible for food safety under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA recommended in its 1992 Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties that develo pers of GM plant products consult with the agency about the safety of GM products under development. In 1996, the FDA provided additional guidance to the industry on procedures for these consultations. These procedures require a developer intending to comm ercialize a food or feed product derived from a GM plant to first meet with the agency to identify and discuss relevant safety, nutritional, and other regulatory issues regarding the product. Subsequently, the developer must submit to the FDA a scientific and regulatory assessment supporting proposed product safety. The FDA evaluates the submission and engages with the developer to resolve any questions, requests for additional data, or other informational requirements. Once the FDA has determined that all requirements have been satisfied, the FDA concludes the consultation process by issuing a letter to the developer acknowledging completion of the consultation process with the addition of the product to the list of completed consultations on the FDA websit e. The completed consultation acknowledges product safety for use as food and feed. To date, over 150 GM products have completed this process. This process may have delays if the FDA requires additional data and information for its consultation and to reso lve any questions the FDA may have. The FDA completed nine consultations in 2013 and 2014, with consultation time periods ranging from 13 to 40 months and averaging 21 months from first submission to conclusion. 

Environmental Protection Agency. Certain products may also be regulated by the EPA, including plants that contain a plant-incorporated protectant, such as a pesticides or herbicide, or plants engineered to be treated with industrial chemicals. 

International Regulation 

In certain instances, commercialization of GM crops in the United States may require approvals in those jurisdictions into which crops or derivative materials, such as oil or meal, will be exported. The laws and regulations for GM plant products are well defined in several commercially significant jurisdictions, including Australia, South America, India, and the European Union, and are in various stages of evolution in others, such as Africa and China. Typically, our collaborators are responsible for obtaining all regulatory permits and approvals relevant to product development and commercialization in their licensed countries and for generating crop and transformation event-specific data required by jurisdictions of interest. We provide basic safety data on trait expression products in accordance with generally accepted standards and may serve as a regulatory consultant and participate in the design of regulatory data generation protocols and development of regulatory submissions beyond the basic safety data package. In certain countries, we may develop strategic business relationships or employ independent consultants with geography-specific knowledge and expertise to support and obtain required approvals.

Intellectual Property 

We rely on patents and other proprietary right protections, including trade secrets and contractual protection of our proprietary know-how and confidential information, to preserve our competitive position.

As of December 31, 2015, we owned or exclusively controlled 133 issued patents and 42 pending patent applications worldwide. As of this date, we owned seven and exclusively in-licensed 19 U.S. patents and we owned six and exclusively in-licensed one pending non-provisional U.S. patent applications relating to our trait technologies and business methods. Also, as of this date, we owned 11 and exclusively in-licensed 96 foreign patents and owned 14 and exclusively in-licensed 17 pending foreign patent applications. With respect to all of the foregoing patent assets, our exclusive licenses afford us control over the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents and patent applications. These numbers do not include in-licensed patents for which we either do not have exclusive rights (such as certain enabling technology licenses), or for which we have exclusive rights only in a limited field of use or do not control prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents.

As of December 31, 2015, we had eight registered trademarks in the United States. As of this date, we also had eight registered trademarks and had one trademark application pending in various other countries.

We also have entered into in-license agreements enabling the use and commercialization of our traits, including NUE, WUE, and Salinity Tolerance, and certain products that we have commercialized or are under development, including GLA safflower oil and ARA safflower oil. Under these licensing arrangements, we are obligated to pay royalty fees on sublicense revenue and net product sales ranging between low single digit percentages and percentages i n the mid-teens, subject in certain cases to aggregate dollar caps. The exclusivity and royalty provisions of these agreements are generally tied to the expiration of underlying patents. After the termination of these provisions, we and our collaborators m ay continue to produce and sell products utilizing the technology under the expired patents. While third parties thereafter may develop products using the technology under the expired patents, in many cases, we have incremental patent rights covering our m ost important technologies, which we believe mitigate the impact of the expiration of these patents, or the related exclusivity provisions, on our business. We also have numerous in-licenses relating to enabling technologies utilized in our development pro grams, such as transformation methods (e.g., Japan Tobacco, DuPont Pioneer), genome editing tools (e.g., Dow), promoters (e.g., Dow, Louisiana State University) and selectable marker technologies (e.g., Bayer). These in-licenses are non-exclusive and inclu de some combination of upfront and annual license fees, milestone fees, and commercial royalty obligations consisting of low single-digit percentages or a low single-digit dollars per acre fee. 

Below is a summary of those in-license agreements that we believe are most significant for our more advanced product development programs.

University of Alberta. We hold an exclusive license from University of Alberta to the patent portfolio that formed the basis of our NUE program, which began in 2002. In exchange for an upfront license fee and royalties on sublicense revenues and net product sales (which are capped at an aggregate amount in the mid-seven figures), and subject to the University&#8217;s right to perform academic research using the technology, we exclusively control all research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops. 

Blue Horse Labs. In conjunction with a sponsored research and development agreement entered into in 2003, we obtained an exclusive license from Blue Horse Labs, an affiliate entity of our majority stockholder, Moral Compass Corporation, for technology related to several of our development programs. Under the sponsored research and development agreement, Blue Horse Labs has an ownership right in patents covering technology that was developed using Blue Horse Labs funds, including certain NUE and GLA safflower patents. In the corresponding license agreement, in exchange for a single-digit royalty on net revenues and management of all aspects of the patent portfolio, we exclusively control all research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops. 

University of California. Our WUE technology was developed under an exclusive option agreement with the University of California, pursuant to which we exercised our right to secure an exclusive license in 2010. In exchange for an upfront license fee, license maintenance fees, and royalties on sublicense revenues and net product sales, we exclusively control all for-profit research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops. 

University of Toronto. We hold an exclusive license from University of Toronto to the patent portfolio that forms the basis of our Salinity Tolerance program. In exchange for an upfront license fee, a low single-digit royalty on revenues, and payment of all costs associated with the patent portfolio, and subject to the University&#8217;s right to use the technology for research and teaching purposes, we exclusively control all for-profit research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops. 

Abbott. We entered into a license and development agreement with Abbott in 2003 under which we have been granted limited exclusive rights to Abbott&#8217;s portfolio of U.S. and foreign patents relating to the development of plant-based sources of GLA, ARA, and essential fatty acids. Under this agreement, we provide Abbott with preferential access to commercial products from our GLA and ARA safflower programs, as well as the right to receive low single-digit royalty payments on product sales to third parties, in exchange for the licenses to Abbott&#8217;s intellectual property rights. 

Key Collabor ations 

Since our founding in 2002, we have established numerous trait collaborations and have developed deep relationships with industry-leading seed and consumer product companies. Our partnerships with global strategic seed and consumer product players enable us to further participate in the development and commercialization of innovative products that promise to play significant roles in improving global crop efficiency and enhancing human health. The results of these collaborations directly feed innovation and drive the progress of our ongoing programs. Moreover, the expertise and opportunities created by the collaborations represent important assets to our business. While our collaboration- focused business model has resulted in numerous strategically significant relationships, below is a summary of selected collaborative partnerships that we view as key to the achievement of our near-term and mid-term business objectives.

Mahyco

We have multiple collaborative agreements with Mahyco covering more than 15 programs, using our most advanced traits in multiple major crops, and have been working with Mahyco as a key partner since 2007. Our collaborations in NUE rice and salt tolerant rice are in advanced stages of development.

Under our various agreements relating to our NUE, WUE, and Salinity Tolerance traits, Mahyco has exclusive research and commercial rights in all licensed geographies and must timely meet certain diligence milestones in order to maintain their exclusivity. Each of our collaboration agreements with Mahyco includes an upfront technology access fee, technical and regulatory milestone fees, and, once products utilizing our traits are commercialized, we are entitled to receive a portion of the commercial value of seeds sold by Mahyco incorporating our traits. Rights to new intellectual property developed under a collaboration agreement are owned by the inventing party or parties.

Vilmorin &#38; Cie (Limagrain)

We selected Limagrain as our strategic partner and collaborator in wheat&#8212;the world&#8217;s largest crop by area grown and the third most valuable at $186.4 billion annual value&#8212;due to their position as the leading global breeder and marketer of wheat seeds. In 2009, we executed an agreement with Limagrain under which we partnered to develop and commercialize NUE wheat in all countries of the world except Australia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Under our agreement, Limagrain has exclusive research and commercial rights in all licensed geographies except North America and South America, in which we retained co-exclusive rights, and Limagrain must timely meet diligence milestones to maintain exclusivity. Our agreement with Limagrain includes an upfront technology access fee, annual maintenance fees, and technical and regulatory milestone fees, and once an NUE wheat product is commercialized, we are entitled to receive a portion of the commercial value of the trait in the marketplace. We and Limagrain have since coordinated with collaborators in Australia to align development efforts in NUE wheat on a global basis.

In 2010, we further expanded our relationship with Limagrain from collaborator to stockholder and joint venture partner. Contemporaneously with Limagrain&#8217;s $25.0 million equity investment in our company, we formed Limagrain Cereal Seeds LLC, a joint venture company focused on the development and commercialization of improved wheat seed in North America, of which a U.S. wholly owned subsidiary of Limagrain owns 65% and we own 35%. This joint venture strengthens a close strategic relationship between us and Limagrain, and increases the share of net trait value that we will recognize on traits commercialized in wheat.

As a key strategic partner, Limagrain has a right of first offer to license&#8212;on an arm&#8217;s-length basis&#8212;new technologies that we develop or acquire that are applicable to wheat or barley. This right of first offer extends to Limagrain Cereal Seeds for the United States and Canada. Pursuant to the right of first offer, we formed a global collaboration with Limagrain and Limagrain Cereal Seeds in 2011 to develop and commercialize WUE wheat. Our agreement with Limagrain and Limagrain Cereal Seeds includes an upfront technology access fee, technical and regulatory milestone fees, and, once a product is commercialized, we are entitled to receive a portion of the commercial value of the WUE trait in the marketplace.

Bioceres 

In 2012, we partnered with Bioceres, an Argentina-based technology company, to form Verdeca LLC, a U.S.-based joint venture company engaged in the development and deregulation of soybean traits, of which we own 50%. We selected Bioceres as our partner in soybeans&#8212;the world&#8217;s fourth largest crop by area grown and the fourth most valuable at $119.0 billion annual value&#8212;due to their desirable trait portfolio, their presence in key South American markets, and the significant presence of large soybean growers in their ownership structure.

Our joint venture agreement provides for each of the joint venture partners to license its trait technologies to Verdeca for use in soybeans, with product development and regulatory efforts equitably divided and managed by us and Bioceres under standalone service agreements that are executed annually. The first product in the Verdeca pipeline is a drought and abiotic stress tolerance trait that has already completed extensive validation trials and is now in the regulatory phase of development. This trait has been demonstrated to confer a seven to 14% yield advantage over conventional soybeans grown under the same suboptimal conditions. In April 2015, Verdeca received the first regulatory approval of its stress tolerance trait in soybeans in Argentina. This is the world&#8217;s first regulatory approval of an abiotic stress tolerance trait in soybeans, which we believe is an important initial step in pursuing additional regulatory approvals that Verdeca intends to seek in multiple geographies globally. Verdeca has successfully negotiated favorable market access in South America through established players and is working on adding market channel partners in the United States, India, and China.

In addition to those agreements with Bioceres directly associated with Verdeca, we also have negotiated exclusive access to Bioceres&#8217; drought and abiotic stress tolerance trait for use globally, outside of South America, in wheat. Our agreement with Bioceres provides for sharing of trait value once a product is commercialized.

In April 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Dow AgroSciences and Bioceres under which our Verdeca joint venture will collaborate with Dow AgroSciences on the development and deregulation of soybean traits on a global basis.

Dow AgroSciences

In December 2015, we announced the entry into a strategic collaboration with Dow AgroSciences to develop and commercialize new yield traits and trait stacks in corn. The collaboration leverages our platform of abiotic stress traits with Dow AgroSciences&#8217; enabling technology platforms, input traits, regulatory capabilities, and commercial channels. 

Under the collaboration, we and Dow AgroSciences will jointly develop and commercialize agronomic yield traits, such as nutrient efficiency and water use efficiency, including several traits that already are in advanced field trials in corn. These traits would then be combined with Dow AgroSciences&#8217; input traits to create highly competitive trait stacks that maximize farmer revenue and efficiency. 

As part of the strategic partnership, we negotiated non-exclusive access to Dow AgroSciences&#8217; EXZACT&#8482; Precision Technology Platform to enhance and accelerate the development of trait stacks. Dow AgroSciences has developed the EXZACT&#8482; Precision Technology Platform under an exclusive license and collaboration agreement in plants with Sangamo BioSciences, Inc.

Under the collaboration agreement, certain development costs will be co-funded, and commercial value of resulting traits in corn will be shared. 

Scientific Advisory Board 

We maintain a scientific advisory board consisting of the members identified below. Our scientific advisory board meets on a quarterly basis and is comprised of industry and academic experts that have extensive experience in the analysis, research and development, and commercialization of biotech plants, including experience relating to discovery, transformation, and field trials. We consult with our scientific advisory board on a variety of matters pertaining to our current and future pipeline of products in development, including, for example, trait selection and development, transformation and TILLING methodologies, field trials, regulatory matters, and intellectual property evaluation.

We currently have a scientific advisory board that consists of six members as follows:

Eduardo Blumwald, Ph.D. is a professor at the University of California, Davis. Dr. Blumwald&#8217;s research program is multidisciplinary in nature, combining physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, genomics, and proteomics. The general objectives of his work are: (i) the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate ion homeostasis in plants; (ii) the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating the responses of plants to abiotic stress (e.g., salt, drought, and heat); (iii) the biochemical and molecular basis of sugar and acid accumulation in fruits; and (iv) the development of genomic and proteomic resources for the improvement of fruit quality. Dr. Blumwald has worked closely with our scientists from the time of his former position with the University of Toronto. 

Vicki Chandler, Ph.D. is Chief Program Officer, Science, at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. She studied biochemistry for her undergraduate and doctoral degrees at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, San Francisco, respectively. She then pursued postdoctoral research at Stanford University and was on the faculty at the University of Oregon and the University of Arizona. Dr. Chandler&#8217;s research on paramutation, an epigenetic process, has implications not only for corn, which she used for the majority of her research, but also for animal and human genetics and genetic diseases. Dr. Chandler is president of the Genetics Society of America, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, and a member of the National Science Board. Her many honors include the Presidential Young Investigator Award, Searle Scholar Award, and American Association for the Advancement of Science Fellow. She has served on advisory boards and panels for the National Research Council, National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and National Institutes of Health. Dr. Chandler has chaired numerous conferences and served on the editorial boards of several journals, including Genetics, Plant Physiology, PNAS, and Science. 

Luca Comai, Ph.D. is a professor at the Genome Center in University of California, Davis. Dr. Comai&#8217;s lab is involved in two areas pertinent to breeding. In the first, they study genome regulation, hybridization, and heterosis responses in chromosome copy number variants and interspecific hybridization. In the second, they develop and make available to the plant community a functional genomic discovery tool called TILLING that allows targeted inactivation of genes in crop plants. The research combines plant genetics and genomics with the use of next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics to identify genes responsible for traits of interest as well as to discover and use natural and induced variation. Dr. Comai is known for his pioneering work creating glyphosate tolerant crops, and as a founding scientist in Calgene Pacific, Targeted Growth, Inc., and Tilligen. 

Georges Freyssinet, Ph.D. is recently retired after many years in the plant biotechnology industry in France. He is the former CEO of RhoBio, a joint venture between Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc Agro and Biogemma, and served as the Scientific Advisor for Life Sciences for the RP Group. Dr. Freyssinet is the former director of plant genomics for Aventis, which was later acquired by BayerCropScience. He joined Biogemma in 2003 to lead their genomic and bioinformatics platform, and in 2006 he joined the Scientific Direction of Groupe Limagrain, serving as Scientific Director from 2008-2011. Dr. Freyssinet is the founder and former CEO of LemnaGene, a biomanufacturing company, and the former CEO of Genective, a joint venture between Groupe Limagrain and KWS. Retired since 2014, he continues his independent consulting activities in plant biotechnology. 

Jim Petersen, Ph.D. is Vice President for Research at Limagrain Cereal Seeds, a U.S. joint venture between Groupe Limagrain and our company, where he currently oversees all U.S. breeding oper ations. Prior to joining Limagrain, Dr. Peterson spent 27 years in public sector wheat research, including 12 years as the Krondstadt Professor of Wheat Breeding and Genetics at Oregon State University. Dr. Peterson served as Chair of the National Wheat Im provement Committee and is a recipient of the Weatherford Award for Entrepreneurship and Innovation from the College of Business at Oregon State University. He is noted for his fundamental research on wheat end-use quality and GxE interactions impacting qu ality. Dr. Peterson received his B.S. in agronomy from Washington State University and his M.S. and Ph.D. in agronomy and plant breeding from the University of Nebraska. 

Peter Quail, Ph.D. is a professor of Plant and Microbial Biology at the University of California, Berkeley where he also serves as Research Director of the Plant Gene Expression Center (U.S. Department of Agriculture/Albany, California). Dr. Quail has been a pioneer in the study of phytochromes, photoreceptor proteins that play a major regulatory role in plant growth and development. Dr. Quail was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2004, as a Fellow of the American Association of Science in 2004, and was the recipient of the Stephen Hales Prize, American Society of Plant Biologists, 2008. He received a B.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Sydney, Australia. 

Competition 

The markets for seed traits and agricultural biotechnology products are highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. Competition for improving plant genetics comes from conventional and advanced plant breeding techniques, as well as from the development of advanced biotechnology traits. Other potentially competitive sources of improvement in crop yields include improvements in crop protection chemicals, fertilizer formulations, farm mechanization, other biotechnology, and information management. Programs to improve genetics and chemistry are generally concentrated within a relatively small number of large companies, while non-genetic approaches are underway with broader set of companies.

In general, we believe that our competitors generally fall into the following categories:

&#160;

&#183; 

Large Agricultural Biotechnology, Seed, and Chemical Companies: According to Phillips McDougall, the leading 11 seed and trait companies as a group invested $4.1 billion in seed and trait research and development in 2013. This includes conventional and advanced plant breeding, as well as biotechnology trait development. According to Phillips McDougall, only a limited number of companies have been actively involved in new trait discovery, development, and commercialization: Monsanto, DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, BASF, Bayer, Dow, KWS, and Genective (a joint venture between KWS and Limagrain). Many of these companies have substantially larger budgets for gene discovery, research, development, and product commercialization than we do. Some of these companies also have substantial resources and experience managing the regulatory process for new GM seed traits. Each of Monsanto, DuPont Pioneer, Syngenta, Dow, and Bayer, which accounted for 85% of the 2013 seed trait research and development spend noted above, also have significant chemical crop protection background and businesses. The trait pipelines of these companies are heavily weighted toward biotic stress traits, although they also have significant programs aimed at development of abiotic stress traits. While these companies have internal programs that may compete with our own, they also seek new traits externally and, as such, some of them either currently are, or may in the future be, our collaborators. In addition, some of these companies are currently among our sources for new trait technologies. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Trait Research and Development Companies: There are a number of companies that specialize in research and development of agricultural yield and product quality traits, and we believe that a dozen or more companies, including Evogene, Ceres, and Keygene, among others, are competitors in our field. We believe that these companies typically focus on a limited number of traits, and do not generally have the product development and regulatory infrastructure necessary to bring traits to market. Therefore, they typically license trait technologies to large industry players with in-house development and regulatory capabilities at a relatively early stage of development. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Companies Focused on the Development and Commercialization of Microbial Crop Enhancements: The use of microbial products to enhance cr op performance via application to soil, seed, or to crops directly is an area where increased research and development activity has been underway for the past decade or more. We believe that there are more than 20 companies of varying size working in this space. There have been a number of acquisitions, including Becker Underwood by BASF, and joint collaborations in this space, but multiple independent companies remain, including Verdesian, Rizobacter, Biagro, and Bioconsortia. While these companies could b e considered to compete with us as their products seek to improve crop yields, we believe that such products and our traits may be additive, or synergistic, to our future products in terms of increasing crop yields. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Companies Focused on Farming Data Management, or Precision Agriculture: Within the past several years there has been a rapid increase in technologies and companies focused on acquiring, analyzing, and acting upon data in ways that may improve farm economics via increased crop yield and more efficient management of crop production inputs. Technical approaches include weather prediction and monitoring, high-density field and crop imaging systems, precision field soil and yield mapping, and others. Companies focusing on this space include Trimble, Planet Labs, Ceres Imaging, Blue River, and others. While these products are potentially competitive with us for increasing crop yields, we believe that certain of these products could also be additive or synergistic with our traits. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Agricultural Research Universities and Institutions: Given the global importance of agriculture, numerous agricultural research universities and institutions around the world focus on basic and applied research aimed at increasing crop yield. According to the Agricultural Science and Technology Indicators, global public spending on agricultural research and development in 2008 totaled $31.7 billion, having increased by 22% during the years from 2000 to 2008. Spending in 2008 in high income countries accounted for approximately 51% of the total, while spending in low and middle income countries accounted for 49% of the total. The United States was the largest contributor of public agriculture funding in 2008 with a total investment of $4.8 billion. Most of this publicly funded research is focused on basic research. Many public research programs aim to understand basic biological processes and do not necessarily engage in further development and commercialization of discovered traits. While these programs are potentially competitive with us, we view them primarily as sources of innovation that fit with our business model. We have an established track record of working closely and effectively with public research programs, including a number from the U.S., Canada, Japan, Australia, Spain, Ireland, and elsewhere. 

We believe that we are uniquely positioned at the nexus of basic research and commercial product development. Unlike many companies in our space, we generally do not compete in the area of basic research. Our focus is on development and validation and, therefore, we provide a value-added link by which basic research can be brought to market. Public research institutions provide us with a source of innovative new technologies and traits and while such basic research programs are competitive with in-house programs at the largest seed and technology companies, global public investment in basic research in 2008 at more than $31.0 billion was more than seven times greater than industry spending in 2013. We believe that these public programs are valuable and sustainable sources of new technologies for us and we have earned a reputation in our industry as a trustworthy and effective partner based on our demonstrated ability to manage the development and regulatory processes for GM seeds and capture additional value for ourselves and our basic research collaborators. While internal programs at the largest seed and technology companies are competitive with ours in some cases, we are technology providers to some of these companies, and we have numerous collaborations with many of them. To remain competitive, we plan to pursue multiple strategies, including further building our pipeline of new technologies from basic research programs, increasing the scope and range of our field testing activities, and continuing to protect our intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions globally.

Research and Development 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 48 full-time employees dedicated to research and development, nine of whom are development and field personnel focused on demonstration and research field trials. Our research and development team has technical expertise in molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics and genetic engineering, analytical chemistry, plant physiology, plant virology, molecular pathogenesis, and soil and water science. Our research and development activities are conducted principally at our Davis, California and Seattle, Washington facilities, with ongoing field trials conducted in American Falls, Idaho; Brawley, California; and numerous other locations throughout the United States and at locations managed by our collaborators worldwide. We have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in research and development. Our research and development expenses were $9.0 million and $10.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 80 full-time employees, of whom 12 hold Ph.D. degrees. Approximately 48 employees are engaged in research and development activities, three in business development, three in regulatory management, and 26 in management, operations, accounting/finance, legal, and administration. We consider our employee relations to be good. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreement.

Facilities 

Our corporate headquarters are located in Davis, California, in a facility consisting of approximately 20,775 square feet of office, laboratory, and growth chamber space under a lease that expires on June 30, 2018, pursuant to which we have an option to renew the lease for an additional three-year term. This facility accommodates research and development, operations, analytical services, regulatory, and administrative activities. We also lease approximately 4,381 square feet of office and laboratory space in Seattle, Washington, where our team of scientists executes our TILLING technology platform, under a lease that expires on December 31, 2016. Our administrative offices in Phoenix, Arizona consist of 2,976 square feet under a lease that expires on June 30, 2018 and accommodate finance, legal, and other administrative activities, as well as sales and marketing activities for our Sonova products. We also lease greenhouse space and farm land for agricultural use in Northern California as well as farmland in Idaho. We also lease grain bin and office space in Idaho under a lease that expires on March 3, 2019.

We believe that our leased facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and that, if needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.

Legal Proceedings 

We currently are not a party to any material litigation or other material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.
