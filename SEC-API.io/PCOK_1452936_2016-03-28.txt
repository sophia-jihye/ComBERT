 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

Overview 

KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. was formed on October 8, 2008 as a Maryland corporation and elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2010 and intends to operate in such manner. As used herein, the terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; refer to KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. and as required by context, KBS Strategic Opportunity Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership formed on December 10, 2008 (the &#8220;Operating Partnership&#8221;), and its subsidiaries. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (&#8220;KBS Capital Advisors&#8221;), our external advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement. Our advisor conducts our operations and manages our portfolio of real estate-related investments. Our advisor owns 20,000 shares of our common stock. We have no paid employees. 

On January 8, 2009, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;) to offer a minimum of 250,000 shares and a maximum of 140,000,000 shares of common stock for sale to the public, of which 100,000,000 shares were registered in our primary offering and 40,000,000 shares were registered under our dividend reinvestment plan. The SEC declared our registration statement effective on November 20, 2009. We ceased offering shares of common stock in our primary offering on November 14, 2012. We sold 56,584,976 shares of common stock in the primary offering for gross offering proceeds of $561.7 million . We continue to offer shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan. As of December 31, 2015 , we had sold 5,096,508 shares of common stock under the dividend reinvestment plan for gross offering proceeds of $ 52.8 million . Also as of December 31, 2015 , we had redeemed 3,281,612 &#32;of the shares sold in our offering for $ 38.4 million . Additionally, on December 29, 2011 and October 23, 2012, we issued 220,994 &#32;shares and 55,249 &#32;shares of common stock, respectively, for $2.0 million &#32;and $0.5 million , respectively, in private transactions exempt from the registration requirements pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 10 office properties, one office campus consisting of nine office buildings, one office portfolio consisting of four office buildings and 25 acres of undeveloped land, one office portfolio consisting of three office properties, one retail property, two apartment properties, two investments in undeveloped land encompassing an aggregate of 1,670 acres, one first mortgage loan and two investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. 

Objectives and Strategies 

Our primary investment objectives are: 

&#8226; 

to provide our stockholders with attractive and stable returns; and 

&#8226; 

to preserve and return our stockholders&#8217; capital contributions. 

We have sought to achieve these objectives by investing in and managing a portfolio of real estate-related loans, opportunistic real estate, real estate-related debt securities and other real estate-related investments. We acquired our investments through a combination of equity raised in our initial public offering and debt financing. We plan to lease-up and stabilize existing assets. We plan to explore value-add opportunities for existing assets and seek to realize growth in the value of our investments by timing asset sales to maximize their value. We also intend to actively pursue additional lending and investment opportunities that we believe will provide an attractive risk-adjusted return to our stockholders. 

Real Estate Investments 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned 10 &#32;office properties, one &#32;office campus consisting of nine &#32;office buildings, one &#32;office portfolio consisting of four &#32;office buildings and 25 &#32;acres of undeveloped land, one &#32;office portfolio consisting of three &#32;office properties and one &#32;retail property encompassing, in the aggregate, approximately 4.4 million &#32;rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2015 , these properties were 84% &#32;occupied. In addition, we owned two &#32;apartment properties, containing 383 &#32;units and encompassing approximately 0.3 million &#32;rentable square feet, which were 92% &#32;occupied. We also owned two investments in undeveloped land encompassing an aggregate of 1,670 &#32;acres. In addition, we owned two investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. 

We have attempted to diversify our tenant base in order to limit exposure to any one tenant or industry. As of December 31, 2015, we had no tenants that represented more than 10% of our total annualized base rent and our top ten tenants represented approximately 15% of our total annualized base rent. The total cost of our real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2015 was $914.1 million. For more information about our real estate investments, see Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

&#32;3 

Real Estate-Related Investments 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned one real estate loan receivable with a total book value of $27.9 million. On June 30, 2015, the real estate loan receivable matured without repayment. As a result, on July 1, 2015, we provided notice to the borrower of default and may commence foreclosure proceedings on, or otherwise take title to, the property securing the real estate loan receivable. We did not record a provision for loan loss reserves during the year ended December 31, 2015 as we believe the entire principal balance of $27.9 million related to the real estate loan receivable to be fully recoverable. 

Financing Objectives 

We have financed the majority of our real estate and real estate-related investments with a combination of the proceeds we received from our initial public offering and debt. We used debt financing to increase the amount available for investment and to potentially increase overall investment yields to us and our stockholders. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted&#8209;average interest rate on our debt was 2.5%. 

We borrow funds at both fixed and variable rates; as of December 31, 2015, we had $32.2 million and $518.6 million of fixed and variable rate debt outstanding, respectively. The weighted-average interest rates of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of December 31, 2015 were 4.5% and 2.4%, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2015, using interest rate indices as of December 31, 2015, where applicable. 

Additionally, in March 2016, we, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, issued 970.2 million Israeli new Shekels (approximately $250.0 million) in 4.25% bonds to investors in Israel pursuant to a public offering registered in Israel. The bonds have a seven year term, with 20% of the principal payable each year from 2019 to 2023. We expect to use the proceeds from the issuance of these bonds to make additional investments. 

We have tried to spread the maturity dates of our debt to minimize maturity and refinance risk in our portfolio. In addition, a majority of our debt allows us to extend the maturity dates, subject to certain conditions. Although we believe we will satisfy the conditions to extend the maturity of our debt obligations, we can give no assurance in this regard. The following table shows the current and fully extended maturities, including principal amortization payments, of our debt as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands):

There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow for any single investment. Our charter limits our total liabilities to 75% of the cost of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if a majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of our charter limitation and we disclose such borrowing to our common stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. As of December 31, 2015 , our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 54% &#32;of the cost (before depreciation or other noncash reserves) and book value (before depreciation) of our tangible assets. As a result of the bond issuance referenced above, as of March 8, 2016, our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 64% and 63% of the cost (before depreciation or other noncash reserves) and book value (before depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively. 

We do not intend to exceed the leverage limit in our charter. High levels of debt could cause us to incur higher interest charges and higher debt service payments, which would decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our investors, and could also be accompanied by restrictive covenants. High levels of debt could also increase the risk of being unable to refinance when loans become due, or of being unable to refinance on favorable terms, and the risk of loss with respect to assets pledged as collateral for loans. 

Except with respect to the borrowing limits contained in our charter, we may reevaluate and change our debt policy in the future without a stockholder vote. Factors that we would consider when reevaluating or changing our debt policy include: then-current economic conditions, the relative cost and availability of debt and equity capital, any investment opportunities, the ability of our investments to generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service requirements and other similar factors. Further, we may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to book value in connection with any change of our borrowing policies. 

&#32;4 

Disposition Policies 

The period that we will hold our investments will vary depending on the type of asset, interest rates and other factors. Our advisor has developed a well-defined exit strategy for each investment we have made. KBS Capital Advisors will continually perform a hold-sell analysis on each asset in order to determine the optimal time to hold the asset and generate a strong return for our stockholders. Economic and market conditions may influence us to hold our investments for different periods of time. We may sell an asset before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we disposed of two office properties and 38 acres of undeveloped land resulting in gross sale proceeds of $40.4 million. 

Market Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets 

The following discussion is based on management&#8217;s beliefs, observations and expectations with respect to the real estate and real estate finance markets. 

Current conditions in the global capital markets remain volatile. The slowdown in global economic growth, and the increase in oil production capacity, has had a ripple effect through the energy and commodity markets. Decreasing levels of demand for commodities have led to a weakening of global economic conditions, particularly in emerging market nations. Many nations in the developing world rely on metals, minerals and oil production as the basis of their economies. When demand for these resources drops, the economic environment deteriorates, and deflation becomes a very real risk. Over the past decade the United States has seen a resurgence of the domestic energy markets. The growth of domestic oil and natural gas production helped the U.S. economy rebound from the 2008-2009 recession. During the first quarter of 2016, supply pressures in the energy markets have driven down the price of oil to levels not seen in many years, and U.S. economic growth has slowed. 

Central bank interventions and the use of monetary policy to combat the lingering effects of the 2008-2009 recession continue to affect the global economy. The U.S. Federal Reserve (the &#8220;FED&#8221;) pursued an accommodative monetary policy that included cutting interest rates and implementing a quantitative easing (&#8220;QE&#8221;) program. In 2015, the U.S. economy continued strengthening, and the FED ceased the QE program and raised the Target Funds rate by 25 basis points. In 2012, Japan embarked on a massive QE program designed to kick start the country&#8217;s economy. The Japanese economy remains weak, with little or no economic growth. In Europe, the European Central Bank (&#8220;ECB&#8221;) announced its own QE program in January 2015. The long awaited announcement led to lower European interest rates and a weakening of the Euro against other currencies. With much of the European economy still experiencing low economic growth, the ECB is now poised to increase its QE program. While the intent of these policies is to spur economic growth, the size of these programs is unprecedented, and the ultimate impact on the global financial system is unknown. 

In the United States, recent economic data has been mixed. Slow and steady growth in the labor markets has driven unemployment to 4.9% as of January 2016. The labor force participation rate continues to be relatively low and personal income growth has been modest. Consumer spending in the United States has been increasing, and consumer confidence levels are starting to reach levels last seen in the mid-2000&#8217;s. U.S. gross domestic product (&#8220;U.S. GDP&#8221;) has continued to grow. On an annual basis, U.S. GDP growth in 2014 was 2.4%, which was an improvement over 2013&#8217;s growth rate of 1.5%. In 2015 U.S. GDP growth came in at 2.4%, with the trend moving towards slower growth in the first quarter of 2016. 

With the backdrop of increasing levels of global political conflict, and weaker international economic conditions, the U.S. dollar has remained a safe haven currency. The U.S. commercial real estate market has benefited from strong inflows of foreign capital. In 2015 commercial real estate transaction volumes increased 23%, making 2015 the second highest level of investment volume, behind only 2007. Foreign capital flows represent 17% of the 2015 volume. Initially, gateway markets such as New York City and San Francisco benefited from a high demand for commercial properties. Now investors have branched into secondary and tertiary markets, and demand for investments is leading to price increases and an uptick in construction and development. Some fear the potential creation of an asset bubble, particularly in the gateway metropolitan markets. 

Economic Dependency 

We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the identification, evaluation, negotiation, origination, acquisition and disposition of investments; management of the daily operations and leasing of our investment portfolio; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide the respective services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources. 

&#32;5 

Competitive Market Factors 

The U.S. commercial real estate leasing markets remain competitive. We face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant. As a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected. We may also face competition from other entities that are selling assets. Competition from these entities may increase the supply of real estate investment opportunities or increase the bargaining power of real estate investors seeking to buy. 

Although we believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively. 

Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law 

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. The cost of defending against claims of liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury claims could reduce the amounts available for distribution to our stockholders. 

All of our real estate properties, other than properties acquired through foreclosure, were subject to Phase I environmental assessments at the time they were acquired. Some of the properties we have acquired are subject to potential environmental liabilities arising primarily from historic activities at or in the vicinity of the properties. Based on our environmental diligence and assessments of our properties and our purchase of pollution and remediation legal liability insurance with respect to some of our properties, we do not believe that environmental conditions at our properties are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

Segments 

We have invested in non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets. In general, we intend to hold our investments in non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets for capital appreciation. Traditional performance metrics of non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets may not be meaningful as these investments are generally non-stabilized and do not provide a consistent stream of interest income or rental revenue. These investments exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics. These investments typically involve a higher degree of risk and do not provide a constant stream of ongoing cash flows. As a result, our management views non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets as similar investments. Substantially all of our revenue and net income (loss) is from non-performing loans, opportunistic real estate and other real estate-related assets, and therefore, we currently aggregate our operating segments into one reportable business segment. 

Employees 

We have no paid employees. The employees of our advisor or its affiliates provide management, acquisition, disposition, advisory and certain administrative services for us.
