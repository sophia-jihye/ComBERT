 Item 1. Business 

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K we refer to Arbor Realty Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries as "we," "us," "our," or "the Company" unless we specifically state otherwise or the context indicates otherwise. 

Overview 

Arbor Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation formed in 2003, is a specialized real estate finance company that invests in a diversified portfolio of structured finance assets in the multifamily and commercial real estate markets. We invest primarily in real estate-related bridge and mezzanine loans, including junior participating interests in first mortgages, preferred and direct equity. We may also directly acquire real property and invest in real estate-related notes and certain mortgage-related securities. Our principal business objective is to maximize the difference between the yield on our investments and the cost of financing these investments to generate cash available for distribution, facilitate capital appreciation and maximize total return to our stockholders. 

We conduct substantially all of our operations and investing activities through our operating partnership, Arbor Realty Limited Partnership, and its subsidiaries. We serve as the general partner of our operating partnership, and own a 100% partnership interest in our operating partnership as of December 31, 2015. 

We are organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes. A REIT is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its REIT taxable income that is distributed to its stockholders, provided that at least 90% of taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met. Certain of our assets that produce non-qualifying income are held in taxable REIT subsidiaries. Unlike other subsidiaries of a REIT, the income of a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes. 

We are externally managed and advised by Arbor Commercial Mortgage, LLC ("ACM" or our "Manager"), a national commercial real estate finance company that specializes in debt and equity financing for multifamily and commercial real estate, pursuant to the terms of a management agreement described below. Our Manager provides us with all of the services vital to our operations other than asset management, securitization and certain credit functions, and certain of our executive officers and other staff are employed by our Manager pursuant to the management agreement. The management agreement requires our Manager to manage our business affairs in conformity with policies and investment guidelines that are approved and monitored by our Board of Directors. 

We believe our Manager's experience and reputation positions it to originate attractive investment opportunities for us. Our management agreement with our Manager was developed to capitalize on synergies with our Manager's origination infrastructure, existing business relationships and management expertise. Our Manager has granted us a right of first refusal to pursue all structured finance investment opportunities in the multifamily or commercial real estate markets that are identified by our Manager or its affiliates. Our Manager continues to originate and service multifamily and commercial mortgage loans under Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Federal Housing Administration and conduit commercial lending programs. We believe that the customer relationships established from these lines of business may generate additional real estate investment opportunities for our business. 

Our Investment Strategy 

We invest in bridge and mezzanine loans, including junior participating interests in first mortgages, preferred and direct equity, mortgage-backed securities and other real estate-related assets predominantly in the multifamily and commercial real estate markets and actively manage our investment portfolio. We believe the financing of multifamily and commercial real estate offers 

opportunities that demand customized financing solutions. We believe we can achieve our primary business objectives through the following investment strategies: 

Provide Customized Financing. We provide financing customized to the needs of our borrowers. We target borrowers who have demonstrated a history of enhancing the value of the properties they operate, but whose options may be limited by conventional bank financing and who may benefit from the sophisticated structured finance products we offer. 

Execute Transactions Rapidly. We act quickly and decisively on proposals, provide commitments and close transactions within a few weeks and sometimes days, if required. We believe that rapid execution attracts opportunities from both borrowers and other lenders that would not otherwise be available. We believe our ability to structure flexible terms and close loans in a timely manner gives us a competitive advantage. 

Manage Credit Quality. A critical component of our strategy is our ability to manage the real estate risk that is underwritten by our Manager and us. We actively manage the credit quality of our portfolio by using the expertise of our asset management group, which has a proven track record of structuring and repositioning structured finance investments to improve credit quality and yield. 

Use Our Manager's Relationships with Existing Borrowers. We capitalize on our Manager's reputation in the commercial real estate finance industry. Our Manager has relationships with a large borrower base nationwide. Since our Manager's originators offer senior mortgage loans as well as our structured finance products, we are able to benefit from its existing customer base and use its senior lending business as a potential refinance vehicle for our structured finance assets. 

Leverage the Experience of Executive Officers, Our Manager and Our Employees. Our executive officers and employees, and those of our Manager, have extensive experience originating and managing structured commercial real estate investments. Our senior management team has, on average, over 20 years of experience in the financial services industry. 

Our Targeted Investments 

We pursue lending and investment opportunities with property owners and developers who need interim financing until permanent financing can be obtained. We primarily target transactions where we believe we have competitive advantages, particularly our lower cost structure and in-house underwriting capabilities. Our structured finance investments generally have maturities of two to five years depending on type, have extension options when appropriate, and generally require a balloon payment of principal at maturity. Borrowers in the market for these types of loans include, but are not limited to, owners or developers seeking either to acquire or refurbish real estate or to pay down debt and reposition a property for permanent financing. 

Our investment program emphasizes the following general categories of real estate-related activities: 

Bridge Financing. We offer bridge financing products to borrowers who are typically seeking short-term capital to be used in an acquisition of property. The borrower has usually identified an undervalued asset that has been under managed and/or is located in a recovering market. From the borrower's perspective, shorter term bridge financing is advantageous because it allows for time to improve the property value through repositioning the property without encumbering it with restrictive long-term debt that may not reflect optimal leverage for a non-stabilized property. 

The bridge loans we currently make typically range in size from $5 million to $30 million, have terms of up to five years, and are predominantly secured by first mortgage liens on the property. At December 31, 2015 our target interest rate range is generally 5% to 6% over 30-day LIBOR. 

Additional yield enhancements may include origination fees, deferred interest, yield look-backs, and participating interests, which are equity interests in the borrower that share in a percentage of the underlying cash flows of the property. Borrowers generally use the proceeds of a conventional mortgage to repay a bridge loan. 

Mezzanine Financing. We offer mezzanine financing in the form of loans that are subordinate to a conventional first mortgage loan and senior to the borrower's equity in a transaction. Mezzanine financing may take the form of loans secured by pledges of ownership interests in entities that directly or indirectly control the real property or subordinated loans secured by second mortgage liens on the property. We may also require additional security such as personal guarantees, letters of credit and/or additional collateral unrelated to the property. 

The mezzanine loans we currently make typically range in size from $1 million to $10 million and have terms of up to ten years. At December 31, 2015 our target interest rate is generally 12% to 14%. As in the case with our bridge loans, the yield on these investments may be enhanced by prepaid and deferred interest payments, yield look-backs and participating interests. We hold a majority of our mezzanine loans through subsidiaries of our operating partnership that are pass-through entities for tax purposes. 

Junior Participation Financing. We offer junior participation financing in the form of a junior participating interest in the senior debt. Junior participation financings have the same obligations, collateral and borrower as the senior debt. The junior participation interest is subordinated to the senior debt by virtue of a contractual agreement between the senior debt lender and the junior participating interest lender. 

The junior participation loans we currently make typically range in size from $1 million to $10 million and have terms of up to ten years. At December 31, 2015 our target interest rate is generally 12% to 14%. As in the case with our bridge loans, the yield on these investments may be enhanced by prepaid and deferred interest payments, yield look-backs and participating interests. 

Preferred Equity Investments. We provide financing by making preferred equity investments in entities that directly or indirectly own real property. In cases where the terms of a first mortgage prohibit additional liens on the ownership entity, investments structured as preferred equity in the entity owning the property serve as viable financing substitutes. With preferred equity investments, we typically become a member in the ownership entity. 

The preferred equity investments we currently make typically range in size from $1 million to $10 million and have terms up to ten years. At December 31, 2015 our target return is generally 12% to 14%. 

Other Investment Opportunities 

Real Property. We have, and may in the future, obtain real estate by foreclosure or through partial or full settlement of mortgage debt related to our loans. Our management team may identify such assets and initiate an asset-specific plan to maximize the value of the collateral, which can include appointing a third party property manager, completing the construction or renovation of the property, leasing or increasing the occupancy of the property, or selling the entire asset or a partial interest to a third party. As such, these transactions may require the use of additional capital prior to the completion of the specific plan. Additionally, we may identify real estate investment opportunities such as domestic real estate for repositioning and/or renovation and then disposition at an anticipated significant return. In these situations, we may act solely on our own behalf or in partnership with other investors. Typically, these transactions are analyzed with the expectation that we will have the ability to sell the property within a one to three year time period, achieving a significant return on invested capital. In connection with these transactions, speed of execution is often the most critical component 

to success. We may seek to finance a portion of the acquisition price through short-term financing, if available. Repayment of the short-term financing will either come from the sale of the property or conventional permanent debt. 

Note Acquisitions. We have, and may in the future, acquire real estate notes from lenders in situations where the borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short-term debt and the lender wishes, for a variety of reasons (such as risk mitigation, portfolio diversification or other strategic reasons), to divest certain assets from its portfolio. These notes may be acquired at a discount. In such cases, we intend to use our management resources to resolve any disputes concerning the note or the property securing it and to identify and resolve any existing operational or any other problems at the property. We will then either restructure the debt obligation for immediate resale or sale at a later date, or reposition it for permanent financing. In some instances, we may take title to the property underlying the real estate note. 

Equity Securities. We have, and may in the future, invest in equity securities such as the common stock of a company. Investments in these securities have the risk of stock market fluctuations which may result in the loss of our principal investment. 

Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities. We have, and may in the future, invest in residential mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS"). These securities may be purchased at a premium or discount to their face value, which is amortized or accreted into interest income on an effective yield adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the expected remaining life of the related security as a yield adjustment. These securities may have underlying credit ratings assigned by the three leading nationally recognized rating agencies (Moody's Investor Service, Standard &#38; Poor's and Fitch Ratings) and are generally not insured or otherwise guaranteed. 

Commercial Real Estate Collateralized Debt Obligation Bonds. We have, and may in the future, invest in securities such as commercial real estate collateralized debt obligation ("CDO") bonds. These certificates are usually purchased at a discount to their face value, which is accreted into interest income, if deemed to be collectable, on an effective yield adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the expected remaining life of the related security as a yield adjustment. These securities may have underlying credit ratings assigned by the three leading nationally recognized rating agencies and are generally not insured or otherwise guaranteed. 

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities. We have, and may in the future, invest in commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"). These securities are usually purchased at a discount to their face value which is accreted into interest income, if deemed to be collectable, on an effective yield adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the expected remaining life of the related security as a yield adjustment. These securities may have underlying credit ratings assigned by the three leading nationally recognized rating agencies and are generally not insured or otherwise guaranteed. 

Our Structured Finance Investments 

We own a diversified portfolio of structured finance investments consisting primarily of real estate-related bridge and mezzanine loans, junior participation interests in first mortgages and preferred equity investments. 

At December 31, 2015, we had 128 loans and investments in our portfolio, totaling $1.55 billion. We have an allowance for loan losses of $86.8 million at December 31, 2015 related to nine loans in our portfolio with an aggregate carrying value, before loan loss reserves, of $189.2 million. The loan loss reserves were determined during our quarterly risk rating review process, which is based on several factors including current market conditions, values and the operating status of these properties. We continue to actively manage all loans and investments in the portfolio in a manner consistent with our underwriting and asset management policy and procedures with the goal of maintaining the credit quality of our portfolio and limiting potential losses. 

The overall yield on our loan and investments portfolio in 2015 was 6.67% on average assets of $1.59 billion. This yield was computed by dividing the interest income earned during the year by the average assets during the year. Our cost of funds in 2015 was 4.25% on average borrowings of $1.17 billion. This cost of funds was computed by dividing the interest expense incurred during the year by the average borrowings during the year. 

Our average net investment (average assets less average borrowings) in 2015 was $420.3 million, resulting in average leverage (average borrowings divided by average assets) of 73.6%. Including average junior subordinated notes of $175.9 million as equity, our average leverage was 62.5%. The net interest income earned in 2015 yielded an 11.6% return on our average net investment during the year. This yield was computed by dividing net interest (interest income less interest expense) earned in 2015 by average equity (computed as average assets minus average borrowings) invested during the year. 

Our business plan contemplates that our leverage ratio, including our junior subordinated notes as equity, will be approximately 70% to 80% of our assets in the aggregate. However, including our junior subordinated notes as equity, our leverage is generally not to exceed 80% of the value of our portfolio assets, before loan loss reserves, when considering additional financing sources unless approval to exceed the 80% limit is obtained from our Board of Directors. See "Operating Policies and Strategies" below for further details.

(1) "Weighted Average Pay Rate" is a weighted average, based on the unpaid principal balances of each loan in the portfolio, of the interest rate that is required to be paid monthly as stated in the individual loan agreements. Certain loans and investments that require an additional rate of interest "Accrual Rate" to be paid at the maturity are not included in the weighted average pay rate as shown in the table. (2) "Weighted Average Remaining Maturity" does not include as of right extensions.

Regulatory Aspects of Our Investment Strategy 

Real Estate Exemption from Investment Company Act. We believe that we conduct our business at all times in a manner that avoids registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring "mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate," are currently exempt from registration under the Investment Company Act if they maintain at least 55% of their assets directly in qualifying real estate assets and meet certain other requirements. Assets that qualify for purposes of this 55% test include, among other things, direct investments in real estate and mortgage loans. Our bridge loans, which are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying properties, and our loans that are secured by second mortgage liens on the underlying properties generally qualify for purposes of this 55% test. These two types of loans constituted more than 55% of our assets as of December 31, 2015. Our investment guidelines provide that no more than 15% of our assets may consist of any type of mortgage-related securities and that the percentage of our investments in mortgage-related securities as compared to our structured finance investments be monitored on a regular basis. The regulatory authorities may from time to time review the interpretive guidance under the above exemption. Refer to Item 1A "Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Business" for more information. 

Investment Advisors Act. Our Manager is required to register under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, or the Investment Advisors Act, and is thereby subject to the regulation prescribed by the statute. In addition, our subsidiary, Arbor Realty Collateral Management, LLC, the collateral manager for our collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs"), is also registered under this Act. 

Management Agreement 

Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement, our Manager has agreed to service and manage our investments and to provide us with multifamily and commercial real estate-related structured finance investment opportunities, finance and other services necessary to operate our business. Our Manager is required to provide a dedicated management team to provide these services to us, the members of which will devote as much of their time to our management as our independent 

directors reasonably deem necessary and appropriate, commensurate with our level of activity from time to time. We rely to a significant extent on the facilities and resources of our Manager to conduct our operations. For performing services under the management agreement, our Manager is eligible to receive a base management fee, incentive compensation and "success-based" compensation as described in Note 14&#151;"Agreements and Transactions with Related Parties" of this report. 

Operations 

Our Manager's Investment Services. Under the management agreement, our Manager is responsible for sourcing originations, providing underwriting services and processing approvals for all loans and other investments in our portfolio. Our Manager also provides us with certain administrative loan servicing functions. We are able to capitalize on our Manager's well established operations and services in each area described below. 

Origination. Our Manager originates most of our investments. Our Manager has a network of sales offices in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas. These offices are staffed by approximately 20 loan originators who solicit property owners, developers and mortgage loan brokers. In some instances, the originators accept loan applications meeting our underwriting criteria from a select group of mortgage loan brokers. While a large portion of our Manager's marketing effort occurs at the branch level, our Manager also markets its products in national industry publications and targeted direct mailings. Our Manager markets its own loan offerings and our product offerings using the same methods. Once potential borrowers have been identified, our Manager determines which financing products best meet the borrower's needs. Loan originators in every branch office are able to offer borrowers the full array of our Manager's loan offerings and our structured finance products. After identifying a suitable product, our Manager works with the borrower to prepare a loan application. Upon completion by the borrower, the application is forwarded to our Manager's underwriters for due diligence. 

Underwriting. Our Manager's underwriters perform due diligence on all proposed transactions prior to loan approval and commitment. The underwriters analyze each loan application in accordance with the guidelines set forth below in order to determine the loan's conformity with respect to such guidelines. In general, our Manager's underwriting guidelines require it to evaluate the following: the historic and current property revenues and expenses; the potential for near-term revenue growth and opportunity for expense reduction and increased operating efficiencies; the property's location, its attributes and competitive position within its market; the proposed ownership structure, financial strength and real estate experience of the borrower and property management; third party appraisal, environmental and engineering studies; market assessment, including property inspection, review of tenant lease files, surveys of property comparables and an analysis of area economic and demographic trends; review of an acceptable mortgagee's title policy and an "as built" survey; construction quality of the property to determine future maintenance and capital expenditure requirements; and the requirements for any reserves, including those for immediate repairs or rehabilitation, replacement reserves, tenant improvement and leasing commission costs, real estate taxes and property casualty and liability insurance. Key factors considered in credit decisions include, but are not limited to, debt service coverage, loan to value ratios and property, financial and operating performance. Consideration is also given to other factors, such as the experience and financial strength of the borrower's principals, additional forms of security and identifying likely strategies to affect repayment. Our Manager continuously refines its underwriting criteria based upon actual loan portfolio experience and as market conditions and investor requirements evolve. 

Investment Approval Process. Our Manager applies its established investment approval process to all loans and other investments proposed for our portfolio before submitting each proposal to us for final approval. A written report is generated for every loan or other investment that is submitted to our 

Manager's credit committee for approval. The report includes a description of the prospective borrower and any guarantors, the collateral and the proposed use of investment proceeds, as well as borrower and property financial statements and analysis. In addition, the report includes an analysis of borrower liquidity, net worth, cash investment, income, credit history and operating experience. If the transaction is approved by a majority of our Manager's credit committee, it is presented for approval to our credit committee, which consists of our chief executive officer, chief credit officer, and executive vice president of structured finance. All transactions require the approval of a majority of the members of our credit committee. Following the approval of any such transaction, our Manager's underwriting and servicing departments, together with our asset management group, assure that all loan approval terms have been satisfied and conform with lending requirements established for that particular transaction. If our credit committee rejects the loan and our independent directors allow our Manager or one of its affiliates to pursue it, our Manager will have the opportunity to execute the transaction. 

Servicing. Our Manager services our loans and investments through its internal servicing operations. Our Manager currently services an expanding portfolio, consisting of 2,624 loans with outstanding balances of approximately $12.9 billion through its loan administration department in Buffalo, New York. Our Manager's loan servicing operations are designed to provide prompt customer service and accurate and timely information for account follow up, financial reporting and management review. Following the funding of an approved loan, all pertinent loan data is entered into our Manager's data processing system, which provides monthly billing statements, tracks payment performance and processes contractual interest rate adjustments on variable rate loans. Our Manager works closely with our asset management group to ensure the appropriate level of customer service and monitoring of our loans. 

Our Asset Management Operations. Our asset management group is comprised of 31 employees. Effective asset and portfolio management is essential to maximize the performance and value of a real estate investment. The asset management group customizes an asset management plan with the loan originators and underwriters to track each investment from origination through disposition. This group monitors each investment's operating history, local economic trends and rental and occupancy rates and evaluates the underlying property's competitiveness within its market. This group assesses ongoing and potential operational and financial performance of each investment in order to evaluate and ultimately improve its operations and financial viability. The asset management group performs frequent onsite inspections, conducts meetings with borrowers and evaluates and participates in the budgeting process, financial and operational review and renovation plans of each underlying property. The asset management group also focuses on increasing the productivity of onsite property managers and leasing brokers. This group communicates the status of each transaction against its established asset management plan to senior management, in order to enhance and preserve capital, as well as to avoid litigation and potential exposure. 

Timely and accurate identification of an investment's operational and financial issues and each borrower's objectives is essential to implementing an executable loan workout and restructuring process, if required. Since existing property management may not have the requisite expertise to manage the workout process effectively, our internal asset management group determines the current operating and financial status of an asset or portfolio and performs a liquidity analysis of the property and ownership entity and then, if appropriate, identifies and evaluates alternatives in order to maximize the value of an investment. 

Our asset management group continues to provide its services to our Manager on a limited basis pursuant to the management agreement. In the event the services provided by our asset management group, pursuant to this agreement, exceed more than 15% of the group's cost per quarter, the level anticipated by our Board of Directors, we will negotiate in good faith with our Manager to adjust the base management fee under the management agreement and/or to reduce the time required to be devoted by our asset management group. 

Operating Policies and Strategies 

Investment Guidelines. Our Board of Directors has adopted general guidelines for our investments and borrowings to the effect that: (1) no investment will be made that would cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT; (2) no investment will be made that would cause us to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act; (3) no more than 25% of our equity (including junior subordinated notes as equity), determined as of the date of such investment, will be invested in any single asset; (4) no single mezzanine loan or preferred equity investment will exceed $75 million; (5) our leverage (including junior subordinated notes as equity) will generally not exceed 80% of the unpaid principal balance ("UPB") of our assets, in the aggregate; (6) we will not co-invest with our Manager or any of its affiliates unless such co-investment is otherwise in accordance with these guidelines and its terms are at least as favorable to us as to our Manager or the affiliate making such co-investment; and (7) no more than 15% of our gross assets may consist of mortgage-related securities. Any exceptions to the above general guidelines require the approval of our Board of Directors. 

Financing Policies. We finance the acquisition of our structured finance investments primarily by borrowing against or "leveraging" our existing portfolio and using the proceeds to acquire additional mortgage assets. We expect to incur debt such that we will maintain an equity-to-assets ratio no less than 20% (including junior subordinated notes as equity), although the actual ratio may be lower from time to time depending on market conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our Manager. Our charter and bylaws do not limit the amount of indebtedness we can incur, and the Board of Directors has discretion to deviate from or change our indebtedness policy at any time, provided that we are in compliance with our bank covenants. However, we intend to maintain an adequate capital base to protect against various business environments in which our financing and hedging costs might exceed the interest income from our investments. 

Our investments are financed primarily by CLOs, junior subordinated notes, senior unsecured notes, and through other financing facilities with institutional lenders. Although we expect that these will be the principal means of leveraging our investments, we may issue common stock, preferred stock or secured or unsecured notes of any maturity if it appears advantageous to do so. 

Credit Risk Management Policy. We are exposed to various levels of credit risk depending on the nature of our underlying assets and the nature and level of credit enhancements supporting our assets. We originate or purchase mortgage loans that meet our minimum debt service coverage standards. Our Manager, our chief credit officer, and our asset management group, reviews and monitors credit risk and other risks of loss associated with each investment. In addition, our Manager seeks to diversify our portfolio of assets to avoid undue geographic, issuer, industry and certain other types of concentrations. Our Board of Directors monitors the overall portfolio risk and reviews levels of provision for loss. 

Interest Rate Risk Management Policy. To the extent that it is consistent with our election to qualify as a REIT, we generally follow an interest rate risk management policy intended to mitigate the negative effects of major interest rate changes. We minimize our interest rate risk from borrowings by attempting to structure the key terms of our borrowings to generally correspond to the interest rate terms of our assets. 

We may enter into hedging transactions to protect our investment portfolio from interest rate fluctuations and other changes in market conditions. These transactions may include interest rate swaps, the purchase or sale of interest rate collars, caps or floors, options, mortgage derivatives and other hedging instruments. These instruments may be used to hedge as much of the interest rate risk as our Manager determines is in the best interest of our stockholders, given the cost of such hedges and the need to maintain our status as a REIT. In general, income from hedging transactions does not constitute qualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income requirements. To the extent, 

however, that a hedging contract reduces interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets, any income that is derived from the hedging contract, would not give rise to non-qualifying income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests. Our Manager may elect to have us bear a level of interest rate risk that could otherwise be hedged when it believes, based on all relevant facts, that bearing such risk is advisable. 

To date, we have entered into various interest rate swaps in connection with the issuance of floating rate secured notes, the issuance of variable rate junior subordinated notes and to hedge the interest risk on forecasted outstanding LIBOR based debt. The notional amount of each interest rate swap agreement and the related terms have been designed to protect our investment portfolio from interest rate risk and to match the payment and receipts of interest on the underlying debt instruments, where applicable. 

Disposition Policies. Our Manager evaluates our asset portfolio on a regular basis to determine if it continues to satisfy our investment criteria. Subject to certain restrictions applicable to REITs, our Manager may cause us to sell our investments opportunistically and use the proceeds for debt reduction, additional acquisitions, or working capital purposes. 

Equity Capital Policies. Subject to applicable law, our Board of Directors has the authority, without further stockholder approval, to issue additional authorized common stock and preferred stock or otherwise raise capital, including through the issuance of senior securities, in any manner and on the terms and for the consideration it deems appropriate, including in exchange for property. We may in the future issue common stock in connection with acquisitions. We also may issue units of partnership interest in our operating partnership in connection with acquisitions of property. We may, under certain circumstances, repurchase our common stock in private transactions with our stockholders, if those purchases are approved by our Board of Directors. 

Conflicts of Interest Policies. We, our executive officers, and our Manager face conflicts of interests because of our relationships with each other. Our Manager has approximately 10.5% of the voting interest in our common stock as of December 31, 2015. Mr. Kaufman, our chairman and chief executive officer, is the chief executive officer of our Manager and beneficially owns approximately 92% of the outstanding membership interests of our Manager. Mr. Martello, one of our directors, is the chief operating officer of Arbor Management, LLC (the managing member of our Manager) and a trustee of two trusts that own minority membership interests in our Manager. Mr. Bishar, our secretary, is general counsel to our Manager. Mr. Elenio, our chief financial officer and treasurer, is the chief financial officer of our Manager. Each of Messrs. Kaufman, Martello, Bishar, and Elenio, as well as Mr. Weber, our executive vice president of structured finance, Mr. Kilgore, our executive vice president of structured securitization and Mr. Guziewicz, our chief credit officer, are members of our Manager's executive committee and, excluding Mr. Kaufman, own minority membership interests in our Manager. 

We have implemented several policies, through board action and through the terms of our charter and our agreements with our Manager, to help address these conflicts of interest, including the following: 

&#149; Our charter requires that a majority of our Board of Directors be independent directors and that only our independent directors make any determination on our behalf with respect to the relationships or transactions that present a conflict of interest for our directors or officers. &#149; Our Board of Directors adopted a policy that decisions concerning our management agreement with our Manager, including termination, renewal and enforcement thereof or our participation in any transactions with our Manager or its affiliates outside of the management agreement, including our ability to purchase securities and mortgages or other assets from our Manager, or our ability to sell securities and assets to our Manager, must be reviewed and approved by a majority of our independent directors. 11 

&#149; Our management agreement provides that our determination to terminate the management agreement for cause, because the management fees are unfair to us, or because of a change in control of our Manager, will be made by a majority vote of our independent directors. &#149; Our independent directors will periodically review the general investment standards established by our Manager under the management agreement. &#149; Our management agreement provides that our Manager may not assign duties under the management agreement, except to certain affiliates of our Manager, without the approval of a majority of our independent directors. &#149; Our management agreement provides that decisions to approve or reject investment opportunities rejected by our credit committee that our Manager or Mr. Kaufman wish to pursue will be made by a majority of our independent directors. Our Board of Directors has approved the operating policies and the strategies set forth above. Our Board of Directors has the power to modify or waive these policies and strategies, or amend our agreements with our Manager, without the consent of our stockholders to the extent that the Board of Directors determines that such modification or waiver is in the best interest of our stockholders. Among other factors, developments in the market that either affect the policies and strategies mentioned herein or that change our assessment of the market may cause our Board of Directors to revise its policies and strategies. However, if such modification or waiver involves the relationship of, or a transaction between us, and our Manager, the approval of a majority of our independent directors is also required. We may not, however, amend our charter to change the requirement that a majority of our board consists of independent directors or the requirement that our independent directors approve related party transactions without the approval of two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by our stockholders. 

Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Laws 

Properties that we may acquire directly or indirectly through partnerships, and the properties underlying our structured finance investments and mortgage-related securities, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. Under these laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner of real estate (including, in certain circumstances, a secured lender that acquires ownership or control of a property) may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at, on, under or in its property. These laws typically impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or control party knew of or was responsible for the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of these substances may be substantial and could exceed the value of the property. An owner or control party of a site may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from a site. Certain environmental laws also impose liability in connection with the handling of or exposure to materials containing asbestos. These laws allow third parties to seek recovery from owners of real properties for personal injuries associated with materials containing asbestos. Our operating costs and the values of these assets may be adversely affected by the obligation to pay for the cost of complying with existing environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, as well as the cost of complying with future legislation, and our income and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be affected adversely by the existence of an environmental liability with respect to properties we may acquire. We will endeavor to ensure that these properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. 

Competition 

Our net income depends, in large part, on our Manager's ability to originate structured finance investments with spreads over our borrowing costs. In originating these investments, our Manager competes with other mortgage REITs, specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, other lenders, governmental bodies and other entities, some of which may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital available to them. In addition, there are numerous mortgage REITs with asset acquisition objectives similar to ours, and others may be organized in the future. The existence of additional REITs may increase competition for the available supply of structured finance assets suitable for purchase by us. Competitive variables include market presence and visibility, size of loans offered and underwriting standards. To the extent that a competitor is willing to risk larger amounts of capital in a particular transaction or to employ more liberal underwriting standards when evaluating potential loans, our origination volume and profit margins for our investment portfolio could be impacted. Our competitors may also be willing to accept lower returns on their investments and may succeed in buying the assets that we have targeted for acquisition. Although management believes that we are well positioned to continue to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there can be no assurance that we will do so or that we will not encounter further increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to compete effectively. 

Employees 

We have 39 employees, including Messrs. Kaufman, Weber, Kilgore and Guziewicz, and including a 31 person asset management group. Mr. Elenio is a full time employee of our Manager and is not directly compensated by us (other than an annual bonus and pursuant to our equity incentive plans), however, a portion of his compensation is reimbursed by the management fee that we pay to our Manager. Beginning January 1, 2014, Mr. Ivan Kaufman is compensated directly as our employee. 

Corporate Governance and Internet Address
