 Item 1. Business. 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 26, 2010. On March 11, 2014, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to (i) change our name from "Oconn Industries Corp." to "Diamante Minerals, Inc." and (ii) increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 75,000,000 shares to 300,000,000 shares.

&#160;

On February 10, 2014, we entered into a letter agreement with Mineracao Batovi Ltda. (&#8220;Mineracao Batovi&#8221;), a Brazilian mineral exploration and mining company, to acquire up to a 75% interest in a diamond exploration project located to the north of Paranatinga in Mato Grosso, Brazil (the "Batovi Diamond Project") and form a joint venture valued at approximately $12 million. The letter agreement has been superseded by our definitive agreement with Mineracao Batovi that was executed and delivered on November 20, 2014. As described in more detail below, we will be required to contribute $1,000,000 in cash to Mineracao Batovi in order to acquire an initial 20% equity interest in that company. Mineracao Batovi holds the mineral claims underlying the Batovi Diamond Project. We may earn an additional 29% equity interest in Mineracao Batovi by funding a further $2,000,000 of exploration expenses no later than November 20, 2017.

&#160;

Our Company is an exploration stage company; at present, there is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on the properties comprising the Batovi Diamond Project in which we hold the right to earn up to a 75% indirect interest, as described in more detail below.

As discussed elsewhere in this annual report, pursuant to an agreement dated January 22, 2016, we have acquired a limited royalty on the first 2,000 ounces of gold that may be produced per month at Petaquilla Minerals Ltd.&#8217;s Molejon Gold Mine located in Donoso District, Colon Province, Republic of Panama. Our royalty right is contingent on our advancing to Blendcore LLC, as borrower and as the operator of certain proposed operations at the Molejon Gold Mine, the final tranche of a loan in the total principal amount of $250,000. The funds are to be advanced in accordance with a budget for the restart of processing of stockpiled ore at the Mine, which has been annexed to the loan agreement dated January 22, 2016 among our Company, Blendcore and Petaquilla Minerals&#8217; subsidiary, Petaquilla Gold, S.A. As of July 31, 2016, our Company had advanced $215,000 to Blendcore under the loan agreement.

&#160;

We currently have no interests in any other mineral exploration projects, and we are a shell company for the purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The mining industry is intensely competitive in all its phases and the Company competes with other companies that have greater financial resources and technical capacity. The Company continues to compete with a number of companies for the acquisition of mineral properties. The ability for the Company to replace or increase its mineral reserves and mineral resources in the future will depend on its ability to develop its present properties and also to select and acquire economic producing properties or prospects for diamond extraction.

&#160;

Licenses, permits and approvals 

&#160;

The Company's operations require licenses, permits and approvals from various governmental authorities. Such licenses and permits are subject to change in various circumstances and certain permits and approvals are required to be renewed from time to time. Additional permits or permit renewals will need to be obtained in the future. The granting, renewal and continued effectiveness of these permits and approvals are, in most cases, subject to some level of discretion by the applicable regulatory authority. Certain governmental approval and permitting processes are subject to public comment and can be appealed by project opponents, which may result in significant delays or in approvals being withheld or withdrawn.

&#160;

Should the Company not be able to obtain or maintain all necessary licenses and permits as are required to explore and develop its properties, commence construction or operation of mining facilities and properties under exploration or development, or to maintain continued operations that economically justify the cost, it could materially and adversely affect the Company's operations.

&#160;

Foreign operations risk 

&#160;

The Company's current potential significant projects are located in Brazil. Foreign countries exposes the Company to risks that may not otherwise be experienced if its operations were domestic. The risks include, but are not limited to, environmental protection, land use, water use, health safety, labor, restrictions on production, price controls, currency remittance, and maintenance of mineral tenure and expropriation of property. For example, changes to regulations in Brazil relating to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of diamonds and environmental protection, may result in the Company not receiving an adequate return on investment capital.

&#160;

Although the operating environments in Brazil is considered favorable compared to those in other developing countries, there are still political risks. These risks include, but are not limited to: terrorism, hostage taking, military repression, expropriation, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, high rates of inflation and labor unrest. Changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitudes in these countries may also adversely affect the Company's business. In addition, there may be greater exposure to a risk of corruption and bribery (including possible prosecution under the federal Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act). Also, in the event of a dispute arising in foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts and may be hindered or prevented from enforcing its rights. Furthermore, it is possible that future changes in taxes in any of the countries in which the Company operates will adversely affect the Company's operations and economic returns.
