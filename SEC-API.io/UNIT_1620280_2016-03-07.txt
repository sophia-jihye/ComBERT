 Item 1. Business. 

The Company 

Communications Sales &#38; Leasing, Inc. (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;CS&#38;L,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) was incorporated in the state of Delaware in February 2014 and reorganized in the state of Maryland on September 4, 2014 as a subsidiary of Windstream Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;Windstream Holdings&#8221; and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries &#8220;Windstream&#8221;). On April 24, 2015, CS&#38;L was separated and spun-off from Windstream (the &#8220;Spin-Off&#8221;) and, in connection therewith, Windstream contributed certain telecommunications network assets, including fiber and copper networks and other real estate (the &#8220;Distribution Systems&#8221;) and a small consumer competitive local exchange carrier (&#8220;CLEC&#8221;) business (the &#8220;Consumer CLEC Business&#8221;) to CS&#38;L. In the Spin-off, Windstream distributed approximately 80.4% of the total outstanding common stock of CS&#38;L to existing stockholders of Windstream Holdings in a tax-free spin-off. Windstream retained the remaining 19.6% of CS&#38;L shares. 

&#160;

We incurred approximately $3.65 billion in long-term debt in connection with the Spin-Off, consisting of approximately $1.51 billion of notes and approximately $2.14 billion in term loans under our senior secured credit facilities. Our senior secured credit facilities also include a $500 million revolving credit facility, which is undrawn as of the date of this Annual Report. Immediately after the Spin-Off, we and Windstream Holdings entered into a long-term exclusive triple-net-lease agreement (&#8220;the Master Lease&#8221;), under which Windstream Holdings leases the Distribution Systems. We intend to elect on our U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year ended December 31, 2015 to be treated as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;).

Recent Developments 

On January 7, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;) to acquire PEG Bandwidth, LLC (&#8220;PEG&#8221;). PEG is a leading provider of infrastructure solutions including cell site backhaul and dark fiber for telecom carriers and enterprises. PEG has an extensive fiber network consisting of over 300,000 strand miles in the Northeast / Mid Atlantic, Illinois and South Central regions of the U.S. Upon closing, the PEG transaction will diversify our portfolio and is expected to contribute approximately 10% consolidated annualized revenues. The purchase price for all outstanding equity interests of PEG is valued at $409 million, subject to adjustment, and will include $315 million of cash, issuance of one million shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, and the issuance of 87,500 shares of the Company&#8217;s 3% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary terms and conditions. At the closing of the transaction, which we anticipate will occur in April 2016, our board of directors will increase the number of directors serving on the board by one director and will nominate an individual designated by PEG Holdings (and reasonably acceptable to CS&#38;L) to fill the newly created vacancy .

Business 

We are an internally managed real estate investment trust engaged in the acquisition and construction of mission critical infrastructure in the communications industry. We are principally focused on acquiring and constructing fiber optic broadband networks, wireless communications towers, copper and coaxial broadband networks and data centers. We currently own 3.6 million fiber strand miles, 230,800 route miles of copper, and other property across 29 states. Presently, our primary source of revenue is rental revenues from leasing the Distribution Systems to Windstream Holdings under the Master Lease. 

&#160;

We expect to grow and diversify our portfolio and tenant base by pursuing a range of transaction structures with communication service providers, including, (i) Sale Leaseback Transactions, whereby we acquire existing infrastructure assets from communication service providers and lease them back on a long-term basis; (ii) Whole Company Acquisitions, which may include the use of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (each, a "TRS"), which are permitted under the tax laws to acquire non-REIT operating businesses and assets; (iii) Capital Investment Financing, whereby we offer communication service providers a cost efficient method of raising funds for discrete capital investments to upgrade or expand their network; and (iv) Mergers and Acquisitions Financing, whereby we facilitate mergers and acquisition ("M&#38;A") transactions as a capital partner. 

&#160;

We have the flexibility to create tax-efficient, tailored solutions for communication service providers seeking to monetize or invest in their communication infrastructure assets or seeking to fund acquisitions in the communication service sector. We believe the opportunities afforded by this flexibility will assist us in diversifying away from the single tenant model we operate under today. In addition, our ability to make acquisitions and operate assets in a TRS will allow us to seize upon market trends and further diversify our holdings. We believe our existing liquidity and REIT structure will provide us with access to capital at attractive costs to pursue these transactions. 

We conduct the Consumer CLEC Business through Talk America Services, LLC, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CS&#38;L ("Talk America"). Talk America provides local telephone, high-speed Internet and long distance service to approximately 

46,000 customers principally located in 17 states across the eastern and central United States. CS&#38;L a nd Talk America have jointly elected for Talk America to be treated as a TRS for federal income tax purposes. As a TRS, Talk America generally may provide services and engage in activities that we may not engage in directly without adversely affecting our qualification as a REIT. 

For the period April 24, 2015 to December 31, 2015, we had revenues of $476.3 million, net income available to common shareholders of $23.7 million, Funds From Operations (&#8220;FFO&#8221;) of $259.8 million and Adjusted Funds From Operations (&#8220;AFFO&#8221;) of $267.1 million. Both FFO and AFFO are non-GAAP financial measures, which we use in our analysis of our results. Refer to Part II, Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for additional information regarding these non-GAAP measures. We manage our operations in two reportable business segments: Leasing and Consumer CLEC. Our Leasing segment represents our REIT operations and corporate expenses not directly attributable to the Consumer CLEC segment. The Consumer CLEC segment represents the operations of our Consumer CLEC Business and corporate expenses directly attributable to the operation of that business. Detailed information about our segments can be found in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . 

Industry 

CS&#38;L is the first and only REIT primarily focused on the acquisition and construction of mission critical infrastructure in the communications industry. We believe we will benefit from this first mover competitive advantage as we seek to grow and diversify our portfolio and tenant base. 

&#160;

We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of favorable Internet, data, and wireless growth trends driving ongoing demand for bandwidth infrastructure and communication sites, and to be an active participant in the consolidation of the telecommunications industry. The growth and expansion of wireless services, cloud-based computing, video, mobile and social media applications, machine-to-machine connectivity, and other bandwidth-intensive applications, continues to drive rapidly increasing consumption of bandwidth on a global basis. This growth in consumption requires the support of robust communications infrastructure, of which fiber networks and communications towers are critical components. We believe this considerable demand creates tremendous opportunities for us as an acquirer and operator, and as a funding source for operators looking to capitalize on these trends through build outs and/or acquisitions of infrastructure assets.

&#160;

There is a large universe of potential partners and/or acquisition targets in the fragmented telecom industry. These include:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Fiber Network Providers : Over 2,000 independent small companies that may build fiber and copper networks to capitalize on the wireless backhaul and broadband demand. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Wireless Tower Operators : National wireless carriers who have demonstrated a willingness to lease, and not own, thousands of wireless towers operated by them. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Ground Lease Lessors : Multitudes of third parties owning the land where communications infrastructure assets are located who may desire to monetize the underlying ground lease. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Other Partners : Data center owners, wireline providers with large copper/coaxial networks, with millions of access lines, requiring upgrades to remain competitive in the market and non-traditional buyers of communication networks looking to capitalize on the large growth in demand for data bandwidth. 

&#160;

We benefit from a large universe of potential existing operator counterparties, which provides us with the opportunity to:

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Acquire additional communication service assets through sale leaseback transactions or other transactions : There are approximately 186 million fiber route miles worldwide, 124,700 existing cell towers in North America, and 133 million copper / coaxial connections in the United States, according to a 2013 Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) report. CS&#38;L currently represents less than 2% of these markets. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Provide cost-efficient passive funding to telecom providers for network investment or M&#38;A activity : Public telecom companies' aggregate spend on capital expenditures in 2014 was $62 billion according to S&#38;P Capital IQ. In addition, annual fiber investment was approximately $15 billion from 2006 to 2011 as reported by industry research firm CRU Group. Furthermore, announced U.S. telecom M&#38;A activity was $71 billion between May 1, 2014 and May 27, 2015 according to ThomsonOne. 

Growth Strategy 

Our primary goal is to create long-term shareholder value by (i) generating reliable and growing cash flows, (ii) diversifying our tenant and asset base, (iii) paying a consistent dividend, and (iv) maintaining our financial strength and liquidity. To achieve this goal, we plan to employ a business strategy that leverages our first mover advantage in the sector and our strong access to the capital markets. We intend to pursue investment opportunities that meet our investing and financing objectives where we can earn attractive risk-adjusted rates of return. The key components of our business strategy include: 

Acquire Additional Infrastructure Assets Through Sale Leaseback Transactions 

We are actively seeking to acquire communications infrastructure assets from communication service providers and lease these assets back to the communication service providers on a long-term basis. We believe this type of transaction benefits the communication service providers with incremental liquidity which can be used to reduce indebtedness or for other investment, while they continue to focus on their existing business. We will employ a disciplined, opportunistic acquisition strategy and seek to price transactions appropriately based on, among other things, growth opportunities, the mix of assets acquired, length and terms of the lease, and credit worthiness of the tenant. 

Acquire Whole Companies Leveraging Our TRS Capacity 

Under our REIT structure, we have capacity through TRSs to acquire up to 25% of the total REIT asset value in non-REIT operating businesses and assets by way of whole company acquisitions or otherwise, giving us the option to operate the newly acquired business, sell the entire business or sell only the operations of the business and lease the network assets to an operator. This provides us with additional flexibility as we explore opportunities for growth. 

Fund Capital Extensions and Improvements of Infrastructure Assets For Existing and New Tenants 

We believe the communications infrastructure industry in the U.S. is currently going through an upgrade cycle driven by the consumer's general desire for greater bandwidth and wireless services. These upgrades require significant capital expenditures, and we believe CS&#38;L provides an attractive, non-competitive funding source for communication service providers to help accelerate the expansion of their networks at an attractive cost of capital. 

We intend to support our tenant operators and other communication service providers by providing capital to them for a variety of purposes, including capacity augmentation projects, tower construction and network expansions. We expect to structure these investments as lease arrangements that produce additional rents. 

Facilitate M&#38;A Transactions in the Communication Service Sector as a Capital Partner 

We believe CS&#38;L can provide cost efficient funds to potential acquirors in the communication service sector, and thereby facilitate M&#38;A transactions as a capital partner. The highly fragmented nature of the communication service sector is expected to result in more consolidation, which we believe will provide ample opportunity for CS&#38;L to pursue these types of transactions. Over the last 5 years, there has been approximately $268 billion in telecom-focused M&#38;A volume in the U.S. according to Securities Data Company. 

Diversify Tenant Relationships 

We are actively pursuing new leasing relationships with potential tenants and communication service providers in order to expand our mix of tenants and other real property and, in doing so, to reduce our concentration with Windstream. We expect that this objective will be achieved over time as part of our overall strategy is to acquire new distribution systems and other real property within the communications infrastructure industry to further diversify our overall portfolio. Once closed, we anticipate revenues generated by PEG will represent approximately 10% of our consolidated annualized revenues.

Maintain Balance Sheet Strength and Liquidity 

We seek to maintain a capital structure that provides the resources and financial flexibility to position us to capitalize on strategic growth opportunities. Our access to, and cost of, external capital is dependent on various factors, including general market conditions, credit ratings on our securities, interest rates and expectations of our future business performance. We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet through disciplined use of leverage, striving to lower our relative cost of capital over time, and continuing to have access to multiple sources of capital and liquidity. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $642.5 million of liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $142.5 million and $500 million of unused borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility. All of our debt is either fixed rate debt, or floating rate debt that we have fixed through the use of interest rate swaps. 

Competition 

We compete for investments in the communications industry with telecommunications companies, investment companies, private equity funds, hedge fund investors, sovereign funds and other REITs who focus primarily on specific segments of the communications infrastructure industry. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we have. However, we believe that the Spin-Off has given us a competitive edge and positioned us to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives. 

In addition, revenues from our network properties are dependent, to an extent, on the ability of our operating partners, like Windstream, to compete with other communication service providers. The communications infrastructure industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants, including many local, regional and global corporations. Not only is competition seen in the communication distribution systems business, but also in any means by which information is transferred. 

&#160;

We believe that we have significant competitive advantages that support our leadership position in owning, funding the construction of and leasing communications infrastructure, including: 

First Mover Advantage; Uniquely Positioned to Capitalize on Expansion Opportunities 

We are the first and only REIT primarily focused on acquisition and construction of mission critical infrastructure in the communications industry. We believe this provides us with a significant first mover competitive advantage to capitalize on the large and fragmented telecom infrastructure industry. Additionally, we believe our position, scale and national reach will help us achieve operational efficiencies and support future growth opportunities. 

Large Scale Anchor Tenant; Stable Rent Revenues 

We believe the assets we lease to Windstream under the Master Lease are critical for Windstream to successfully run its business and operations. Windstream, as our anchor tenant, provides us with a base of stable and highly predictable rent revenues as an initial platform for us to grow and diversify our portfolio and tenant base. 

Windstream is a publicly-traded company that provides advanced network communications, including cloud computing and managed services, to businesses nationwide. Windstream also offers broadband, phone and digital TV services to consumers primarily in rural areas. Windstream continues to operate the Distribution Systems, hold the associated regulatory licenses and own and operate other assets, including distribution systems in select states not included in the Spin-Off. 

Windstream has a diverse customer base, encompassing enterprise and small business customers, carriers and consumers. The Distribution Systems assets that we lease to Windstream are located in 29 different states across the continental United States. The properties in any one state do not account for more than 20% of the total route miles in our network. We believe this geographic diversification will limit the effect of changes in any one market on our overall performance. 

Windstream is subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, which include the requirements to file annual reports containing audited financial information and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial information. Windstream's filings with the SEC can be found at www.sec.gov. Windstream's filings are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report. 

Strong Relationships with Communication Service Providers 

Members of our management team have developed an extensive network of relationships with qualified local, regional and national communication service providers across the United States. This extensive network has been built by our management team through decades of operating experience, involvement in industry trade organizations and the development of banking relationships and investor relations within the communications infrastructure industry. We believe these strong relationships will allow us to effectively source investment opportunities from communication service providers other than Windstream. We intend to work collaboratively with our operating partners in providing expansion capital at attractive rates to help them achieve their growth and business objectives. We will seek to partner with communication service providers who possess local market knowledge, demonstrate hands-on management and have proven track records. 

Experienced and Committed Management Team 

Our senior management team is comprised of veteran leaders with strong backgrounds in their respective disciplines. As a result of extensive public company experience, our senior management team has over [70] years of combined experience in managing 

teleco mmunications operations, consummating mergers and acquisitions and accessing both debt and equity capital markets to fund growth and maintain a flexible capital structure. 

Insurance 

We maintain, or will require in our leases, including the Master Lease, that our tenants maintain, all applicable lines of insurance on our properties and their operations. Under the Master Lease, Windstream has the right to self-insure or use a captive provider with respect to its insurance obligations. We believe that the amount and scope of insurance coverage provided by our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants are customary for similarly situated companies in the telecommunications industry. However, we cannot assure you that our tenants will maintain the required insurance coverages, and the failure by any of them to do so could have a material adverse effect on us. We also cannot assure you that we will continue to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our leases, including the Master Lease, that such insurance will be available at a reasonable cost in the future or that the insurance coverage provided will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event, nor can we assure you of the future financial viability of the insurers. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had 37 full-time employees, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

Significant Customers 

Currently all of our leasing revenues are derived from leasing our Distribution Systems to Windstream Holdings pursuant to the Master Lease. 

Government Regulation, Licensing and Enforcement 

As operators of telecommunications facilities, Windstream and any future tenants of our telecommunications assets are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local telecommunications laws and regulations. The FCC regulates interstate matters, and state public utility commissions ("PUCs") regulate intrastate matters. These regulations are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants to civil, criminal and administrative sanctions. We expect that the telecommunications industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation. Changes in laws and regulations and reimbursement enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by our tenants could have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely affect us, as detailed below and set forth under "Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Business." 

The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations generally applicable to operators of our telecommunications facilities, and in certain cases, to us. 

Windstream and similarly situated wireline carriers are subject to federal and state regulations that limit their pricing flexibility for regulated voice and high-speed Internet products, subject them to service quality, service reporting and other obligations and expose them to the reduction of revenue from changes to the universal service fund, the intercarrier compensation system, or access to interconnection with competitors' facilities. PUCs have jurisdiction over local and intrastate services, including, to some extent, the rates that carriers charge and service quality standards. The FCC has primary jurisdiction over interstate services, including the rates that carriers charge other telecommunications companies that use a carrier's network and other issues related to interstate service. In some circumstances, these regulations restrict the carrier's ability to adjust rates to reflect market conditions and may affect the ability of our tenants to compete and respond to changing industry conditions. 

Talk America operates the Consumer CLEC Business as a reseller of telecommunication services pursuant to the Wholesale Master Services Agreement. In almost all cases, Windstream does not own the underlying telecommunication facilities required to support the Consumer CLEC Business, rather it is a reseller of facility-based services pursuant to wholesale interconnection agreements with the third party carriers who own the underlying telecommunication facilities. Talk America is regulated as a CLEC in each state where it has Consumer CLEC Business customers. These CLEC certifications subject Talk America to regulations requiring it to file and maintain tariffs for the rates charged to its Consumer CLEC Business customers for regulated services and to comply with service quality, service reporting and other obligations. Talk America's ability to operate the Consumer CLEC Business is dependent on existing telecommunication regulations that allow access to such underlying facilities of other carriers at reasonable rates. 

We believe that we have structured the operations for our core real estate business in a manner that will not require us to become regulated as a public utility or common carrier by the FCC or PUCs. 

Future revenues, costs and capital investment in the communication businesses of Windstream, Talk America and other carriers could be adversely affected by material changes to, or decisions regarding applicability of, government requirements, including, but not limited to, changes in rules governing intercarrier compensation, interconnection access to network facilitie s, state and federal universal service fund (&#8220;USF&#8221;) support and other pricing and requirements. Federal and state communications laws may be amended in the future, and other laws may affect our business. In addition, certain laws and regulations applicable to us and our competitors may be, and have been, challenged in the courts and could be changed at any time. We cannot predict future developments or changes to the regulatory environment or the impact such developments or changes would have. 

In addition, these regulations could create significant compliance costs for us. Delays in obtaining certifications and regulatory approvals could cause us to incur substantial legal and administrative expenses, and conditions imposed in connection with such approvals could adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers. The business of Windstream, Talk America, and future tenants also may be affected by legislation and regulation imposing new or greater obligations related to, for example, assisting law enforcement, bolstering homeland and cyber-security, protecting intellectual property rights of third parties, minimizing environmental impacts, protecting customer privacy, or addressing other issues that affect the business of our tenants. 

Environmental Matters 

A wide variety of federal, state and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations affect telecommunications operations and facilities. These complex laws, and their enforcement, involve a myriad of regulations, many of which involve strict liability on the part of the potential offender. Some of these federal, state and local laws may directly impact us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, an owner of real property, such as us, may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances at, under or disposed of in connection with such property, as well as other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal property damages and the owner's liability therefore could exceed or impair the value of the property and/or the assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral, which, in turn, could reduce revenues.
