 Item 1. Business. 

General Development of Business 

Overview 

W. P. Carey Inc., or W. P. Carey, is, together with our consolidated subsidiaries and predecessors, a self-managed diversified REIT and a leading global owner and manager of commercial real estate, primarily net leased to companies on a long-term basis. The majority of our revenues are lease revenues, which are derived from our owned real estate portfolio. In addition, we earn fee revenue by acting as an advisor to a series of income-oriented, non-traded REITs through our investment management business. 

Our owned real estate portfolio, which we believe is diversified by property type, tenant, tenant industry, and geographic location, is comprised primarily of single-tenant office, industrial, warehouse, and retail facilities that are essential to our corporate tenants&#8217; operations. We have 222 &#32;corporate tenants and own 869 &#32;properties in 19 &#32;countries. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 64.0% &#32;of our contractual minimum annualized base rent, or ABR, was generated by properties located in the United States and approximately 36.0% &#32;was generated by properties located outside the United States, primarily in Western and Northern European countries. 

The vast majority of our leases specify a base rent with scheduled rent increases, either fixed or tied to an inflation-related index, and require our tenants to pay substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the property, including the real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance of the facilities. See Our Portfolio &#32;below for more information on the characteristics of our properties. Furthermore, we actively manage our owned real estate portfolio to try to mitigate risk with respect to changes in tenant credit quality and the likelihood of lease renewal. 

Originally founded in 1973, we operated primarily as a sponsor of and advisor to a series of income-generating investment programs under the Corporate Property Associates, or CPA &#174; , brand name until we reorganized as a REIT in September 2012 in connection with our merger with Corporate Property Associates 15 Incorporated, or CPA &#174; :15, referred to as the CPA &#174; :15 Merger. On January 31, 2014, Corporate Property Associates 16 &#8211; Global Incorporated, or CPA &#174; :16 &#8211; Global, merged with and into us, based on a merger agreement dated as of July 25, 2013, referred to as the CPA &#174; :16 Merger ( Note 3 ). 

Our shares of common stock are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#8220;WPC&#8221;. 

Headquartered in New York, we also have offices in Dallas, London, Amsterdam, and Shanghai. At December 31, 2015 , we employed 314 &#32;individuals. 

Financial Information About Segments 

Our business operates in two segments &#8211; Real Estate Ownership and Investment Management, as described below. 

Narrative Description of Business 

Business Objectives and Strategy 

Our primary business objective is to increase stockholder value through accretive acquisitions for our owned real estate portfolio and to grow the assets managed by our investment management operations, which in turn will allow us to grow earnings and to maintain or increase our dividend. 

Our investment strategy primarily focuses on owning and actively managing a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate that is net leased to credit-worthy companies globally. We believe that many companies prefer to lease rather than own their corporate real estate. We structure long-term financing for our corporate tenants primarily in the form of sale-leaseback transactions, through which we acquire what we believe is a company&#8217;s essential real estate and then lease it back to them on a long-term net lease basis, which typically produces a more predictable income stream compared to other types of real estate investments and requires minimal capital expenditures.

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; &#160; 

We actively manage our real estate portfolio to mitigate risk with respect to any changes in tenant credit quality and probability of lease renewal. We believe that diversification with respect to property type, tenant, tenant industry, and geographic location is an important component of portfolio risk management and that we own a portfolio of real estate that is well-diversified across each of these categories. 

In addition to managing our owned real estate portfolio, we currently act as the advisor to a series of publicly-owned, non-traded REITs &#32; for which we raise equity capital through public offerings of their shares, invest those funds, and manage their assets in return for fee revenue as specified in our advisory agreements with them. Since 1979, we have sponsored a series of 17 income-generating investment programs under the CPA &#174; &#32;brand name that invest primarily in commercial real estate properties net leased to single tenants. At December 31, 2015 , we were the advisor to Corporate Property Associates 17 &#8211; Global Incorporated, or CPA &#174; :17 &#8211; Global, and Corporate Property Associates 18 &#8211; Global Incorporated, or CPA &#174; :18 &#8211; Global. We were the advisor to CPA &#174; :16 &#8211; Global until the CPA &#174; :16 Merger on January 31, 2014. We refer to CPA &#174; :16 &#8211; Global, CPA &#174; :17 &#8211; Global, and CPA &#174; :18 &#8211; Global together as the CPA &#174; REITs. 

At December 31, 2015 , we were also the advisor to Carey Watermark Investors Incorporated, referred to as CWI 1, and Carey Watermark Investors 2 Incorporated, or CWI 2, two publicly-owned, non-traded REITs that invest in lodging and lodging-related properties. We refer to CWI 1 and CWI 2 together as the CWI REITs, and, together with the CPA &#174; &#32;REITs, as the Managed REITs ( Note 4 ). At December 31, 2015 , we also served as the advisor to Carey Credit Income Fund, or CCIF, a business development company, or BDC, which is the master fund in a master/feeder fund structure. We refer to CCIF and the two feeder funds of CCIF, or the CCIF Feeder Funds, collectively as the Managed BDCs and, together with the Managed REITs, as the Managed Programs. See Significant Developments in Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;for a summary of the funds we have raised on behalf of the Managed Programs. 

We believe that our owned real estate investments provide our stockholders with a stable, growing source of income, primarily from lease revenues. We also believe that the fee income we generate from our advisory contracts with the Managed Programs provides our stockholders with attractive sources of additional income, a portion of which is more variable in nature. 

We have two primary reportable segments, Real Estate Ownership and Investment Management. These segments are each described below. 

Real Estate Ownership 

We own and invest in commercial real estate properties primarily located in the United States and Europe and leased on a triple-net lease basis, which requires the tenant to pay substantially all of the costs associated with operating and maintaining the property ( Note 17 ). We earn revenues or equity income from: 

&#8226; 

our wholly-owned commercial real estate investments; 

&#8226; 

our co-owned commercial real estate investments; 

&#8226; 

our investments in the shares of the Managed REITs; and 

&#8226; 

our participation in the cash flows of the Managed REITs. 

Investment Management 

We earn revenue as the advisor to the Managed Programs. Under the advisory agreements with the Managed Programs, we perform various services, including but not limited to the day-to-day management of the Managed Programs and transaction-related services, for which we earn revenues as follows: 

&#8226; 

We earn dealer manager fees in connection with the public offerings of the Managed Programs; 

&#8226; 

We structure and negotiate investments and debt placement transactions for the Managed REITs, for which we earn structuring revenue; 

&#8226; 

We manage the portfolios of the Managed REITs&#8217; real estate investments and the loans made by CCIF, for which we earn asset-based management revenue; 

&#8226; 

The Managed Programs reimburse us for certain costs that we incur on their behalf, consisting primarily of broker-dealer commissions and marketing costs while we are raising funds for their public offerings, and certain personnel and overhead costs; and 

&#8226; 

We may also earn incentive and disposition revenue and receive other compensation in connection with providing liquidity alternatives to the Managed Programs&#8217; stockholders. 

&#160;

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; &#160; 

Our business strategy includes exploring alternatives for expanding our investment management operations beyond advising the existing Managed Programs. Any such expansion could involve the purchase of properties or other investments as principal, either for our owned portfolio or with the intention of transferring such investments to a newly-created fund. 

Investment Strategies 

In analyzing potential investments for our owned real estate portfolio and the CPA &#174; REITs, we review various aspects of a transaction, including tenant and real estate fundamentals, to determine whether a potential investment and lease will satisfy our investment criteria. In evaluating net-lease transactions, we generally consider, among other things, the following aspects of each transaction: 

Tenant/Borrower Evaluation &#32;&#8212; We evaluate each potential tenant or borrower for its creditworthiness, typically considering factors such as management experience, industry position and fundamentals, operating history, and capital structure, as well as other factors that may be relevant to a particular investment. We seek opportunities in which we believe the tenant may have a stable or improving credit profile or credit potential that has not been fully recognized by the market. Whether a prospective tenant or borrower is creditworthy is determined by our investment department and our independent investment committee, as described below. We define creditworthiness as a risk-reward relationship appropriate to our investment strategies, which may or may not coincide with ratings issued by the credit rating agencies. As such, creditworthy does not mean &#8220;investment grade,&#8221; as defined by the credit rating agencies. 

We generally seek investments in facilities that we believe are critical to a tenant&#8217;s current business and that we believe have a low risk of tenant default. We rate each asset based on the asset&#8217;s market and liquidity and also based on how critical the asset is to the tenant&#8217;s operations. We also assess the relative risk of the portfolio quarterly. We evaluate the credit quality of our tenants utilizing an internal five-point credit rating scale, with one representing the highest credit quality (investment grade or equivalent) and five representing the lowest (bankruptcy or foreclosure). Investment grade ratings are provided by third-party rating agencies such as Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s Ratings Services or Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, although we may determine that a tenant is equivalent to investment grade even if the credit rating agencies have not made that determination. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 38 &#32;tenants that were rated investment grade. Ratings for other tenants are generated internally utilizing metrics such as interest coverage and debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA. These metrics are computed internally based on financial statements obtained from each tenant on a quarterly basis. Under the terms of our lease agreements, tenants are generally required to provide us with periodic financial statements. As of December 31, 2015 , we had 184 &#32;non-investment grade tenants, with a weighted-average credit rating of 3.2 . 

Properties Critical to Tenant/Borrower Operations &#32;&#8212; We generally focus on properties that we believe are critical to the ongoing operations of the tenant. We believe that these properties provide better protection generally as well as in the event of a bankruptcy, since a tenant/borrower is less likely to risk the loss of a critically important lease or property in a bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise. 

Diversification &#32;&#8212; We attempt to diversify our owned and managed portfolios to avoid dependence on any one particular tenant, borrower, collateral type, geographic location, or tenant/borrower industry. By diversifying the portfolios, we seek to reduce the adverse effect of a single under-performing investment or a downturn in any particular industry or geographic region. While we have not endeavored to maintain any particular standard of diversity in our owned portfolio, we believe that it is reasonably well-diversified. 

Lease Terms &#32;&#8212; Generally, the net-leased properties in which we invest will be leased on a full-recourse basis to the tenants or their affiliates. In addition, we seek to include a clause in each lease that provides for increases in rent over the term of the lease. These increases are fixed or tied generally to increases in indices such as the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, or other similar index in the jurisdiction in which the property is located, but may contain caps or other limitations, either on an annual or overall basis. In the case of retail stores and hotels, the lease may provide for participation in gross revenues of the tenant above a stated level, which we refer to as a percentage rent. Alternatively, a lease may provide for mandated rental increases on specific dates. 

Real Estate Evaluation &#32;&#8212; We review and evaluate the physical condition of the property and the market in which it is located. We consider a variety of factors, including current market rents, replacement cost, residual valuation, property operating history, demographic characteristics of the location and accessibility, competitive properties, and suitability for re-leasing. We obtain third-party environmental and engineering reports and market studies, if needed. When considering an investment outside the United States, we will also consider factors particular to foreign countries, including those mentioned in Item 1A. Risk Factors , in addition to the risks normally associated with real property investments.

Transaction Provisions to Enhance and Protect Value &#32;&#8212; We attempt to include provisions in the leases that we believe may help protect an investment from changes in the operating and financial characteristics of a tenant that may affect the tenant&#8217;s ability to satisfy its obligations to us or reduce the value of the investment. Such provisions include requiring our consent to specified tenant activity, requiring the tenant to provide indemnification protections, requiring the tenant to provide security deposits, and requiring the tenant to satisfy specific operating tests. We may also seek to enhance the likelihood of a tenant&#8217;s lease obligations being satisfied through a guaranty of obligations from the tenant&#8217;s corporate parent or other entity, security deposits, or through a letter of credit. This credit enhancement, if obtained, provides us with additional financial security. However, in markets where competition for net-lease transactions is strong, some or all of these provisions may be difficult to obtain. In addition, in some circumstances, tenants may retain the right to repurchase the property leased by the tenant. The option purchase price is generally the greater of the contract purchase price or the fair market value of the property at the time the option is exercised. 

Other Equity Enhancements &#8212; We may attempt to obtain equity enhancements in connection with transactions. These equity enhancements may involve warrants exercisable at a future time to purchase stock of the tenant or borrower or their parent. If warrants are obtained and become exercisable, and if the value of the stock subsequently exceeds the exercise price of the warrant, equity enhancements can help us to achieve our goal of increasing investor returns. 

Investment Committee &#32;&#8212; We have an independent investment committee that provides services to us and to the CPA &#174; REITs. Our investment department, under the oversight of our chief investment officer, is primarily responsible for evaluating, negotiating, and structuring potential investment opportunities. The investment committee is not directly involved in originating or negotiating potential investments, but instead functions as a separate and final step in the investment process. We place special emphasis on having experienced individuals serve on our investment committee. The investment committee retains the authority to identify categories of transactions that may be entered into without its prior approval. 

&#160; 

Financing Strategies 

We seek to maintain a conservative capital structure that enhances equity returns, maintains financial flexibility, and enables us to effectively match our assets and liabilities. Historically, we entered into secured debt such as mortgage financings collateralized by individual property assets to finance our business. We are actively reducing our reliance on secured debt and increasing the level of unencumbered assets on our balance sheet by paying off individual mortgage loans as they mature. In January 2014, we recast our unsecured line of credit and increased the amounts available to borrow thereunder, as compared to the prior facility, subject to certain covenants ( Note 11 ). In addition to funding our working capital needs, this increased line of credit capacity will assist with our transition to becoming more of an unsecured borrower by enhancing our ability to repay a portion of our mortgage debt. During 2014 and 2015, we also issued corporate bonds ( Note 11 ) and shares of our common stock ( Note 13 ) in separate public offerings. We expect to continue to have access to a wide variety of capital sources, including the public debt and equity markets, although there can be no assurance that such access will be available to us at all times. 

Asset Management 

We believe that effective management of our assets is essential to maintain and enhance property values. Important aspects of asset management include entering into new or modified transactions to meet the evolving needs of current tenants, re-leasing properties, refinancing debt, and selling properties. 

We monitor, on an ongoing basis, compliance by tenants with their lease obligations and other factors that could affect the financial performance of any of our real estate investments. Monitoring involves receiving assurances that each tenant has paid real estate taxes, assessments, and other expenses relating to the properties it occupies and confirming that appropriate insurance coverage is being maintained by the tenant. For international compliance, we often engage third-party asset managers. We review financial statements of tenants and undertake regular physical inspections of the condition and maintenance of properties. Additionally, we periodically analyze each tenant&#8217;s financial condition, the industry in which each tenant operates, and each tenant&#8217;s relative strength in its industry.

Our Portfolio 

At December 31, 2015 , our portfolio had the following characteristics: 

&#8226; 

Number of properties &#8211; full or partial ownership interests in 869 &#32;net-leased properties, two hotels, and one self-storage property; 

&#8226; 

Total net-leased square footage &#8211; 90.1 million ; and 

&#8226; 

Occupancy rate &#8211; approximately 98.8% . 

For more information about our portfolio, please see Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8212; Portfolio Overview . 

&#160; 

Tenant/Lease Information 

At December 31, 2015 , our tenants/leases had the following characteristics: 

&#8226; 

Number of tenants &#8211; 222 ; 

&#8226; 

Investment-grade tenants &#8211; 23% ; 

&#8226; 

Weighted-average remaining lease term &#8211; 9.0 &#32;years; 

&#8226; 

95% &#32;of our leases provide rent adjustments as follows: 

&#9702; 

CPI and similar &#8211; 70% &#32; 

&#9702; 

fixed &#8211; 25% &#32; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face active competition in both our Real Estate Ownership segment and our Investment Management segment from many sources for investment opportunities in commercial properties net leased to tenants both domestically and internationally. In general, we believe that our management&#8217;s experience in real estate, credit underwriting, and transaction structuring should allow us to compete effectively for commercial properties. However, competitors may be willing to accept rates of return, lease terms, other transaction terms, or levels of risk that we may find unacceptable. 

&#160; 

In our Investment Management segment, we face active competition in raising funds for the Managed Programs, from other funds with similar investment objectives such as publicly-registered non-traded funds, publicly-traded funds, and private funds, including hedge funds. In addition, we face broad competition from other forms of investment. Currently, we raise substantially all of the funds for investment by the Managed Programs from investors within the United States. 

&#160; 

Environmental Matters &#160; 

We and the Managed REITs have invested, and expect to continue to invest, in properties currently or historically used as industrial, manufacturing, and commercial properties. Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, current and former owners and operators of property may have liability for the cost of investigating, cleaning up, or disposing of hazardous materials released at, on, under, in, or from the property. These laws typically impose responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous materials or contamination, and liability under these laws is often joint and several. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous materials. As part of our efforts to mitigate these risks, we typically engage third parties to perform assessments of potential environmental risks when evaluating a new acquisition of property, and we frequently require sellers to address them before closing or obtain contractual protection (indemnities, cash reserves, letters of credit, or other instruments) from property sellers, tenants, a tenant&#8217;s parent company, or another third party to address known or potential environmental issues. With respect to our hotels and self-storage investments, which are not subject to net lease arrangements, there is no tenant of the property to provide indemnification, so we may be liable for costs associated with environmental contamination in the event any such circumstances arise after we acquire the property.
