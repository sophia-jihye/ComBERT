Corporate Overview 

&#160;

eXp Realty, LLC is a cloud-based real estate brokerage operating in 35 states. As a cloud-based real estate brokerage for the residential real estate market, eXp Realty, LLC has embraced and adopted a number of cloud-based technologies in order to grow an international brokerage without the burden of physical bricks and mortar or redundant staffing costs. Following the closing of the merger agreement with eXp Realty International, Inc. in September 2013, described in more detail below, the business of eXp Realty, LLC became our principal business.

&#160;

Acquisition of eXp Realty International, Inc. 

&#160;

On August 15, 2013, we and eXp Acquisition Corp., a Washington corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of our company, entered into a merger agreement with eXp Realty International, Inc., and as a result of the closing of this agreement, eXp Realty International, Inc. merged into eXp Acquisition Corp. with eXp Acquisition Corp. remaining as the surviving corporation and the separate existence of eXp Realty International, Inc. ceasing at the effective time of the merger. The merger of eXp Realty International, Inc. and eXp Acquisition Corp. was completed on September 27, 2013.

The business model was created in order to increase brokers&#8217; and agents&#8217; listings and sales and reduce their overhead and capital requirements.

The organization and ownership our company as of December 31, 2015 was as follows: 

Corporate History 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in the State of Delaware on July 30, 2008. In connection with and prior to the closing of the acquisition of eXp Realty International, Inc., effective September 9, 2013, we changed our name from &#8220;Desert Canadians Ltd.&#8221; to &#8220;eXp Realty International Corporation&#8221; and effected a 35 new for 1 old forward stock split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, our authorized capital was increased from 220,000,000 shares of common stock to 7,700,000,000 shares of common stock and our issued and outstanding shares of common stock was increased on the basis of 35 new shares for 1 old share.

&#160;

Description of Business 

&#160;

Operations 

&#160;

We launched our operation in October 2009 with a small number of agents in Washington and Arizona, and have grown to a team of approximately 1,000 real estate professionals, and operate in various geographic markets as discussed in detail below.

&#160;

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We operate over the internet through our website, http://exprealty.com and rely on a cloud-based platform to provide our residential real estate brokerage services. Through our website, buyers can search real-time property listings, and sellers list their properties and gain exposure across the various markets we operate within. We also provide buyers and sellers access to a network of professional, consumer-centric agents and brokers.

&#160;

Internally, we use our technology to provide agents, teams of agents, and brokerage owners with opportunities for increased profitability, reduced risk, and greater levels of professional development while fostering an organizational culture that values collaboration, strength of community, and commitment to serving the consumer&#8217;s best interests. We provide agents, teams of agents, and brokerage-owners with the systems, support, professional development and infrastructure to survive and then thrive in unpredictable and, at times, challenging economic conditions. This includes delivering 24/7 access to collaborative tools and training for real estate brokers and agents.

&#160;

&#160;

We have adopted a number of cloud-based technologies. Among the technologies we use to operate our business, is our 3D, fully-immersive, cloud office complex which has conference rooms, training centers, individual offices, and in which our management, staff, agents and brokers all work on a daily basis learning from, sharing with, transacting business with, and socializing with their colleagues from different geographic regions by utilizing avatars and USB headsets. In these virtual spaces agents and brokers meet for state-based sales meetings, attend live interactive training and classes, go over commission disbursement authorization forms, build websites and online branding materials, and work on purchase and sales agreements. Moreover, in these virtual spaces new managing brokers are evaluated and approved, our management meets to discuss strategy and vision, and personnel interviews occur. These are the only spaces where our senior management and our entire team report to work, manage projects and functional teams, attend classes, strategize, collaborate, and innovate. Furthermore, our cloud office has a fully-staffed transaction and administration office, and a fully-staffed web development, search engine optimization and technical support office. Thus, our cloud office provides agents, teams of agents and brokers with training, education, coaching, mentoring, transaction support, broker support, and technical support. Consequently, our cloud office is our company office for brokers, agents, management and staff, and the cloud office has also eliminated redundant staffing costs. The utilization of this cloud office platform permits us to serve our entire geographic reach.

&#160;

We also serve real estate agents, which are independent contractors affiliated with our company, teams of agents, and real estate brokers by providing a full suite of back office functions ranging from paperless file sharing and transaction management, web design, social media, digital campaigns, customer relationship management platforms, business coaching, tech support, and live training that places a premium on engagement, discussion and collaboration.

&#160;

Furthermore, we allow our brokers, some of whom are former real estate brokerage owners, to leverage our infrastructure to reduce their fixed costs and be empowered to build scalable teams of agents in any of the markets that we serve while preserving and enhancing the broker&#8217;s personal brand. In this way our brokers can attract agents and build a co-brand in any of markets currently served by the company without any additional capital requirements.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to our core real estate brokerage services, part of our overall strategy is to derive revenue from ancillary services related to real estate transactions. As the first step of that strategy, in September 2015 we announced the formation of First Cloud Mortgage, Inc. (&#8220;First Cloud&#8221;), focused on utilizing an attractive platform and technologies to originate and provide premium loan products and outstanding service to borrowers. Through December 31, 2015, First Cloud&#8217;s activities consisted primarily of obtaining mortgage broker licenses in several States and establishing relationships with wholesale lenders and other vendors.

&#160;

Fee Structure 

&#160;

Our fee structure resulting directly from the cloud office and its impact on profitability has enabled us to offer our agents and brokers a relatively high minimum split of 80% of the gross commission generated from transactions.

&#160;

We retain 20% of the gross commission generated from the same transactions. At the point (should it arrive) in the agent&#8217;s or broker&#8217;s anniversary year with our company that the 20% we retain adds up to $16,000 (effectively when the agent or broker closes transactions resulting in $80,000 in gross commission income) the agent&#8217;s or broker&#8217;s split graduates to 100% of gross commission for the balance of the agent&#8217;s or broker&#8217;s anniversary year less adjusted fees.

&#160;

Unlike agents and brokers at most of our national competitors, our agents and brokers do not pay a royalty or franchise fee. Because we do not house agents in physical brick and mortar offices our agents and brokers also do not pay desk or office fees that are commonplace among competitors. Our agents pay a small monthly technology fee, a modest tuition fee for eXp University (curriculum of professional development classes and real estate vision and training), a transaction processing fee and a liability insurance fee. Our fee structure is favorable in relation to our competitors.

&#160;

Revenue Sharing Plan 

&#160;

Our cloud office and its impact on profitability has enabled us to introduce and maintain a 7-level gross revenue sharing plan which each of our agents and brokers can participate in and from which they can realize significant monthly and annual residual overrides on the gross commission income resulting from transactions consummated by agents and brokers who they have attracted to our company, effectively contributing to our growth.

&#160;

A number of our competitors have introduced residual income plans to their agents and brokers in an effort to incentivize growth but those companies&#8217; cost structures, many of which are overhead-intensive, have led to plans where the residual income is either calculated on net profit, which is unpredictable or unattainable and over which the agent has no control, is capped or structurally offers lower opportunity for payout.

&#160;

Our gross revenue sharing program has the potential to pay out tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars monthly to our individual agents and brokers. Our gross revenue sharing plan also unties one of the industry&#8217;s longstanding compensation challenges for the industry&#8217;s professionals by providing a vehicle with which agents and brokers can truly, and comfortably, reduce their sales activity in the future and ultimately potentially retire with a vested monthly revenue share plan distribution.

&#160;

Consistent with our commitment to enabling and empowering agents and brokers in pursuit of building a scalable business and organization, our revenue sharing plan allows brokers and agents a financial mechanism to build teams across borders without incurring any expense, oversight responsibility, or liability.

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Markets 

&#160;

Our primary market is the United States where we currently operate in 35 States under the name of eXp Realty LLC, eXp Realty of Connecticut, LLC, eXp Realty of California, Inc. (formerly eXp Realty Washington, Inc.), or eXp Realty Associates, LLC.

&#160;

We also have a wholly owned subsidiary, eXp Realty Canada, Inc. which is licensed to do business in Calgary, Alberta and Toronto, Ontario.

&#160;

First Cloud Mortgage Inc. is currently licensed to conduct business in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We compete with local, regional and national and international residential real estate brokerages to attract agents, teams of agents, brokers and consumers. We compete primarily on the basis of our culture, collaboration, utilization of systems and technologies, including our cloud office platform to reduce costs, provide relevant and substantial professional development opportunities, and provide our agents and brokers with an opportunity to generate more business and participate in the growth of our company. We believe that we are the only national real estate brokerage in the United States presently using a 3D immersive office environment in place of physical brick and mortar locations and as such, we believe that we are well-positioned in our competitive landscape.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

&#8220;eXp Realty&#8221; is one of our registered trademarks in the United States. We have also placed the marks &#8220;3D MLS&#8221; and &#8220;3D Listing Service&#8221; and &#8220;RE Tech Campus&#8221; on the United States Patent and Trademark Office&#8217;s Supplemental Register. We also own the rights to the domain name &#8220;http://exprealty.com&#8221;.

&#160;

We license software and other proprietary technology upon which we depend to provide our 3D immersive cloud office environment from a third party vendor. While we currently depend on our relationship with this vendor to provide our cloud office environment in the short term, we believe other alternatives are available in the longer term, should they be needed, to license or develop technology for our cloud office environment.]

&#160;

We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, unfair competition, trademark and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property, including product design, product research and concepts and recognized trademarks. These rights are protected through the acquisition of patents and trademark registrations, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing these rights.

&#160;

While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks will protect our proprietary information, we intend to assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights could result in a substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, our company, management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights will be a key component of our operating strategy.

&#160;

Seasonality of Business 

&#160;

Seasons and weather, while seemingly predictable, traditionally impact the real estate industry. Continuous poor weather or natural disasters negatively impact listings and sales. Spring and summer seasons historically reflect greater sales periods in comparison to fall and winter seasons. Seasonal or weather related lower revenue also reduces our operating income, net income, operating margins and cash flow.

&#160;

Real estate listings precede sales and a period of poor listings activity will negatively impact revenue. Past performance be it weather, seasons, prior month or prior quarter is no assurance of the following month&#8217;s or quarter&#8217;s revenue and macroeconomic shifts in the markets served could conceal the impact of poor weather and/or seasonality.

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Home sales in successive quarters can fluctuate widely due to holidays, national or international emergencies, the school year calendar&#8217;s impact on relocation and/or interest rate changes or speculation of pending interest rate changes. Our revenue and operating margins each quarter will remain subject to seasonal fluctuations, poor weather and natural disasters, combined with macroeconomic market changes may make it difficult to compare or analyze our financial performance effectively across successive quarters.

&#160;

Furthermore, the residential real estate market and the real estate industry in general has a cyclical nature often defined by a protracted period of depressed revenues, values, and demand, inflated rates of foreclosure, and then economic relief. Consequently, our business is affected by such cycles.

&#160;

Research and Development Costs During the Last Two Years 

&#160;

We did not incur any costs associated with research and development during each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

We serve the residential real estate industry which is regulated by federal, state and local authorities as well as private associations or state sponsored associations or organizations. We are required to comply with each state, province, county or country&#8217;s laws and as well as private governing bodies&#8217; regulations, which combined results in a highly regulated industry.

&#160;

We are also subject to federal and state regulations relating to employment, contractor, and compensation practices. All of our company&#8217;s agents and brokers are classified as independent contractors, which are subject to Internal Revenue Service and state law guidelines as they apply to this classification. The only exception is our managing brokers (one per each state where we are registered to conduct business) that are classified as part-time employees to fulfill state or local real estate business requirements.

&#160;

Real Estate Regulation - Federal 

&#160;

The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 ( &#8220; RESPA &#8221; ) became effective on June 20, 1975. The RESPA requires lenders, mortgage brokers, or servicers of home loans to provide borrowers with pertinent and timely disclosures regarding the nature and costs of the real estate settlement process. The RESPA also protects borrowers against certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations upon the use of escrow accounts.

&#160;

The Department of Housing and Urban Development promulgated Regulation X, which implements RESPA.

&#160;

The National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 amended RESPA to require detailed disclosures concerning the transfer, sale, or assignment of mortgage servicing. It also requires disclosures for mortgage escrow accounts at closing and annually thereafter, itemizing the charges to be paid by the borrower and what is paid out of the account by the servicer.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act bestowed the administration of RESPA from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;). In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act increased regulation of the mortgage industry, including: generally prohibiting lenders from making residential mortgage loans unless a good faith determination is made of a borrower's creditworthiness based on verified and documented information; requiring the CFPB to enact regulations, which have been finalized, to help assure that consumers are provided with timely and understandable information about residential mortgage loans that protect them against unfair, deceptive and abusive practices; and requiring federal regulators to establish minimum national underwriting guidelines for residential mortgages that lenders will be allowed to securitize without retaining any of the loans&#8217; default risk. In addition, federal fair housing laws generally make it illegal to discriminate against protected classes of individuals in housing or brokerage services. Other federal regulations protect the privacy rights of consumers, which affects our opportunities to solicit new clients.

&#160;

&#160;

Real Estate Regulation - State and Local Level 

&#160;

States licensing laws and/or requirements vary from state to state. In general, all individuals and entities lawfully conducting businesses as real estate brokers, agents or sales associates must be licensed in the state in which they carry on business and at all times be in compliance.

&#160;

States will require a real estate broker to be employed by the brokerage firm or permit an independent contractor classification, and the broker may work for another broker conducting business on behalf of the sponsoring broker.

&#160;

States may require a person licensed as a real estate agent, sales associate or salesperson, be affiliated with a broker in order to engage in licensed real estate brokerage activities or allow the agent, sales associate or salesperson to work for another agent, sales associate or salesperson conducting business on behalf of the sponsoring agent, sales associate or salesperson. Agents, sales associates or salespersons are generally classified as independent contractors; however, real estate firms can offer employment.

&#160;

Generally, a limited liability company such as eXp Realty, LLC engaged in the real estate brokerage business must obtain an entity real estate broker license (although in some states the licenses are personal to individual brokers). In order to obtain this license, most jurisdictions require that a member or manager of the limited liability company be licensed individually as a real estate broker in that jurisdiction. If applicable, this member or manager is responsible for supervising the licensees and the entity&#8217;s real estate brokerage activities within the state.

&#160;

Real estate licensees, whether they are brokers, salespersons, individuals, agents or entities, must follow the state&#8217;s real estate licensing laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally specify minimum duties and obligations of these licensees to their clients and the public, as well as standards for the conduct of business, including contract and disclosure requirements, record keeping requirements, requirements for local offices, escrow trust fund management, agency representation, advertising regulations and fair housing requirements.

&#160;

In each of the states where we have operations, we assign appropriate personnel to manage and comply with laws and regulations be it equal to, or greater than federal law.

&#160;

Most states have local regulations (city or county government) that govern the conduct of the real estate brokerage business. Local regulations generally require additional disclosures by the parties to a real estate transaction or their agents or brokers, or the receipt of reports or certifications, often from the local governmental authority, prior to the closing or settlement of a real estate transaction as well as prescribed review and approval periods for documentation and broker conditions for review and approval.

&#160;

In addition, state and local laws, public policy and general principles of equity relating to the protection of consumers, unfair and deceptive practices and debt collection practices may apply to the origination, servicing and collection of mortgage loans, which we expect will become increasingly applicable to the extent our mortgage loan business develops under First Cloud.

&#160;

Third-Party Rules 

&#160;

Beyond federal, state and local governmental regulations, the real estate industry is subject to rules established by private real estate groups and/or trade organizations, including, among others, state Associations of REALTORS&#174; (AOR), and local Associations of REALTORS&#174; (AOR), the National Association of Realtors&#174; (NAR), and local Multiple Listing Services (MLSs). &#8220;REALTOR&#8221; and &#8220;REALTORS&#8221; are registered trademarks of the National Association of REALTORS&#174;.

&#160;

Each third party organization generally has prescribed policies, bylaws, codes of ethics or conduct, and fees and rules governing the actions of members in dealings with other members, clients and the public, as well as how the third party organization&#8217;s brand and services may or may not be deployed or displayed.

&#160;

We assign appropriate personnel to manage and comply with third party organization policies and bylaws.

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We presently have approximately 27 full-time employees, 9 of whom oversee and manage all of our company&#8217;s transactions globally, and approximately 36 part-time employees.

&#160;

All of our agents and brokers are classified as independent contractors. The only exceptions are our managing brokers (one per each state where we are registered to conduct business) that are classified as part-time employees to fulfill state or local real estate business requirements. Currently, we have approximately 1,000 agents and brokers.

&#160;

Our operations are overseen directly by management that engages our employees to carry on our business. Our management oversees all responsibilities in the areas of corporate administration, business development, and research. We intend to expand our current management to retain skilled directors, officers, and employees with experience relevant to our business focus. Our management&#8217;s relationships with agents, brokers, technology providers, and customers will provide the foundation through which we expect to grow our business in the future. We believe that the skill-set of our management team will be a primary asset in the development of our brands and trademarks.
