 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

H.B. Fuller Company was founded in 1887 and incorporated as a Minnesota corporation in 1915. Our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol FUL. As used herein, &#8220;H.B. Fuller&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;management&#8221; or &#8220;company&#8221; includes H.B. Fuller and its subsidiaries unless otherwise indicated. Where we refer to 2015, 2014 and 2013 herein, the reference is to our fiscal years ended November 28, 2015, November 29, 2014 and November 30, 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

We are a leading worldwide formulator, manufacturer and marketer of adhesives, sealants and other specialty chemical products. Sales operations span 36 countries in North America, Europe, Latin America, the Asia Pacific region, India, the Middle East and Africa. Industrial adhesives represent our core product offering. Customers use our adhesives products in manufacturing common consumer and industrial goods, including food and beverage containers, disposable diapers, windows, doors, flooring, appliances, sportswear, footwear, multi-wall bags, water filtration products, insulation, textiles and electronics. Our adhesives help improve the performance of our customers&#8217; products or improve their manufacturing processes. We also provide our customers with technical support and unique solutions designed to address their specific needs. We have established a variety of product offerings for residential construction markets, such as tile-setting adhesives, grout, sealants and related products, which are sold primarily in our Construction Products operating segment. 

&#160; 

Recent Acquisitions 

&#160; 

On February 3, 2015 we acquired Continental Products Limited, a provider of industrial adhesives, based in Nairobi, Kenya for $1.6 million. The acquisition supports our growth strategy for emerging markets and delivers specialty adhesive products to key customers in East and Central Africa. 

&#160; 

On February 2, 2015 we acquired 95 percent of Tonsan Adhesive, Inc., an independent engineering adhesives provider based in Beijing, China for $215.9 million. The acquisition strengthens our customer relationships in the engineering adhesives markets. Concurrent with the acquisition, we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining 5 percent of Tonsan&#8217;s equity beginning February 1, 2019 for 82 million Chinese renminbi or approximately $13.0 million. In addition, the agreement requires us to pay up to 418 million Chinese renminbi, or approximately $66.8 million, in contingent consideration based upon a formula related to Tonsan&#8217;s gross profit in fiscal 2018. The fair values of the agreement to purchase the remaining equity and the contingent consideration based upon a discounted cash flow model as of the date of acquisition were $11.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively. 

&#160; 

Operating Segment Information 

&#160; 

Our business is reported in four operating segments - Americas Adhesives, EIMEA (Europe, India, Middle East and Africa), Asia Pacific and Construction Products. In 2015, as a percentage of total net revenue by operating segment, Americas Adhesives was 42 percent, EIMEA 29 percent, Asia Pacific 18 percent and Construction Products 11 percent. 

&#160; 

Our Americas Adhesives, EIMEA and Asia Pacific operating segments produce and supply industrial adhesives products for applications in various markets, including durable assembly (appliances, filters, construction, automotive, electronics, windows, doors, wood flooring, textile such as footwear, sportswear), packaging (food and beverage containers, flexible packaging, consumer goods, package integrity and re-enforcement, durable and non-durable goods), converting (corrugation, folding carton, tape and label, paper converting, envelopes, books, multi-wall bags, sacks, tissue and towel) and nonwoven and hygiene (disposable diapers, feminine care and medical garments). Our Construction Products operating segment includes products used for tile setting (adhesives, grouts, mortars, sealers, levelers), flooring, and heating, ventilation and air conditioning and insulation applications (duct sealants, weather barriers and fungicidal coatings, block fillers). 

&#160; 

The Americas Adhesives operating segment includes a full range of specialty adhesives such as thermoplastic, thermoset, reactive, water-based and solvent-based products. Sales are made primarily through a direct sales force with a smaller portion of sales through distributors. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The EIMEA operating segment is comprised of an adhesives component with the same range of products as the Americas Adhesives operating segment. EIMEA adhesives sales are made through both a direct sales force and distributors. 

&#160; 

The Asia Pacific operating segment is similar to that of the Americas Adhesives operating segment, with one exception. The Asia Pacific operating segment also includes caulks and sealants for the consumer market and professional trade, sold through retailers, primarily in Australia. Other adhesives sales are made through a direct sales force and distributors. 

&#160; 

The Construction Products operating segment provides floor preparation, grouts and mortars for tile setting as well as sealants and related products for heating, ventilation and air conditioning installations. Construction Products sales are made primarily through distributors, wholesalers, big box retailers and a direct sales force. 

&#160; 

Financial information with respect to our operating segments and geographic areas is set forth in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Non-U.S. Operations 

&#160; 

The principal markets, products and methods of distribution outside the United States vary with each of our regional operations generally maintaining integrated business units that contain dedicated supplier networks, manufacturing, logistics and sales organizations. The vast majority of the products sold within any region are produced within the region, and the respective regions do not import significant amounts of product from other regions. At the end of 2015, we had sales offices and manufacturing plants in 20 countries outside the United States and satellite sales offices in another 15 countries. 

&#160; 

We have detailed Code of Conduct policies that we apply across all of our operations around the world. This set of policies represents a set of common values that apply to all employees and all of our business dealings. We have adopted policies and processes, and conduct employee training, all of which are intended to ensure compliance with various economic sanctions and export controls, including the regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). We do not conduct any business in countries that are subject to U.S. economic sanctions such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Many of our markets are highly competitive. However, we compete effectively due to the quality and breadth of our adhesives, sealants and specialty chemical portfolio and the experience and expertise of our commercial organizations. Within the adhesives and other specialty chemical markets, we believe few suppliers have comparable global reach and corresponding ability to deliver quality and consistency to multinational customers. Our competition is made up generally of two types of companies: (1) similar multinational suppliers and (2) regional or specialty suppliers that typically compete in only one region or within a narrow geographic area within a region. The multinational competitors typically maintain a broad product offering and range of technology, while regional or specialty companies tend to have limited or more focused product ranges and technology. 

&#160; 

Principal competitive factors in the sale of adhesives and other specialty chemicals are product performance, supply assurance, technical service, quality, price and customer service. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We have cultivated strong, integrated relationships with a diverse set of customers worldwide. Our customers are among the technology and market leaders in consumer goods, construction, and industrial markets. We pride ourselves on long-term, collaborative customer relationships and a diverse portfolio of customers in which no single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of consolidated net revenue. 

&#160; 

Our leading customers include manufacturers of food and beverages, hygiene products, clothing, major appliances, electronics, automobiles, filters, construction materials, wood flooring, furniture, cabinetry, windows, doors, tissue and towel, corrugation, tube winding, packaging, labels and tapes. 

&#160; 

Our products are delivered directly to customers primarily from our manufacturing plants, with additional deliveries made through distributors and retailers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Backlog 

&#160; 

No significant backlog of unfilled orders existed at November 28, 2015 or November 29, 2014. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We use several principal raw materials in our manufacturing processes, including tackifying resins, polymers, synthetic rubbers, vinyl acetate monomer and plasticizers. We generally avoid sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials. 

&#160; 

The majority of our raw materials are petroleum/natural gas based derivatives. Under normal conditions, raw materials are available on the open market. Prices and availability are subject to supply and demand market mechanisms. Raw material costs are primarily determined by the balance of supply against the aggregate demand from the adhesives industry and other industries that use the same raw material streams. The cost of crude oil and natural gas, the primary feedstocks for our raw materials, can also impact the cost of our raw materials. 

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

&#160; 

Much of the technology we use in our products and manufacturing processes is available in the public domain. For technology not available in the public domain, we rely on trade secrets and patents when appropriate to protect our competitive position. We also license some patented technology from other sources. Our business is not materially dependent upon licenses or similar rights or on any single patent or group of related patents. 

&#160; 

We enter into agreements with many employees to protect rights to technology and intellectual property. Confidentiality commitments also are routinely obtained from customers, suppliers and others to safeguard proprietary information. 

&#160; 

We own numerous trademarks and service marks in various countries. Trademarks, such as H.B. Fuller&#174;, Swift&#174;, Advantra&#174;, Clarity&#174;, Sesame&#174;, TEC&#174;, Plasticola&#174;, Foster&#174;, Rakoll&#174;, Rapidex&#174;, Full-Care TM , Liquamelt&#174;, Thermonex&#174;, Tile-Perfect&#174; and TONSAN&#174; are important in marketing products. Many of our trademarks and service marks are registered. U.S. trademark registrations are for a term of ten years and are renewable every ten years as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our investment in research and development creates new and innovative adhesive technology platforms, enhances product performance, ensures a competitive cost structure and leverages available raw materials. New product development is a key research and development outcome, providing higher-value solutions to existing customers or meeting new customers&#8217; needs. Projects are developed in local laboratories in each region, where we understand our customer base the best. Platform developments are coordinated globally through our network of laboratories. 

&#160; 

Through designing and developing new polymers and new formulations, we expect to continue to grow in our current markets. We also develop new applications for existing products and technologies, and improve manufacturing processes to enhance productivity and product quality. Research and development efforts are closely aligned to customer needs, but we do not engage in customer sponsored activities. We foster open innovation, seek supplier-driven new technology and use relationships with academic and other institutions to enhance our capabilities. 

&#160; 

Research and development expenses were $26.2 million, $21.2 million and $24.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Research and development costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. 

&#160; 

Environmental, Health and Safety 

&#160; 

We comply with applicable regulations relating to environmental protection and workers&#39; safety. This includes regular review of and upgrades to environmental, health and safety policies, practices and procedures as well as improved production methods to minimize our facilities&#8217; outgoing waste, based on evolving societal standards and increased environmental understanding. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Environmental expenditures to comply with environmental regulations over the next two years are estimated to be approximately $9.9 million, including approximately $1.9 million of capital expenditures. See additional disclosure under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our Americas Adhesives, EIMEA and Construction Products operating segments have historically had lower net revenue in winter months, which is primarily our first fiscal quarter, partially due to the seasonal decline in construction activities. There also are many international holidays in our first quarter, reducing available shipping days. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We employed approximately 4,400 individuals on November 28, 2015, of which approximately 1,500 were located in the United States.
