 Item 1. &#32; Business 

Company Overview 

Pilgrim&#8217;s Pride Corporation (referred to herein as &#8220;Pilgrim&#8217;s,&#8221; &#8220;PPC,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; or similar terms), which was incorporated in Texas in 1968 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1986, is the successor to a partnership founded in 1946 as a retail feed store. JBS S.A., through its indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries (together, &#8220;JBS&#8221;) beneficially owns 76.7% of our outstanding common stock. We are one of the largest chicken producers in the world with operations in the United States (&#8220;U.S.&#8221;), Mexico and Puerto Rico. We are primarily engaged in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of fresh, frozen and value-added chicken products to retailers, distributors and foodservice operators. We offer a wide range of products to our customers through strong national and international distribution channels. Pilgrim's fresh chicken products consist of refrigerated (non-frozen) whole chickens, whole cut-up chickens and selected chicken parts that are either marinated or non-marinated. The Company's prepared chicken products include fully cooked, ready-to-cook and individually frozen chicken parts, strips, nuggets and patties, some of which are either breaded or non-breaded and either marinated or non-marinated. 

We market our balanced portfolio of fresh, prepared and value-added chicken products to a diverse set of over 5,000 customers across the U.S., Mexico and in approximately 90 other countries, with no single customer accounting for more than 10% of total sales. We have become a valuable partner to our customers and a recognized industry leader by consistently providing high-quality products and services designed to meet their needs and enhance their business. Our sales efforts are largely targeted towards the foodservice industry, principally chain restaurants and food processors such as Chick-fil-A &#174; &#32;and Yum! Brands &#174; , distributors such as US Foods and Sysco &#174; &#32;and retail customers, including grocery store chains and wholesale clubs such as Kroger &#174; , Wal-Mart &#174; , Costco &#174; , Publix &#174;, Albertsons &#174; , H-E-B &#174; &#32;and Sam&#8217;s Club &#174; . 

As a vertically integrated company, we control every phase of the production process, which helps us better manage food safety and quality, as well as more effectively control margins and improve customer service. We operate feed mills, hatcheries, processing plants and distribution centers in 12 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Mexico. Our plants are strategically located to ensure that customers timely receive fresh products. With our global network of approximately 4,130 growers, 35 feed mills, 40 hatcheries, 30 processing plants, six prepared foods cook plants, 23 distribution centers, eight rendering facilities and three pet food plants, we believe we are well positioned to supply the growing demand for our products. 

We are one of the largest, and we believe one of the most efficient, producers and sellers of chicken in Mexico. Our presence in Mexico provides access to a market with growing demand and has enabled us to leverage our operational strengths within the region. The market for chicken products in Mexico is still developing, with most sales attributed to fresh, commodity-oriented, market price-based business. We believe our Mexico business is well positioned to continue benefiting from these trends in the Mexican consumer market. Additionally, we are an important player in the live market, which accounted for approximately 

25% of the industry&#8217;s chicken sales in Mexico in 2015. On June 29, 2015, we acquired 100% of the equity of Provemex Holding LLC and its subsidiaries (together, &#8220;Tyson Mexico&#8221;) from Tyson Foods, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries. Tyson Mexico is a vertically integrated poultry business based in Gomez Palacio, Durango, Mexico. The acquired business has a production capacity of three million birds per week in its three plants and currently employs more than 4,500 people in its plants, offices and seven distribution centers. The acquisition further strengthens our strategic position in the Mexico chicken market. 

We have approximately 39,000 employees and have the capacity to process more than 37.0 million birds per week for a total of more than 10.8 billion pounds of live chicken annually. In 2015, we produced 7.9 billion pounds of chicken products, generating approximately $8.2 billion in net sales and approximately $645.9 million in net income attributable to Pilgrim&#8217;s. 

We operate on the basis of a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the Sunday falling on or before December 31. The reader should assume any reference we make to a particular year (for example, 2015) applies to our fiscal year and not the calendar year. Fiscal 2015 was a 52-week fiscal year. 

Our Industry 

Industry Overview 

The U.S. consumes more chicken than any other protein (approximately 33.9 billion pounds projected in calendar year 2016 according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;)), and chicken is the second most consumed protein globally after pork. The U.S. is the world&#8217;s largest producer of chicken and is projected to produce approximately 40.5 billion pounds of ready-to-cook broiler meat in calendar year 2016, representing 20.6% of the total world production. Broilers are tender, young chickens suitable for broiling or roasting. Brazil and China produce the second and third most broiler meat, with 15.1% and 14.7% of the world market, respectively, according to the USDA. 

According to the USDA, the export of U.S. chicken products increased at an average annual growth rate of 3.9% from 2004 through 2014. The U.S. is the second-largest exporter of broiler meat behind Brazil. The U.S. is projected to export 6.9 billion pounds in calendar year 2016, which would account for 30.1% of the total world exports and 17.5% of the total U.S. production, according to the USDA. The top five exporters are projected to control over 86.4% of the market in 2016. 

According to the USDA, chicken production in the U.S. increased from 2004 through 2014 at a compounded annual growth rate of 1.1%. The growth in chicken demand is attributable to (i) relative affordability compared to other proteins such as beef and pork, (ii) the increasingly health conscious nature of U.S. consumers, (iii) chicken&#8217;s consistent quality and versatility and (iv) its introduction on many foodservice menus. In addition, global protein demand continues to be strong, consistent with rising standards of living and a growing middle class in developing countries around the world. USDA estimates from 2010 through 2020 show an anticipated increase of global chicken demand of 29%, 81% of which is expected to come from emerging markets. We believe our relationship with JBS positions us to capture a portion of those emerging markets. 

Key Industry Dynamics 

Pricing. &#32;Items that influence chicken pricing in the U.S. include international demand, changes in production by other broiler producing countries, input costs and the demand associated with substitute products such as beef and pork. We believe our focus on sales mix enables us to adapt to changing supply demand dynamics by adjusting our production to maximize value. We also benefit from a shorter production lifecycle of broilers compared to other proteins. While production for cattle takes approximately 28 to 39 months from breeding to slaughter and the production for pork takes 11 to 12 months, the production lifecycle for the broiler is only ten weeks. 

Feed. &#32;Broilers are fed corn and soybean meal as well as certain vitamins and minerals. Corn and soybean meal accounted for approximately 46.0% and 35.1% of our feed costs, respectively, in 2015. Broiler production is significantly more efficient from a feed perspective than cattle or hog production. Approximately two pounds of feed are required for each pound of chicken, as compared to approximately seven and 3.5 pounds for cattle and hogs, respectively. We have sought to mitigate the impact of feed price volatility on our profitability by decreasing the amount of our products that are sold under longer term fixed price contracts, broadening our product portfolio and expanding the variety of contracts within our book of business. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe that our competitive strengths will enable us to maintain and grow our position as a leading chicken company and to capitalize on future favorable growth opportunities: 

Leading market position in the growing chicken industry. We are one of the largest chicken producers globally and a leading chicken producer in the U.S. with an approximate 17.0% market share, based on ready-to-cook production in 2014, 

according to WATTPoultryUSA &#32;magazine. We believe we can maintain this prominent market position as we are one of the few producers in the chicken industry that can fully satisfy the requirements of large retailers and foodservice companies due to our broad product range, national distribution, vertically integrated operations and technical capabilities. Further, our scale of operations, balanced product portfolio and a wide range of production capabilities enable us to meet both the capacity and quality requirements of our customer base. Finally, we believe we are well positioned with our global footprint to benefit from the growth in the U.S. chicken export market. 

Broad product portfolio. We have a diversified product portfolio ranging from large to small birds and from fresh to cooked to processed chicken. In addition, our prepared foods business is focused on our most profitable product lines. We believe we are well positioned to be the primary chicken supplier for large customers due to our ability to provide consistent supply, innovate and develop new products to address consumer desires and provide competitive pricing across a diverse product portfolio. Our balanced portfolio of fresh, prepared and value-added chicken products yields a diversified sales mix, mitigating supply and market volatility and creating more consistent gross margins. 

Blue chip and diverse customer base across all industry segments. We benefit from strong relationships with leading companies in every customer segment, including Chick-fil-A &#174; , Sysco &#174; , US Foods, Yum! Brands &#174; , Kroger &#174; , Wal-Mart &#174; , Costco &#174; , Publix &#174; , Albertsons &#174; , H-E-B &#174; , Sam&#8217;s Club &#174; &#32;and ConAgra Foods &#174; , most of whom have been doing business with us for more than five years. We sell our products to a large and diverse customer base, with over 5,000 customers, with no single one accounting for more than 10% of total sales. 

Lean and focused enterprise. We are an efficient and lean organization supported by our market-driven business strategy. Since 2008, we have closed, idled or sold 14 plants and 14 distribution centers, reduced or consolidated production at other facilities, streamlined our workforce and reduced administrative and corporate expenses. In addition, we continue to seek to make significant production improvements driven by improved yields, labor, cost savings and product mix. We utilize zero-based budgeting and plant-level profit and loss analysis, driving engagement and ownership over the results at each plant. These strategic initiatives have reduced our cost base, resulting in higher and more sustainable profits. We share corporate headquarters with JBS in Greeley, Colorado, and have integrated certain corporate functions with JBS to save costs. 

Robust cash flow generation with disciplined capital allocation. &#32;Our leading market position, strong customer relationships and highly efficient operations help drive attractive and we believe sustainable &#32;margins. We also have a proven track record of disciplined capital allocation. We have spent approximately $554 million since 2011 in capital spending towards identified projects with rapid payback, further driving our profitability. Since the end of 2011, we have also reduced our net debt from over $1.4 billion to $575 million at the end of 2015. 

Experienced management team and results-oriented corporate culture. We have a proven senior management team whose tenure in the chicken industry has spanned numerous market cycles and is among the most experienced in the industry. Our senior management team is led by William W. Lovette, our Chief Executive Officer, who has over 30 years of experience in the chicken industry. Our management team has successfully improved and realigned our business and instilled a corporate culture focused on performance and accountability. We also benefit from management ideas, best practices, and talent shared with the seasoned management team of JBS, which has over 50 years of combined experience operating protein processing facilities in South America, North America and Australia. 

Relationship with JBS. We work closely with JBS management to identify areas where Pilgrim's and JBS can achieve synergies. We share corporate headquarters with JBS in Greeley, Colorado, and have integrated certain corporate functions with JBS to save costs. In addition to cost savings through the integration of certain corporate functions and the rationalization of facilities, our relationship with JBS allows us to enjoy several advantages given its diversified international operations and strong record in commodity risk management. We seek to leverage JBS' international network by expanding into untapped international markets and strengthening our presence in geographies in which we already operate. In addition, the expertise of JBS in managing the risk associated with volatile commodity inputs will help us to further improve our operations and manage our margins. 

Business Strategy 

We intend to continue growing our business and enhancing profitability by pursuing the following strategies: 

Be a valued partner with our key customers. &#32;We have developed and acquired complementary markets, distributor relationships and geographic locations that have enabled us to expand our customer base and provide global distribution capabilities for all of our product lines. As a result, we believe we are one of only two U.S. chicken producers that can supply the growing demand for a broad range of price competitive standard and specialized products with well-known brand names on a nationwide basis from a single-source supplier. Additionally, we intend to leverage our innovation capabilities to develop new products along with our customers to accelerate sales and enhance the profitability of chicken products at their businesses. We plan to further enhance our industry position by optimizing our sales mix and accelerating innovation. 

Relentless pursuit of operational excellence . &#32;As production and sales grow, we continue to focus on improving operating efficiencies by focusing on cost reductions, more effective processes, training and our total quality management program. Specific initiatives include: 

&#8226; 

Benchmarking live and plant costs against the industry; 

&#8226; 

Striving to be in the top 25% of the industry for yields and costs; 

&#8226; 

Fostering a culture of accountability and ownership deeper in the organization; 

&#8226; 

Conducting monthly performance reviews with senior management; and 

&#8226; 

Improving sales mix and price. 

Between 2011 and 2015, these initiatives have resulted in approximately $1.0 billion of cumulative operational improvements, including from reduction of plant-related costs and improved sales mix and product yield. Between 2007 and 2015, our SG&#38;A has also decreased by approximately 95 basis points as a percentage of net sales, as we have reduced these costs. 

Strategically grow value-added exports. &#32;We will continue our focus on expanding international sales by seeking opportunities to increase penetration in our existing markets and entering attractive new markets. Expansion of our export sales complements our U.S. chicken operations and positions us to capitalize on expected global demand growth, particularly in emerging markets. Utilizing the extensive sales network of JBS, we believe that we can accelerate the sales of value-added chicken products into our international distribution channels. Our relationship with JBS has improved our access to markets such as Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and Asia. We believe substantial opportunities exist to expand our sales to these markets by capitalizing on direct international distribution channels supplemented by our existing export broker relationships. Our export sales accounted for approximately 4.6% of our U.S. chicken sales in 2015. 

Accountability and ownership culture. We have a results-oriented culture with our business strategy centered on reducing fixed costs and increasing profitability, consistent with JBS values. Our employee accountability has further increased as we have de-layered the organization through our recent restructuring and cost improvement initiatives. In addition, we continue to invest in developing our talent internally. As a result, we have a strong accountability and ownership culture. We strive to be the best managed and most respected company in our industry. 

Reportable Business Segment 

We operate in one reportable business segment, as a producer and seller of chicken products we either produce or purchase for resale in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Mexico. We conduct separate operations in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Mexico; however, for geographic reporting purposes, we include Puerto Rico with our U.S. operations. See &#8220;Note 19. Business Segment and Geographic Reporting&#8221; of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this annual report for additional information. 

Products and Markets 

Our primary product types are fresh chicken products, prepared chicken products and value-added export chicken products. We sell our fresh chicken products to the foodservice and retail markets. Our fresh chicken products consist of refrigerated (nonfrozen) whole or cut-up chicken, either pre-marinated or non-marinated and prepackaged case-ready chicken. Our case-ready chicken includes various combinations of freshly refrigerated, whole chickens and chicken parts in trays, bags or other consumer packs labeled and priced ready for the retail grocer&#8217;s fresh meat counter. Our fresh chicken sales accounted for 69.8% of our total U.S. chicken sales in 2015. 

We also sell prepared chicken products, including portion-controlled breast fillets, tenderloins and strips, delicatessen products, salads, formed nuggets and patties and bone-in chicken parts. These products are sold either refrigerated or frozen and may be fully cooked, partially cooked or raw. In addition, these products are breaded or non-breaded and either pre-marinated or non-marinated. Our prepared chicken products sales accounted for 24.9% of our total U.S. chicken sales in 2015. 

E xport and other chicken products primarily consist of whole chickens and chicken parts sold either refrigerated for distributors in the U.S. or frozen for distribution to export markets. We sell U.S.-produced chicken products for export to Mexico, the Middle East, Asia, countries within the Commonwealth of Independent States (the &#8220;CIS&#8221;) and other world markets. In the U.S., prices of these products are negotiated daily or weekly and are generally related to market prices quoted by the USDA or other public price reporting services. Prices for export sales are determined by supply and demand and local market conditions. In certain newly accessed international markets, we have established premium brands, which allow us to market our products at 

a premium to commodity price levels within those regions. Our export and other chicken products sales accounted for 5.3% of our total U.S. chicken sales in 2015. 

Our primary customer markets consist of the foodservice and retail channels, as well as selected export and other markets. 

Our foodservice market principally consists of chain restaurants, food processors, broad-line distributors and certain other institutions located throughout the continental U.S. Within this market, we service frozen, fresh and corporate accounts. Fresh and frozen chicken products are usually pre-cut to customer specifications and are often marinated to enhance value and product differentiation. Corporate accounts include further-processed and value-added products supplied to select foodservice customers, improving their ability to manage product consistency and quality in a cost efficient manner. We believe we are positioned to be the primary or secondary supplier to national and international chain restaurants who require multiple suppliers of chicken products. Additionally, we believe we are well suited to be the sole supplier for many regional chain restaurants. Regional chain restaurants often offer better margin opportunities and a growing base of business. We believe that our full-line product capabilities, high-volume production capacities, research and development expertise and extensive distribution and marketing experience are competitive strengths compared to smaller and non-vertically integrated producers. Foodservice growth is anticipated to continue, despite the effects resulting from continued weak economic conditions in the U.S. 

Our retail market consists primarily of grocery store chains, wholesale clubs and other retail distributors. Our retail market products consist primarily of branded, prepackaged cut-up and whole chicken and chicken parts. We concentrate our efforts in this market on creating value for our customers through category management and supporting key customers in expanding their private label sales programs. Additionally, for many years, we have invested in both trade and retail marketing designed to establish high levels of brand name awareness and consumer preference. We utilize numerous advertising and marketing techniques to develop and strengthen trade and consumer awareness and increase brand loyalty for consumer products marketed under the Gold Kist &#174; , County Post &#174; , Pierce Chicken &#174; , Pilgrim&#8217;s Pride &#174; &#32;and Pilgrim&#8217;s &#174; &#32;brands. We believe our efforts to achieve and maintain brand awareness and loyalty help to achieve greater price premiums than would otherwise be the case in certain markets and support and expand our product distribution. We actively seek to identify and address consumer preferences by using sophisticated qualitative and quantitative consumer research techniques in key geographic markets to discover and validate new product ideas, packaging designs and methods. 

Our export and other chicken market consists primarily of customers who purchase for distribution in the U.S. or for export to Mexico, the Middle East, Asia, countries within the CIS and other world markets. Our value-added export and other chicken products, with the exception of our exported prepared chicken products, consist of whole chickens and chicken parts sold in bulk, or value-added form, either refrigerated or frozen. We believe that U.S. chicken exports will continue to grow as worldwide demand increases for high-quality, low-cost meat protein sources. We expect that worldwide demand for higher-margin prepared food products will increase over the next several years and believe our strategy of value-added export growth positions us to take advantage of this expected demand. 

Historically, we have targeted international markets to generate additional demand for our dark chicken meat, for which there has been less demand in the U.S. than for white chicken meat. We have expanded our portfolio to provide prepared chicken products tailored for export to the international divisions of our U.S. chain restaurant customers, as well as newly identified customers in regions not previously accessed. Through our relationship with JBS, we have developed an international distribution channel focused on growing our tailored export program and expanding value-added products, such as all-vegetable-fed whole griller birds, chicken franks and further processed thigh meat. Utilizing the extensive sales network of JBS, we believe that we can accelerate the sales of value-added chicken products into these international channels. 

The following table sets forth, for the periods beginning with 2011, net sales attributable to each of our primary product lines and markets served with those products. We based the table on our internal sales reports and their classification of product types.

Product Types 

Fresh Chicken Overview. &#32;Fresh chicken is an important component of our sales and accounted for $4,701.9 million, or 69.8%, of our total U.S. chicken sales in 2015 and $3,160.4 million, or 51.7%, in 2011. Most fresh chicken products are sold to established customers, based upon certain weekly or monthly market prices reported by the USDA and other public price reporting services, plus a markup, which is dependent upon the customer&#8217;s location, volume, product specifications and other factors. We believe our practices with respect to sales of fresh chicken are generally consistent with those of our competitors. The majority of these products are sold pursuant to agreements with varying terms that set a price according to formulas based on underlying chicken price markets, subject in many cases to minimum and maximum prices. 

Prepared Chicken Overview. &#32;In 2015, $1,672.7 million, or 24.9%, of our U.S. chicken sales were in prepared chicken products to foodservice customers and retail distributors, as compared to $2,135.3 million, or 35.0%, in 2011. The production and sale in the U.S. of prepared chicken products reduce the impact of the costs of feed ingredients on our profitability. Feed ingredient costs are the single largest component of our U.S. cost of sales, representing approximately 30.6% of our U.S. cost of sales in 2015. The production of feed ingredients is positively or negatively affected primarily by the global level of supply inventories, demand for feed ingredients, the agricultural policies of the U.S. and foreign governments and weather patterns throughout the world. As further processing is performed, feed ingredient costs become a decreasing percentage of a product&#8217;s total production cost, thereby reducing their impact on our profitability. Products sold in this form enable us to charge a premium, reduce the impact of feed ingredient costs on our profitability and improve and stabilize our profit margins. 

We establish prices for our prepared chicken products based primarily upon perceived value to the customer, production costs and prices of competing products. The majority of these products are sold pursuant to agreements with varying terms that either set a fixed price for short-term periods or set a price according to formulas based on an underlying commodity market such as corn and chicken price forecasts, subject in many cases to minimum and maximum prices. Many times, these prices are dependent upon the customer&#8217;s location, volume, product specifications and other factors. 

Export and Other Chicken Overview. &#32;Our export and other chicken products consist of whole chickens and chicken parts sold primarily in bulk, nonbranded form, either refrigerated to distributors in the U.S. or frozen for distribution to export markets, and branded and nonbranded prepared chicken products for distribution to export markets. In 2015, approximately $358.9 million, or 5.3%, of our total U.S. chicken sales were attributable to U.S. chicken export and other chicken products, as compared to $808.0 million, or 13.3%, in 2011. 

Markets for Other Products 

Presently, this category includes chicken by-products, which we convert into protein products and sell primarily to manufacturers of pet foods. In addition, many of our U.S. feed mills produce and sell some livestock feeds to local dairy farmers and livestock producers. We marketed fresh eggs through private labels until August 2012. In August 2012, we sold our commercial egg operation to Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. We sold products, primarily our own chicken products, through our four U.S. distribution centers until November 2011. In November 2011, we sold these distribution centers to JBS. 

Mexico Operations 

Background 

Our Mexico operations generated approximately 12.7% of our net sales in 2015. We are one of the largest producers and sellers of chicken in Mexico. We believe that we operate one of the more efficient business models for chicken production in Mexico. 

On June 29, 2015, we acquired, indirectly through certain of our Mexican subsidiaries, 100% of the equity of Provemex Holding LLC and its subsidiaries (together, &#8220;Tyson Mexico&#8221;) from Tyson Foods, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries for cash. Tyson Mexico is a vertically integrated poultry business based in Gomez Palacio, Durango, Mexico. The acquired business has a production capacity of three million birds per week in its three plants and currently employs more than 4,500 people in its plants, offices and seven distribution centers. The acquisition further strengthens our strategic position in the Mexico chicken market. We expect to maintain these operations working to capacity with the existing workforce. We plan to keep all current labor contracts in place. The results of operations of the acquired business since June 29, 2015 are included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net sales generated by the acquired business from the acquisition date through December 27, 2015 totaled $250.6 million. The acquired business incurred a net loss from the acquisition date through December 27, 2015 totaling $13.7 million. 

During 2014 and 2015, we invested approximately $12.5 million in the first phase of a new poultry processing complex in Veracruz, Mexico. We initiated live production operations at this facility in September 2015. 

During 2014, we also executed our first grower contract for breeding flocks in Mexico. The contract grower farms, which initiated operations in November 2014, are located in San Luis Potos&#237;, Mexico and allowed us to replace some of our current company-owned breeder farms in Quer&#233;taro, Mexico. 

Product Types 

While the market for chicken products in Mexico is less developed than in the U.S., with sales attributed to fewer, simpler products, we believe we have been successful in differentiating our products through high-quality client service and product improvements. Additionally, we are an important player in the live market, which accounts for approximately 25% of the chicken sales in Mexico. 

Markets 

We sell our chicken products primarily to wholesalers, large restaurant chains, fast food accounts and supermarket chains, and also engage in direct retail distribution in selected markets. Our largest presence is by far in the central states of the country where we have been able to gain market share. Our presence in Mexico reaches 72.4% of the population. 

Foreign Operations Risks 

Our foreign operations pose special risks to our business and operations. A discussion of foreign operations risks is included in &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Key Customers 

Our two largest customers accounted for approximately 14.9% and 14.6% of our net sales in 2015 and 2014, respectively. No customer accounted for ten percent or more of our net sales in either 2015 or 2014. 

Competition 

The chicken industry is highly competitive. We are one of the largest chicken producers in the world and we believe our relationship with JBS enhances our competitive position. In the U.S. and Mexico, we compete principally with other vertically integrated poultry companies. However, there is some competition with non-vertically integrated further processors in the U.S. prepared chicken business. We believe vertical integration generally provides significant, long-term cost and quality advantages over non-vertically integrated further processors. 

In general, the competitive factors in the U.S. chicken industry include price, product quality, product development, brand identification, breadth of product line and customer service. Competitive factors vary by major market. In the U.S. retail market, we believe that product quality, brand awareness, customer service and price are the primary bases of competition. In the foodservice market, competition is based on consistent quality, product development, service and price. The export market is competitive on a global level based on price, product quality, product tailoring, brand identification and customer service. Competitive factors vary by market and may be impacted further by trade restrictions, sanitary and phyto-sanitary issues, brand awareness and the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against local currencies. We believe that product customization, service and price are the most critical competitive factors for export sales. 

In Mexico, where product differentiation has traditionally been limited, we believe product quality and price have been the most critical competitive factors. 

Regulation and Environmental Matters 

The chicken industry is subject to government regulation, particularly in the health, workplace safety and environmental areas, including provisions relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, by the Centers for Disease Control (&#8220;CDC&#8221;), the USDA, the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and state and local regulatory authorities in the U.S. and by similar governmental agencies in Mexico. Our chicken processing facilities in the U.S. are subject to on-site examination, inspection and regulation by the USDA. The FDA inspects the production of our feed mills in the U.S. Our Mexican food processing facilities and feed mills are subject to on-site examination, inspection and regulation by a Mexican governmental agency that performs functions similar to those performed by the USDA and FDA. 

Our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the EPA and other state and local authorities relating to handling and discharge of waste water, storm water, air emissions, treatment, storage and disposal of wastes, handling of hazardous substances and remediation of contaminated soil, surface water and groundwater. Our Mexican operations also are subject to extensive regulation by Mexican environmental authorities. The EPA, Mexican environmental authorities and/or other U.S. or Mexican state and local authorities may, from time to time, adopt revisions to environmental rules and regulations, and/or changes in the terms and conditions of our environmental permits, with which we must comply. Compliance with existing or new environmental requirements, including more stringent limitations imposed or expected in recently-renewed or soon-to be renewed environmental permits, may require capital expenditures and operating expenses which may be significant. Our operations are also subject to regulation by the EPA, OSHA and other state and local regulatory authorities regarding the treatment and disposal of agricultural and food processing wastes, the use and maintenance of refrigeration systems, including ammonia-based chillers, noise, odor and dust management, the operation of mechanized processing equipment, and other operations. 

Some of our facilities have been operating for many years, and were built before current environmental, health and safety standards were imposed and/or in areas that recently have become subject to residential and commercial development pressures. We are upgrading wastewater treatment facilities at a number of our facilities, either pursuant to consent agreements with regulatory authorities or on a voluntary basis in anticipation of future permit requirements. We do not anticipate that the capital expenditures associated with these upgrades, which will be spread over a number of years, will be material. 

We have from time to time had incidents at our plants involving worker health and safety. These have included ammonia releases due to mechanical failures in chiller systems and worker injuries and fatalities involving processing equipment and vehicle accidents. We have taken preventive measures in response. 

Some of our properties have been impacted by contamination from spills or other releases, and we have incurred costs to remediate such contamination. In addition, in the past we acquired businesses with operations such as pesticide and fertilizer production that involved greater use of hazardous materials and generation of more hazardous wastes than our current operations. While many of those operations have been sold or closed, some environmental laws impose strict and, in certain circumstances, joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation of contaminated sites on current and former owners and operators of the sites, and on persons who arranged for disposal of wastes at such sites. In addition, current owners or operators 

of such contaminated sites may seek to recover cleanup costs from us based on past operations or contractual indemnifications. See &#8220;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#8221; for risks associated with compliance with existing or changing environmental requirement. 

We anticipate increased regulation by the USDA concerning food safety, by the FDA concerning the use of medications in feed and by the EPA and various other state agencies concerning discharges to the environment. Although we do not currently anticipate that such increased regulation will have a material adverse effect upon us, new environmental, health and safety requirements that are more stringent than we anticipate, stricter interpretations of existing environmental requirements, or obligations related to the investigation or clean-up of contaminated sites may materially affect our business or operations in the future. 

Employees 

As of December 27, 2015, we employed approximately 29,100 persons in the U.S. and approximately 9,750 persons in Mexico. Approximately 45.6% of the Company&#8217;s employees were covered under collective bargaining agreements. Substantially all employees covered under collective bargaining agreements are covered under agreements that expire in 2016 or later, with the exception of four processing operations locations, where the collective bargaining agreements expired in 2015 and negotiations are ongoing. We have not experienced any labor-related work stoppage at any location in over ten years. We believe our relationship with our employees and union leadership is satisfactory. At any given time, we will likely be in some stage of contract negotiations with various collective bargaining units. The Company is currently in negotiations at four locations, and there is no assurance that agreements will be reached. In the absence of agreements, we may become subject to labor disruption at one or more of these locations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.
