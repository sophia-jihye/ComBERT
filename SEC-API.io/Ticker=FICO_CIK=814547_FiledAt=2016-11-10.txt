 Item 1. Business 

GENERAL 

Fair Isaac Corporation (NYSE: FICO) (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; which may also be referred to in this report as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; and &#8220;FICO&#8221;) provides products and services that enable businesses to automate, improve and connect decisions to enhance business performance. Our predictive analytics, which includes the industry-standard FICO &#174; &#32;Score, and our decision management systems leverage the use of big data and mathematical algorithms to predict consumer behavior and power hundreds of billions of customer decisions each year. 

We were founded in 1956 on the premise that data, used intelligently, can improve business decisions. Today, we help thousands of companies in over 100 countries use our decision management technology to target and acquire customers more efficiently, increase customer value, reduce fraud and credit losses, lower operating expenses, and enter new markets more profitably. Most leading banks and credit card issuers rely on our solutions, as do insurers, retailers, telecommunications providers, pharmaceutical companies, healthcare organizations, public agencies and organizations in other industries. We also serve consumers through online services that enable people to purchase and understand their FICO &#174; &#32;Scores, the standard measure in the U.S. of consumer credit risk, empowering them to manage their financial health. 

More information about us can be found on our principal website, www.fico.com. We make our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K, as well as amendments to those reports, available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the SEC.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES 

We use analytics to help businesses automate, improve and connect decisions across their enterprise, an approach we commonly refer to as decision management. Most of our solutions address customer engagement, including customer acquisition, customer onboarding, customer servicing and management, and customer protection. We also help businesses improve non-customer decisions such as transaction and claims processing. Our solutions enable users to make decisions that are more precise, consistent and agile, and that systematically advance business goals. This helps our clients to reduce the cost of doing business, increase revenues and profitability, reduce losses from risks and fraud, and increase customer loyalty. 

Our Segments 

We categorize our products and services into the following three operating segments: 

&#8226; 

Applications. This segment includes pre-configured decision management applications designed for a specific type of business problem or process &#8212; such as marketing, account origination, customer management, fraud, collections and insurance claims management &#8212; as well as associated professional services. These applications are available to our customers as on-premises software, and many are available as hosted, software-as-a-service (&#8220;SaaS&#8221;) applications through the FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Cloud. 

&#8226; 

Scores . This segment includes our business-to-business scoring solutions and services, our business-to-consumer scoring solutions and services including myFICO &#174; &#32;solutions for consumers, and associated professional services. Our scoring solutions give our clients access to analytics that can be easily integrated into their transaction streams and decision-making processes. Our scoring solutions are distributed through major credit reporting agencies worldwide, as well as services through which we provide our scores to clients directly. 

&#8226; 

Decision Management Software (formerly&#8220;Tools&#8221; ) . This segment is composed of analytic and decision management software tools that clients can use to create their own custom decision management applications, our new FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Management Suite, as well as associated professional services. These tools are available to our customers as on-premises software or through the FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Cloud. 

Comparative segment revenues, operating income and related financial information for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 are set forth in Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

Our Solutions 

Our solutions involve four fundamental disciplines: 

&#8226; 

Analytics, which include predictive analytics that identify risks and opportunities associated with individual customers, prospects and transactions, in order to detect patterns such as risk and fraud, as well as optimization analytics that are used to improve the design of decision logic or &#8220;strategies.&#8221; 

&#8226; 

Data management and transaction profiling that bring extensive consumer information to every decision. 

&#8226; 

Software such as decision management systems that implement business rules, models and decision strategies, often in a real-time environment, as well as software for managing customer engagement. 

&#8226; 

Consulting services that help clients make the most of investments in FICO applications, tools and scores in the shortest possible time. 

All of our solutions are designed to help businesses make decisions that are faster, more precise, more consistent and more agile, while reducing costs and risks incurred in making decisions. With the new FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Cloud, FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Management Platform and FICO &#174; Decision Management Suite, we now offer clients an increasing portfolio of applications, tools and services in the cloud, which they can use to create, customize, deploy and manage powerful analytic services. 

Applications 

We develop industry-tailored decision management applications, which apply analytics, data management and decision management software to specific business challenges and processes. Our applications primarily serve clients in the banking, insurance, telecommunications, healthcare, retail and public sectors. During fiscal 2016, we continued to expand our product offerings for the FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Cloud, resulting in increased sales opportunities by accommodating small to mid-size businesses that benefit from the affordability and simplicity of cloud-based solutions. Within our Applications segment our fraud solutions accounted for 20%, 23% and 23% of total revenues in each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively; our customer management solutions accounted for 9%, 9% and 10% of total revenues in each of these periods, respectively; and our customer communication services accounted for 9%, 8% and 8% of total revenues for each of these periods, respectively. 

Marketing Applications 

The chief offerings for marketing are our FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Offer Manager and FICO &#174; &#32;Customer Dialogue Manager. These solutions offer a suite of products, capabilities and services designed to integrate the technology and analytic services needed to perform context-sensitive customer acquisition, cross-selling and retention programs and deliver mathematically optimized offers. Our marketing solutions enable companies that offer multiple products and use multiple channels (companies such as large financial institutions, consumer branded goods companies, pharmaceutical companies, retail merchants and hospitality companies) to execute more efficient and profitable customer interactions. Services offered in our marketing solutions include customer data integration services; services that enable real-time marketing through direct consumer interaction channels; campaign management and optimization services; interactive tools that automate the design, execution and collection of customer response data across multiple channels; and customer data collection, management and profiling services. 

Originations Applications 

We provide solutions that enable banks, credit unions, finance companies, alternative peer-to-peer and online lenders, auto lenders and other companies to automate and improve the processing of requests for credit or service. These solutions increase the speed and efficiency with which requests are handled, reduce losses and increase approval rates through analytics that assess applicant risk, and reduce the need for manual review by loan officers. 

The latest version of our origination application, FICO &#174; &#32;Origination Manager, is an application-to-decision processing solution, available both on premises and in the FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Cloud. Our other solutions include the web-based FICO &#174; &#32;LiquidCredit &#174; &#32;service, which is primarily focused on credit decisions and is offered largely to mid-tier banking institutions. We also offer custom and consortium-based credit risk and application fraud models. 

Customer Management Applications 

Our customer strategy management products and services enable businesses to automate and improve risk-based decisions for their existing customers. These solutions help businesses apply advanced analytics in account and customer decisions to increase portfolio revenue, decrease risk exposure and losses, and reduce customer attrition, while improving operational efficiencies. 

We provide customer strategy management solutions for banking, telecommunications and retail. Our primary account and customer strategy management product is FICO &#174; &#32;TRIAD &#174; &#32;Customer Manager, a leading credit management system, available both on premises and in the FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Cloud. The solution is an adaptive control system, which enables businesses to rapidly adapt to changing business and internal conditions by designing and testing new strategies in a &#8220;champion/challenger&#8221; environment. The current version enables users to manage risk and communications at both the account and customer level from a single platform. 

We market and sell FICO &#174; &#32;TRIAD &#174; &#32;Customer Manager software licenses, maintenance, consulting services, and strategy design and evaluation. Additionally, we provide TRIAD services and similar credit account management services through third-party credit card processors worldwide, including two of the largest processors in the U.S. 

Fraud and Security Management Applications 

Our fraud management products improve our clients&#8217; profitability by predicting the likelihood a given transaction or customer account is experiencing fraud. Our fraud products analyze transactions in real time and generate recommendations for immediate action, which is critical to stopping third-party fraud, as well as first-party fraud and deliberate misuse of account privileges. 

Our solutions are designed to detect and prevent a wide variety of fraud and risk types across multiple industries, including credit and debit payment card fraud; e-payment fraud; deposit account fraud; healthcare fraud; Medicaid and Medicare fraud; and property and casualty insurance claims fraud, including workers' compensation fraud. FICO fraud solutions protect financial institutions, insurance companies and government agencies from losses and damaged customer relationships caused by fraud and related criminal behavior. 

Our leading fraud detection solution is FICO &#174; Falcon &#174; &#32;Fraud Manager, recognized as a leader in global payment card fraud detection. Falcon &#174; &#32;Fraud Manager examines transaction, cardholder, account, customer, device and merchant data to detect a wide range of payment card fraud quickly and accurately utilizing artificial intelligence technology. It analyzes payment transactions in real time, assesses the risk of fraud in a fraud score, and provides the ability for user-defined variables and rules strategies to be used in conjunction with the fraud score to prevent fraud while expediting legitimate transactions. Adaptive analytics, a form of self-learning models, can also be employed to accelerate our customers&#8217; response to evolving fraud tactics. 

FICO &#174; Fraud Predictor with Merchant Profiles is used in conjunction with Falcon &#174; &#32;Fraud Manager on payment card monitoring for credit and debit to improve fraud detection rates through the inclusion of merchant profiles. Merchant profiles are built using fraud and transactional data that include characteristics revealing which merchants have a history of higher fraud volumes, and which purchase types and ticket sizes have most often been fraudulent at a particular merchant, among others. 

In addition to our Falcon products, we offer a wide range of solutions focused on preventing and detecting a variety of financial crimes. FICO &#174; &#32;Application Fraud Manager helps businesses prevent both first- and third-party fraud during the application process. By preventing fraud prior to account origination we help our customers avoid future losses as well as unnecessary collections costs. Separately, the FICO &#174; Card Alert Service prevents ATM debit fraud by identifying counterfeit payment cards and reporting them to issuers. The service analyzes daily transactions from participating networks, and uses this data to identify common points of compromise and suspect cards most likely to incur fraud. 

FICO &#174; Insurance Fraud Manager uses advanced unsupervised predictive modeling techniques to detect health care claims fraud, abuse and errors as soon as unusual behavior patterns emerge. Insurance Fraud Manager is used by both public and private health care payers to detect and prevent fraud in both pre- and post-pay fraud investigation environments. 

FICO offers a comprehensive modular set of compliance solutions to fight money-laundering, terrorist financing, and to fulfill custom requirements for governance, risk and compliance. These solutions are based on the acquisition of TONBELLER Aktiengesellschaft (&#8220;TONBELLER&#8221;) combined with FICO&#8217;s legacy fraud analytics, such as those used in FICO &#174; &#32;Falcon &#174; &#32;Fraud Manager. 

FICO&#8217;s cybersecurity products utilize predictive analytics to deliver enterprise-level risk assessments as well as prioritization of tactical cyber threat response. The FICO &#174; &#32;Enterprise Security Score, based on the acquisition of QuadMetrics, Inc. (&#8220;QuadMetrics&#8221;) in 2016, provides an empirically derived score that conveys the security posture of an organization and the likelihood of a material data breach in the next 12 months. The score is used to manage the cyber risk of an enterprise as well as risks introduced by trusted business partners. Separately, FICO &#174; &#32;Falcon &#174; &#32;Cybersecurity Analytics utilizes advanced streaming self-learning models to help organizations detect and remediate cyber attacks by reducing the dwell time between when an attack occurs and when it is recognized. These products can be used independently or together as part of a comprehensive cyber risk management program. 

Collections &#38; Recovery Applications 

FICO &#174; &#32;Debt Manager &#8482; &#32;solution and FICO &#174; &#32;PlacementsPlus &#174; service automate the full cycle of collections and recovery, including early collections, late collections, asset disposal, agency placement, recovery, litigation, bankruptcy, asset management and residual balance recovery. PlacementsPlus service facilitates control over the distribution and management of accounts to agencies, attorneys, debt buyers and internal recovery departments. FICO Debt Management Solutions also include assessments, models and scores, predictive analytics, advanced customer engagement, optimization and speech analytics capabilities. FICO &#174; &#32;Debt Manager &#8482; &#32;is available both on premises and in the FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Cloud. 

Customer Communication Services 

FICO &#174; &#32;Customer Communication Services provides customer engagement, fraud resolution, and collections solutions in the cloud. It enables leading financial services institutions, utilities, telecommunications firms, insurers, and other businesses to engage in automated two-way communications. It allows businesses to reach customers in real time using short message service (&#8220;SMS&#8221;), mobile applications, automated voice, email and other channels; resolve matters such as verification of suspicious credit or debit card transactions; request missed payments; and resolve customer service issues. FICO &#174; &#32;Customer Communication Services, combined with FICO&#8217;s decision management applications, allow businesses to execute and resolve customer interactions while improving customer outcomes. 

Analytic Services 

We perform custom predictive, descriptive and decision modeling and related analytic projects for clients in multiple industries to address business processes across the customer life cycle. This work leverages our analytic methodologies and expertise to solve risk management and marketing challenges for a single business, using that business&#8217;s data and industry best practices to develop a highly customized solution. Most of this work falls under predictive analytics, decision analysis and optimization, which provide greater insight into customer preferences and future customer behavior. Within decision analysis and optimization, we apply data and proprietary algorithms to the design of customer treatment strategies. 

Scores 

Our FICO &#174; &#32;Scores are used in the majority of U.S. credit decisions, by nearly all of the major banks, credit card organizations, mortgage lenders and auto loan originators. These credit scores, developed based on third-party data, provide a consistent and objective measure of an individual&#8217;s credit risk. Credit grantors use our FICO &#174; &#32;Scores in a variety of ways: to prescreen candidates for marketing programs; evaluate applicants for new credit; and manage existing customer accounts. FICO &#174; &#32;Score is a three-digit score ranging from 300&#8212;850. They are calculated by running data from the three U.S. national credit reporting agencies, TransUnion, Experian and Equifax, through one of several proprietary scoring models developed by FICO. Lenders generally pay the credit reporting agencies scoring fees based on usage, and the credit reporting agencies pay an associated fee to us. FICO &#174; &#32;Score 9, the most recent version of the FICO &#174; &#32;Score, was released in early fiscal 2015. 

While the core FICO &#174; Score is the foundation of our scoring portfolio, we offer a number of other broad based scores, including several specific FICO &#174; &#32;Industry Scores. We also develop various custom scores for our financial services clients. In 2016 we introduced FICO &#174; &#32;Score XD, which expands the scorable population using alternative credit data. FICO &#174; &#32;Score XD looks at public records and property data, and a consumer&#8217;s history with mobile, landline phone and cable payments, to generate scores on the same 300&#8212;850 scale as standard FICO &#174; &#32;Scores. FICO &#174; &#32;Score XD is available to lenders from LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Equifax. 

Outside the U.S., we offer the FICO &#174; &#32;Score for consumers, as well as for small and medium enterprises lending through credit reporting agencies in 12 countries worldwide. We have installed client-specific versions of the FICO &#174; &#32;Score in nine countries. Like FICO &#174; &#32;Scores in the U.S., these scores help lenders in multiple countries leverage the FICO &#174; &#32;Score&#8217;s predictive analysis to assess the risk of marketing prospects and credit applicants. FICO &#174; &#32;Scores are in use or being implemented in 20 different countries across five continents outside the U.S. 

We also have scoring systems for insurance underwriters and marketers. They use the same underlying statistical technology as our FICO &#174; &#32;Scores, but are designed to predict applicant or policyholder insurance loss ratio for automobile or homeowners' coverage. Our insurance scores are available in the U.S. and Canada. We license credit bureau scoring services and related consulting directly to users in banking through the FICO &#174; &#32;PreScore &#174; &#32;service for prescreening solicitation candidates. 

We also provide FICO &#174; Score based products, education and information on FICO &#174; &#32;Scores to consumers. They are distributed directly by us through our myFICO &#174; &#32;service and through licensed distribution partners, including Experian and certain lenders, for use in customer and noncustomer programs. 

The myFICO &#174; &#32;products and subscription offerings are available online at www.myfico.com. Consumers can use the myFICO.com website to purchase their FICO &#174; &#32;Scores, including credit reports associated with the scores, explanations of the factors affecting their scores, and customized information on how to manage their scores. We make available the 19 most widely used versions of the FICO &#174; &#32;Score from the three major U.S. credit bureaus through our myFICO &#174; &#32;service, representing approximately 95% of all FICO &#174; &#32;Scores sold and used by lenders. Customers can use products to simulate how taking specific actions would affect their FICO &#174; &#32;Score. Consumers can also subscribe to monitoring services, which deliver alerts via email and text when changes to a user&#8217;s FICO &#174; &#32;Scores or other credit report content are detected. In addition, consumers can purchase identity theft monitoring products that alert consumers of potential risks of identity fraud with comprehensive detection, defense and identity restoration services. 

Decision Management Software 

We provide analytic and decision management platforms and tools that businesses use to build their own tailored, analytically powered decision management applications on-premises, within the FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Cloud or via third-party cloud environments such as Amazon Web Services. In contrast to our packaged applications developed for specific industry solutions, our tools platform adds scalable and flexible decision management capabilities to virtually any application or operational system . These tools are sold as licensed software, and can be used standalone, or in conjunction with third-party solutions to advance a client&#8217;s decision management initiatives. We use these tools as common software components for our own decision management solutions, described above in the Applications section. They are also key components of our decision management architecture. We also partner with third-party providers within given industry markets and with major software companies to embed our tools within existing applications. 

During fiscal 2016, FICO continued to enhance the FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Management Suite, a collection of tools for building, extending, deploying and scaling applications and solutions. The Decision Management Suite includes the FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Management Platform, along with capabilities for building and customizing predictive analytic, decisioning, and optimization components and services; developing, orchestrating and publishing analytics-powered applications; and visualizing, analyzing and reporting data trends. The FICO &#174; Decision Management Suite is available in the FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Cloud and on-premises; businesses can choose either or both deployments depending on their specific needs, IT environments and other factors. In fiscal 2016, we upgraded and enhanced much of the functionality in the suite, including: 

&#8226; 

FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Management Platform, the fundamental backbone of the Suite, to dramatically improve performance, data interchange, model tracking and user collaboration; 

&#8226; 

FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Management Streaming (formerly known as Data Management Integration Platform) to improve scale, performance and versatility; and 

&#8226; 

FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Central&#8482; (formerly known as Model Central), an analytic and decision model management tool, to expand its versatility and usability across a much broader range of implementations and use cases. 

The FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Management Suite combines big data, predictive analytics and decision execution together in an easy-to-use development environment. It enables organizations to rapidly create innovative analytic applications; dramatically increase developer and business user productivity with support for a broad range of analytic and decision tools; and execute decisions in real time. It also empowers business analysts and other domain experts to modify systems in real time without IT involvement, providing organizations with the agility they need to rapidly respond to customer, regulatory and business changes. 

The principal products offered are software tools for: 

&#8226; 

Rules Management . The FICO &#174; Blaze Advisor &#174; &#32;decision rules management system is used to design, develop, execute and maintain rules-based business applications. The Blaze Advisor system enables business users to propose and preview the impact of changes to decisioning logic, to review and approve proposed changes, and commit those changes to production decisioning, all without demanding IT cycles. The Blaze Advisor system is sold as an end-user tool and is also the rules engine within several of our decision management applications. The Blaze Advisor system, available in six languages, is a multi-platform solution that: embeds rules management within existing applications; supports Web Services and service-oriented architecture, Java 2 Enterprise Edition platforms, Microsoft .NET and COBOL for z/OS mainframes; and is the first rules engine to support Java, .NET and COBOL deployment of the same rules. It also incorporates the exclusive Rete III rules execution technology, which improves the efficiency and speed with which the Blaze Advisor &#174; &#32;system is able to process and execute complex, high-volume decision rules. FICO&#8217;s solution for rules management in the cloud is called FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Modeler. 

&#8226; 

Predictive Modeling. FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Central &#8482; &#32;is a comprehensive offering to help banks and other organizations, including insurance, retail and health care companies, maximize the power of their predictive and decision models and meet stricter regulations for model management. It complements FICO &#174; Model Builder, which enables the user to develop and deploy sophisticated predictive models for use in automated decisions. This software is based on the methodology and tools FICO uses to build both client-level and industry-level predictive models and scorecards, which we have developed over more than 40 years, and includes additional algorithms for rapidly discovering variable relationships, predictive interactions and optimal segmentation. The predictive models produced can be embedded in custom production applications or one of our Decision Management applications and can also be executed in the FICO &#174; &#32;Blaze Advisor &#174; &#32;system. FICO&#8217;s solution set for predictive modeling in the cloud is called FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Modeler. 

&#8226; 

Optimization. &#32;FICO &#174; Xpress Optimization Suite provides operations research professionals with world-class solvers and high-productivity tools to quickly design and deliver custom, mathematically optimal solutions for a wide range of industry problems. Xpress includes a powerful modeling and programming language, with robust scalability, to quickly model and solve even the largest optimization problems. Xpress tools are licensed to end users, consultants and independent software vendors in several industries, and are a core component within FICO &#174; Decision Optimizer. Decision Optimizer is a software tool that enables complex, large-scale optimizations involving dozens of networked action-effect models, and enables exploration and simulation of many optimized scenarios along an efficient frontier of options. The data-driven strategies produced by these tools can be executed by the FICO &#174; Blaze Advisor &#174; &#32;system or one of our Decision Management applications. FICO&#8217;s solution for executing optimization services in the cloud is called FICO &#174; &#32;Optimization Modeler.

TECHNOLOGY 

We specialize in analytics software and decision management technologies that analyze data and drive decision strategies and customer engagement. We maintain active research in a number of fields for the purposes of deriving greater insight and predictive value from data, making various forms of data more usable and valuable to the model-building process, and automating and applying analytics to the various processes involved in making high-volume decisions in real time. 

We are widely recognized as a leader in predictive analytics due to our pioneering work in credit scoring and fraud detection. We believe that our tools and processes are among the very best commercially available, and that we are uniquely able to integrate advanced analytic, software and data technologies into mission-critical business solutions that offer superior returns on investment. 

In fiscal 2016, we continued to make progress with our FICO &#174; &#32;Analytic Cloud and FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Management Platform initiatives. We have made many of our software solutions, which were previously available only as on-premises software installations, into SaaS solutions hosted on our cloud. The FICO &#174; &#32;Decision Management Suite enables clients to use FICO tools, along with rapid application development tools and visualization tools, to quickly develop their own decision management applications and services. We continue to add functionality to the platform as well as host additional FICO applications in the cloud. These ongoing initiatives are driven by enhancing our core technical capabilities listed below, and extending them through partnerships with other technology providers as well as through employing open source software. 

Principal Areas of Expertise 

Predictive Modeling. Predictive modeling identifies and mathematically represents underlying relationships in historical data in order to explain the data and make predictions or classifications about future events. Our models summarize large quantities of data to amplify its value. Predictive models typically analyze current and historical data on individuals to produce easily understood metrics such as scores. These scores rank-order individuals by likely future performance, e.g., their likelihood of making credit payments on time, or of responding to a particular offer for services. We also include in this category models that detect the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent. Our predictive models are frequently operationalized in mission-critical transactional systems and drive decisions and actions in near real time. A number of analytic methodologies underlie our products in this area. These include proprietary applications of both linear and nonlinear mathematical programming algorithms, in which one objective is optimized within a set of constraints, and advanced neural systems, which learn complex patterns from large data sets to predict the probability that a new individual will exhibit certain behaviors of business interest. We also apply various related statistical techniques for analysis and pattern detection within large datasets, and have enhanced our abilities to derive insights and predictive variables from various forms of so-called big data, including unstructured data, such as text. 

Decision Analysis and Optimization. Decision analysis refers to the broad quantitative field that deals with modeling, analyzing and optimizing decisions made by individuals, groups and organizations. Whereas predictive models analyze multiple aspects of individual behavior to forecast future behavior, decision analysis analyzes multiple aspects of a given decision to identify the most effective action to take to reach a desired result. We have developed an integrated approach to decision analysis that incorporates the development of a decision model that mathematically maps the entire decision structure; proprietary optimization technology that identifies the most effective strategies, given both the performance objective and constraints; the development of designed testing required for active, continuous learning; and the robust extrapolation of an optimized strategy to a wider set of scenarios than historically encountered. Our optimization capabilities also include a proprietary mathematical modeling and programming language, an easy-to-use development environment, and a state-of-the-art set of optimization algorithms. 

Transaction Profiling. Transaction profiling is a patent-protected technique used to extract meaningful information and reduce the complexity of transaction data used in modeling. Many of our products operate using transactional data, such as credit card purchase transactions, or other types of data that change over time. In its raw form, this data is very difficult to use in predictive models for several reasons. First, an isolated transaction contains very little information about the behavior of the individual who generated the transaction. In addition, transaction patterns change rapidly over time. Finally, this type of data can often be highly complex. To overcome these issues, we have developed a set of techniques that transform raw transactional data into a mathematical representation that reveals latent information, and which make the data more usable by predictive models. This profiling technology accumulates data across multiple transactions of many types to create and update profiles of transaction patterns. These profiles enable our neural network models to efficiently and effectively make accurate assessments of, for example, fraud risk and credit risk within real-time transaction streams. 

Customer Data Integration. Decisions made on customers or prospects can benefit from data stored in multiple sources, both inside and outside the enterprise. We have focused on developing data integration processes that are able to assemble and integrate those disparate data sources into a unified view of the customer or household, through the application of persistent keying technology. This data can include structured or unstructured data. Recent innovations include a solution that can integrate multiple data sources in real time and make them available for analysis and decisions. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Decision Management Software. In order to make a decision strategy operational, various steps and rules need to be programmed or exported into the business's software infrastructure, where they can communicate with front-end, customer-facing systems and back-end systems such as billing systems. We have developed software systems, sometimes known as decision engines and decision rules management systems, which perform the necessary functions to execute a decision strategy. Our software includes very efficient programs for these functions, facilitating, for example, business user definition of extremely complex decision strategies using graphical user interfaces; simultaneous testing of hundreds of decision strategies in &#8220;champion/challenger&#8221; (test/control) mode; high-volume processing and analysis of transactions in real time; integration of multiple data sources; and execution of predictive models for improved behavior forecasts and finer segmentation. Decision management software is an integral part of our decision management applications, described earlier. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;Customer Engagement . We have advanced technology for customer engagement, which enables the execution of decisions and customer contact through SMS, email, automated voice, mobile applications and other channels. This technology enables FICO to extend decision management beyond the rendering of the decision to the final resolution with a customer, using the most effective method of communication for a given event and customer. Integrating this technology with our decision management systems has proven to decrease costs, improve staff efficiency, increase customer satisfaction and improve the return from marketing, fraud and collections activities. 

Social Network Analysis. We have advanced technology for identity resolution and social network analysis, which enables users to understand the relationships between their organization, customers, events, and third-party actors. Businesses can perform real-time searches across their enterprise data to find, match, and link similar entities and uncover hidden relationship between people, places and things. This technology complements FICO&#8217;s capabilities in the area of fraud and marketing analytics. 

Cybersecurity. We continue to seek projects in the cybersecurity and security information and event management space that leverage FICO&#8217;s streaming analytics, transaction profiling and unsupervised modeling technologies. These technologies include those successfully leveraged by our fraud management systems, including FICO &#174; &#32;Falcon &#174; &#32;Fraud Manager, and new methods we believe to be unique approaches for detecting certain types of cyber security threats. 

Research and Development Activities 

Our research and development expenses were $103.7 million , $98.8 million &#32;and $83.4 million &#32;in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. We believe that our future success depends on our ability to continually maintain and improve our core technologies, enhance our existing products, and develop new products and technologies that meet an expanding range of markets and customer requirements. In the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, we use our own development tools extensively. 

We have traditionally relied primarily on the internal development of our products. Based on timing and cost considerations; however, we have acquired, and in the future may consider acquiring, technology or products from third parties. 

PRODUCT PROTECTION AND TRADEMARKS 

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements and procedures to protect our proprietary rights. 

We retain the title to and protect the suite of models and software used to develop scoring models as a trade secret. We also restrict access to our source code and limit access to and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. We have generally relied upon the laws protecting trade secrets and upon contractual nondisclosure safeguards and restrictions on transferability to protect our software and proprietary interests in our product and service methodology and know-how. Our confidentiality procedures include invention assignment and proprietary information agreements with our employees and independent contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with our distributors, strategic partners and customers. We also claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation. 

We have patents on many of our technologies and have patent applications pending on other technologies. The patents we hold may not be upheld as valid and may not prevent the development of competitive products. In addition, patents may never be issued on our pending patent applications or on any future applications that we may submit. We currently hold 156 U.S. and 15 foreign patents with 93 applications pending. 

Despite our precautions, it may be possible for competitors or users to copy or reproduce aspects of our software or to obtain information that we regard as trade secrets. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Patents and other protections for our intellectual property are important, but we believe our success and growth will depend principally on such factors as the knowledge, ability, experience and creative skills of our personnel, new products, frequent product enhancements and name recognition. 

We have developed technologies for research projects conducted under agreements with various U.S. government agencies or their subcontractors. Although we have acquired commercial rights to these technologies, the U.S. government typically retains ownership of intellectual property rights and licenses in the technologies that we develop under these contracts. In some cases, the U.S. government can terminate our rights to these technologies if we fail to commercialize them on a timely basis. In addition, under U.S. government contracts, the government may make the results of our research public, which could limit our competitive advantage with respect to future products based on funded research. 

We have used, registered and/or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks for our technologies, products and services. We currently have 40 trademarks registered in the U.S. and select foreign countries.
