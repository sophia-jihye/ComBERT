Strategy and Results Summary 

Marathon Oil&#8217;s strategy is to safely and sustainably deliver value by investing in low cost, liquids-rich projects with a focus on risk-adjusted rates of return. We are focused in the high quality core of three premier unconventional resource plays in the U.S.: the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins. Our strategy for our operated conventional producing assets in E.G., the U.K. and the U.S. is to maximize value and cash flow to provide flexibility to invest in the shorter cycle opportunities in the U.S. resource plays. Our conventional exploration program is currently limited to existing commitments in the Gulf of Mexico and Gabon. Our strategy is guided by the following seven strategic imperatives ("SI 7 "): 

1. Living Our Values 

2. 

Investing in Our People 

3. 

Continuous Improvement in Operational and Capital Efficiency 

4. 

Driving Profitable and Sustainable Growth 

5. 

Rigorous Portfolio Management 

6. 

Quality and Material Resource Capture 

7. 

Delivering Long-Term Shareholder Value 

Commodity prices are the most significant factor impacting our revenues, profitability, operating cash flows and the amount of capital available to reinvest into our business. The low pricing environment has presented several challenges for us and our industry. We responded to the lower commodity prices in a number of ways: 

&#8226; 

Reduced our 2015 Capital Program by approximately 50% from the prior year, down to $3 billion 

&#8226; 

Established our 2016 Capital Program at $1.4 billion 

&#8226; 

Exercised cost discipline, significantly reducing drilling and completion, production and general and administrative costs 

&#8226; 

Drove sustainable operational efficiency gains in the U.S. unconventional resource plays 

&#8226; 

Scaled back our conventional exploration program to focus on our U.S. unconventional resources plays 

&#8226; 

Increased our target for non-core asset sales, now $750 million to $1 billion, up from our previous goal of $500 million 

&#9702; 

Closed over $300 million of non-core asset sales (excluding closing adjustments) 

&#8226; 

Protected our liquidity and capital structure: 

&#9702; 

Issued $2 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes ($1 billion of which was used to repay the 0.90% senior notes that matured in November 2015) 

&#9702; 

Increased the capacity of the revolving credit facility from $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion while also extending the maturity date an additional year to May 2020 

&#9702; 

Decreased our quarterly dividend from $0.21 to $0.05 per share, saving approximately $425 million of cash on an annualized basis 

In 2015, we continued to focus on the U.S. unconventional resource plays. We progressed co-development in the Eagle Ford, further delineated Austin Chalk in the Eagle Ford along with SCOOP/STACK in the Oklahoma Resource Basins and improved overall competitiveness in the Bakken with cost reductions and enhanced completions. Our U.S. operations added 73 mmboe proved reserves in 2015, excluding acquisitions, dispositions and production, amounting to an increase of 107% over the prior year's ending balance. 

Net sales volumes from continuing operations increased by 6% to 438 &#32;mboed in 2015 from 415 &#32;mboed in 2014. Volumes from our three U.S. resource plays totaled 218 &#32;mboed, an increase of 20% &#32;from 181 &#32;mboed in 2014. For the total company, we ended 2015 &#32;with proved reserves of approximately 2,163 &#32;mmboe as compared to 2,198 &#32;&#32;mmboe at the end of 2014 . 

See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Outlook, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and outlook, including the 2016 Capital Program.

&#160; 

Eagle Ford - As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 153,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford in south Texas and 1,236 gross (911 net) operated producing wells, where we have been operating since 2011. 

Of the 276 &#32;gross wells brought to sales in 2015, 56 were in the Austin Chalk, 28 were in the Upper Eagle Ford and 192 were in the Lower Eagle Ford. Of the 310 &#32;gross wells brought to sales in 2014, 22 were in the Austin Chalk and four were in the Upper Eagle Ford. Our 2015 &#32;average spud-to-TD time was 11 days compared to 13 days in 2014 . Our high-density pad drilling continues to average approximately four wells per pad in 2015 . The continued focus on stimulation design has contributed to incremental improvements in well performance across our area of activity. 

During 2015, we continued evaluation of the Austin Chalk formation and began delineation of Upper Eagle Ford across our acreage position in south Texas, with a total of 22,000 Austin Chalk acres and 16,500 Upper Eagle Ford acres now delineated. The mix of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas from the Austin Chalk wells is similar to Eagle Ford condensate wells. Co-development of the Austin Chalk, Upper and Lower Eagle Ford horizons will leverage the infrastructure investments we have made to support production growth across the Eagle Ford operating area. 

We operate approximately 800 miles of gathering pipeline in the Eagle Ford area. We now have 32 central gathering and treating facilities, with aggregate capacity of more than 475 mboed. We also own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes, Atascosa and Bee Counties of south Texas. 

In late 2015 , we connected to a newly constructed third-party liquids pipeline, which allowed us to increase the amount of our Eagle Ford production transported by pipeline to 90% at year-end, up from an average of 70% during 2014. The ability to transport more barrels by pipeline enables us to improve/optimize price realizations, reduce costs, improve reliability and lessen our environmental footprint. 

Approximately 42% of our 2016 &#32;Capital Program, $600 million, is allocated to the Eagle Ford. We expect drilling activity to average five rigs in 2016. Our drilling plans for 2016 include drilling 91 - 96 net wells (150 - 160 gross, of which we will operate 134 - 141). We anticipate bringing 124 - 132 gross operated wells to sales during 2016. 

Oklahoma Resource Basins &#32;&#8211; Our primary focus in 2016 will be in the SCOOP and STACK areas. In the SCOOP and STACK areas we hold approximately 265,000 net acres with rights to the Woodford, Springer, Meramec, Granite Wash and 

other Pennsylvanian and Mississippian plays. This includes 8,000 net acres added in the Oklahoma Resource Basins, primarily in the STACK Meramec play during 2015. 

Approximately 90% of our SCOOP acreage is held by production. In the SCOOP Woodford, we delineated over 70% of our acreage. We estimate the SCOOP Springer has a high oil yield that is about 85% liquids. We believe about 80% of our acreage in STACK has the potential for co-development of multiple horizons. About 67,000 STACK Woodford acres are delineated while approximately 42,000 acres of STACK Meramec acreage is delineated. 

Approximately 14% of our 2016 &#32;Capital Program, $204 million, is allocated to the Oklahoma Resource Basins, which will support two rigs and lease retention in the STACK and delineation of the SCOOP Springer and Meramec. Our drilling plans for the Oklahoma Resource Basins in 2016 call for drilling and completing 23 - 28 net wells (65 - 75 gross, of which 24 - 27 are company operated wells). We anticipate bringing 20 - 22 gross operated wells to sales during 2016. 

Bakken &#32;&#8211; We hold approximately 277,000 net acres in the Bakken shale oil play in North Dakota and eastern Montana, where we have been operating since 2006. We continue to see improvement in efficiency and well performance through optimizing completion techniques. We successfully completed a 55-well enhanced completion trial program that began in late 2014 and continued through 2015. We will continue executing and evaluating enhanced completion designs, including increased stage counts, high proppant volumes and fluid types as opportunities arise in 2016. Our large scale water gathering system is currently handling over 50% of our produced water. With a second phase expected to be fully operational in the second half of 2016, we anticipate this system will manage 80% of produced water by year end. 

Our time to drill a well averaged 15 days spud-to-TD in 2015 &#32;compared to 17 days in 2014 . We recompleted 11 wells during 2015. In efforts to optimize price realizations, we sell our production in local North Dakota markets and to select purchasers who may elect to transport outside the state. 

Approximately 13% of our 2016 &#32;Capital Program, $193 million, is allocated to the Bakken, which will support one rig in 2016. Our 2016 Bakken program includes plans to drill 10 - 12 net wells (45 - 55 gross, of which we will operate 8 - 10). We anticipate bringing 13 - 15 gross operated wells to sales during 2016. 

Other North America 

During 2015, we further emphasized our focus on the U.S. unconventional resource plays, continued to maximize cash generation from our conventional assets and continued to dispose of non-core assets. In August 2015, we closed the sale of our East Texas, North Louisiana and Wilburton, Oklahoma natural gas assets. In December 2015, we closed the sale of our operated producing properties in the greater Ewing Bank area and non-operated producing interests in the Petronius field in the Gulf of Mexico. In February 2016, we closed the sale of our non-operated producing interests in the Neptune field in the Gulf of Mexico. These assets collectively produced approximately 14 mboed in 2015. 

Other North America consists primarily of onshore production operations in Wyoming and development activities in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf, development work continues in the Gunflint field located on Mississippi Canyon Blocks 948, 949, 992 (N/2) and 993 (N/2). The development wells were completed in 2015. First oil is expected in mid-2016 after the completion of work at the third-party Gulfstar 1 host facility. We hold an 18% non-operated working interest in the Gunflint field. 

A deepwater oil discovery on the Shenandoah prospect, located on Walker Ridge Block 51, was drilled in 2009. We own a 10% non-operated working interest in this prospect. The first appraisal well on the Shenandoah prospect reached total depth in 2013 and was successful. The operator drilled a second appraisal well in 2014, which was unsuccessful. A third appraisal well was spud in 2015, and was successfully sidetracked, logged and cored, finding more than 620 feet of net oil pay. A fourth appraisal well is expected to be spud in the first quarter of 2016. 

Wyoming &#32;- We have ongoing waterflood and enhanced oil recovery projects in the mature Big Horn and Wind River Basins. Marathon is the third largest oil producer in the state of Wyoming. We also have conventional natural gas operations in the Greater Green River Basin. 

Our Wyoming net sales averaged 17 mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and 4 mmcfd of natural gas, or 17 mboed, during 2015 compared to 18 mboed in 2014. In addition, Marathon owns the 420-mile Red Butte Pipeline which connects oil fields in the Big Horn Basin to both the Silvertip Station on the Montana/Wyoming state line and to alternate outlets in Casper, Wyoming. 

North America E&#38;P--Exploration 

In September 2015, we announced our intention to scale back our conventional exploration program. Our 2016 Capital Program includes $15 million for conventional exploration. No conventional exploration wells are planned in 2016. Our Capital Program is limited to existing commitments in the Gulf of Mexico. We continue to evaluate options for utilization of our remaining commitments on the Maersk Valiant drillship. The rig is currently being operated by our rig share partner, and we anticipate the rig to be available for our use in early 2017. 

The Solomon exploration prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 225 was spud during the second quarter of 2015 and reached total depth in the fourth quarter. The well did encounter the lower tertiary target interval. The well was plugged and abandoned, with well costs charged to dry well expense, and the rig was released with no further activity planned on the block. We hold a 58% operated working interest in this prospect. 

We hold interests in both operated and non-operated exploration stage oil sand leases in Alberta, Canada, which could be developed using in-situ methods of extraction. These leases cover approximately 142,000 &#32;gross ( 54,000 &#32;net) acres in four project areas: Namur, in which we hold a 70% operated interest; Birchwood, in which we hold a 100% operated interest; Ells River, in which we hold a 20% non-operated interest; and Saleski in which we hold a 33% non-operated interest. During 2015, in connection with our decision to scale back our conventional exploration program, and also after further evaluation of the estimated recoverable resources and our development plans at Birchwood, Ells River and Namur, we impaired the remaining net book values of these in-situ properties. 

International E&#38;P Segment 

We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in E.G., Gabon, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Libya and the U.K. We include the results of our natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International E&#38;P segment.

Africa 

Equatorial Guinea &#32;&#8211; Production &#32;&#8211; We own a 63% operated working interest under a PSC in the Alba field which is offshore E.G. Operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 97% in 2015 . In the third quarter of 2015, production was increased as the Alba C21 development well came online with higher than expected liquid yields, in combination with a successful well intervention program on five existing Alba wells. In January 2016, we completed the installation of an offshore compression platform which is expected to start up mid-2016 following completion of hookup and commissioning activities. The compression project was designed to maintain the production plateau two additional years and extend field life up to eight years. 

Equatorial Guinea &#32;&#8211; Gas Processing &#8211; &#32;We own a 52% interest in Alba Plant LLC, an equity method investee, that operates an onshore LPG processing plant located on Bioko Island. Alba field natural gas is processed by the LPG plant. Under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, the LPG plant extracts secondary condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations. 

We also own 60% of EGHoldings and 45% of AMPCO, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. EGHoldings operates an LNG production facility and AMPCO operates a methanol plant, both located on Bioko Island. These facilities allow us to monetize natural gas reserves from the Alba field. 

EGHoldings' 3.7 mmta LNG production facility sells LNG under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement through 2023. The purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 3.6 mmta in 2015 . 

AMPCO had gross sales totaling 760 mt in 2015 . Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the U.S. 

Libya &#32;&#8211; We hold a 16% non-operated working interest in the Waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million gross acres located in the Sirte Basin of eastern Libya, where civil and political unrest continues to interrupt our production operations. Operations were interrupted in mid-2013 as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil terminal, and although temporarily re-opened during the second half of 2014, production remains shut-in through early 2016. Considerable uncertainty remains around the timing of future production and sales levels. We and our partners in the Waha concessions continue to assess the situation and the condition of our assets in Libya. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Note 12 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our Libya operations. 

Other International 

United Kingdom &#32;&#8211; Our largest asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42% working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields and a 39% working interest in the East Brae field. The Brae Alpha platform and facilities host the South, Central and West Brae fields. The North Brae and East Brae fields are natural gas condensate fields which are produced via the Brae Bravo and the East Brae platforms, respectively. The East Brae platform also hosts the nearby Braemar field in which we have a 28% working interest. During the second quarter of 2015, we completed the final three wells of a five-well Brae infill drilling program that began in 2014. 

The strategic location of the Brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, the operators of 31 third-party fields are contracted to use the Brae system and 72 mboed are being processed or transported through the Brae infrastructure. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage. 

The working interest owners of the Brae area producing assets collectively own a 50% non-operated interest in the SAGE system. The SAGE pipeline transports natural gas from the Brae area, and the third-party Beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline as well as approximately 0.3 bcf per day of third-party natural gas. 

We own non-operated working interests in the Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28% working interest in the main Foinaven field, a 47% working interest in East Foinaven and a 20% working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. The export of Foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from an FPSO to market. All natural gas sales are to the non-operated Magnus platform for use as injection gas. 

Kurdistan Region of Iraq &#32;&#8211; In aggregate, we have approximately 109,000 &#32;net acres in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We have a 45% operated working interest in the Harir block located northeast of Erbil. We also have non-operated interests in two blocks located north-northwest of Erbil: Atrush with 15% working interest and Sarsang with 20% working interest. 

On the non-operated Atrush block, following the successful appraisal program and a declaration of commerciality, the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources approved a plan for field development in September 2013. The development project consists of drilling four production wells and constructing a central processing facility in Phase 1 which provides for a 25-year production period. We expect first production in late 2016 with estimated initial gross production of approximately 30 mbbld of oil. Subject to further drilling and testing results, and partner and government approvals, a potential Phase 2 development could add an additional gross 30 mbbld facility. 

On the non-operated Sarsang block, the Swara Tika discovery was declared commercial in May 2014 and a field development plan was filed in June 2014. The plan was approved by the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources in the fourth quarter of 2015. The first producing well came online in 2014 and the second producing well came online in December 2015. In 2016, an additional well is planned to come on-line. As the development plan progresses, we expect to increase production after 2016. 

&#32; International E&#38;P Exploration 

In September 2015, we announced our intention to scale back our conventional exploration program. Our 2016 Capital Program includes $16 million for conventional exploration. No conventional exploration wells are planned in 2016. Our Capital Program is limited to existing commitments in Gabon. 

Equatorial Guinea &#32;&#8211; Exploration &#8211; We hold a 63% operated working interest in the Deep Luba discovery on the Alba Block and an 80% operated working interest in the Corona well on Block D. We plan to develop Block D through a unitization with the Alba field. Negotiations have been substantially completed and approval is expected in 2016. We also have an 80% operated working interest in exploratory Block A-12 offshore Bioko Island, located immediately west of our operated Alba Field. 

Gabon &#32;&#8211; Exploration &#8211; We hold a 21.25% non-operated working interest in the Diaba License G4-223 and its related permit offshore Gabon, which covers approximately 2.2 million gross (477,000 net) acres. Multiple additional pre-salt prospects have been identified on this License. 

In August 2014, we signed an exploration and production sharing contract for Gabon offshore Block G13, which was subsequently re-named Tchicuate. The block, which is located in the pre-salt play offshore Gabon, encompasses 277,000 acres. The seismic program was completed during 2015 and processing will occur through 2016. We hold a 100% participating interest and operatorship in the block. In the event of development, the Republic of Gabon will assume a 20% financed interest in the contract upon commencement of production. The State holds additional rights to participate in the block in the future as a co-investor. 

Kurdistan Region of Iraq &#32;&#8211; During 2015, in connection with our decision to scale back our conventional exploration program, we impaired our investment in the operated Harir block. 

International E&#38;P Disposition 

In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell our East Africa exploration acreage in Ethiopia and Kenya. The Kenya transaction closed in February 2016 and the Ethiopia transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2016. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about this disposition. 

Oil Sands Mining Segment 

We hold a 20% non-operated interest in the AOSP, an oil sands mining and upgrading joint venture located in Alberta, Canada. Other JV partners include Shell Canada Limited with a 60% ownership interest and Chevron Canada Limited with a 20% ownership interest. Shell Canada Limited operates the joint venture, which produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen into synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. 

The AOSP&#8217;s mining and extraction assets are located near Fort McMurray, Alberta, and include the Muskeg River and the Jackpine mines. Gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net) barrels of bitumen per day. The AOSP operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. The mined ore passes through a series of primary crushers and rotary breakers for particle size reduction. The particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. The slurry is hydro-transported to a primary separation vessel where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. A solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. The solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. The process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the Scotford upgrader via the approximately 300-mile Corridor Pipeline. 

&#32;The AOSP's Scotford upgrader is located at Fort Saskatchewan, northeast of Edmonton, Alberta. The bitumen is upgraded at Scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. Blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. The upgrader produces synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. The vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long-term contract at market-related prices and the other products are sold in the marketplace. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped surface mineable leases totaling approximately 159,000 gross (32,000 net) acres. The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of Alberta. Synthetic crude oil sales volumes for 2015 &#32;averaged 53 &#32;mbbld and net-of-royalty production was 45 &#32;mbbld. 

The operating cost structure of our Oil Sands Mining operations is predominantly fixed and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime. Per-unit costs are sensitive to production rates. As average price realizations are typically at a discount to WTI, the fixed operating cost structure for Oil Sands Mining will not fully track the price realization. Significant cost improvement efforts were employed in 2015 resulting in a material reduction to the production cost structure. See Item 7. Consolidated Results of Operations: 2015 compared to 2014 for additional detail on production expenses. 

The governments of Alberta and Canada agreed to partially fund Quest CCS. Construction began in 2012 and was completed in February 2015. Government funding commenced in 2012 and continued as milestones were achieved during the development, construction and operating phases of the project. Quest CCS was successfully completed and commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Acreage 

We believe we have satisfactory title to our North America E&#38;P and International E&#38;P properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry; nevertheless, we can be involved in title disputes from time to time which may result in litigation. In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international PSCs or exploration licenses. 

The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage held in our North America E&#38;P and International E&#38;P segments as of December 31, 2015 .

In the ordinary course of business, based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics, we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future. If production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases, licenses or concessions, undeveloped acreage listed in the table below will expire over the next three years. We plan to continue the terms of certain of these licenses and concession areas or retain leases through operational or administrative actions; however, the majority of the undeveloped acres associated with Other Africa as listed in the table below pertains to our licenses in Ethiopia and Kenya, for which we executed agreements in 2015 to sell. The Kenya transaction closed in February 2016 and the Ethiopia transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about this disposition.

Reserves 

Estimated Reserve Quantities 

Reserves are disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. Other International ("Other Int&#8217;l"), includes the U.K. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We closed the sale of our East Texas/North Louisiana/Wilburton assets in the third quarter of 2015 and part of our Gulf of Mexico business in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, we closed the sale of our Angola assets and our Norway business in 2014, and both are represented as discontinued operations ("Disc Ops") for periods presented. Approximately 77% of our proved reserves are located in OECD countries. 

Our December 31, 2015 proved reserves were calculated using the unweighted average of closing prices nearest to the first day of each month within the 12-month period ("SEC pricing"). The table below provides the 2015 SEC pricing of benchmark prices as well as the unweighted average for the first two months of 2016:

When determining the December 31, 2015 proved reserves for each property, the 2015 SEC prices listed above were adjusted using price differentials that account for property-specific quality and location differences. 

Beginning in the second half of 2014, the crude oil and natural gas benchmarks began to decline and these declines continued through 2015 and into 2016. Commodity prices are likely to remain volatile based on global supply and demand and could decline further. Sustained reduced commodity prices could have a material effect on the quantity and future cash flows of our proved reserves. 

Estimates of future cash flows associated with proved reserves are based on actual costs of developing and producing the reserves as of the end of the year. The decline in commodity prices prompted a concerted effort to reduce the costs of developing and producing reserves. Therefore, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future cash flows will be partially offset by the resulting lower costs to develop and produce reserves. 

A sustained period of lower commodity prices could also result in additional decreases to our near term capital program and deferrals of investment until prices improve. A shifting of capital expenditures into future periods beyond five years from the initial proved reserve booking could potentially lead to a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of how a substantial extended decline in commodity prices could impact us. 

As of December 31, 2015, total proved reserves declined 35 mmboe, primarily due to negative revisions in the U.S. totaling 173 mmboe largely a result of reductions to our capital development program which deferred proved undeveloped reserves beyond the 5-year plan, as well as routine production. This decline was partially offset by increased reserves from the drilling programs in our U.S. unconventional shale plays totaling 246 mmboe as well as a positive revision of 67 mmboe in OSM. The OSM revision was a consequence of technical reevaluation and lower royalty percentages due to lower realized prices. Royalties paid in Canada are on a sliding scale; as the sales price of our synthetic crude oil decreases, our royalty rate decreases. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities for more information. 

The following tables set forth estimated quantities of our proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an SEC pricing for periods ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Preparation of Reserve Estimates 

All estimates of reserves are made in compliance with SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X. Crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group, which includes our Director of Corporate Reserves and his staff of Reserve Coordinators. Crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas reserve estimates are developed or reviewed by Qualified Reserves Estimators ("QREs"). QREs are engineers or geoscientists who hold at least a Bachelor of Science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed Marathon Oil's QRE training course. All QREs must complete a QRE refresher course at least once every three years. Our Corporate Reserves group screens all fields with net proved reserves of 20 mmboe or greater, every year, to determine if a field review is required. Any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 1 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by a Reserve Coordinator. 

Our Director of Corporate Reserves, who reports to our Vice President, Technology and Innovation, has a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. In his 28 years with Marathon Oil, he has held numerous engineering and management positions, including managing our OSM segment. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers ("SPE") and a former member of the Petroleum Engineering Advisory Council for the University of Texas at Austin. 

Estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants ("GLJ") of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, third-party consultants. Their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The individual responsible for the estimates of our synthetic crude oil reserves has 15 years of experience in petroleum engineering, has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 2009 and is a registered Practicing Professional Engineer in the Province of Alberta. 

Audits of Estimates 

We engage third-party consultants to provide, at a minimum, independent estimates for fields that comprise 80% of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period. We exceeded this percentage for the four-year period ended December 31, 2015 , with 82% of our total proved reserves independently audited. We have established a tolerance level of +/- 10% such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants for each field are accepted if they are within 10% of our internal estimates. Should the third-party consultants&#8217; initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both parties re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis, if appropriate. In the very limited instances where differences outside the 10% tolerance cannot be resolved by year end, a plan to resolve the difference is developed and executive management consent is obtained. The audit process did not result in any significant changes to our reserve estimates for 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . 

During 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , Netherland, Sewell &#38; Associates, Inc. ("NSAI") prepared a certification of the prior year's reserves for the Alba field in E.G. The NSAI summary reports are filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Members of the NSAI team have multiple years of industry experience, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining NSAI. The senior technical advisor has over 35 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences, with over 15 years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. The second team member has over 10 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with over five years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. Both are registered Professional Engineers in the State of Texas. 

Ryder Scott Company ("Ryder Scott") also performed audits of the prior years' reserves of several of our fields in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 . Their summary reports are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The team lead for Ryder Scott has over 20 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining Ryder Scott.

End of year 

The revisions to previous estimates were largely due to a result of reductions to our capital development program which deferred proved undeveloped reserves beyond the 5-year plan. A total of 139 mmboe was booked as extensions, discoveries or other additions and revisions due to the application of reliable technology. Technologies included statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. The observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves. 

Transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves included 47 mmboe in the Eagle Ford, 14 mmboe in the Bakken and 5 mmboe in the Oklahoma Resource Basins due to development drilling and completions. 

&#32;Costs incurred in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves were $1,415 million , $3,149 million &#32;and $2,536 million . 

Projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as large development projects which take more than five years to complete, or the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. Of the 603 &#32;mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015 , 26% of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. The majority of this volume is related to a compression project in E.G. that was sanctioned by our Board of Directors in 2004. During 2012, the compression project received the approval of the E.G. government, fabrication of the new platform began in 2013 and installation of the platform at the Alba Field occurred in January 2016. Commissioning is currently underway, with first production expected by mid-2016. 

Proved undeveloped reserves for the North Gialo development, located in the Libyan Sahara desert, were booked for the first time in 2010. This development is being executed by the operator and encompasses a multi-year drilling program including the design, fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities. Anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region leads to an expected project execution time frame of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked. Interruptions associated with the civil and political unrest have also extended the project duration. Operations were interrupted in mid-2013 as a result of the shutdown of the Es Sider crude oil terminal, and although temporarily re-opened during the second half of 2014, production remains shut-in through early 2016. The operator is committed to the project&#8217;s completion and continues to assign resources in order to execute the project. 

Our conversion rate for proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves for 2015 was 11%. However, excluding the aforementioned long-term projects in E.G. and Libya, our 2015 conversion rate would be 15%. Furthermore, our 

5-year annual conversion rate (2011-2015) averaged 21% and would be 32%, excluding the long-term projects in E.G. and Libya. 

All proved undeveloped reserve drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2020. As of December 31, 2015 , future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves for the years 2016 &#32;through 2020 &#32;are projected to be $630 million, $859 million, $1,389 million, $1,764 million and $986 million.

Production, severance and property taxes are excluded; however, shipping and handling as well as other operating expenses are included in the production costs used in this calculation. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Results of Operations for Oil and Gas Production Activities for more information regarding production costs. 

N.M. 

Not meaningful information due to limited sales. 

Marketing and Midstream 

Our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our liquid hydrocarbon, synthetic crude oil and natural gas production. These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale. 

As discussed previously, we currently own and operate gathering systems and other midstream assets in some of our production areas. We continue to evaluate midstream infrastructure investments in connection with our development plans. 

Delivery Commitments 

We have committed to deliver quantities of crude oil and synthetic crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas to customers under a variety of contracts. As of December 31, 2015 , those contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to liquid hydrocarbon production in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and OSM synthetic crude oil production. Eagle Ford liquid hydrocarbon production sales commitments range from a minimum of 128 mbbld in 2016, decreasing to 51 mbbld through 2020. Bakken liquid hydrocarbon production sales commitments range from 10 mbbld to 30 mbbld from 2016 through 2026. Synthetic crude oil production sales commitments are 14 mbbld in 2016 and 10 mbbld in 2017. Eagle Ford natural gas production sales commitments range from a minimum of 210 mmbtu in 2016, decreasing to 46 mmbtu through 2022. 

Our current production rates, forecasts and proved reserves are sufficient to meet these commitments. All of these contracts provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate. Certain volumetric requirements can also be met through purchases of third-party volumes. 

In addition to the sales contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. Some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms. 

Competition and Market Conditions 

Competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks. 

We also compete with other producers of synthetic crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in North America. Because not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, sufficient market demand may not exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices. 

Our operating results are affected by price changes for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally, results from oil and gas production and OSM operations benefit from higher liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas prices. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations. See Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Overview &#8211; Market Conditions for additional discussion of the impact of prices on our operations. 

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 

The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties. 

Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. Major U.S. federal statutes include, but are not limited to, the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") with respect to the protection of the health and safety of employees, the Clean Air Act ("CAA") with respect to air emissions, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act ("CWA")) with respect to water discharges, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA-90") with respect to oil pollution and response, the National Environmental Policy Act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts, the Endangered Species Act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal and the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories. Other countries in which we operate have their own laws dealing with similar matters. 

These laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution, recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes. 

New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined. 

For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies. 

Air and Climate Change 

The EPA finalized a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS") for ozone in October 2015. This more stringent ozone NAAQS could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. The EPA's final rule has been judicially challenged by both industry and other interested parties, and the outcome of this litigation may also impact implementation and revisions to the rule. 

In September 2015, the EPA published a suite of proposed rules specifically targeting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, aggregation of air emissions sources and minor source permitting for operations on tribal lands. These rules are expected to be finalized in 2016. If we are unable to comply with the final terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego construction, modification or certain operations. These regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate, and result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance. 

In 2010, the EPA promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions. Further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated (see discussion above regarding proposed regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by the EPA). Potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time. 

In January 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) proposed a rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to BLM jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements. If the rule is finalized as proposed, it could result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. If we are unable to comply with the final terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego certain operations. These regulations may also result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance. 

For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective. 

Hydraulic Fracturing 

Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. For example, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. Further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. In addition to such legislative and regulatory proposals, there are also a number of studies and initiatives underway that may lead to additional proposals in the future, such as the EPA research study on the potential effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health. In 2015 the BLM issued a rule governing certain hydraulic fracturing practices on lands within their jurisdiction. While this rule has been stayed nationwide by court ruling, further findings by the court could result in additional changes to this new rule. 

Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. 

State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In a few instances, operators of injection wells in the vicinity of seismic events have been ordered to reduce injection volumes or suspend operations. A 2012 report published by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity; and a 2015 report by researchers at the University of Texas has suggested that the link between seismic activity and wastewater disposal may vary by region. Some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations to account for induced seismicity. Regulatory agencies at all levels are continuing to study the possible linkage between oil and gas activity and induced seismicity. In addition, a number of lawsuits have been filed including recent negligence suits and a RCRA citizen suit in Oklahoma alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells and hydraulic fracturing. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, including from the shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding induced seismicity 

could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells. 

Transportation 

A number of state and federal rules apply to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons. In 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) finalized a rule relating to testing and classification of liquid hydrocarbons and imposing additional restrictions on the types of rail cars that may be used in certain types of liquid hydrocarbon service. Although our businesses do not own rail cars and purchasers of our liquid hydrocarbons make arrangements for its transportation, such regulations could increase transportation costs which are passed on to Marathon Oil by liquid hydrocarbon purchasers. In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, a sub-agency of DOT, has proposed or announced the intention to propose various rules related to pipeline transportation of natural gas and/or liquid hydrocarbons. Such regulations could increase the regulatory burden on our businesses where we own or operate pipelines or could otherwise increase costs to third parties that are passed on to Marathon Oil. 

Water 

In 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the Clean Water Act and its various programs. While these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule has been stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. If this rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of CWA jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 

We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. In 2015, sales to Irving Oil and Shell Oil and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 13% and 11% of our total revenues. In 2014, sales to Shell Oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. In 2013, Statoil, the purchaser of the majority of our Libyan crude oil, accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues. 

Trademarks, Patents and Licenses 

We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. 

Employees 

We had 2,611 &#32;active, full-time employees as of December 31, 2015 . We consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory. We have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees.
