 Item 1. Business 

Overview

BIOLASE, Inc. (&#8220;BIOLASE&#8221; and, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;) is a medical device company that develops, manufactures, markets, and sells laser systems in dentistry and medicine and also markets, sells, and distributes dental imaging equipment, including cone beam digital x-rays and CAD/CAM intra-oral scanners, in-office, chair-side milling machines and three-dimensional (&#8220;3-D&#8221;) printers. Our products advance the practice of dentistry and medicine for patients and health care professionals. Our proprietary dental laser systems allow dentists, periodontists, endodontists, oral surgeons, and other dental specialists to perform a broad range of minimally invasive dental procedures, including cosmetic, restorative, and complex surgical applications. Our laser systems are designed to provide clinically superior results for many types of dental procedures compared to those achieved with drills, scalpels, and other conventional instruments, in most cases without the need for local or general anesthesia. We have clearance from the FDA to market and sell our laser systems in the United States and also have the necessary registrations to market and sell our laser systems in Canada, the European Union, and many other countries outside the U.S. Additionally, our in-licensed imaging equipment and related products improve diagnoses, applications, and procedures in dentistry and medicine. 

We offer two categories of laser system products: WaterLase (all-tissue) systems and Diode (soft tissue) systems. Our flagship brand, WaterLase, uses a patented combination of water and laser energy to perform most procedures currently performed using drills, scalpels, and other traditional dental instruments for cutting soft and hard tissue. We also offer our Diode laser systems to perform soft tissue, pain therapy, and cosmetic procedures, including teeth whitening. We have approximately 340 issued and 90 pending U.S. and international patents, the majority of which are related to WaterLase technology. From 1998 through December 31, 2015, we sold approximately 30,500 laser systems in over 90 countries around the world. Contained in this total are over 11,200 WaterLase systems, including more than 7,200 WaterLase MD and WaterLase iPlus systems. We were originally formed as Societe Endo Technic, SA (&#8220;SET&#8221;) in 1984 in Marseilles, France, to develop and market various endodontic and laser products. In 1987, SET merged into Pamplona Capital Corp., a public holding company incorporated in Delaware. In 1994, we changed our name to BIOLASE Technology, Inc. and in 2012, we changed our name to BIOLASE, Inc., since 1998, we have been the global leading innovator, manufacturer, and marketer of dental laser systems. 

We currently operate in a single reportable business segment. We had net revenues of $48.5 million, $47.7 million, and $56.4 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and we had net losses of $20.3 million, $18.9 million, and $11.5 million for the same periods, respectively. We had assets of $42.3 million, $59.4 million, and $31.0 million as of December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.

Recent Developments

Leadership Changes

Consistent with our goal to refocus our energies on strengthening our leadership, and worldwide competitiveness and increasing the amount of attention we pay to our professional customers and their patients, we announced the appointment of a new Chief Financial Officer in March 2015 and a new Director, President, and Chief Executive Officer in July 2015. In September 2015, we completed a series of internal corporate organizational restructuring activities where we streamlined operations and reduced payroll, payroll-related expenses, and consulting-related expenses by approximately $2.6 million, net, on an annualized basis. Expenses related to this restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $269,000. We experienced cost savings related to these measures in the fourth quarter of 2015 and expect to continue to realize the cost savings throughout 2016.

New Product Offerings

In February 2015, we launched the WaterLase iPlus 2.0, our next generation minimally invasive all-tissue flagship laser, along with our exclusive Practice Growth Guarantee&#8482; Program (our &#8220;PGG Program&#8221;). The latter assists our clients&#8217; dental practices by providing focused training on a select number of clinical procedures and support for billing and marketing. In November 2015, we announced an upgrade to the WaterLase iPlus 2.0 to provide dental practitioners a clinical protocol and application to assist in the effective management of peri-implantitis. A growing problem in dentistry, peri-implantitis is a destructive inflammatory process affecting the soft and hard tissues surrounding dental implants. With the addition of the new clinical protocol, the WaterLase iPlus 2.0 provides pre-programmed settings and step-by-step applications for more than 50 FDA-cleared procedures and clinical indications.

&#160;

The WaterLase iPlus 2.0 includes innovations and improvements designed to enhance patient s&#8217; and dentists&#8217; experiences and generate practice growth for dental practitioners through routine use. During the second quarter of 2015, we fully implemented the PGG Program in the United States. By partnering with our WaterLase iPlus 2.0 customers via the PGG Program , w e are actively and routinely soliciting feedback, which provides them and us with highly valuable information . 

The WaterLase iPlus 2.0 also marks the debut of the SureFire YSGG Delivery System, which ensures greater uptime through enhanced precision, performance, and reliability. SureFire has redesigned optics that efficiently deliver precise laser energy with a replaceable, disposable shield for better dependability. SureFire offers improved clinical access and comfort with its minimally invasive flagship dental laser system and exclusive contra-angle hand-piece. 

In December 2014, we introduced the EPIC X diode laser, an enhanced soft tissue laser system featuring upgrades and improvements from our EPIC 10 line of lasers, which were first cleared by the FDA and released in 2012. EPIC X includes enhancements to nearly every system component to optimize treatment speed and efficiency, including pre-initiated diode tips, allowing dentists to significantly reduce procedure time. EPIC X was cleared by the FDA in 2014. 

Industry Background 

General

Dental procedures, including medical and cosmetic treatment, are performed on hard tissue, such as bone and teeth, and soft tissue, such as gum and other oral tissue. 

The American Dental Association (&#8220;ADA&#8221;) 2007 Survey of Dental Services Rendered (the &#8220;ADA Study&#8221;) estimated that more than 200 million hard tissue procedures are performed annually in the United States. Hard tissue procedures include cavity preparation, root canals, and other procedures involving bone or teeth. Moreover, iData Research, an international market research group that specializes in medical device market dynamics, estimated that approximately 400 million hard tissue procedures are performed annually outside the United States.

The ADA also estimates that 46.5 million periodontal, implant, or soft tissue surgical procedures are performed annually in the United States. Periodontal procedures are performed on the supporting structures to remove periodontal and gum disease, which leads to tooth loss. Implant procedures include dental implant placement and restoration, and the treatment of peri-mucositis and peri-implantitis to mitigate implant failure, which is estimated to affect as many as 48% of all implants placed since 2000.

Furthermore, according to the ADA Study, over 90% of hard tissue procedures and 60% of periodontal, implants, and soft tissue, procedures in the United States are performed by general dentists. The remainder are performed by dental specialists, such as oral surgeons, endodontists, periodontists, and prosthodontists. 

The ADA estimated that the demand for dental services in the United States continues to grow due to population growth, aging demographics, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the &#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;) and increased awareness of the benefits of preventive dentistry in reducing the incidence of oral and systemic disease. Periodontitis and peri-implantitis are two rapidly growing disease states requiring therapy in a dental practice.

We believe there is a growing awareness among consumers of the value and importance of oral health and its connections to overall systemic health and wellness. Studies indicate a link between periodontitis and other health conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. According to the 2013 Distribution of Dentists in the U.S. by Region and State, there were 177,625 active private practitioners in the U.S. According to the World Health Organization, there were 1.8 million dentists worldwide in 2012. As many developing nations continue to experience fiscal growth, we believe those nations will also experience higher demand for improved dental care. Corresponding growth resulting from dental practices competing for patients could create further demand for clinical solutions that enable dentists to perform minimally invasive dental procedures with less trauma, less anesthesia, improved patient acceptance, and clinically superior results. We believe our product offerings align with this trend.

Traditional Dental Instruments 

Dentists and other specialists choose from a variety of instruments depending on the tissue involved and the type of procedure. Most procedures require the use of multiple instruments to achieve desired results. 

&#160;

High-Speed Drills . Most dentists use conventional high-speed drills for hard tissue procedures, such as preparing cavities for filling , gaining access for performing root canals , and shaving or contouring oral bone tissue. Potentially adverse effects associated with drills include thermal heat transfer, vibration, pressure and noise. The cutting and grinding action of high-speed drills can cause damage , such as microfractures , to the patient&#8217;s t eeth . The trauma can lead to longer recovery times and the need for future crowns and root canals. Additionally, this grinding action of high-speed drills may weaken the tooth&#8217;s underlying structure, leading to fractures and broken cusps. Procedures involv ing high-speed drills typically require anesthesia and are often the source of patient anxiety and fear . Because many dentists do not recommend anesthetizing more than one or two sections of the mouth in a single appointment , patients may need to return se veral times to complete their treatment plan. 

Cutting Instruments . Soft tissue procedures are typically performed by oral surgeons or periodontists using scalpels, scissors, and other surgical tools. Due to the pain, bleeding, post-operative swelling and discomfort associated with these instruments, most soft tissue procedures require the use of local anesthetic which may result in numbness and longer recovery time, and often require stitches. Bleeding can impair the practitioner&#8217;s visibility during the procedure, thereby reducing efficiency and is a particular problem for patients with immune deficiencies or blood disorders and for patients taking blood-thinning medications. 

Film Radiography Equipment . Dentists have traditionally relied on radiographic images produced by exposing photographic film to X-ray radiation as part of the examination and diagnosis of patients. These X-ray images can help reveal tooth decay, periodontal disease, bone loss, infections, hidden dental structures, abscesses or cysts, developmental abnormalities, some types of tumors, and other issues that might not be detected during a visual examination or upon probing with a handheld instrument. Due to the chemical development process required for film, however, this process is time-consuming, inefficient, costly for dental offices, and not environmentally friendly. Mistakes in the development process can require retakes which expose patients to additional radiation. Film X-rays also restrict the ability of doctors to enhance or further manipulate images for easier and more accurate analysis and treatment planning. Furthermore, one of the most critical limitations of film is that it is restricted to two-dimensional images, which can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. 

Alternative Dental Instruments 

Alternative technologies have been developed over the years to address the problems associated with traditional methods used in dentistry. Most alternatives have addressed either hard or soft tissue applications but not both. 

Electrosurge Systems. Electrosurge systems use an electrical current to heat a shaped tip that simultaneously cuts and cauterizes soft tissue, resulting in less bleeding than occurs with scalpels. However, electrosurge systems are generally less precise than lasers and can damage surrounding tissue. Electrosurge systems are also not suitable for hard tissue procedures and due to the depth of penetration, generally require anesthesia and a lengthy healing process. Electrosurge systems generally cannot be used in areas near metal fillings and dental implants. Finally, electrosurge systems generally cannot be used to treat patients with implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. 

Traditional Laser Systems. More recently, lasers have gained acceptance for use in general and cosmetic dentistry. Most lasers used in dentistry have been adapted from other medical applications, such as dermatology, but are not optimally designed to perform common dental procedures. Most dental lasers use thermal energy to cut tissue and are used primarily for soft tissue procedures. 

Products

Combining our laser system products with imaging solutions provides dental professionals capabilities for early diagnosis and minimally invasive treatment. Our product offering consists of the following:

WaterLase systems. Our all-tissue WaterLase dental laser systems currently consist of the WaterLase iPlus 2.0, the WaterLase MD Turbo, and the WaterLase MDX 300 and 450. Each of these systems features our patented YSGG Laser technology with a proprietary laser crystal, which contains the elements erbium and chromium doped with yttrium, scandium, gallium, and garnet (Er, Cr: YSGG). This unique crystal laser produces energy with specific absorption and tissue interaction characteristics specifically designed for dental applications. It is minimally invasive and can precisely cut hard tissue, such as bone and teeth, and soft tissue, such as gums and skin, without the heat, vibration, bleeding, or pressure associated with traditional dental treatments. By combining the YSGG Laser light and water, our WaterLase systems may eliminate the need for anesthesia and also result in faster healing times compared to traditional methods of treatment, both of which could lead to improved patient-reported outcomes. 

&#160;

The WaterLase systems incorporate an ergonomic hand-piece and a user-friendly digital interface with clinical applications to control the mix of laser energy, air, and water, as well as the pulse rate. Each system also has been designed to be easil y moved from operatory to operatory within a practice. We developed the WaterLase systems using internally developed intellectual property, as well as intellectual property obtained through various acquisitions. The WaterLase systems are FDA -cleared in the United States and CE mark-approved in Europe for dental as well as dermatological, aesthetic, and other general surgery uses . 

Diode systems. Our Diode (soft tissue) laser systems currently consist of the EPIC X, EPIC 10 and iLase , semiconductor diode lasers that perform soft tissue, hygiene, cosmetic procedures, teeth whitening, and temporary pain relief. Each of these laser systems features our unique 940nm diode wavelength to deliver successful clinical outcomes for common surgical procedures. EPIC X, EPIC 10, and iLase feature our proprietary pulse technology called ComfortPulse, which is designed for added patient comfort. iLase, released in 2010, was the first &#8220;personal&#8221; laser with no wires, footswitch, or cumbersome cables to manage. EPIC 10, released in 2012, is a portable, powerful diode laser that facilitates clinical versatility with surgical, pain therapy and whitening capabilities and provides an exceptional laser with an attractive value proposition. In December 2014 we introduced the EPIC X diode laser, an enhanced soft tissue laser system featuring upgrades and improvements from our EPIC 10. We developed the Diode systems using internally developed intellectual property, as well as intellectual property obtained through acquisitions. The iLase and EPIC are FDA-cleared in the United States and CE mark-approved in Europe for dental as well as dermatological, aesthetic, and other general surgery uses. 

Imaging systems . Our dental imaging systems include state-of-the-art extra-oral and intra-oral dental digital imaging devices. Our imaging systems include the CEFLA NewTom VGi and VG3, three-dimensional (&#8220;3-D&#8221;) Cone Beam Computed Tomography devices. We also offer the 3Shape Trios CAD/CAM digital impression systems for offering high-speed digital 3-D picture taking, and the Galaxy BioMill CAD/CAM system which enables dental practitioners to design, scan, mill and finish crowns, inlays and veneers inside the dental office during a single appointment. We distribute all of these products under the manufacturer&#8217;s FDA 510(k) clearance. We believe that by combining high-end digital imaging, laser systems, intra-oral scanning, digital x-rays, CAD/CAM design, chair-side milling, and 3-D printing, dental offices can accurately and rapidly address a variety of unmet patient needs conveniently. 

Related Accessories and Consumable Products 

We also manufacture and sell consumable products and accessories for our laser systems. Our WaterLase and Diode systems use disposable laser tips of differing sizes and shapes depending on the procedure being performed. We also market flexible fibers and hand pieces that dental practitioners replace at some point after initially purchasing laser systems. For our EPIC systems, we sell teeth whitening gel kits. 

Our Solution 

Due to the limitations associated with traditional and alternative dental instruments, we believe there is a large market opportunity for all-tissue dental laser systems that provide superior clinical outcomes, reduce the need to use anesthesia, help reduce trauma, pain, and discomfort associated with dental procedures, and increase patient acceptance for treatment protocols. We also believe there is a large market opportunity for digital radiography systems that improve practice efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis, leading to superior treatment planning, increased practice revenue, and healthier outcomes for patients. 

Our WaterLase systems precisely cut hard tissue, bone, and soft tissue with minimal or no damage to surrounding tissue and dental structures. Our Diode systems are designed to complement our WaterLase systems, and are used only in soft tissue procedures, pain therapy, hygiene, and cosmetic applications, including teeth whitening. The Diode systems, together with our WaterLase systems, offer practitioners a broad product line with a range of features and price points. 

Benefits to Dental Professionals 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expanded range of procedures and revenue opportunities . Our laser systems allow general dentists to perform surgical and cosmetic procedures that they are unable or unwilling to perform using conventional methods, and that would typically be referred to a specialist. Our laser systems allow dentists to perform these procedures easily and efficiently, increasing their range of skills, professional and patient satisfaction levels, patient retention rates, new patient attraction rates, and revenues. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Additional procedures through increased information and efficiency . Our digital imaging systems allow dentists to diagnose and dis cover cases that they might not be ab le to detect with film images or other two-dimensional images, thereby giving them the ability to offer more treatment options for patients. Our laser systems can shorten and reduce the number of patient visits, providi ng dental professionals with the ability to service more patients. For hard tissue procedures, our WaterLase systems can reduce the need for anesthesia, which enables the dental practitioner to perform multiple procedures in one visit. T he WaterLase and Di ode systems cut soft tissue more precisely and with minimal bleeding when compared to traditional tools such as scalpels and electrosurge systems. We have FDA clearance for treatment indications for use that comprise our REPAIR Perio&#8482; and REPAIR Implant&#8482;, our proprietary periodontal protocols for subgingival calculus removal and debridement of root surfaces and implant surfaces using the WaterLase system and patented Radial Firing Perio Tips. This is a minimally invasive treatment for moderate to advanced g um and peri-implant disease s , which are among the leading causes of dental health conditions for adults over age 35 and conditions that impact more than half of Americans over the age of 55. In addition, our EPIC system can be used to quickly perform in-office teeth whitening with our proprietary whitening gel and to provide temporary pain relief. The 3Shape Trios and Galaxy BioMill System allow for same-day crowns. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increased loyalty and expanded patient base . We believe the improved patient comfort and convenience offered by our laser systems, the reduction in chair time and radiation exposure of our digital imaging systems, and the benefits of in-office, chair-side milling and 3-D printing helps improve patient retention rates, attract new patients, and increase revenue per patient, demand for elective procedures, acceptance of treatment plans, and word-of-mouth referrals. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Improved clinical outcomes . Our laser systems can be used for dozens of clinical indications with reduced trauma, swelling, and general discomfort of the patient, resulting in improved clinical outcomes and less follow-up treatment. In parallel, our digital imaging systems provide greater clarity and information, making it possible for the doctor to determine the optimal diagnosis and treatment plan. The Galaxy BioMill System further expands treatment options available to patients and allows for same-day crowns. Our products collectively improve clinical outcomes, making it possible for practitioners to devote time to new cases, rather than managing or treating complications. 

Benefits to Patients

&#160;

&#183; 

Comfort . Our WaterLase systems allow dentists to perform minimally invasive dental procedures without anesthesia in many cases, and patients recover more comfortably, faster, and with less pain than when treated with conventional instruments. The heat, vibration, microfractures, trauma, or pressure associated with traditional dental methods are largely avoided. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Convenience and efficiency . Procedures utilizing our WaterLase systems do not require anesthesia in many cases, which allows dental practitioners to perform multiple procedures in one appointment, which saves patients time. Digital images are available almost immediately, so patients do not have to spend extra time in the dental chair waiting for film to be developed. Further, the Galaxy BioMill System and Stratasys 3-D printers allow for same-day crowns. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Reduced trauma . WaterLase systems allow for a faster and more pleasant patient recovery with less swelling, bleeding, and general discomfort than when treated with conventional instruments. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Broader range of available procedures . Due to the comfort and convenience of procedures utilizing our WaterLase system, patients may be more likely to consider cosmetic and other elective procedures resulting in better smiles and oral health. Our WaterLase system received expanded clearance from the FDA for dermatological, aesthetic, and general surgery uses, as well as dental procedures. Since digital images are displayed on computer monitors, doctors can make treatment planning a more personal experience for patients. Further, the Galaxy BioMill System and Stratasys 3-D printers offer patients the convenience of same-day crowns. We believe that these factors will lead to greater patient case acceptance. 

Business Strategy 

Our business strategy includes the following key elements: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increasing awareness of and demand for our products among dental practitioners . We intend to increase demand for our products by educating dental practitioners and patients about the clinical benefits of our product suite. We plan to continue participation in key industry trade shows, the World Clinical Laser Institute &#174; (&#8220;WCLI &#174; &#8221;) (which we founded in 2002), dental schools, and other educational forums. Our products are also used for clinical research, which often leads to published articles that can garner attention from dental practitioners . 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increasing awareness of and demand for our laser systems among patients. We also intend to increase demand for our products by educating patients about the clinical benefits of the WaterLase and Diode systems. We believe that patients will understand the clinical benefits and seek out dental practitioners that offer the WaterLase and Diode systems, which, in turn, will result in increased demand for our systems from dental practitioners. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Creating value through innovation and leveraging existing technologies into adjacent medical a pplications . We plan to expand our product line and clinical applications by developing enhancements and transformational innovations, including new clinical solutions for dental applications and for other adjacent medical applications. In particular, we believe t hat our existing technologies can provide significant improvements over existing standards of care in fields , including ophthalmology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, podiatry, pain management, aesthetics/dermatology, veterinary, and consumer products. We pla n to continue to explore potential collaborations to bring our proprietary laser technologies with expanded FDA-cleared indications for other medical applications in the future . In addition or alternatively, we may acquire complementary products and techn ologies . We also aim to increase our consumables revenue by selling more single-use accessories used by dental practitioners when performing procedures using our dental laser systems. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Improving product quality . We plan to achieve the industry&#8217;s highest rate of defect-free delivery of products, maintain high quality standards, and address and timely resolve customer complaints. In the U.S., we provide maintenance and support services to customers through our support hotline and dedicated staff of in-house and field service personnel. Outside the U.S., we maintain a network of factory-certified service technicians to provide maintenance and support services to customers. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Strengthening sales and distribution capabilities . In the U.S. and Canada, we primarily distribute our products directly to dental practitioners via our field sales force. During 2012, we augmented our field sales force by establishing an in-house sales organization. The in-house sales organization is located at our corporate headquarters and is comprised of sales representatives and lead generators who work in partnership with the field sales team to maximize sales by leveraging the existing installed customer base. In 2013, we also added regional imaging specialists to the in-house sales organization to provide technical and clinical expertise in coordination with our field sales representatives. In addition to our field sales force in North America, we also use various independent distributors to sell and support our products throughout Europe, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific. We plan to continue to build out the infrastructure to support our customers and to drive revenue and profit growth, both domestically and internationally. This includes expandi ng our sales presence with respect to the rapidly growing group practices, group purchasing organizations, and government channels. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Strengthening and defending technology leadership . We plan to continue protecting our intellectual property rights by expanding our existing patent portfolio in the United States and internationally. We strategically enforce our intellectual property rights worldwide. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Strengthening customer training and clinical education. We provide introductory, advanced, and specialized training for dental practitioners to increase their proficiency and to certify them. Our goal is to provide our customers world class training that is accessible and can be executed with a practical technique. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Expanding our product portfolio to dental practitioners . By combining our digital imaging, intra-oral scanners, CAD/CAM design, chair-side milling, and 3-D printing, dental offices can accurately and timely address unmet patient needs with convenience. In 2014, we began shipping our Galaxy BioMill and 3-D printers. We plan to continue to evaluate how to optimize the manner in which we market and sell additional products to our WaterLase and Diode systems customers. 

Warranties 

Our WaterLase laser systems and Diode systems sold domestically are covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one to two years from the date of sale to the end-user by us or a distributor. WaterLase systems and Diode systems sold internationally are covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of up to 28 months from date of sale to the international distributor. Our laser systems warranty covers parts and service for sales in our North American territories and parts only for international distributor sales. In North America and select international locations, we sell service contracts to our laser systems end users that cover the period after the expiration of our standard warranty coverage for our laser systems. Extended warranty coverage provided under our service contracts varies by the type of system and the level of service desired by the customer. Products or accessories remanufactured, refurbished, or sold by unauthorized parties, voids all warranties in place for such products and exempts us from liability issues relating to the use of such products. We offer extended warranties on certain imaging products that we distribute, including our digital radiography products. However, all imaging products that we distribute are initially covered by manufacturer&#8217;s warranties. 

&#160;

Insurance 

We maintain product liability insurance on a claims-made-and-reported basis with a limit of $10 million per occurrence and $10 million in the aggregate for all occurrences. The insurance is subject to various standard coverage exclusions, including damage to the product itself, losses from the recall of our product, and losses covered by other forms of insurance such as workers compensation. We cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully defend any claims against us, nor can we be certain that our insurance will cover all liabilities resulting from such claims. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain such insurance in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

Manufacturing 

Our strategy is to manufacture products in-house when it is efficient for us to do so. We currently manufacture, assemble, and test all of our laser systems at our corporate headquarters facility in Irvine, California. The 57,000 square foot facility has approximately 20,000 square feet dedicated to manufacturing and warehousing. The facility is ISO 13485 certified. ISO 13485 certification provides guidelines for our quality management system associated with the design, manufacture, installation, and servicing of our products. In addition, our U.S. facility is registered with the FDA and complies in all material respects with the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation. 

We use an integrated approach to manufacturing, including the assembly of tips, laser hand pieces, fiber assemblies, laser heads, electro-mechanical subassembly, final assembly, and testing. We obtain components and subassemblies for our products from third-party suppliers, the majority of which are located in the United States. We generally purchase components and subassemblies from a limited group of suppliers through purchase orders. In general, we rely on these purchase orders and do not have written supply contracts with many of our key suppliers. Three key components used in our WaterLase system (power suppliers, laser crystals, and fiber components) are each supplied by separate single-source suppliers. In recent years, we have not experienced material delays from the suppliers of these three key components. However, in the event that we experience an unexpected interruption from a single-source supplier, manufacturing delays, re-engineering, significant costs, and sales disruptions could occur, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. As of the date on which this Form 10-K was filed with the SEC, we were in the process of identifying and qualifying alternate source suppliers for our key components, including but not limited to those noted above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully identify and qualify an alternate source supplier for any of our key components or that we could enter into an agreement with any such alternate source supplier on terms acceptable to us. 

As discussed below, we are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA as a manufacturer of medical devices. Such inspections can cover manufacturing, design, production, reporting, recordkeeping, and other processes and can lead to FDA observations requiring corrective action, which can disrupt normal processes.

Marketing and Sales 

Marketing 

We market our laser systems worldwide. Our marketing efforts are focused on increasing brand awareness and demand among dental practitioners. We also continue to test methods to increase awareness of our brands&#8217; benefits by marketing directly to patients. 

Dental Practitioners. We market our laser systems to dental practitioners through regional, national, and international educational events, seminars, industry tradeshows, trade publications, the internet, field sales forces (in North America and Canada), and agents and distributors. We also use brochures, direct mail, public relations, and other promotional tools and materials. 

Our primary marketing message to dental practitioners focuses on the improved cash flow and return on investment (&#8220;ROI&#8221;) generated by delivering improved patient-reported outcomes. In 2015, we revamped our clinical and practical educational events for prospective laser dentists to include practice management and ROI information. In 2014, we introduced the Journal of Laser-Assisted Dentistry as a platform to provide education and research to users. In 2010, we introduced the BIOLASE Store for online purchase of laser systems, consumables, accessories, and service contracts in North America. In 2002, we founded the World Clinical Laser Institute (the &#8220;WCLI&#8221;) to formalize our efforts to educate and train dental practitioners in laser dentistry. The WCLI conducts and sponsors educational programs domestically and internationally for dental practitioners, researchers, and academicians, including one, two, and three-day seminars and training sessions involving in-depth presentations on the use of lasers in dentistry. In addition, we have developed relationships with research institutions, dental schools, and laboratories that use our products for clinical research and in-clinical training. We believe these relationships will increase awareness of and demand for our products. In 2012 we formalized a five-year agreement with Professor Norbert Gutknecht and the Aachen Center for Laser Dentistry (&#8220;AALZ&#8221;), the acknowledged leader in dental laser education since its founding in 1992, to continue expanding the availability of postgraduate advanced wavelength clinical laser education while also taking major steps toward standardizing laser dental education for all of our owners worldwide.

&#160;

Patients. We plan to continue to test ways to effectively market the benefits of our laser systems directly to patients through marketing and advertising programs, including the internet, search engine optimization, social media , print and broadcast media, and point-of-sale materials in dental practitioners&#8217; offi ces . We believe that making patients aware of our laser systems and their benefits will motivate them to request from dental practitioners laser procedures and their outcomes thereby increas ing demand for our brands .

We sell our products primarily to dentists in general practice through our field sales force and our distributor network. We expect our laser systems to continue to gain acceptance among periodontists, endodontists, oral surgeons, pediatric dentists, and other dental specialists as they become aware of the clinical benefits and minimally invasive treatment options available by using our laser systems.

International revenue accounts for a significant portion of our total revenue and accounted for approximately 39%, 37%, and 37% of our net revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. No individual country outside the United States represented more than 10% of our net revenue during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. 

For financial information about our long-lived assets, see Note 2 and Note 9 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements &#8212; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and &#8212; Segment Information . 

North American Sales. In the United States and Canada, we primarily sell our products directly to dental practitioners utilizing a field sales force consisting of laser sales representatives, imaging specialists, and regional managers. During 2012, we augmented our field sales force by establishing an in-house sales organization. The in-house sales force is located at our corporate headquarters and is comprised of sales representatives and lead generators who work in partnership with the field sales team to maximize sales by leveraging the existing installed customer base. 

International Sales . Our distributors purchase laser systems and disposables from us at wholesale dealer prices and resell them to dentists in their sales territories. All sales to distributors are final and we can terminate our arrangements with dealers, agents, and distributors for cause or non-performance. We have granted certain distributors the right to be our exclusive distributor in select territories. These distributors are generally required to satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements to maintain their exclusivity. In 2011, we began selling our products directly to end users in Germany. In 2012, we began selling our products directly to end users in India and neighboring countries. 

&#160;

Customer Concentration . We sell our products through our field sales force , agents, and distributor s . For the years ended D ecember 31, 2015, 201 4 , and 201 3 , sales to our largest distributor worldwid e accounted for approximately 3%, 6 %, and 5% , respectively, of our net revenue. 

Customer Service. We provide high quality maintenance and support services in the United States through our support hotline and dedicated staff of in-house and field service personnel. Outside the United States, we maintain a network of factory-certified service technicians to provide maintenance and support services to customers. Our international distributors are responsible for providing maintenance and support services for products sold by them. We provide parts to distributors at no additional charge for products covered under warranty. 

Financing Options. Most customers (other than distributors) finance their purchases through several third-party financial institutions with which we have established good relationships. In the United States and Canada, third-party customers enter into a financing agreement with one of the financial institutions that purchases the product from us or one of our distributors. We are not party to these financing agreements. Thus if the customer agrees to pay the financial institution in installments, we do not bear the credit risk. The financial institutions do not have recourse to us for a customer&#8217;s failure to make payments, nor do we have any obligation to take back the product. 

Seasonality . Typically, we experience fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter due to seasonality. Revenue in the first quarter typically is lower than average and revenue in the fourth quarter typically is stronger than average due to the buying patterns of dental practitioners. We believe that this trend exists because a significant number of dentists purchase their capital equipment towards the end of the calendar year in order to maximize their practice earnings while seeking to minimize their taxes. They often use certain tax incentives, such as accelerated depreciation methods for purchasing capital equipment, as part of their year-end tax planning. In addition, revenue in the third quarter may be affected by vacation patterns which can cause revenue to be flat or lower than in the second quarter of the year. Our historical seasonal fluctuations may also be impacted by sales promotions used by large dental distributors that encourage end-of-quarter and end-of-year buying in our industry. Because of these seasonal fluctuations, historically we have often used less cash in operations for the six months ended December 31 as compared to the six months ended June 30. 

Engineering and Product Development 

Engineering and product development activities are essential to maintaining and enhancing our business. We believe our engineering and product development team has demonstrated its ability to develop innovative products that meet evolving market needs. Our engineering and product development group consists of 20 individuals with medical device and laser development experience, including two Ph.Ds. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our engineering and product development expenses totaled approximately $7.3 million, $4.6 million, and $4.0 million, respectively. Our current engineering and product development activities are focused on developing new product platforms, improving our existing products and technology and extending our product range in order to provide dental practitioners and patients with new and improved protocols or procedures that are less painful and have clinically superior results. Some examples of the improvements we are pursuing for our laser systems include faster cutting speed, improved ease of use, less need for anesthesia, interconnectivity, and an expanded portfolio of consumable products for use with our laser systems. Our engineering and product development activities encompass both fundamental and applied fields. We seek to improve methods to perform clinical procedures through the use of new laser wavelengths, laser operation modes and accessories.

We also devote engineering and product development resources toward markets outside of dentistry in which we might exploit our technology platform and capabilities. We believe our laser technology and development capabilities could address unmet needs in several other medical applications, including ophthalmology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, podiatry, pain management, aesthetics/dermatology, veterinary, and consumer products. We have already started to enter the otolaryngology, pain management, and veterinary markets to varying degrees.

To further our development efforts, we have entered into a development and distribution agreement with IPG Photonics Corporation&#8217;s medical laser division, IPG Medical. The development and distribution agreement between the Company and IPG covers several projects in various stages of development, with the expectation that these projects will culminate in commercialized joint dental laser products, accessories, or integral system components. The parties will collaborate in the design and development of these new products and applications, with each party contributing its technological expertise, know-how, and development resources. We will be responsible for U.S. and international registrations of all dental products resulting from the agreement, and we will have exclusive worldwide commercial distribution rights for certain products over a multi-year initial term after completion of development.

&#160;

Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights 

We believe that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights to protect our intellectual property. We have developed a patent portfolio internally, and to a lesser extent through acquisitions and licensing, that covers many aspects of our product offerings. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 340 issued patents and 90 pending patent applications in the United States, Europe and other countries. While we hold a variety of patents that cover a broad range of technologies and methods, the majority of these patents provide market protection for our core technologies incorporated in our laser systems and related accessories. Existing patents related to our core technology, which are at various stages of being incorporated into our products, are scheduled to expire as follows: 23 in 2016, 4 in 2017, and 21 in 2018, with the majority having expiration dates ranging from 2025 to 2038. With approximately 90 patent applications pending, we expect the number of new grants to exceed the number of patents expiring. We do not expect the expiration of the expired or soon-to-expire patents to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. 

There are risks related to our intellectual property rights. For further details on these risks, see Item 1A &#8212; &#8220;Risk Factors.&#8221; 

Competition 

We operate under relatively competitive market conditions. We believe that the principal competitive factors for companies that market technologies in dental and other medical applications include acceptance by leading dental and medical practitioners, product performance, product pricing, intellectual property protection, customer education and support, timing of new product research, and development of successful national and international distribution channels.

Our competitors vary by product and location. There are companies that market some, but not all, of the same types of products as ours. &#160; Our laser systems compete with other lasers, mostly with other wavelengths, patient outcomes, and benefit profiles, as well as with drills, scalpels, scissors, air abrasion systems, and a variety of other tools that are used to perform dental and medical procedures. We believe our products have key differentiating performance features. For example, we market diode lasers which also have FDA clearance for use in both pain management therapy and teeth whitening and our WaterLase systems have been FDA-cleared for a wide range of uses beyond dentistry, including dermatological, aesthetics, and other general surgery uses. Our teeth whitening technology competes with other in-office whitening products and high intensity lights used by dentists, as well as teeth whitening strips, and other over-the-counter products. Our pain management technology competes with a variety of traditional, advanced, and pharmaceutical pain management products and services. The dental imaging equipment and in-office milling machines that we offer compete with traditional dental laboratories, imaging centers and products and services.

Traditional tools are generally less expensive than our laser systems for performing similar procedures. For example, a high-speed drill or an electrosurge device can be purchased for less than $2,500 each. In addition, though our systems are superior to traditional tools in many ways, they are not intended to replace all of the applications of traditional tools, such as removing metal fillings and certain polishing and grinding functions. 

Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing, and/or technical resources than we do. In addition, some competitors have developed, and others may attempt to develop, products with applications similar to those performed by our products. Because of the large size of the potential market for our products, we anticipate that new or existing competitors may develop competing products, procedures, or clinical solutions that could prove to be more effective, safer, or less costly than procedures using our laser systems. The introduction of new products, procedures, or clinical solutions by competitors may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, or may render our products obsolete. 

Government Regulation 

FDA&#8217;s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to market in the U.S. must first receive either 510(k) clearance, by filing a 510(k) premarket notification, or PMA approval, by filing a Premarket Approval Application (&#8220;PMA&#8221;) from the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDA&#8217;s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to 12 months, but it can take longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy, and uncertain. It generally takes from one to three years or even longer. We cannot be sure that 510(k) clearance or PMA approval will ever be obtained for any product we propose to market. 

&#160;

The FDA decides whether a device must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or PMA approval process based upon statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either Class I or II, which generally requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notificati on requesting 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. After the FDA clears a device, the FDA requires that a 510(k) be submitted for certain, though not all, changes to the device. 

Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA&#8217;s general regulatory controls (&#8220;General Controls&#8221;) for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA&#8217;s Quality System Regulation (&#8220;QSR&#8221;) facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process. 

Class II devices are subject to the FDA&#8217;s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure. All of our devices are 510(k)-cleared Class II devices or 510(k)-exempt devices. 

Class III devices are those devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices, or deemed not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below. Premarket approval applications are subject to significantly higher user fees under the FDA Safety and Innovation Act (the &#8220;FDASIA&#8221;), which includes the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2012 (the &#8220;MDUFA III&#8221;) as well as other medical device provisions, and generally take much longer for the FDA to review. 

To obtain 510(k) clearance, a company must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; in intended use and in technological and performance characteristics to a legally marketed &#8220;predicate device&#8221; that is either in Class I or Class II or is a Class III device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application. Pursuant to the FDASIA, which includes the MDUFA III as well as other medical device provisions, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees unless a specific exemption applies. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#8217;s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. The FDA also can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. We have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements to our laser systems, many of which we believe, based on the FDA&#8217;s regulation and existing guidance, will not require new 510(k) clearances. We cannot provide assurance that the FDA will agree with any of our decisions not to seek additional 510(k) clearances or even PMA approval for these or future device modifications. If the FDA requires us to seek 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for any modification, we may be required to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until we obtain a new 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. 

Class III devices are required to undergo the PMA approval process in which the manufacturer must establish the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction. A PMA application must provide extensive preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. During the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR. A new PMA or a PMA Supplement is required for modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device&#8217;s indications for use, manufacturing process, manufacturing facility, labeling and design. PMA Supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. None of our products are currently approved under a PMA. 

A clinical trial may be required in support of a 510(k) submission and generally is required for a PMA application. These trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption (&#8220;IDE&#8221;) application approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for certain exemptions from the IDE requirements. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. Clinical trials may begin if the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance to market the product in the U.S. 

&#160;

In the future, we may be required to make additional 510(k) submissions to the FDA to address new claims, uses, or products. We cannot provide assurance that the FDA will not deem one or more of our future products, or those of our original equipment manufacturer partners, to be a Class III device subject to the more burdensome PMA approval process. The FDA also may not approve or clear these products for the indications th at are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Indeed, the FDA may refuse our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products. 

Pervasive and Continuing FDA Regulation 

After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. Those regulatory requirements include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

device listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action; 

&#160;

&#183; 

QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design control, testing, change control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 

&#160;

&#183; 

labeling control and advertising regulations which include FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved, or off-label uses or indications; 

&#160;

&#183; 

clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; 

&#160;

&#183; 

approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our future approved devices; 

&#160;

&#183; 

medical device reporting, regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur; 

&#160;

&#183; 

post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 

&#160;

&#183; 

post-market surveillance requirements, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the FDA&#8217;s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws or regulations or other conditions under which the product was approved; 

&#160;

&#183; 

regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

notices of corrections or removals. 

Additional FDA requirements apply to radiation emitting products, such as medical lasers, under the Radiation Control Health Safety Act of 1968 (&#8220;RCHSA&#8221;). These include: 

&#160;

&#183; 

conformance to the FDA&#8217;s laser performance standard, which establishes certain requirements for emssions, testing, safety features, labeling, and other aspects of laser products; 

&#160;

&#183; 

certification of compliance with the laser performance standard; 

&#160;

&#183; 

reporting and recordkeeping requirements; 

&#160;

&#183; 

notification to the FDA and dealers, distributors, and purchasers of certain product defects; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

complying with a recall or an order to repair, replace, or refund an electronic product if ordered by the FDA. 

We invest significant time and other resources to ensure ongoing compliance with FDA QSR and other post-market regulatory requirements. 

We have registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer and we have obtained a manufacturing license from the California Department of Health Services. As a manufacturer, we are subject to announced and unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and the California Department of Health Services to determine our compliance with various regulations. Our subcontractors&#8217; manufacturing facilities are also subject to inspection. 

&#160;

If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, the agency can institute a w ide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as: 

&#160;

&#183; 

fines and civil penalties; 

&#160;

&#183; 

unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions; 

&#160;

&#183; 

product recall or seizure; 

&#160;

&#183; 

interruption of production; 

&#160;

&#183; 

operating restrictions; 

&#160;

&#183; 

injunctions; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

criminal prosecution. 

The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us. Our failure, or the failure of our subcontractors, to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. Promotional activities for FDA-regulated products of other companies have been the subject of enforcement actions brought under health care reimbursement laws and consumer protection statutes. In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use, the FDA could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a notice of violation, a warning letter, an injunction, a seizure, a civil fine, or criminal penalties. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products could be impaired. 

Foreign Regulation 

Many foreign countries in which we market or may market our products have regulatory bodies and restrictions similar to those of the FDA. International sales are subject to foreign government regulation, the requirements of which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance and the requirements may differ. We have received CE Marking for our WaterLase and Diode laser systems. Additionally, foreign countries in which the Company markets its products may subject the Company to regulations affecting, among other things, product standards and specifications, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, quality system requirements, import restrictions, tariffs, duties, tax requirements and interactions with health care providers and/or government officials (e.g. UK Anti-Bribery Act). We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary foreign government approvals or successfully comply with foreign regulations. Our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Other U.S. Regulation 

We and our subcontractors also must comply with numerous federal, state and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and hazardous substance disposal. Furthermore, we are subject to various reporting requirements including those prescribed by the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We cannot be sure that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future or that these laws or regulations will not adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Environmental 

Our manufacturing processes involve the use, generation, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, including alcohol, adhesives, and cleaning materials. As such, we are subject to stringent federal, state, and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Future environmental laws may require us to alter our manufacturing processes, thereby increasing our manufacturing costs. We believe that our products and manufacturing processes at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated. 

&#160;

Heal th Care Fraud and Abuse 

As a medical device manufacturer, our operations and interactions with health care providers, including dentists, are subject to extensive laws and regulations imposed at the federal, state, and local level in the U.S., including, but not limited to, those discussed in this Form 10-K. In the U.S., there are federal and state anti-kickback Statute that generally prohibit the payment or receipt of kickbacks, bribes, or other remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients or other health-related business. For example, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is a criminal statute that prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any bribe, kickback, or other remuneration intended to induce a referral for the furnishing of, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, any item or service reimbursable under the Federal health care programs (&#8220;FHCPs&#8221;), including Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE. Recognizing that the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and potentially applicable to many commonplace arrangements, the U.S. Congress and the Office of Inspector General (&#8220;OIG&#8221;) within the Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;) have created statutory &#8220;exceptions&#8221; and regulatory &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Exceptions and safe harbors exist for a number of arrangements relevant to our business, including, among other things, certain payments to bona fide employees, certain discount and rebate arrangements, and certain payment arrangements with health care providers, assuming all elements of the relevant exception/safe harbor have been satisfied. Although an arrangement that fits squarely into one or more of these exceptions or safe harbors generally will not be subject to prosecution, OIG has also cautioned in various contexts that even where each component of an arrangement has been structured to satisfy a safe harbor, the components, as part of an overall arrangement, may still violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. However, arrangements that do not fit squarely within an exception or safe harbor do not necessarily violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Rather, OIG and/or other government enforcement authorities will examine the facts and circumstances relevant to the specific arrangement to determine whether it involves the sorts of abuses that the statute was designed to combat. Violations of this federal law constitute a felony offense punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines of up to $25,000, civil fines of up to $50,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other FHCPs. Exclusion of a manufacturer, like us, would preclude any FHCP from paying for the manufacturer&#8217;s products. In addition, pursuant to the changes made by the Affordable Care Act, a claim resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may serve as the basis for a false claim under the federal Civil False Claims Act. Many states also have their own laws that parallel and implicate anti-kickback restrictions, but may apply regardless of whether any FHCP business is involved. Federal and state anti-kickback laws may affect our sales, marketing and promotional activities, educational programs, pricing and discount practices and policies, and relationships with dental and medical providers by limiting the kinds of arrangements we may have with hospitals, alternate care market providers, physicians, dentists, and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products. 

Federal and state false claims laws prohibit anyone from presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. For example, the federal Civil False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the government, including FHCPs. Some suits filed under the Civil False Claims Act can be brought by a &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; or a &#8220;relator&#8221; on behalf of the government, and such individuals may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Manufacturers, like us, can be held liable under false claims laws, even if they do not submit claims to the government, where they are found to have caused submission of false claims by, among other things, providing incorrect coding or billing advice about their products to customers that file claims, or by engaging in kickback arrangements with customers that file claims. A violation of the Civil False Claims Act could result in fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 (as adjusted for inflation) for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. A Civil False Claims Act violation may also provide the basis for the imposition of administrative penalties and exclusion from participation in FHCPs. In addition to the Civil False Claims Act, the federal government also can use several criminal statutes to prosecute persons who are alleged to have submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government, or improperly retained funds received which were not due. Moreover, a number of states also have false claims laws, and some of these laws may apply to claims for items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and/or commercial insurance. 

In addition to the general fraud statutes mentioned above, there are a variety of other fraud and abuse laws specific to health care. For example, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;) created several new federal crimes, including health care fraud and false statements related to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payers. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, up to ten years imprisonment (assuming no serious bodily injury or death results), or exclusion from FHCPs. The false statements statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for items or services under a health care benefit program . A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines and imprisonment and could potentially result in the government&#8217;s pursuit of exclusion from FHCPs. Additionally, a person who offers or transfers to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary any remuneration that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary&#8217;s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of items or services payable by Medicare or Medicaid may be liable for civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each item or service and potential exclusion from FHCPs. 

&#160;

The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires us to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) certain pa yments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians, dentists, and teaching hospitals. These annual reports are publicly available, which could impact the number of health care providers who are willing to work with us on the research a nd development of our products. In addition, several states have implemented similar transparency and disclosure laws applicable to medical device manufacturers, some of which require reporting of transfers of value made to a wider variety of health care p rofessionals and institutions. 

The federal physician self-referral prohibition (&#8220; Stark Law &#8221;) is a strict liability statute , which, in the absence of a statutory or regulatory exception, prohibits: (i) the referral of Medicare and Medicaid patients by a phy sician to an entity for the provision of designated health care services if the physician or a member of the physician&#8217;s immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship, including an ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement wit h, the entity and (ii) the submission of a bill to Medicare or Medicaid for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Penalties for violations of the Stark Law include denial of payment for the service, required refund of payments received pursuant to the prohibited referral, and civil monetary penalties for knowing violations of up to $15,000 per claim, up to $100,000 for circumvention schemes, and up to $10,000 per day for failing to report information concerning the entity&#8217;s ownership, investment, and compensation arrangements upon HHS&#8217; request. Stark Law violations also may lead to False Claims Act liability and possible exclusion from FHCPs.

The FCPA generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from offering to pay, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign official in his/her capacity or to secure any other improper advantage to obtain or retain business. Violation of the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA can result in criminal fines of up to $2 million and civil penalties of up to $16,000 for each violation. Individuals, including officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of companies, can be subject to a criminal fine of up to $250,000 and imprisonment, in addition to civil penalties of up to $16,000, per violation.

Due to the breadth of some of these laws, it is possible that some of our current or future practices might be challenged under one or more of these laws. In addition, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws. Evolving interpretations of current laws or the adoption of new federal or state laws or regulation s could adversely affect some of the arrangements we have with customers, physicians, and dentists. If our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, which could hurt our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Privacy and Security of Health Information 

Numerous federal, state, and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, and disclosure of patient-identifiable health information, including HIPAA. HIPAA applies to covered entities, which include, among other entities, a &#8220;health care provider&#8221; that transmits health information in electronic form in connection with certain transactions regulated under HIPAA. HIPAA also applies to &#8220;business associates,&#8221; meaning persons or entities that create, receive, maintain, or transmit protected health information (&#8220;PHI&#8221;) to perform a function on behalf of, or provide a service to, a covered entity. Although we are not a covered entity, most health care (including dental) facilities that purchase our products are covered entities under HIPAA. Due to activities that we perform for or on behalf of covered entities, we may sometimes act as a business associate, or our customers may ask us to enter Business Associate Agreements and assume business associate responsibilities. 

Various implementing regulations have been promulgated under HIPAA. The HIPAA Security Rule requires implementation of certain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic PHI. The HIPAA Privacy Rule governs the use and disclosure of PHI and provides certain rights to individuals with respect to that information. For example, for most uses and disclosures of PHI, other than for treatment, payment, health care operations, and certain public policy purposes, the HIPAA Privacy Rule generally requires obtaining valid written authorization from the individual, including in the research context. With certain limited exceptions, the covered entity performing the research must obtain valid authorization from the research subject (or an appropriate waiver) before providing that subject&#8217;s PHI to sponsors like us. Furthermore, in most cases, the HIPAA Privacy Rule requires that use or disclosure of PHI be limited to the minimum necessary to achieve the purpose of the use or disclosure.

The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules require covered entities to contractually bind us, where we are acting as a business associate, to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information that we may use, access, or disclose for purposes of services we may provide. Moreover, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;) enacted in February 2009, made certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules directly applicable to business associates.

&#160;

HITECH also established new breach notification requirements, increased civil penalty amounts for HIPAA violations, and requ ires HHS to conduct periodic audits of covered entities and business associates to confirm compliance. In addition, HITECH authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions in response to HIPAA violations committed against residents of their respec tive states. 

On January 17, 2013, the Office for Civil Rights (&#8220;OCR&#8221;) of HHS released an omnibus final rule (&#8220;Final Rule&#8221;), implementing HITECH. Among other provisions, the Final Rule made certain changes to the breach notification regulations, including requiring business associates to notify covered entities if a breach occurs at or by the business associate. Following a breach of unsecured PHI, covered entities must provide notification of the breach to affected individuals, the HHS Secretary, and, for breaches affecting more than 500 residents of a state or jurisdiction, prominent media outlets serving that state/jurisdiction. Breaches of health information can also give rise to class actions by affected individuals and result in significant reputational damage to the covered entity and/or business associates or other parties involved in the breach.

The Final Rule also provides for heightened governmental investigations of potential non-compliance. However, the Final Rule did not address accounting of disclosures, although such regulations are forthcoming. The proposed rule addressing accounting of disclosures, if finalized, could impose a significant burden on us, as it would require covered entities and their business associates to develop systems to monitor (1) which employees access an individual's electronic PHI contained in a designated record set, (2) the time and date such access occurs, and (3) the action taken during the access session (e.g., modification, deletion, viewing).

Failure to comply with HIPAA may result in civil and criminal penalties. Civil penalties for a single violation of the regulations occurring on or after February 18, 2009 range from $100 to more than $50,000 per violation, with a maximum penalty of $1.5 million per year for violations of an identical provision of the regulations. Criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and imprisonment may also be imposed for certain knowing violations of HIPAA. We may be required to make costly system modifications, which may restrict our business operations, to comply with HIPAA, to the extent we act as a business associate. Our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 

Numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality of patient information, including state medical privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws. These state laws may be similar to or possibly more stringent than the federal provisions. These laws in many cases are not preempted by the HIPAA rules and may be subject to varying interpretations by the courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our customers and potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity, and liability. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use, and transmission of personal or patient information, which could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. 

New health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, future Congressional action, or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle health information, and the cost of complying with these standards could be significant. If we do not properly comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to patient health information, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions.

Third-Party Reimbursement 

Dentists and other health care providers that purchase our products may rely on third-party payers, including the Medicare, Medicaid, and private payers to cover and reimburse all or part of the cost of the clinical procedures performed using our products. As a result, demand for our products is dependent in part on the coverage and reimbursement policies of these payers. We believe that most of the procedures being performed with our current products generally are reimbursable, with the exception of cosmetic applications, such as teeth whitening.

No uniform coverage or reimbursement policy for dental and medical treatment exists among third-party payers, and coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payer to payer. Under Medicaid, for example, states are required to cover basic dental services for children, but retain discretion as to whether to provide coverage for dental services for adults. Under the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment benefit available to children, dental services determined to be &#8220;medically necessary&#8221; and provided at intervals that meet reasonable standards of dental practice (or at such other intervals, as indicated by medical necessity) are generally covered by Medicaid. Although not required to cover dental services for adults, most state Medicaid programs still provide a degree of coverage for at least emergency dental services. 

Medicare covers dental services only in certain limited circumstances. For instance, Medicare will pay for certain dental services when provided in the inpatient hospital setting if the dental procedure itself made hospitalization necessary. Medicare will also pay for certain dental services that are an integral part of a covered procedure (e.g., jaw reconstruction following accidental injury), extractions done in preparation for certain radiation treatments, and oral examinations preceding kidney transplantation or heart valve replacement, under certain circumstances.

&#160;

Future legislation, regulation or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payers may adversely affect the demand for our products . For example, the Affordable Care Act included various reforms impacting Medicare reimbursement and coverage, including revision to prospective payment systems, any of which may adversely impact any Medicare reimbursements received by our end-user custome rs. Moreover, the Budget Control Act of 2011, enacted on August 2, 2011, established a process to reduce federal budget deficits through an automatic &#8220;sequestration&#8221; process if deficit reductions targets are not otherwise reached. Under the terms of the Bu dget Control Act, sequestration imposes cuts to a wide range of federal programs, including Medicare, which is subject to a 2% cut. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 extended the 2% sequestration cut for Medicare through fiscal year 2025 and realigned the fiscal year 20 25 Medicare sequestration amounts so that there will be a 4% sequester for the first six months and a 0% sequester for the second six months, instead of a 2% sequester for the full 12-month period. 

In addition, private payers and employer-sponsored health care plans became subject to various rules and potential penalties under the Affordable Care Act. For example, health plans in the individual and small group markets were required to begin providing a core package of health care services, known as &#8220;essential health benefits.&#8221; Essential health benefits include ten general categories of care, including pediatric services, which requires coverage of dental and vision care, among other medical services, for children. The Affordable Care Act also required employers with 50 or more employees to offer health insurance coverage to full-time workers or pay a penalty, which could potentially increase the availability of third-party reimbursement for some medical procedures using our products, although we continue to assess the impact of the Affordable Care Act on our business. 

We cannot be sure that government or private third-party payers will cover and reimburse the procedures using our products in whole or in part in the future or that payment rates will be adequate. 

Because third-party payments may be less than a provider&#8217;s actual costs in furnishing care, providers have incentives to lower their operating costs by utilizing products that will decrease labor or otherwise lower their costs. However, we cannot be certain that dental and medical service providers will purchase our products, despite the clinical benefits and opportunity for cost savings that we believe can be derived from their use. If providers cannot obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products, or the procedures in which they are used, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could suffer. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, the Company employed approximately 200 people. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement and we believe our employee relations are good.
