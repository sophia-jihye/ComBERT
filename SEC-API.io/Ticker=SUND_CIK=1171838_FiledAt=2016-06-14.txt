Organizational Background 

&#160;

Java Express, Inc., was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 14, 2001, for the purpose of selling coffee and other related items to the general public from retail coffee shop locations. These endeavors ceased in 2006, and it had no material business operations from 2006 until March of 2013. On March 29, 2013, the Company, its newly formed and wholly-owned subsidiary, Anew Acquisition Corp., a Utah corporation (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), and ANEW LIFE, INC., a Utah corporation (&#8220;ANEW LIFE&#8221;), executed and delivered an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into ANEW LIFE, ANEW LIFE was the surviving company under the merger and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on the closing of the merger (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). On April 17, 2013, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to change its name from &#8220;Java Express, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Sundance Strategies, Inc.&#8221; Sundance Strategies, Inc. is referred to as the Company, us or we.

&#160;

Our Business 

&#160; 

We are a specialty financial services company engaged in the secondary market for interests in life insurance policies known generally as &#8220;life settlements.&#8221; A life settlement is the sale of an existing life insurance policy to a third party for more than the policy&#8217;s cash surrender value, but less than the face value of the policy benefit. After the sale, the new policy holder will pay the premiums due on the policy until maturity and then collect the settlement proceeds at maturity.

We do not purchase or hold life insurance policies but, rather, hold a contractual right to receive the net insurance benefits, or NIBs, from a portfolio of life insurance policies held by a third party. These NIBs represent an indirect, residual ownership interest in a portfolio of individual life insurance policies and they allow us to receive a portion of the settlement proceeds from such policies, after expenses related to the acquisition, financing, insuring and servicing of the policies underlying our NIBs have been paid, as more fully described below.

NIBs are generally sold by an entity that holds the underlying life insurance policies, either directly or indirectly through a subsidiary, such an entity being referred to herein as a &#8220;Holder.&#8221; A Holder, either directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary, purchases life insurance policies either from the insured or on the secondary market and aggregates them into a portfolio of policies. At the time of purchase, the Holder generally also (i) contracts with a service provider to manage the servicing of the policies until maturity, (ii) purchases mortality re-insurance, or MRI, coverage under which payments will be made to the Holder in the event the life insurance policies do not mature according to actuarial life expectancies, and (iii) arranges financing to cover the initial purchase of the life insurance policies, the servicing of the life insurance policies until maturity and the payment of the MRI premiums. The financing obtained by the Holder for a portfolio of life insurance policies is secured by the insurance policies for which the financing was obtained. After a Holder purchases policies, aggregates them into a portfolio and arranges for the servicing, MRI coverage and financing, the Holder contracts to sell NIBs related to the policies. The NIBs grant the holder of the NIBs the right to receive the proceeds from the settlement of the life insurance policies after all of the expenses related to such policies incurred by the Holder have been paid. The Company is not responsible for maintaining premiums or other expenses related to maintaining the life insurance policies underlying NIBs. Such obligations remain with the Holder.

When an insurance policy underlying our NIBs comes to maturity, the insurance proceeds are first used by the Holder to pay related debt and expenses associated with such policy. Once all of the expenses have been paid, the Holder will retain a small percentage of the proceeds and then will pay the remaining insurance proceeds to us in satisfaction of our related NIB.

Life Settlements Market 

There are a number of reasons a policy owner may choose to sell his or her life insurance policy. The policy owner may no longer need or want his or her policy, he or she may wish to purchase a different kind of insurance policy, premium payments may no longer be affordable or the policy owner may need cash to fund

&#160;

healthcare or other expenses. In particular, policy holders 65 years of age and older and their families are faced with a variety of challenges as they seek to address their post-retirement financial needs and selling one&#8217;s life insurance policy may provide a unique and valuable financial solution to such challenges. From the early 2000s through 2008, the market for newly originated life settlements grew from virtually no activity to a peak of an estimated $12 billion of face value of U.S. life settlement policies settled annually in 2007 and 2008. Economic factors slowed the growth in 2009, when an estimated $8 billion of face value of U.S. life insurance was settled and growth has continued to decline since that time. According to a 2015 study done by the insurance research group Conning &#38; Co., investors purchased $1.7 billion worth of U.S. life insurance face value in 2014, bringing its estimate of the total face value of life settlements held at year end to just over $32 billion. Looking ahead, however, Conning &#38; Co. projected steady growth in the amount of face value available for life settlements, though it may take years to re-attract capital to pre-2009 levels to meet that supply. Regardless, we believe that the supply of policies has the potential to increase over time due to the aging population and increased awareness of the life settlement market as an alternative to allowing a policy to lapse for little or no value. A report from the AAP Life Settlement Market Update indicated that internal rates of return for life settlement transactions conducted in 2013 were in the high-teens. Participants in the secondary life settlement market have included major insurance companies which have purchased available pools of policies for their own investment, portfolio aggregators, private equity funds, and independent third-party investors.

Our Business Model 

Predictability of Future Cash Flows . Predictability of future cash flows is one of the biggest challenges facing companies engaged in the life settlements industry. If a Holder is not able to adequately predict future cash flows and does not continually have enough cash to make a policy portfolio&#8217;s premium payments, the policies in the portfolio may lapse and we may lose our right to receive the proceeds from the settlement of the policies at maturity. Prediction of future cash flow requires the use of financial models, which rely on various assumptions. These assumptions include the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts, expected maturity events, counter party performance risk, changes to applicable regulation of the investment, shortage of funds needed to maintain the asset until maturity, changes in discount rates, life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums, interest, and other costs incurred, among other items. These uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income. As a result, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. If projections of life expectancies are wrong, Holders may be obligated to service the related insurance policies for longer than expected, thereby increasing their costs and reducing the net insurance benefit available to us. Other than the NIBs initially acquired from Del Mar Financial S.a.r.l. as described below, we have mitigated some of this risk by only holding NIBs where the Holders of the insurance policies underlying such NIBs have (i) financed a portion of the purchase price of the policy portfolio underlying the NIBs and (ii) financed the policy portfolio&#8217;s premium payments and obtained MRI coverage for the policy portfolio.

Financing a portion of the purchase price . Financing a portion of the purchase price of a policy portfolio allows the Holder to leverage its investment and create a larger and diversified policy portfolio. When making an investment in a portfolio of life insurance policies, a Holder utilizes actuarial tables to determine when the policies in the portfolio can be expected to come to maturity. However, the Holder assumes the risk that the policies in the portfolio will come to maturity later than was predicted by the actuarial tables used at the time of purchase. The life expectancies provided by the actuarial tables are based on actual death rates in large populations of individuals with similar demographic characteristics. Thus, the more policies underlying a policy portfolio, the more reliable the use of actuarial tables becomes. In other words, the larger the policy portfolio, the more closely the underlying insureds would be expected to, on average, follow actuarial predictions and the lower the risk associated with future cash flows will be. Because we want predictability and stability in the cash flows generated by our NIBs, we have only purchased NIBs where the Holder of the underlying policy portfolio has maximized its investment in the policy portfolios by financing a portion of the purchase price.

Financing premium payments . Holding NIBs where the Holder of the policy portfolio has ensured its ability to pay policy premiums by financing such premium payments and ensured the predictability of future cash flows by obtaining MRI provides us with a more stable cash position and enables us to focus on long term growth.

&#160;

MRI Coverage . Because of the uncertainty of maturity of insurance policies, the Holders have contracted with an insurance provider for MRI coverage. We do not have a contract with the MRI provider and the MRI provider does not provide any insurance to us but, rather, provides MRI coverage to the various Holders of life

6&#160; 

&#160;

insurance policies underlying our NIBs. MRI coverage typically provides guaranteed cash flow based on the expected death benefits of the pool of policies being insured calculated at the issuance of the coverage and thereby provides credit enhancement to any bank providing financing to a Holder. The term of the MRI policies is usually 15 years. Any claims paid by the MRI to the Holder must be paid back to the MRI provider out of death benefit proceeds from the pool of policies being insured when such death benefit proceeds are eventually received. This enables the Holder to receive a smoother cash flow from a pool of policies over time and avoid &#8220;lumpiness&#8221; in the cash flows that would otherwise be more pronounced in the absence of the MRI coverage. Any claim payment balances would accrue interest, typically at a spread of 250 basis points over LIBOR, to the extent they remain outstanding. The MRI coverage is obtained by paying an MRI premium, typically at equal to 2% of the cumulative death benefit of the covered life insurance policies, at the outset of the coverage and, depending on the specific terms of the MRI policy, possibly an additional premium amount at a predetermined time during the effective coverage period (the &#8220;Commitment Fee&#8221;), which is typically 1% of the cumulative death benefits of the covered policies. The insurer under the MRI policy typically must approve the sale of any life insurance policies covered by the MRI policy if such sale does not result in the full repayment of any outstanding recovery amounts. It is our understanding that there is only one MRI Provider. While the MRI coverage is relatively expensive, we believe that insurance policies underlying NIBs that are covered by MRI have less volatility, are more liquid and should achieve higher values for purposes of financing and secondary market sales.

Financing a policy portfolio&#8217;s premium payments gives a Holder additional cash needed to satisfy the premium obligations of its portfolio. In addition, obtaining MRI increases the probability that the Holder will receive future cash flows in the event the underlying insureds live longer than expected. This combination provides the Holder with sufficient liquidity to stabilize its cash position and, in turn, increases the likelihood that we will receive the NIB we have purchased related to the Holder&#8217;s portfolio.

Life Settlement Financing Market 

Because of the uncertainty of maturity of life insurance policies, financing for the purchase and servicing of life insurance policies has historically been difficult to secure. The lender (the &#8220;Holders&#8217; Lender&#8221;) has provided financing to the Holders to finance the purchase of the insurance policies underlying our NIBs. To be clear, the Holders&#8217; Lender does not provide any financing to us but, rather, provides financing to the various Holders of life insurance policies underlying our NIBs. We have no contract, arrangement or understanding with the Holders&#8217; Lender. The Holders&#8217; Lender contracts with the Holders for financing to purchase the insurance policies underlying our NIBs. We believe the Holders&#8217; Lender is presently the only lender currently providing financing for insurance policy portfolios underlying NIBs. We believe other lenders may enter this market. No assurance can be given that the Holders&#8217; Lender will be able to continue to provide financing for policy portfolios or that any such other lending sources will become available to participants in the life settlement market. The failure of the Holders&#8217; Lender or other lenders to make loans to Holders may result in Holders&#8217; inability to provide NIBs to us for purchase and our business model of purchasing and holding NIBs will suffer substantially. We do not have a direct contractual relationship with the Holders&#8217; Lender. 

We understand that a typical loan from the Holders&#8217; Lender has a term of 4 to 5 years at an interest rate between 4.5% and 8% compounded quarterly (12.1% in the event of default) and is secured by the life insurance policies owned by the Holder. These loans also include a variety of covenants agreed to by the Holder and/or one of its subsidiaries. The use of funds disbursed under the loan is restricted to servicing the pledged portfolio of life insurance policies, including, among other uses, the policy premiums, MRI premiums, the payment of a commitment fee to the MRI provider and administration costs. The Holder must provide confirmation of MRI coverage prior to receiving any funds under the loan. In addition, if the outstanding loan amount exceeds 75% of the aggregate value of the life insurance policies securing the loan or if the loan balance exceeds applicable regulatory large exposure limits, the Holders&#8217; Lender is not required to disburse funds under the loan.

We further understand that the Holders&#8217; Lender also receives repayment priority as proceeds are received from the life insurance policies serving as collateral for the loan. Life insurance policy proceeds must first be used to repay interest and principal owed under the loan (as long as the outstanding loan amount exceeds 50% of the

&#160;

aggregate value of the life insurance policies securing the loan) including draws on the MRI, if applicable, next to pay the Holder&#8217;s servicing fees, then to repay any additional amounts owed to the Holders&#8217; Lender and finally to an account designated by the Holder. If it is determined that the outstanding loan amount is less than 50%, and all other obligations have been paid in full, the Company may be eligible to receive a distribution.

While the loan typically matures 4 to 5 years after the first disbursement of funds, maturity of loan amounts is accelerated if the related life insurance policy is liquidated or at the time that the death benefit is received. Prepayment is subject to a prepayment fee equal to the difference between the interest that would have been received by the Holders&#8217; Lender at maturity of the loan and the interest the Holders&#8217; Lender would have received if it deposited the prepayment amount in an institution in the London interbank market until the maturity date.

Our NIB Purchasing Guidelines 

Our objective is to acquire NIBs based on insurance policy portfolios that will produce returns in excess of the purchase, financing, servicing and insuring costs incurred by the Holder and hold those NIBs to maturity. The guidelines we generally follow regarding the purchase of NIBs include:

the insured is 75 years old or older; all NIBs relate to U.S. Universal Life Insurance policies; all underlying insurance policies have qualified for financing that will cover at least four years of premiums following the date on which we acquire the NIBs; each policy must first be reviewed by the legal due diligence team of the lender providing financing for the acquisition and servicing of the life insurance policies, second by the MRI company&#8217;s due diligence team and then finally approved by our due diligence processes; all policies must qualify for MRI; and the projected proceeds payable on each life insurance policy upon the death of the underlying insured are projected to exceed the costs to service the life insurance policies, amounts due to creditors secured by such life insurance policy, such as the Holders&#8217; Lender or the MRI provider, other costs and fees incurred by the Holder and the percentage of the remaining insurance benefit retained by the Holder before payment is made to us in satisfaction of our NIBs. &#160;

Competition 

We are not aware of any other company engaged in the business of buying NIBs. However, we encounter significant competition in the life settlements industry generally from numerous companies, including hedge funds, investment banks, secured lenders, specialty life insurance finance companies and life insurance companies themselves who purchase life settlements. Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and may have significantly lower cost of funds because they have greater access to insured deposits or the capital markets. Moreover, some of these competitors have significant cash reserves and can better fund shortfalls in collections that might have a more pronounced impact on companies such as ours. They also have greater market share. For example, Berkshire Hathaway purchased a portfolio of $300 million (face value) in life insurance policies in 2013. According to The Deal Pipeline, total life settlement transactions grew to $2.57 billion (face value) in 2013.

&#160;

A report from the AAP Life Settlement Market Update indicated that internal rates of return for life settlement transactions conducted in 2013 were in the high-teens - an attractive return at a time when fixed income and other hedge positions were delivering minimal rates of return. In the event that certain better-financed companies make a significant effort to compete against our business or the secondary market in general, prices paid for existing portfolios of life insurance policies may rise and our ability to purchase NIBs or realize a return on NIBs may decline. In addition, recent shrinking of the market for life settlements has resulted in fewer available pools of insurance policies. As a result, price competition for the remaining pools has increased. Our limited resources prohibit us from competing for larger pools. These factors could adversely affect our profitability by reducing our return on investment or increasing our risk.

8&#160; 

&#160;

Our Current NIB Portfolio 

We purchased all of the NIBs we currently own on the secondary market, not directly from a Holder. We currently own NIBs related to 13 portfolios of life insurance policies. Our current NIB portfolio consists of NIBs purchased from PCH Financial S.a.r.l., or &#8220;PCH,&#8221; Del Mar Financial S.a.r.l., or &#8220;Del Mar,&#8221; and HFII Assets Solutions, LLC, or &#8220;HFII.&#8221; We currently estimate proceeds of approximately $115 million on the NIBs owned by us as of March 31, 2016. This amount is based on the estimated proceeds from policies of approximately $401 million in face value. The policy portfolios underlying our NIBs currently contain 130 fractionalized policies on 71 individual insureds.

Through the combination of loans from the Holders&#8217; Lender to and MRI coverage held by the Holder of the portfolios of policies underlying our NIBs and debt or equity financing by us, we currently believe we should be able to hold all the NIBs we acquired until maturity. However, we will continuously analyze the senior loans, MRI payments, NIBs and underlying policies to determine, in conjunction with the Holders, whether any such assets should be liquidated. Further, in the event of any events of default under the senior loans or MRI, we plan to make a request to the relevant Holder, to sell the affected assets, if necessary or advisable. If we are not successful, we may lose our interest in the affected NIBs. We believe there is an active secondary market for life insurance policies that we can access if it is determined that any of the life insurance policies or NIBs should be liquidated. However, prices in the secondary market are relatively volatile, and our goal is to avoid the early sale of NIBs or life insurance policies so that we can realize the maximum net amount on maturity of the Policies. Through relationships with well-known market participants, we believe we have substantial lines of communications with the potential participants active in the life settlement secondary market; however, no assurance can be given that if we are required to sell any of our NIBs or other insurance related products prior to maturity, that we will be able to do so without incurring a loss.

NIBs Acquired from PCH Financial . On March 11, 2013, pursuant to an agreement between PCH and ANEW LIFE, our wholly-owned subsidiary, ANEW LIFE acquired NIBs related to policies with an aggregate original face amount equal to $129,038,933, for an aggregate of $5,999,000, $3,000,000 of which was paid in cash and $2,999,000 of which was paid by the issuance of a secured promissory note by ANEW LIFE. Subsequent to the execution of the transfer agreement between PCH and ANEW LIFE, the secured promissory note was assigned to Del Mar and the face value of the note was reduced to $1,500,000. Ultimately the secured promissory note was assigned to Hyperion. In June 2015 the secured promissory note was converted to temporary equity through the issuance of 187,500 shares of common stock and the grant of a redemption right allowing Hyperion to require the Company to repurchase the shares. The redemption right was exercised with respect to 93,750 shares on June 9, 2015, for which the Company paid $750,000. On March 25, 2016, Hyperion exercised the redemption right in relation to the remaining 93,750 shares and on April 12, 2016, the Company paid $750,000 and the secured promissory note was settled. At March 31, 2016, the $750,000 with respect to the unexercised portion of the redemption right was classified on the balance sheet as Mandatorily Redeemable Common Stock.

The following table contains detailed information about the life insurance policies underlying the NIBs we acquired from PCH Financial.

Age at nearest birthday (as of March 31, 2016) The Life Expectancy (&#34;LE&#34;) input is the 70%/30% weighted average of two LEs available at the time of the original creation of the NIB portfolio. In purchasing and financing NIBs, we may use alternate life expectancy companies or may use weighted averages of two or more life expectancy companies, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case and requirements of the various counterparties. The life expectancy report is just an estimate, as the life expectancy of any individual cannot be known with absolute certainty. The Age of LE report represents the difference between the average date of the reports from which the Life Expectancy input were taken and of March 31, 2016 divided by 30.5 days to arrive at a number expressed in months. The age of an LE report is relevant to the reliability or aging of the Life Expectancy provided in the previous column. The carrier ratings are generally taken from S&#38;P, but if a carrier is not rated by S&#38;P, then the ratings are taken from the following agencies (in order): Moody's, Fitch, or A.M. Best. 

Based on the original life expectancy report related to the life insurance portfolio underlying the NIBs we purchased from PCH Financial, with an adjustment made to reduce the Life Expectancies by the number of months since the last Life Expectancy report, we could expect 9 underlying policies, representing an aggregate face amount of $53.5 million, to mature within 5 years of March 31, 2016, and the remaining underlying policies, representing an aggregate face amount of approximately $76.5 million, to mature thereafter. These life expectancies, or &#8220;LEs&#8221;, are based on a 70%/30% weighted average of two LEs available at the time of the original creation of the NIB portfolio. It should be noted that the insured&#8217;s health, medical conditions and other considerations may have changed since the initial LE report, so the LE is simply an estimate. These LEs were produced by third-party life expectancy companies and represent the actuarial mean of how long an individual is expected to live using the LE provider's proprietary statistical model, which is typically based on individualized mortality curves for each life factoring in the insured's gender, age, health and family history, medical conditions, and other considerations. The life expectancy report is just an estimate, as the life expectancy of any individual cannot be known with absolute certainty. 

&#160;

&#160;

Although paid by the holder of the policy portfolio underlying our NIBs, the estimated premiums and other expenses to be paid with respect to the underlying policies for each of the five succeeding fiscal years to keep the policies in force as of March 31, 2016, are as follows:

1. The amounts in this column represent what we expect the Holders expenses to be in relation to interest accrued on the Senior Loans, servicing fees, custodial fees and other administrative expenses and fees. &#160;

These premiums, along with other costs and expenses and repayments under the MRI, if any, will reduce the net insurance benefits payable to us under the policies underlying our NIBs. Certain policies contain a return of premium provision, which will increase the net insured benefit as premium payments are made. As of March 31, 2016, we have not received any proceeds from the NIBs we acquired from PCH Financial. Based on our current projections, we expect to ultimately receive between 30% and 40% of the aggregate face amount of the life insurance policies underlying the NIBs we acquired from PCH Financial. Our current projections are based off of various assumptions including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts, expected maturity events, counter party performance risk, changes to applicable regulation of the investment, shortage of funds needed to maintain the asset until maturity, changes in discount rates, life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums, interest, and other costs incurred, among other items. These uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income. As a result, actual results could differ significantly from these projections. In addition, this expectation may not be realized for a number of reasons, such as if the Holder defaults on premium payments and the related life insurance policies underlying our NIBs lapse and the underlying insureds live longer than expected, thus increasing the length of time that the related life insurance policies must be maintained and amounts that must be repaid to MRI providers and related expenses.

&#160;

NIBs Acquired from Del Mar . Effective June 7, 2013, we entered into an asset transfer agreement with Del Mar (the &#8220;Del Mar ATA&#8221;) to purchase NIBs based on two portfolios of life insurance policies having a face amount of approximately $284,270,924 as well as some additional assets, consisting primarily of approximately 72.2% of the NIBs associated with a portfolio of life settlement policies having a face value that originally totaled $94,000,000. These additional assets served as consideration and collateral for certain cash advances and expense payments made by the Company on Del Mar&#8217;s behalf. During June 2015, one of these life settlement policies matured for $10,000,000, lowering the remaining face value of such life settlement policies to $84,000,000.

A portion of the NIBs we initially acquired pursuant to the Del Mar ATA did not meet all of our NIB purchasing guidelines described above; such NIBs are referred to herein as the &#8220;Unqualified NIBs.&#8221; The Del Mar ATA provided that Del Mar would convert the Unqualified NIBs into NIBs that generally meet our NIB purchasing guidelines, or &#8220;Qualified NIBs,&#8221; and that Del Mar would make available for purchase by the Company an aggregate face amount of $400,000,000 of Qualified NIBs. The aggregate purchase price under the Del Mar ATA was $20,000,000, $5,000,000 of which was paid in cash up front with an additional $3,000,000 in cash and $12,000,000 in promissory notes to be paid or issued, as applicable, upon certain events described in the Del Mar ATA. In connection with entering into the Del Mar ATA, we also entered into an agreement with Europa Settlement Advisors Ltd. (&#8220;Europa&#8221;), whereby it was agreed that Europa would exclusively provide its NIBs related structuring and consulting services to us in relation to the NIBs acquired by us under the Del Mar ATA, with the understanding that we had no obligation to purchase any NIBs, qualified or otherwise, that Europa presented to us. Europa

10&#160; 

&#160;

received an initial cash advance of $340,000 for its services related to its structuring and consulting services regarding the Del Mar ATA.

Under the Del Mar ATA, Del Mar, with the assistance of Europa, was obligated to convert the Unqualified NIBs into Qualified NIBS. As soon as Del Mar met its obligation to provide Qualified NIBs to the Company, any remaining NIBs and any other consideration and collateral transferred to us pursuant to the Del Mar ATA would be returned or released to Del Mar. The original due date for the conversion was December 31, 2013.

As Del Mar was unable to provide the required amount of Qualified NIBs by the extended due date of August 31, 2015, effective September 1, 2015, the agreements with Del Mar and Europa were cancelled and the Company obtained full ownership and control of the collateral, which included the above mentioned approximately 72.2% of the NIBs associated with $84,000,000 face value of life settlement policies and certain rights to net proceeds relating to a policy that had matured prior to the due date.

The following table contains detailed information about the life insurance policies underlying the NIBs we acquired pursuant to the Del Mar ATA and held as of March 31, 2016.

The Life Expectancy (&#34;LE&#34;) input is the 70%/30% weighted average of two LEs available at the time of the original creation of the NIB portfolio. In purchasing, financing or insuring NIBs, we may use alternate life expectancy companies or may use weighted averages of two or more life expectancy companies, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case and requirements of the various counterparties. The life expectancy report is just an estimate, as the life expectancy of any individual cannot be known with absolute certainty. 3. The Age of LE report represents the difference between the average date of the reports from which the Life Expectancy input were taken and of March 31, 2016 divided by 30.5 days to arrive at a number expressed in months. The age of an LE report is relevant to the reliability or aging of the Life Expectancy provided in the previous column. 4. The carrier ratings are generally taken from S&#38;P, but if a carrier is not rated by S&#38;P, then the ratings are taken from the following agencies (in order): Moody's, Fitch, or A.M. Best. 5.

&#160;

&#160;

Based on the original life expectancy report related to the life insurance portfolio underlying the NIBs we purchased from Del Mar, with an adjustment made to reduce the Life Expectancies by the number of months since the last Life Expectancy report, we could expect 11 underlying policies, representing an aggregate face amount, of approximately $65.1 million, to mature within 5 years of March 31, 2016, and the remaining underlying policies, representing an aggregate face amount of approximately $24.6 million, to mature thereafter. These face values are after consideration is given to the Company&#8217;s 72.2% ownership of a portion of the policies, and the life expectancies, or &#8220;LEs&#8221;, are based on a 70%/30% weighted average of two LEs available at the time of the original creation of the NIB portfolio. It should be noted that the insured&#8217;s health, medical conditions and other considerations may have changed since the initial LE report, so the LE is simply an estimate. These LEs were produced by third-party life expectancy companies and represent the actuarial mean of how long an individual is expected to live using the LE provider's proprietary statistical model, which is typically based on individualized mortality curves for each life factoring in the insured's gender, age, health and family history, medical conditions, and other considerations. The life expectancy report is just an estimate, as the life expectancy of any individual cannot be known with absolute certainty. 

&#160; &#160;

Although paid by the Holder, the estimated premiums and other expenses to be paid with respect to the policies underlying the NIBs and Qualified NIBs purchased by us from Del Mar for each of the five succeeding fiscal years to keep such policies in force as of March 31, 2016, are as follows:

These premiums, along with other costs and expenses and repayments under the MRI, if any, will reduce the net insurance benefits payable to us under the policies. As of March 31, 2016, we have not received any proceeds from the NIBs we acquired from Del Mar. Based on our current projections, we expect to ultimately receive between 30% and 40% of the aggregate face amount of the life insurance policies underlying the NIBs we acquired from Del Mar. Our current projections are based off of various assumptions including, but not limited to, the amount and timing of projected net cash receipts, expected maturity events, counter party performance risk, changes to applicable regulation of the investment, shortage of funds needed to maintain the asset until maturity, changes in discount rates, life expectancy estimates and their relation to premiums, interest, and other costs incurred, among other items. These uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income. As a result, actual results could differ significantly from these projections. In addition, this expectation may not be realized for a number of reasons, such as if the Holder defaults on premium payments and the related life insurance policies underlying our NIBs lapse and the underlying insureds live longer than expected, thus increasing the length of time that the related life insurance policies must be maintained and amounts that must be repaid to MRI providers and related expenses.

Qualified NIBs acquired under the HFII Asset Transfer Agreement 

&#160; 

On March 31, 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with HFII, which was subsequently amended on March 31, 2015, pursuant to which we purchased NIBs related to four portfolios of life insurance policies with an aggregate face value of approximately $124,375,000 and which meet our NIB purchasing guidelines. The following table contains detailed information about the life insurance policies underlying the NIBs we acquired from HFII Assets.
