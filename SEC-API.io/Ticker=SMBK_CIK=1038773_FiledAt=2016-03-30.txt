 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

&#160; 

OVERVIEW 

&#160;

SmartFinancial (formerly &#8220;Cornerstone Bancshares, Inc.&#8221;) was incorporated on September 19, 1983, under the laws of the State of Tennessee. SmartFinancial is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. On August 31, 2015, Cornerstone Bancshares, Inc. merged with SmartFinancial, Inc. (&#8220; Legacy SmartFinancial &#8221;), with Cornerstone Bancshares, Inc. surviving the merger and changing its name to &#8220;SmartFinancial, Inc.&#8221; Following the merger, the company operated two wholly-owned subsidiaries: SmartBank and Cornerstone Community Bank, both Tennessee banking corporations (the &#8220; Banks &#8221;). On February 26, 2016, the company merged Cornerstone Community Bank with and into SmartBank, with SmartBank surviving the merger. As of the date of this annual report, SmartBank is our only subsidiary bank.

&#160;

SmartFinancial

&#160; 

The primary activity of SmartFinancial currently is, and is expected to remain for the foreseeable future, the ownership and operation of SmartBank. As a bank holding company, SmartFinancial intends to facilitate SmartBank&#8217;s ability to serve its customers&#8217; requirements for financial services. The holding company structure also provides flexibility for expansion through the possible acquisition of other financial institutions and the provision of additional banking-related services, as well as certain non-banking services, which a traditional commercial bank may not provide under present laws.

&#160;

The Merger

&#160;

On August 31, 2015, we completed our merger with Legacy SmartFinancial valued at approximately $28.4 million. Legacy SmartFinancial was merged with and into Cornerstone Bancshares, with Cornerstone Bancshares continuing on as the surviving corporation, changing its name to SmartFinancial, Inc. and relocating the headquarters to Knoxville, Tennessee. The merger was treated as a reverse merger for accounting purposes. Following the merger, SmartBank and Cornerstone Community Bank continued to operate separately until February 26, 2016, when the two banks were merged together. In connection with the merger, Cornerstone Bancshares Inc. sold $15 million of common stock at $3.75 per share in a stock offering to accredited investors, and used the proceeds to redeem the company&#8217;s Series A Cumulative Preferred Stock. As part of the merger, Cornerstone effected a 1-for-4 reverse stock split after which the Legacy SmartFinancial shareholders were issued 1.05 shares of Cornerstone common stock for each share of Legacy SmartFinancial common stock owned. All of Cornerstone&#8217;s outstanding stock options vested upon consummation of the merger. The merger gave us a material market presence in the Chattanooga, Tennessee-Georgia MSA and surrounding counties. As part of the merger agreement SmartFinancial listed its common stock on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol &#8220;SMBK.&#8221;

&#160; 

SBLF Preferred Stock 

&#160;

On August 31, 2015, and in connection with the merger, the Company entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the &#8220; Assignment Agreement &#8221;) with Legacy SmartFinancial, pursuant to which Legacy SmartFinancial assigned to the Company, and the Company assumed, all of Legacy SmartFinancial&#8217;s rights, responsibilities, and obligations under that certain Securities Purchase Agreement (the &#8220; Securities Purchase Agreement &#8221;), dated as of August 4, 2011, by and between The United States Secretary of the Treasury (&#8220; Treasury &#8221;) and Legacy SmartFinancial. The Securities Purchase Agreement was entered into by Legacy SmartFinancial in connection with its participation in Treasury&#8217;s Small Business Lending Fund Program.

&#160;

Under the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, Legacy SmartFinancial sold 12,000 shares of its Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (&#8220; Legacy SmartFinancial SBLF Stock &#8221;), to Treasury for a purchase price of $12 million. Each share of Legacy SmartFinancial SBLF Stock was converted into one share of the Company&#8217;s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, having a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the &#8220; SBLF Preferred Stock &#8221;).

&#160;

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, SmartFinancial had 225 full-time equivalent employees. SmartBank had 121 full-time equivalent employees and Cornerstone Community Bank had 104 full-time equivalent employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. SmartFinancial believes that its relationship with its employees is good.

&#160;

Merger and Acquisition Strategy

&#160;

Our strategic plan involves growing a high performing community bank through organic loan and deposit growth as well as disciplined merger and acquisition activity. We are continually evaluating business combination opportunities and may conduct due diligence activities in connection with these opportunities. As a result, business combination discussions and, in some cases, negotiations, may take place, and transactions involving cash, debt or equity securities could be expected. Any future business combinations or series of business combinations that we might undertake may be material in terms of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, or equity issued. 

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The three Tennessee markets in which we currently operate are very competitive. The Knoxville MSA banking market consists of 51 financial institutions with over $15.1 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2015 up from $14.7 billion at June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 48.5% of this deposit base was controlled by three large, multi-state banks headquartered outside of Knoxville, consisting of the following: First Horizon, SunTrust, and Regions Financial. At June 30, 2015, SmartBank had approximately 0.34% of the deposit market share in the Knoxville MSA.

&#160;

The Chattanooga MSA banking market consists of 28 financial institutions with over $9.0 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2015 up from $8.5 billion at June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 56.6% of this deposit base was controlled by three large, multi-state banks headquartered outside of Chattanooga, consisting of the following: First Horizon, SunTrust, and Regions Financial. At June 30, 2015, SmartBank had approximately 3.68% of the deposit market share in the Chattanooga MSA.

&#160;

The Sevier County banking market is comprised of 10 financial institutions with over $2.1 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2015 up from $2.0 billion at June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 79.9% of this deposit base was controlled by four local community banks all but one of which are headquartered in the county. At June 30, 2015, SmartBank had approximately 17.47% of the deposit market share in Sevier County.

&#160;

The two Florida markets in which we currently operate branches are very competitive. The Pensacola MSA banking market consists of 20 financial institutions with over $5.1 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2015 up from $4.7 billion at June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2015, approximately 66.0% of this deposit base was controlled by five large, multi-state banks headquartered outside of Pensacola, consisting of the following: Regions, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Synovus Bank and Whitney Bank.

&#160;

The Okaloosa County (Destin) banking market is comprised of 22 financial institutions with over $3.6 billion in deposits in the market as of June 30, 2015 up from $3.4 billion at June 30, 2014. As of June 30, 2015, there was no concentrations of deposits with the largest bank controlling only 14.8% of the market&#8217;s deposits. The top four institution were a mix of large regional banks and local community banks both headquartered in the county. At June 30, 2015, SmartBank had approximately 1.55% of the deposit market share in Okaloosa County.

&#160;

The Bank competes for deposits principally by offering depositors a variety of deposit programs with competitive interest rates, quality service and convenient locations and hours. The Bank focuses its resources in seeking out and attracting small business relationships and taking advantage of the Bank&#8217;s ability to provide flexible service that meets the needs of this customer class. Management feels this market niche is the most promising business area for the future growth of the Bank.

&#160;

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

SmartFinancial and SmartBank are subject to state and federal banking laws and regulations that impose specific requirements and restrictions and provide for general regulatory oversight over virtually all aspects of our operations. These laws and regulations generally are intended to protect depositors, not shareholders. The following discussion is only a general summary of some of the more significant statutory and regulatory provisions. This summary is qualified by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects.

&#160;

General 

&#160;

SmartFinancial is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220; Act &#8221;), and is registered with and regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#8220; Federal Reserve Board &#8221;). SmartFinancial is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board annual reports and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Act. The Federal Reserve Board may also make examinations of SmartFinancial and its subsidiary.

&#160;

SmartBank is a Tennessee-chartered commercial bank and is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (the &#8220; TDFI &#8221;). In addition, the Bank&#8217;s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220; DIF &#8221;) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the &#8220;FDIC&#8221;). SmartBank is also a member of the Federal Reserve System.

&#160;

FDIC Insurance of Deposit Accounts 

&#160;

The FDIC insures the deposit accounts of the SmartBank up to the maximum amount provided by law. The general insurance limit is $250,000. The Dodd-Frank Act, which is discussed in more detail below, provided for temporary, unlimited deposit insurance for all non-interest bearing transaction accounts through December 31, 2012. Beginning January 1, 2013, noninterest-bearing transaction accounts are no longer insured separately from depositors&#8217; other accounts at the same bank.

&#160;

The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on each insured institution quarterly based on annualized rates for one of four risk categories. Under the rules in effect through March 31, 2011, these rates were applied to the institution&#8217;s deposits. Each institution was assigned to one of four risk categories based on its capital, supervisory ratings and other factors. Well capitalized institutions that are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses were assigned to Risk Category I. Risk Categories II, III and IV presented progressively greater risks to the DIF. A range of initial base assessment rates applied to each risk category, subject to adjustments based on an institution&#8217;s unsecured debt, secured liabilities and brokered deposits.

&#160;

As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC adopted rules effective April 1, 2011, under which insurance premium assessments are based on an institution&#8217;s total assets minus its tangible equity (defined as Tier 1 capital) instead of its deposits. Under these rules, an institution with total assets of less than $10 billion is assigned to a risk category as described above, and a range of initial base assessment rates apply to each category, subject to adjustment downward based on unsecured debt issued by the institution and, except for an institution in Risk Category I, adjustment upward if the institution&#8217;s brokered deposits exceed 10% of its domestic deposits, to produce total base assessment rates. Total base assessment rates range from 2.5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I, 9 to 24 basis points for Risk Category II, 18 to 33 basis points for Risk Category III, and 30 to 45 basis points for Risk Category IV, all subject to further adjustment upward if the institution holds more than a de minimis amount of unsecured debt issued by another FDIC-insured institution. The FDIC may increase or decrease its rates by 2.0 basis points without further rulemaking. In an emergency, the FDIC may also impose a special assessment.

&#160;

Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC has established 2.0% as the designated reserve ratio (&#8220; DRR &#8221;), which is the ratio of the DIF to insured deposits. The FDIC has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by September 30, 2020, the deadline imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the FDIC to offset the effect of the increase in the statutory minimum DRR to 1.35% on institutions with assets of less than $10 billion from the former statutory minimum of 1.15%.

&#160;

The FDIC also collects an asset-based assessment from insured financial institutions on behalf of the Financing Corporation (the &#8220; FICO &#8221;). The funds from these assessments are used to service debt issued by FICO in its capacity as a financial vehicle for the Federal Savings &#38; Loan Insurance Corporation. The FICO assessment rate is set quarterly. In 2013 it was 0.64 cents per $100 of assets. These assessments will continue until the debt matures in 2017 through 2019.

State of Tennessee Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

As a commercial bank chartered and regulated by the TDFI, SmartBank is subject to various state laws and regulations which limit the amount that can be loaned to a single borrower and the borrower&#8217;s related interests, the types of permissible investments, and geographic and new product expansion, among other things. SmartBank must submit an application to, and receive the approval of, the TDFI before opening a new branch office or merging with another financial institution. The Commissioner of the TDFI has the authority to enforce state laws and regulations by ordering a director, officer or employee of SmartBank to cease and desist from violating a law or regulation or from engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices.

&#160;

Tennessee law contains limitations on the interest rates that may be charged on various types of loans and restrictions on the nature and amount of loans that may be granted and on the type of investments which may be made. The operations of banks are also affected by various consumer laws and regulations, including those relating to equal credit opportunity and regulation of consumer lending practices. SmartBank&#8217;s deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.

&#160;

State banks are subject to regulation by the TDFI with regard to capital requirements and the payment of dividends. Tennessee has adopted the provisions of the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Regulation O with respect to restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit to bank &#8220;insiders&#8221;. Further, under Tennessee law, state banks are prohibited from lending to any one person, firm or corporation amounts more than fifteen percent (15%) of the bank&#8217;s equity capital accounts, except (i) in the case of certain loans secured by negotiable title documents covering readily marketable nonperishable staples, or (ii) with the prior approval of the bank&#8217;s board of directors or finance committee (however titled), the bank may make a loan to any person, firm or corporation of up to twenty-five percent (25%) of its equity capital accounts. Tennessee law requires that dividends be paid only from retained earnings (or undivided profits) except that dividends may be paid from capital surplus with the prior written consent of the TDFI. Tennessee laws regulating banks require certain charges against and transfers from an institution&#8217;s undivided profits account before undivided profits can be made available for the payment of dividends.

&#160;

Federal Supervision and Regulation 

&#160;

SmartFinancial is regularly examined by the Federal Reserve Board, and the bank is supervised and examined by the FDIC. SmartFinancial is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and the business operations of the bank. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required before SmartFinancial may acquire, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of the voting shares of any bank, if, after such acquisition, SmartFinancial would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the voting stock of the bank. In addition, pursuant to the provisions of the Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, SmartFinancial may only engage in, or own or control companies that engage in, activities deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto.

&#160;

SmartBank and SmartFinancial are &#8220;affiliated&#8221; within the meaning of the Act. Certain provisions of the Act establish standards for the terms of, limit the amount of, and establish collateral requirements with respect to, any loans or extensions of credit to, and investments in, affiliates by SmartBank, as well as set arms-length criteria for such transactions and for certain other transactions (including payment by the bank for services under any contract) between SmartBank and its affiliates. In addition, related provisions of the Act and the regulations promulgated under the Act limit the amounts of, and establish required procedures and credit standards with respect to, loans and other extensions of credit to officers, directors, and principal shareholders of SmartBank, SmartFinancial and any other subsidiary of SmartFinancial, and to related interests of such persons.

&#160;

Bank holding companies are required to serve as a source of financial strength to their subsidiary banks. Most bank holding companies are required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of their outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the bank holding company&#8217;s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice that would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. The prior notice requirement does not apply to certain &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; bank holding companies that meet specified criteria.

&#160;

The Federal Reserve Board has adopted a Policy Statement on Cash Dividends Not Fully Covered by Earnings. The Policy Statement sets forth various guidelines that the Federal Reserve Board believes that a bank holding company should follow in establishing its dividend policy. In general, the Federal Reserve Board stated that bank holding companies should not pay dividends except out of current earnings and unless the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The FDIC may impose sanctions on any insured bank that does not operate in accordance with FDIC regulations, policies and directives. Proceedings may be instituted against any insured bank or any director, officer or employee of the bank that is believed by the FDIC to be engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, including violation of applicable laws and regulations. The FDIC is also empowered to assess civil penalties against companies or individuals who violate certain federal statutes, orders or regulations. In addition, the FDIC has the authority to terminate insurance of accounts, after notice and hearing, upon a finding by the FDIC that the insured institution is or has engaged in any unsafe or unsound practice that has not been corrected, or is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule or order of, or condition imposed by, the FDIC. Neither SmartFinancial nor SmartBank knows of any past or current practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of its deposit insurance.

&#160;

Specific Legislation Affecting SmartFinancial and SmartBank 

&#160;

The following information summarizes certain statutory and regulatory provisions affecting SmartFinancial and SmartBank and is qualified in its entirety by reference to such statutory and regulatory provisions.

&#160;

FIRREA and FDICIA 

&#160;

Far-reaching legislation, including the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (&#8220; FIRREA &#8221;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#8220; FDICIA &#8221;) have for years impacted the business of banking. FIRREA primarily affected the regulation of savings institutions rather than the regulation of commercial banks and bank holding companies like SmartBank and SmartFinancial, but did include provisions affecting deposit insurance premiums, acquisitions of thrifts by banks and bank holding companies, liability of commonly controlled depository institutions, receivership and conservatorship rights and procedures and substantially increased penalties for violations of banking statutes, regulations and orders.

&#160;

FDICIA resulted in extensive changes to the federal banking laws. The primary purpose of FDICIA was to authorize additional borrowings by the FDIC in order to assist in the resolution of failed and failing financial institutions. However, the law also instituted certain changes to the supervisory process and contained various provisions affecting the operations of banks and bank holding companies.

&#160;

The additional supervisory powers and regulations mandated by FDICIA include a &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; program based upon five regulatory zones for banks, in which all banks are placed largely based on their capital positions. Regulators are permitted to take increasingly harsh action as a bank&#8217;s financial condition declines. Regulators are also empowered to place in receivership or require the sale of a bank to another depository institution when a bank&#8217;s ratio of tangible equity to total assets reaches two percent. Better capitalized institutions are generally subject to less onerous regulation and supervision than banks with lesser amounts of capital. The FDIC has adopted regulations implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of the FDICIA, which place financial institutions into one of the following five categories based upon capitalization ratios: (1) a &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of at least 6% and a leverage ratio of at least 5%; (2) an &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; institution has a total risk-based ratio of at least 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of at least 4% and a leverage ratio of at least 4%; (3) an &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221; institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of under 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of under 4% or a leverage ratio of under 4%; (4) a &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of under 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of under 3% or a leverage ratio of under 3%; and (5) a &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2% or less. Institutions in any of the three undercapitalized categories would generally be prohibited from declaring dividends or making capital distributions. The regulations also establish procedures for &#8220;downgrading&#8221; an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital.

&#160;

U.S. Banking agencies have recently adopted revisions to their risk-based and leverage capital requirements consistent with agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel III). The proposed rules establish tougher capital standards through more restrictive capital definitions, higher risk-weighted assets, additional capital buffers, and higher requirements for minimum capital ratios. These reforms could have a material negative impact on the profitability and returns on equity of U.S. banks, including the bank. Additional information about the higher capital standards is presented in Note 13 to the &#8220;Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.&#8221;

&#160;

Various other sections of the FDICIA impose substantial audit and reporting requirements and increase the role of independent accountants and outside directors. Set forth below is a list containing certain other significant provisions of the FDICIA:

&#160;

&#167; annual on-site examinations by regulators (except for smaller, well-capitalized banks with high management ratings, which must be examined every 18 months); &#160;

&#167; mandated annual independent audits by independent public accountants and an independent audit committee of outside directors for institutions with more than $500,000,000 in assets; &#160;

&#167; uniform disclosure requirements for interest rates and terms of deposit accounts; &#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#167; a requirement that the FDIC establish a risk-based deposit insurance assessment system; &#160;

&#167; authorization for the FDIC to impose one or more special assessments on its insured banks to recapitalize the bank Insurance Fund (now called the Deposit Insurance Fund); &#160;

&#167; a requirement that each institution submit to its primary regulators an annual report on its financial condition and management, which report will be available to the public; &#160;

&#167; a ban on the acceptance of brokered deposits except by well capitalized institutions and by adequately capitalized institutions with the permission of the FDIC, and the regulation of the brokered deposit market by the FDIC; &#160;

&#167; restrictions on the activities engaged in by state banks and their subsidiaries as principal, including insurance underwriting, to the same activities permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries unless the state bank is well capitalized and a determination is made by the FDIC that the activities do not pose a significant risk to the insurance fund; &#160;

&#167; a review by each regulatory agency of accounting principles applicable to reports or statements required to be filed with federal banking agencies and a mandate to devise uniform requirements for all such filings; &#160;

&#167; the institution by each regulatory agency of noncapital safety and soundness standards for each institution it regulates which cover (1) internal controls, (2) loan documentation, (3) credit underwriting, (4) interest rate exposure, (5) asset growth, (6) compensation, fees and benefits paid to employees, officers and directors, (7) operational and managerial standards, and (8) asset quality, earnings and stock valuation standards for preserving a minimum ratio of market value to book value for publicly traded shares (if feasible); &#160;

&#167; uniform regulations regarding real estate lending; and &#160;

&#167; a review by each regulatory agency of the risk-based capital rules to ensure they take into account adequate interest rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risks of non-traditional activities. &#160;

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 

&#160;

The activities permissible to SmartFinancial and SmartBank were substantially expanded by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the &#8220;Gramm Act&#8221;). The Gramm Act repealed the anti-affiliation provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act to permit the common ownership of commercial banks, investment banks and insurance companies. The Gramm Act amended the Act to permit a financial holding company to engage in any activity and acquire and retain any company that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity, or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. The Gramm Act also modified existing law relating to financial privacy and community reinvestment. The new financial privacy provisions generally prohibit financial institutions, including SmartBank and SmartFinancial, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial information to third parties unless customers have the opportunity to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of the disclosure.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act 

&#160;

On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). The impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry will be broad, with enhanced regulatory oversight and compliance, including, among other things, (i) enhanced resolution authority of troubled and failing banks and their holding companies; (ii) increased capital and liquidity requirements; (iii) increased regulatory examination fees; (iv) changes to assessments to be paid to the FDIC for federal deposit insurance; and (v) numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthening safety and soundness for, the financial services sector. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework for systemic risk and oversight in the industry which has resulted and will continue to result in sweeping changes in the regulation of financial institutions aimed at strengthening safety and soundness for the financial services sector. A summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act is set forth below:

&#160;

&#183; Increased Capital Standards and Enhanced Supervision . The federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies. These new standards will be no lower than current regulatory capital and leverage standards applicable to insured depository institutions and may, in fact, be higher when established by the agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act also increases regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks, bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency. &#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Federal Deposit Insurance . The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the $250,000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits and provided unlimited federal deposit insurance on non-interest bearing transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions until December 31, 2012. The Dodd-Frank Act also changed the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible equity, eliminated the ceiling on the size of the DIF and increased the floor on the size of the DIF. &#160;

&#183; The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220;Bureau&#8221;) . The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Bureau, responsible for implementing, examining and, for large financial institutions (i.e., those with more than $10 billion in assets), enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The Bureau will have broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. On July 21, 2011, the Dodd-Frank Act transferred the responsibility for implementation of a wide variety of existing consumer protection rules and regulations to the Bureau. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act tasks the Bureau with implementation of many new consumer protection initiatives required by that law. While the exact impact of these future changes is unknown, SmartBank expects that it will incur additional expense related to the implementation of those rules. Another provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Durbin Amendment, became effective October 1, 2011. The Durbin Amendment limits interchange fees payable on debit card transactions for financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. While the Durbin Amendment does not directly apply to SmartBank, competitive market forces related to the reduction mandated by the Durbin Amendment may result in a decrease in revenue from interchange fees for smaller financial institutions. &#160;

&#183; Interest on Demand Deposit Accounts . The Dodd-Frank Act repeals the prohibition on the payment of interest on demand deposit accounts effective one year after the date of enactment, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business checking and other accounts. &#160;

&#183; Mortgage Reform . The Dodd-Frank Act provides for mortgage reform addressing a customer&#8217;s ability to repay, restricts variable-rate lending by requiring the ability to repay to be determined for variable rate loans by using the maximum rate that will apply during the first five years of a variable-rate loan term, and makes more loans subject to requirement for higher-cost loans, new disclosures and certain other restrictions. &#160;

We expect that many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented over time, and most will be subject to implementing regulations over the course of several years. Given the uncertainty associated with the manner in which the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and through regulations, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on financial institutions&#8217; operations is unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.

Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act 

&#160;

The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, better known as the Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;) requires all United States financial institutions to assist United States government agencies to detect and prevent money laundering. Specifically, BSA requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports of cash transactions exceeding a daily aggregate amount of $10,000, and to report suspicious activity that might signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities.

&#160;

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (&#8220;USA PATRIOT Act&#8221;) substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States, imposed new compliance and due diligence obligations, defined new crimes and penalties, compelled the production of documents located both inside and outside the United States, including those of foreign institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the United States, and clarified the safe harbor from civil liability to customers. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued a number of regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions such as SmartBank. The regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The Treasury Department may issue additional regulations which will further clarify the USA PATRIOT Act&#8217;s requirements.

&#160;

Under the USA PATRIOT Act all &#8220;financial institutions,&#8221; as defined, must establish anti-money laundering compliance and due diligence programs. Such programs must include, among other things, adequate policies, the designation of a compliance officer, employee and director training programs, and an independent audit function to review and test the program.

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 

&#160;

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;) increased the threshold under which a bank or bank holding company may terminate registration of a security under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to 1,200 shareholders of record from 300. The JOBS Act also raised the threshold requiring companies to register to 2,000 shareholders from 500. Since the JOBS Act was signed, numerous banks or bank holding companies have filed to deregister their common stock.

Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule 

&#160;

Pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#8220; CFPB &#8221;) issued a final rule on January 10, 2013, which became effective January 10, 2014, amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act (&#8220; TILA &#8221;), requiring mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers&#8217; ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision:

&#160;

&#183; current or reasonably expected income or assets; &#183; current employment status; &#183; the monthly payment on the covered transaction; &#183; the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; &#183; the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; &#183; current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; &#183; the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and &#183; credit history. &#160;

Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate &#8220;qualified mortgages,&#8221; which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a &#8220;qualified mortgage&#8221; is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Loans which meet these criteria will be considered qualified mortgages, and as a result generally protect lenders from fines or litigation in the event of foreclosure. Qualified mortgages that are &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not &#8220;higher-priced&#8221; (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. The final rule, as issued, is not expected to have a material impact on our lending activities or our results of operations or financial condition.

&#160;

TILA/RESPA Integrated Disclosures 

&#160;

On October 3, 2015, the CFPB implemented a final rule combining the mortgage disclosures consumers previously received under TILA and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#8220; RESPA &#8221;). For more than 30 years, the TILA and RESPA mortgage disclosures had been administered separately by, respectively, the Federal Reserve Board and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The final rule requires lenders to provide applicants with the new Loan Estimate and Closing Disclosure and generally applies to most closed-end consumer mortgage loans for which the creditor or mortgage broker receives an application on or after October 3, 2015.

&#160;

Future Legislation 

&#160;

Legislation is regularly introduced in both the United States Congress and the Tennessee General Assembly that contains wide-ranging proposals for altering the structures, regulations and competitive relationships of the nation&#8217;s financial institutions. Such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment of SmartFinancial and/or SmartBank in substantial and unpredictable ways and could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance, depending upon whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that it or any implementing regulations would have on the financial condition or result of operations of SmartFinancial and/or SmartBank.
