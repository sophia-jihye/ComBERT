Business Development &#38; Business Overview 

&#160; 

Prevention Insurance.com (the &#34;Company&#34;) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 7, 1975, under the name Vita Plus, Inc. The name was later changed to Vita Plus Industries, Inc. and in 2000 the Company&#8217;s name was changed to its current name Prevention Insurance.com. 

&#160; 

From inception until early 1999, the Company&#8217;s principal business consisted of the sale and distribution of our own formulations of specific vitamins and nutritional supplements, and of various other health and personal care products. In 1991, we were licensed in Nevada as an agent for health and life insurance. Since 1991, we have not derived any significant income from sales of insurance policies. Effective March 15, 1999, we sold for cash substantially all of our assets associated with the traditional distribution of vitamin and dietary supplement formulations, including all inventory of vitamins and nutritional supplements and terminated all business activities associated with the distribution of individual vitamins and dietary supplements. We did, however, retain our insurance agency license, our Prevention Insurance website and ownership rights in certain trademarks. 

&#160; 

In 2005, the Company added a second line of business focused on the development of ATM machine sale operations. On December 28, 2007, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the &#8220;Letter Agreement&#8221;), with Paragon Capital LP (&#8220;Paragon&#8221;) and Scott Goldsmith, which after the satisfaction of the terms of the Letter Agreement, would result in a change in control of the Company. In connection with the terms of the Letter Agreement, the Company and Paragon entered into a stock purchase agreement (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) pursuant to which Paragon purchased an aggregate of 71,428,571 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the &#8220;Old Common Stock&#8221;) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $250,000. As provided pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, our then sole officer and director, Alan P. Donenfeld, was elected to the Board of Directors of the Company and appointed to serve as the Company&#8217;s President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 

&#160; 

On February 5, 2008, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Letter Agreement, Mr. Goldsmith, Paragon and the Company signed an agreement and release (the &#8220;Release&#8221;), which provided for, among other items, (a) cancellation of 1,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the &#8220;Old Preferred Stock&#8221;), issued in the name of Mr. Goldsmith, (b) cancellation of warrants to purchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Old Common Stock, in exchange for (1) payment in full of all of the Company&#8217;s liabilities, debts, and payables, (2) an initial payment to Mr. Goldsmith of $200,000, (3) conveyance of the assets and liabilities of Quick Pay, Inc. to Mr. Goldsmith, (4) an additional payment to Mr. Goldsmith, upon certain events happening such as a reverse merger with a private company, of $400,000 or 1,600,000 shares of Old Common Stock, regardless of any stock splits for a period from four years from the date of the issuance of the stock and (5) future assignment of warrants held by Paragon to Mr. Goldsmith upon completion of a reverse merger. 

&#160; 

On September 22, 2009, the Company issued 1,600,000 shares of its Old Common Stock to Scott Goldsmith in satisfaction of the $400,000 payment required pursuant to the Release. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On March 8, 2010, the Company, Paragon and Scott Goldsmith entered into an agreement (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) whereby the Company paid Goldsmith $65,000 in consideration for the following: 1) Paragon transferred ownership to Goldsmith of a warrant, issued to Paragon on April 30, 2008 (originally due April 30, 2010) (the &#8220;April 30, 2008 Warrant&#8221;), to purchase 10,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s Old Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share; 2) the Company extended the maturity date of the April 30, 2008 Warrant from April 30, 2010 to April 30, 2012, pursuant to a warrant extension agreement; and 3) Goldsmith agreed to cancel Paragon&#8217;s requirement to issue 4,000,000 warrants to Goldsmith pursuant to the parties&#8217; Settlement and Release Agreement dated February 5, 2008. 

&#160; 

On April 27, 2011, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to (1) effect a one for one hundred (1:100) reverse stock split of its Old Common Stock (the &#8220;Reverse Split&#8221;) and (2) change the par value of the capital stock of the Company such that the Company has 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the &#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the &#8220;Preferred Stock&#8221;) authorized. 

&#160; 

As a result of the Reverse Split, each one hundred (100) shares of Old Common Stock of the Company issued and outstanding or held as unissued immediately prior to the Reverse Split was automatically without any action on the part of the holder thereof, reclassified and changed into one (1) share of Common Stock. Upon the conversion of the Old Common Stock, any fractional shares were disregarded and rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares of Common Stock. In addition, the total number of issued and outstanding warrants of the Company and the related exercise prices were adjusted in accordance with the Reverse Split ratio. 

&#160; 

Effective December 8, 2015, a change of control occurred with respect to the Company. Pursuant to the change of control, Paragon sold 2,109,286 shares of common stock of Company that it held (&#8220; Common Stock &#8221;) and (ii) the following convertible notes of the Company issued in favor of Paragon totaling $199,500 (&#8220; Convertible Notes &#8221;); (a) a Convertible Note from the Company dated August 31, 2015 in the amount of $127,000, (b) a Convertible Note from the Company dated August 31, 2015 in the amount of $35,000, (c) a Convertible Note from the Company dated April 30, 2015 in the amount of $17,500, and (d) a Convertible Note from the Company dated November 3, 2015 in the amount of $20,000. Pursuant to the conversion features of the Convertible Notes, they were converted into 19,950,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The new controlling shareholders are Wooi Huat Teow who owns 8,936,058 shares of common stock or 40% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock, and Chee Chow Teow and Ee Meng Teow, each of whom respectively own 3,351,013 shares of common stock or 15% of the total issued and outstanding shares of common stock (See &#8220; Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters &#8221; below). In addition, pursuant to the change of control, Mr. Chee Chau Ng was elected to the Board of Directors of the Company and appointed to serve as the Company&#8217;s President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 

&#160; 

Current Business and Plan of Operations 

&#160; 

Under SEC Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), the Company qualifies as a &#8220;shell company,&#8221; because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is subject to those requirements. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. 

&#160; 

The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management and the Company&#8217;s principal shareholders. Current or future management of the Company may decide to hire outside consultants to assist in the investigation and selection of business opportunities, and might pay a finder&#8217;s fee, in stock or in cash, as allowed by law. Since the Company has no current plans to use any outside consultants, no criteria or policies have been adopted. 

&#160; 

As of the date of this report, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company. The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors: 

&#160; 

(a) Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products; 

&#160; 

(b) Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 

&#160; 

(c) Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

(d) Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources; 

&#160; 

(e) The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; 

&#160; 

(f) The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; and 

&#160; 

(g) The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items. 

&#160; 

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company's limited capital available for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. In evaluating a prospective business combination, we will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as possible given the lack of information which may be available regarding private companies, our limited personnel and financial resources and the inexperience of our management with respect to such activities. We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with the target business&#8217;s incumbent management and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, including but not limited to attorneys, accountants, consultants or such other professionals. The costs associated with hiring third parties to complete a business combination target may be significant and are difficult to determine as such costs may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of the target company and the size and the complexity of the target company. Our limited funds and the lack of full-time management will likely make it impracticable to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a target business before we consummate a business combination. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds available to us, would be desirable. We will be particularly dependent in making decisions upon information provided by the promoters, owners, sponsors or other associated with the target business seeking our participation. 

&#160; 

We fully anticipate that business opportunities will come to the Company&#8217;s attention from various sources. These sources may include, but not be limited to, its principal shareholders, professional advisors such as attorneys and accountants, securities broker-dealers, and others who may present unsolicited proposals. Currently, the Company has no agreements, whether written or oral, with any individual or entity, to act as a finder for the Company. However, at the present, we contemplate that our majority shareholders or our sole officer and certain of their affiliates may introduce a business combination target to us. 

&#160; 

It is possible that the range of business opportunities that might be available for consideration by the Company could be limited by the impact of Securities and Exchange Commission regulations regarding purchase and sale of &#8220;penny stocks.&#8221; The regulations would affect, and possibly impair, any market that might develop in the Company&#8217;s securities until such time as they qualify for listing on NASDAQ or on another exchange which would make them exempt from applicability of the &#8220;penny stock&#8221; regulations. 

&#160; 

The Company believes that various types of potential merger or acquisition candidates might find a business combination with the Company to be attractive. These include acquisition candidates desiring to create a public market for their shares in order to enhance liquidity for current shareholders, acquisition candidates which have long-term plans for raising capital through the public sale of securities and believe that the possible prior existence of a public market for their securities would be beneficial, and acquisition candidates which plan to acquire additional assets through issuance of securities rather than for cash, and believe that the possibility of development of a public market for their securities will be of assistance in that process. Acquisition candidates who have a need for an immediate cash infusion are not likely to find a potential business combination with the Company to be an attractive alternative. 

&#160; 

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. The amount of time it takes to complete a business combination, the location of the target company and the size and complexity of the business of the target company are all factors that determine the costs associated with completing a business combination transaction. The time and costs required to complete a business combination transaction can be ascertained once a business combination target has been identified. Any costs incurred with respect to evaluation of a prospective business combination that is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. There are numerous &#8220;public shell&#8221; companies either actively or passively seeking operating businesses with which to merge in addition to a large number of &#8220;blank check&#8221; companies formed and capitalized specifically to acquire operating businesses. Additionally, we are subject to competition from other companies looking to expand their operations through the acquisition of a target business. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses is limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Further, our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. 

&#160; 

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities with a business objective similar to ours to acquire a target business on favorable terms. 

&#160; 

If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. Many of our target business&#8217; competitors are likely to be significantly larger and have far greater financial and other resources than we will. Some of these competitors may be divisions or subsidiaries of large, diversified companies that have access to financial resources of their respective parent companies. Our target business may not be able to compete effectively with these companies or maintain them as customers while competing with them on other projects. In addition, it is likely that our target business will face significant competition from smaller companies that have specialized capabilities in similar areas. We cannot accurately predict how our target business&#8217; competitive position may be affected by changing economic conditions, customer requirements or technical developments. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources to compete effectively. 

&#160; 

Acquisition Structure 

&#160; 

It is impossible to predict the manner in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity. Specific business opportunities will be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity and, upon the basis of that review and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters, the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable will be selected. Such structure may include, but is not limited to leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures and other contractual arrangements. The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with other corporations or forms of business organization, and although it is likely, there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, the present management, board of directors and stockholders of the Company most likely will not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Company&#8217;s existing management and directors may resign and new management and directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders. 

&#160; 

It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of Common Stock or other securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called &#8220;tax free&#8221; reorganization under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, depends upon the issuance to the stockholders of the acquired company of a controlling interest (i.e. 80% or more) of the common stock of the combined entities immediately following the reorganization. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other &#8220;tax free&#8221; provisions provided under the Internal Revenue Code, the Company&#8217;s current stockholders would retain in the aggregate 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. This could result in substantial additional dilution in the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization. Any such issuance of additional shares might also be done simultaneously with a sale or transfer of shares representing a controlling interest in the Company by the principal shareholders. The Company does not intend to supply disclosure to shareholders concerning a target company prior to the consummation of a business combination transaction, unless required by applicable law or regulation. In the event a proposed business combination involves a change in majority of directors of the Company, the Company will file and provide to shareholders a Schedule 14F-1, which shall include, information concerning the target company, as required. The Company will file a current report on Form 8-K, as required, within four business days of a business combination which results in the Company ceasing to be a shell company. This Form 8-K will include complete disclosure of the target company, including audited financial statements. 

&#160; 

It is anticipated that any new securities issued in any reorganization would be issued in reliance upon exemptions, if any are available, from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of the transaction, the Company may agree to register such securities either at the time the transaction is consummated, or under certain conditions or at specified times thereafter. The issuance of substantial additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market that might develop in the Company&#8217;s securities may have a depressive effect upon such market. 

&#160; 

The present majority stockholder of the Company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting securities of the Registrant following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, the Registrant's sole director may resign and one or more new directors may be appointed by our majority stockholder. 

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the sole determination of management with the consent of our majority stockholder. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders' meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require stockholder approval. 

&#160; 

The Company will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of a written agreement. Although the terms of such agreement cannot be predicted, generally such an agreement would require specific representations and warranties by all of the parties thereto, specify certain events of default, detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by each of the parties thereto prior to such closing, outline the manner of bearing costs if the transaction is not closed, set forth remedies upon default, and include miscellaneous other terms normally found in an agreement of that type. 

&#160; 

It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Moreover, because many providers of goods and services require compensation at the time or soon after the goods and services are provided, the inability of the Company to pay until an indeterminate future time may make it impossible to procure such goods and services. 

&#160; 

The Company intends to search for a target for a business combination by contacting various sources including, but not limited to, our affiliates, lenders, investment banking firms, private equity funds, consultants and attorneys. The approximate number of persons or entities that will be contacted is unknown and dependent on whether any opportunities are presented by the sources that we contact. It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Registrant of the related costs incurred. 

&#160; 

We presently have no employees apart from our management. Our sole officer and director is engaged in outside business activities. Our sole officer and director anticipates that he will devote very limited time to our business until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. The specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company may vary from week to week or even day to day, and therefore the specific amount of time that management will devote to the Company on a weekly basis cannot be ascertained with any level of certainty. In all cases, management intends to spend as much time as is necessary to exercise its fiduciary duties as officer and director of the Company. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.

Investment Company Act and Other Regulations 

&#160; 

The Company may participate in a business opportunity by purchasing, trading or selling the securities of such business. The Company does not, however, intend to engage primarily in such activities. Specifically, the Company intends to conduct its activities so as to avoid being classified as an &#8220;investment company&#8221; under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the &#8220;Investment Act&#8221;), and therefore to avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 

&#160; 

Section 3(a) of the Investment Act contains the definition of an &#8220;investment company,&#8221; and it excludes any entity that does not engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, or that does not engage in the business of investing, owning, holding or trading &#8220;investment securities&#8221; (defined as &#8220;all securities other than government securities or securities of majority-owned subsidiaries&#8221;) the value of which exceeds 40% of the value of its total assets (excluding government securities, cash or cash items). The Company intends to implement its business plan in a manner which will result in the availability of this exception from the definition of &#8220;Investment Company.&#8221; Consequently, the Company&#8217;s participation in a business or opportunity through the purchase and sale of investment securities will be limited. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s plan of business may involve changes in its capital structure, management, control and business, especially if it consummates a reorganization as discussed above. Each of these areas is regulated by the Investment Act, in order to protect purchasers of investment company securities. Since the Company will not register as an investment company, stockholders will not be afforded these protections. 

&#160; 

Any securities which the Company might acquire in exchange for its Common Stock are expected to be &#8220;restricted securities&#8221; within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220;Act&#8221;). If the Company elects to resell such securities, such sale cannot proceed unless a registration statement has been declared effective by the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission or an exemption from registration is available. Section 4(1) of the Act, which exempts sales of securities not involving a distribution, would in all likelihood be available to permit a private sale. Although the plan of operation does not contemplate resale of securities acquired, if such a sale were to be necessary, the Company would be required to comply with the provisions of the Act to effect such resale. 

&#160; 

An acquisition made by the Company may be in an industry which is regulated or licensed by federal, state or local authorities. Compliance with such regulations can be expected to be a time-consuming and expensive process.
