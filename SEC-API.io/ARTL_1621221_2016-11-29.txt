Status of Publicly Announced New Products or Services 

&#160;

&#160;

Competitive Business Conditions and Strategy; Knight Knox Development Corp.'s Position in the Industry 

&#160;

Barrier to entry in the industry is extremely low and there are many competitors. Knight Knox intends to establish itself as a competitive company in the online advertising and auction of products and services. Knight Knox's main competitors will be firms offering similar products. Some of the online companies already established are: www.vivastreet.ie and www.locanto.ie. Other companies such as eBay and Amazon have significant presence in our potential marketplace, and may pose as serious competitors.

&#160;

As a new company compared to some of our competitors, they may have greater financial and marketing resources than do we and they may have a greater advantage to negotiate better discounts as they have been around longer. There are no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful.

&#160;

Talent Sources and Names of Principal Suppliers 

&#160;

Knight Knox has hired an independent contractor to design and develop our website, and as well we will hire an independent contractor to do our marketing and advertising of our website. There is no contract in place with the independent contractor for the development of the website, and the Company will be quoted as work is requested and invoiced when completed. 

&#160;

Dependence on one or a few major Customers 

&#160;

Knight Knox Development Corp. will be dependent on the website, social media and google adwords for finding customers. Currently we have not yet acquired any customers since our website is not yet fully developed and operational and we have yet to begin any advertising and marketing.

&#160;

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Agreements or Contracts 

&#160;

There are no aspects of our business plan which require a patent, trademark, or product license. We have entered into one vendor agreement and have not entered into any other agreements of contracts that give or could give rise to any obligations or concessions.

&#160;

Governmental Controls, Approval and Licensing Requirements 

&#160;

We are not aware of any governmental regulations which would currently be material to our operations.

&#160;

Research and Development Activities and Costs 

&#160;

We have spent no time on specialized research and development activities, and have no plans to undertake any research or development in the future.

&#160;

Number of Employees 

&#160;

Knight Knox Development Corp. has no employees. The sole officer and director is donating his time to the development of the company, and intends to do whatever work is necessary in order to bring us to the point of earning revenues. We estimate that he will be able to complete his required work and complete whatever work is necessary by spending 20 hours per week without lending the Company additional funds. If this is not the case and additional time and funds will be require then he is willing to commit additional time funds although he has no commitment or contractual obligation to do so. We have no other employees, and do not foresee hiring any additional employees in the near future. We will be engaging independent contractors to design and develop our website and manage our internet marketing efforts.

&#160;

Plan of Operation 

&#160;

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Except for the historical information contained herein, the discussion in this Prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Form 10-K should be read as being applicable to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Form 10-K. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those discussed here.

&#160;

Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay for our expenses. This is because we have generated limited revenues and have limited operating history. There is no assurance we will ever reach this point. Accordingly, we must raise sufficient capital from sources. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others. We must raise cash to stay in business. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.

&#160;

Knight Knox has limited operations, limited revenue, limited financial backing and limited assets. Our plan is to operate a fully functional auction site where customers can register for an account and sell and purchase goods and services.

&#160;

We are a public entity, subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, we will incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements. We estimate that these accounting, legal and other professional costs would be a minimum of $15,000 in the next year and will be higher, in the following years, if our business volume and activity increases. Increased business activity could greatly increase our professional fees for reporting requirements and this could have a significant impact on future operating costs. The difference between having the ability to sustain our cash flow requirements over the next twelve months and the need for additional outside funding will depend on how fast we can generate sales revenue.

&#160;

At present, we only have enough cash on hand to cover our regulatory reporting costs for the next 12 months. In order to proceed with our business plan, we will have to find alternative sources of funds, like a second public offering, a private placement of securities, or loans from our officers or third parties (such as banks or other institutional lenders). Equity financing could result in additional dilution to then existing shareholders. If we are unable to meet our needs for cash from either money that we raise from our equity, or possible alternative sources, then we may be unable to continue to maintain, develop or expand our operations.
