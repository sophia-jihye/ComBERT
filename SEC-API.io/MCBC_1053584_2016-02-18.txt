 ITEM 1: Business. 

As used in this report, the terms "we," "us," "our&#8221; and &#8220;Company&#8221; mean Macatawa Bank Corporation and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates another meaning. The term "Bank" means Macatawa Bank.

Overview

Macatawa Bank Corporation is a Michigan corporation and a registered bank holding company. The Company was incorporated in 1997. Our business is concentrated in a single industry segment - commercial banking. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Macatawa Bank, we offer a full range of commercial and personal banking services, including checking, savings and certificates of deposit accounts, cash management, safe deposit boxes, trust services and commercial, mortgage and consumer loans through our twenty-six branch offices and a lending and operation service facility in Ottawa County, Kent County and northern Allegan County, Michigan. Other services we offer include ATMs, internet banking, telephone banking and debit cards. The Bank provides various brokerage services, including discount brokerage through Infinex, personal financial planning and consultation regarding mutual funds.

At December 31, 2015, we had total assets of $1.73 billion, total loans of $1.20 billion, total deposits of $1.44 billion and shareholders&#8217; equity of $152.0 million. We recognized net income of $12.8 million in 2015, our fifth straight full year of profitability post recession. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, our interest income accounted for approximately 74%, 74% and 75%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenue and our noninterest income accounted for approximately 26%, 26% and 25%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenue. For additional information about our financial condition and results of operations, see our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.

In response to our losses during 2008, 2009 and early 2010, our Board of Directors implemented additional corporate governance practices and disciplined business and banking principles, including more conservative lending principles. These and other efforts were reflected in our results of operations for the past five years with lower levels of charge-offs and provisions for loan losses, reductions in operating expenses and reductions in balance sheet totals resulting in improvement in our regulatory capital and liquidity ratios. We successfully completed our shareholder rights offering and public offering of common stock in June 2011 resulting in net proceeds of $20.3 million. As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s and the Bank&#8217;s risk-based regulatory capital ratios were significantly above those required under the regulatory standards and the Bank continued to be categorized as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; at December 31, 2015.

During 2013, the Company improved its capital structure by prepaying and redeeming its $1.7 million of 11% unsecured subordinated debt, resuming interest payments on its trust preferred securities and completing an exchange of all of the Company&#8217;s Series A and Series B Preferred Stock for Company common stock and cash, at the election of the holder. Each of these transactions are discussed in detail in Item 7 and in our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report.

Within the past five years, much progress has been made at reducing our nonperforming assets. The following table reflects period end balances of these nonperforming assets as well as total loan delinquencies over the past five years.

Earnings in recent years have been impacted by high costs associated with administration and disposition of nonperforming assets. These costs, including losses on repossessed and foreclosed properties were $3.0 million, $3.1 million and $5.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During 2015, we added $2.5 million in other real estate and sold $11.6 million, allowing for a another year of meaningful reduction in our year-end balance. We sold our largest remaining individual other real estate property late in the fourth quarter of 2015, recognizing a loss of $1.1 million. Even with this large realized loss, our nonperforming asset costs declined slightly in 2015 compared to 2014. Going forward, as further reductions in nonperforming assets are accomplished, we expect the costs associated with these assets to continue to decline thereby allowing for improved earnings in future periods.

Our earnings in 2015, 2014 and 2013 were favorably impacted by a negative provision for loan losses of $3.5 million, $3.4 million and $4.3 million, respectively. As discussed in detail later in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Allowance for Loan Losses", the large negative provision in 2015 was primarily a result of the reversal of a portion of a specific reserve on an individual credit that was upgraded to accruing status in the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as net loan recoveries for the year. The negative provision in each period was also impacted by other recoveries from our collection efforts and a continual decline in our historical charge-off levels from prior years. We do not expect a similar level of negative provision for loan losses in 2016.

During the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, the State of Michigan entered into a recession earlier than the rest of the country and experienced heavy job loss as a result of the concentration the state has related to the automotive industry. Our market areas of Grand Rapids and Holland fared better than the state as a whole, but nevertheless the impact of our local economy on our results was profound. The recession and job loss impacted housing values, commercial real estate values and consumer activity. Improvement has been evident during the past several years. The state&#8217;s unemployment rate at the end of 2015 was 5.1%, down dramatically from 15.2% in June 2009. The Grand Rapids and Holland area unemployment rate was 3.0% at the end of 2015. Residential housing values and commercial real estate property values decreased significantly during the recession, but have shown signs of stabilization, with some of our newer appraisals tending to reflect values at or above prior year values.

It also appears that the housing market in our primary market area has stabilized and is now improving. In the Grand Rapids market during 2015, there were 10% more living unit starts than in 2014. Similarly, in the Holland-Grand Haven/Lakeshore region, there were 11% more living unit starts in 2015 than in 2014. These improvements are on top of improved results in 2014 over 2013. Also, these markets are now also seeing significant activity in duplex, condominium and apartment starts after years of virtually no activity.

In years immediately following the recession, we have diversified our loan portfolio structure by de-emphasizing commercial real estate loans. However, in 2014, we began cautiously increasing commercial real estate loans along with commercial and industrial loans, residential mortgages and other consumer loans. Commercial real estate loans have increased from $472.3 million at December 31, 2013 to $490.5 million at December 31, 2014 and $508.7 million at December 31, 2015. Commercial and industrial loans have increased from $274.1 million at December 31, 2013 to $327.7 million at December 31, 2014 and $377.3 million at December 31, 2015. Consumer loans have increased from $295.9 million at December 31, 2013 totaling $300.3 million at December 31, 2014 and $312.0 million at December 31, 2015. With our improved financial condition, successful capital raise in 2011, and retained earnings growth, our focus has shifted to high quality loan portfolio growth. We experienced strong commercial loan growth in the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015 and believe we are positioned for continued growth in 2016.

We have no material foreign loans, assets or activities. No material part of our business is dependent on a single customer or very few customers. Our loan portfolio is not concentrated in any one industry.

Products and Services

Loan Portfolio

We have historically offered a broad range of loan products to business customers, including commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans, and to retail customers, including residential mortgage and consumer loans. Given current soft economic conditions, new commercial loan origination activity has been lower than it was before the recession of 2008-2009. However, select, well-managed loan renewal activity is taking place and we are seeing growth in our commercial and consumer loan portfolios and pipelines. Following is a discussion of our various types of lending activities.

Commercial and Industrial Loans

Our commercial and industrial lending portfolio contains loans with a variety of purposes and security, including loans to finance operations and equipment. Generally, our commercial and industrial lending has been limited to borrowers headquartered, or doing business, in our primary market area. These credit relationships typically require the satisfaction of appropriate loan covenants and debt formulas, and generally require that the Bank be the primary depository bank of the business. These loan covenants and debt formulas are monitored through periodic, required reporting of accounts receivable aging schedules and financial statements, and in the case of larger business operations, reviews or audits by independent professional firms.

Commercial and industrial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower's ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower's business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and economic conditions. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.

Commercial Real Estate Loans

Our commercial real estate loans consist primarily of construction and development loans and multi-family and other non-residential real estate loans.

Construction and Development Loans. &#160; These consist of construction loans to commercial customers for the construction of their business facilities. They also include construction loans to builders and developers for the construction of one- to four-family residences and the development of one- to four-family lots, residential subdivisions, condominium developments and other commercial developments.

This portfolio was particularly adversely affected by job losses, declines in real estate value, declines in home sale volumes, and declines in new home building in 2008 and 2009. Declining real estate values resulted in sharp increases in losses, particularly in the land development and construction loan portfolios to residential developers. During the past several years, we made a significant effort to reduce exposure to residential land development and other construction and development loans.

Multi-Family and Other Non-Residential Real Estate Loans. &#160; These are permanent loans secured by multi-family and other non-residential real estate and include loans secured by apartment buildings, condominiums, small office buildings, small business facilities, medical facilities and other non-residential building properties, substantially all of which are located within our primary market area.

Multi-family and other non-residential real estate loans generally present a higher level of risk than loans secured by owner occupied one- to four-family residences. This greater risk is due to several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the effects of general economic conditions on income producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. Furthermore, the repayment of these loans is typically dependent upon the successful operation of the related real estate project. For example, if leases are not obtained or renewed, or a bankruptcy court modifies a lease term, or a major tenant is unable to fulfill its lease obligations, cash flow from the project will be reduced. If cash flow from the project is reduced, the borrower's ability to repay the loan may be impaired.

Retail Loans

Our retail loans are loans to consumers and consist primarily of residential mortgage loans and consumer loans.

Residential Mortgage Loans. &#160; We originate construction loans to individuals for the construction of their residences and owner-occupied residential mortgage loans, which are generally long-term with either fixed or adjustable interest rates. Our general policy is to sell the majority of our fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market due primarily to the interest rate risk associated with these loans.

&#160;

During the past three years, in an effort to further diversify our loan concentrations, we increased our targeted retention of residential mortgage loans, resulting in a $19.7 million increase in balances held in portfolio at December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. For 2015, we retained loans representing 46% of the total dollar volume originated, compared to 39% in 2014.

Our borrowers generally qualify and are underwritten using industry standards for quality residential mortgage loans. We do not originate loans that are considered "sub-prime". Residential mortgage loan originations derive from a number of sources, including advertising, direct solicitation, real estate broker referrals, existing borrowers and depositors, builders and walk-in customers. Loan applications are accepted at most of our offices and online. The substantial majority of these loans are secured by one-to-four family properties in our market area.

Consumer Loans. &#160; We originate a variety of different types of consumer loans, including automobile loans, home equity lines of credit and installment loans, home improvement loans, deposit account loans and other loans for household and personal purposes. We also originate home equity lines of credit utilizing the same underwriting standards as for home equity installment loans. Home equity lines of credit are revolving line of credit loans. The majority of our existing home equity line of credit portfolio has variable rates with floors and ceilings, interest only payments and a maximum maturity of ten years.

The underwriting standards that we employ for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's payment history on other debts and ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. Although creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the security, if any, in relation to the proposed loan amount. Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than do residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans which are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In such cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance as a result of the greater likelihood of damage, loss or depreciation. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability, and are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. Furthermore, the application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.

Nonperforming Assets

Interest income totaling $3.6 million was recorded in 2015 on loans that were on a non-accrual status or classified as restructured as of December 31, 2015. Additional interest income of $546,000 would have been recorded during 2015 on these loans had they been current in accordance with their original terms. More information about the levels of nonperforming loan balances in 2011 through 2015 and our policy for placing loans on non-accrual status may be found in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Portfolio Loans and Asset Quality" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition."

Loans at December 31, 2015 that were classified as substandard or worse per our internal risk rating system that would cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms are discussed in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Portfolio Loans and Asset Quality" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition." At December 31, 2015, there were no other interest-bearing assets that would be required to be disclosed under Industry Guide 3, Item III, C. 1. or 2. if such assets were loans.

Loan Loss Experience

A summary of our loan balances at the end of 2011 through 2015 and the daily average balances of these loans as well as changes in the allowance for loan losses arising from loans charged-off and recoveries on loans previously charged-off, and additions to the allowance which we have expensed is shown in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality" included in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition."

Additional information about our allowance for loan losses, including a table showing the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the end of 2011 through 2015 and the factors which influenced management&#8217;s judgment in determining the amount of the additions to the allowance charged to operating expense, may be found in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Allowance for Loan Losses" in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition."

Deposit Portfolio

We offer a broad range of deposit services, including checking accounts, savings accounts and time deposits of various types. Transaction accounts and savings and time certificates are tailored to the principal market area at rates competitive with those offered in the area. All deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC up to the maximum amount permitted by law.

We solicit deposit services from individuals, businesses, associations, churches, nonprofit organizations, financial institutions and government authorities. Deposits are gathered primarily from the communities we serve through our network of 26 branches. We offer business and consumer checking accounts, regular and money market savings accounts, and certificates of deposit with many term options. We operate in a competitive environment, competing with other local banks similar in size and with significantly larger regional banks. We monitor rates at other financial institutions in the area to ascertain that our rates are competitive with the market. We also attempt to offer a wide variety of products to meet the needs of our customers. We set our deposit pricing to be competitive with other banks in our market area.

We may utilize alternative funding sources as needed, including short-term borrowings, advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis or the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, securities sold under agreements to repurchase ("repo borrowings") and brokered deposits. The Bank has not accepted or renewed brokered deposits since November of 2008. We had no brokered deposits at December 31, 2015 or 2014.

Securities Portfolio

Our securities portfolio is classified as either "available for sale" or "held to maturity." Securities classified as "available for sale" may be sold prior to maturity due to changes in interest rates, prepayment risks, and availability of alternative investments, or to meet our liquidity needs.

The primary objective of our investing activities is to provide for the safety of the principal invested. Our secondary considerations include the maximization of earnings, liquidity and to help decrease our overall exposure to changes in interest rates. We have generally invested in bonds with lower credit risk, primarily those secured by government agencies or insured municipalities, to assist in the diversification of credit risk within our asset base. We have not experienced any credit losses within our investment portfolio.

Market Area

Our primary market area includes Ottawa, Kent and northern Allegan Counties, all located in western Michigan. This area includes two mid-sized cities, Grand Rapids and Holland, and rural areas. Grand Rapids is the second largest city in Michigan. Holland is the largest city in Ottawa County. Both cities and surrounding areas have a solid and diverse economic base, which includes health and life sciences, tourism, office and home furniture, automotive components and assemblies, pharmaceutical, transportation, equipment, food and construction supplies. Grand Valley State University, a 25,000-student regional university with nearly 2,000 employees, has its three main campuses in our market area. GVSU and several smaller colleges and university affiliates located in our market area help stabilize the local economy because they are not as sensitive to the fluctuations of the broader economy. Companies operating in the market area include the Van Andel Institute, Steelcase, Herman Miller, Alticor, Gentex, Spectrum Health, Haworth, Wolverine World Wide, Johnson Controls, General Motors, Gerber, Magna, SpartanNash and Meijer.

Competition

There are many bank, thrift, credit union and other financial institution offices located within our market area. Most are branches of larger financial institutions. We also face competition from finance companies, insurance companies, mortgage companies, securities brokerage firms, money market funds and other providers of financial services. Many of our competitors have been in business a number of years, have established customer bases, are larger and have higher lending limits than we do. We compete for loans, deposits and other financial services based on our ability to communicate effectively with our customers, to understand and meet their needs and to provide high quality customer service. Our management believes that our personal service philosophy, our local decision-making and diverse delivery channels enhances our ability to compete favorably in attracting individuals and small businesses. We actively solicit customers by offering our customers personal attention, professional service, and competitive interest rates.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had 342 full-time equivalent employees consisting of 303 full-time and 82 part-time employees. We have assembled a staff of experienced, dedicated and qualified professionals whose goal is to meet the financial needs of our customers while providing outstanding service. The majority of our management team has at least 10 years of banking experience, and several key personnel have more than 20 years of banking experience. None of our employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements with us.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

The following is a summary of statutes and regulations affecting Macatawa Bank Corporation and Macatawa Bank. A change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on us and our business.

General

Financial institutions and their holding companies are extensively regulated under federal and state law. Consequently, our growth and earnings performance can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the statutes administered by, and the regulations and policies of, various governmental regulatory authorities. Those authorities include, but are not limited to, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board"), the FDIC, the State of Michigan&#8217;s DIFS, the Internal Revenue Service, and state taxing authorities. The effect of such statutes, regulations and policies can be significant, and cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty.

Federal and state laws and regulations generally applicable to financial institutions and their holding companies regulate, among other things, the scope of business, investments, reserves against deposits, capital levels relative to operations, lending activities and practices, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, mergers, consolidations and declaration and payment of dividends. The system of supervision and regulation applicable to us and our bank establishes a comprehensive framework for our respective operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC's deposit insurance fund, our depositors, and the public, rather than our shareholders.

Federal law and regulations establish supervisory standards applicable to our lending activities, including internal controls, credit underwriting, loan documentation and loan-to-value ratios for loans secured by real property.

Recent Developments

Dodd-Frank Act: The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), and requires the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. The CFPB has issued significant new regulations that impact consumer mortgage lending and servicing. Those regulations became effective in January 2014. In addition, the CFPB issued new regulations that changed the disclosure requirements and forms used under the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement and Procedures Act effective October 3, 2015. Compliance with these new laws and regulations and other regulations under consideration by the CFPB will likely result in additional costs, which could be significant and could adversely impact the Company's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing: The Federal Reserve Board in June 2011 issued a rule to implement a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that requires it to set debit-card interchange fees so they are "reasonable and proportional" in relation to the cost of the transaction incurred by the card issuer. The rule could result in a significant reduction in banks' debit-card interchange revenue. Though the rule technically does not apply to institutions with less than $10 billion, there is concern that the price controls will harm community banks, such as Macatawa Bank, which will be pressured by the marketplace to lower their own interchange rates.

BASEL III: &#160; On July 3, 2013, the FDIC Board of Directors approved the Regulatory Capital Interim Final Rule, implementing Basel III. This rule redefines Tier 1 capital as two components (Common Equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1), creates a new capital ratio (Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-based Capital Ratio) and implements a capital conservation buffer. It also revises the prompt corrective action thresholds and makes changes to risk weights for certain assets and off-balance-sheet exposures. Banks were required to transition into the new rule beginning on January 1, 2015.

Macatawa Bank Corporation

General . Macatawa Bank Corporation is registered with, and subject to regulation by, the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHCA"). Under the BHCA, Macatawa Bank Corporation is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board periodic reports of our operations and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require.

In accordance with Federal Reserve Board policy, Macatawa Bank Corporation is expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank. In addition, if the DIFS deems the Bank's capital to be impaired, the DIFS may require the Bank to restore its capital by a special assessment upon Macatawa Bank Corporation as the Bank's sole shareholder. If Macatawa Bank Corporation were to fail to pay any such assessment, the directors of the Bank would be required, under Michigan law, to sell the shares of the Bank's stock owned by Macatawa Bank Corporation to the highest bidder at either a public or private auction and use the proceeds of the sale to restore the Bank's capital.

Investments and Activities . In general, any direct or indirect acquisition by us of any voting shares of any bank which would result in our direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares of such bank, and any merger or consolidation between us and another financial holding company or bank holding company, will require the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA.

The merger or consolidation of the Bank with another bank, or the acquisition by the Bank of assets of another bank, or the assumption of liability by the Bank to pay any deposits of another bank, will require the prior written approval of the responsible federal depository institution regulatory agency under the Bank Merger Act. In addition, in certain such cases, an application to, and the prior approval of, the Federal Reserve Board under the BHCA or the OFIR under the Michigan Banking Code, may be required.

Capital Requirements . The Federal Reserve Board uses capital adequacy guidelines in its examination and regulation of bank holding companies. If capital falls below minimum guidelines, a bank holding company may, among other items, be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses.

Additional information on our capital ratios may be found in Item 7 of this report under the heading "Capital Resources" included in "Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition" and in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference.

Dividends . Macatawa Bank Corporation is a corporation separate and distinct from the Bank. Most of our revenues are dividends paid by the Bank. Thus, Macatawa Bank Corporation's ability to pay dividends to our shareholders is indirectly limited by restrictions on the Bank's ability to pay dividends described below. Further, in a policy statement, the Federal Reserve Board has expressed its view that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends if its net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, its prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or it will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve Board also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. Similar enforcement powers over our bank are possessed by the FDIC. The "prompt corrective action" provisions of federal law and regulation authorizes the FDIC to restrict the payment of dividends to Macatawa Bank Corporation by our bank if it fails to meet specified capital levels.

In addition, the Michigan Business Corporation Act provides that dividends may be legally declared or paid only if after the distribution a corporation can pay its debts as they come due in the usual course of business and its total assets equal or exceed the sum of its liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of any holders of preferred stock whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.

Additional information about restrictions on the payment of dividends by the Bank may be found in Item 8 of this report in Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and is here incorporated by reference.

Federal Securities Regulation. &#160; Our common stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). We are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act. We are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which imposes numerous reporting, accounting, corporate governance and business practices on companies, as well as financial and other professionals who have involvement with the U.S. public markets. We are generally subject to these requirements and applicable SEC rules and regulations.

Macatawa Bank

General . Macatawa Bank is a Michigan banking corporation, and its deposit accounts are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (the "DIF") of the FDIC. As a DIF-insured Michigan-chartered bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the DIFS, as the chartering authority for Michigan banks, and the FDIC, as administrator of the DIF. These agencies, and the federal and state laws applicable to the Bank and its operations, extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business, including, among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and on deposits, the maintenance of noninterest bearing reserves on deposit accounts, and the safety and soundness of banking practices.

Deposit Insurance . As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system under which all insured depository institutions are placed into one of four categories and assessed insurance premiums, based upon their respective levels of capital and results of supervisory evaluation. Institutions categorized as well-capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and considered healthy pay the lowest premium, while institutions that are categorized as less than adequately capitalized (as defined by the FDIC) and considered of substantial supervisory concern pay the highest premium. Risk classification of all insured institutions is made by the FDIC for each semi-annual assessment period.

The FDIC&#8217;s deposit insurance assessment base methodology uses average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity as the assessment base. Under this calculation, most well capitalized banks will pay 5 to 9 basis points annually, increasing up to 35 basis points for banks that pose significant supervisory concerns. This base rate may be adjusted for the level of unsecured debt and brokered deposits, resulting in adjusted rates ranging from 2.5 to 9 basis points annually for most well capitalized banks to 30 to 45 basis points for banks that pose significant supervisory concerns. We estimate our annual assessment rate to be 8 basis points in 2016.

FICO Assessments. &#160; The Bank, as a member of the DIF, is subject to assessments to cover the payments on outstanding obligations of the Financing Corporation ("FICO"). From now until the maturity of the outstanding FICO obligations in 2019, DIF members will share the cost of the interest on the FICO bonds on a pro rata basis. It is estimated that FICO assessments during this period will be less than 0.025% of deposits.

Capital Requirements . The FDIC has established the following minimum capital standards for FDIC insured banks: a leverage requirement consisting of a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total average assets and risk-based capital requirements consisting of a ratio of total capital to total risk-weighted assets, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to total risk-weighted assets, and a ratio of common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital to risk weighted assets. Tier 1 capital consists principally of shareholders' equity. Common equity Tier 1 capital excludes forms of stock that are not common stock.

Federal regulations define these capital categories as follows:

&#160;

&#160; CET1 Risk-Based

Capital Ratio 

Tier 1 Risk-Based

Capital Ratio 

Total Risk-Based

Capital Ratio 

&#160;

Leverage Ratio 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Well capitalized

6.5% or above

6% or above

10% or above

5% or above

Adequately capitalized

4.5% or above

4% or above

8% or above

4% or above

Undercapitalized

Less than 4.5%

Less than 4%

Less than 8%

Less than 4%

Significantly undercapitalized

Less than 3%

Less than 3%

Less than 6%

Less than 3%

Critically undercapitalized

&#160;--

&#160;--

&#160;--

Ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 2% or less

Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators' corrective powers include: requiring the submission of a capital restoration plan; placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities; requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to be acquired; restricting transactions with affiliates; restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits; ordering a new election of directors of the institution; requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution.

In general, a depository institution may be reclassified to a lower category than is indicated by its capital levels if the appropriate federal depository institution regulatory agency determines the institution to be otherwise in an unsafe or unsound condition or to be engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice. This could include a failure by the institution, following receipt of a less-than-satisfactory rating on its most recent examination report, to correct the deficiency.

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank was categorized as &#8220;well capitalized&#8221;. &#160; Additional information on our capital ratios may be found in Item 8 of this report in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference.

Dividends . Under Michigan law, the Bank is restricted as to the maximum amount of dividends it may pay on its common stock. The Bank may not pay dividends except out of net income after deducting its losses and bad debts. A Michigan state bank may not declare or pay a dividend unless the bank will have surplus amounting to at least 20% of its capital after the payment of the dividend.

Federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. The FDIC may prevent an insured bank from paying dividends if the bank is in default of payment of any assessment due to the FDIC. In addition, the FDIC may prohibit the payment of dividends by our bank, if such payment is determined to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

Additional information about restrictions on payment of dividends by the Bank may be found in Item 8 of this report in Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and is here incorporated by reference.

Insider Transactions . The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit to Macatawa or any subsidiary of Macatawa, on investments in the stock or other securities of Macatawa or any subsidiary of Macatawa and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of Macatawa or any subsidiary of Macatawa as collateral for loans. Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by our bank to its directors and officers, to Macatawa's directors and officers, to our principal shareholders and to "related interests" of such directors, officers and principal shareholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person becoming a director or officer of our company or any subsidiary or a principal shareholder in our company may obtain credit from banks with which our bank maintains a correspondent relationship.

Safety and Soundness Standards . The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines to promote the safety and soundness of federally insured depository institutions. These guidelines establish standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.

Investments and Other Activities . Under federal law and FDIC regulations, FDIC insured state banks are prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from making or retaining equity investments of a type, or in an amount, that are not permissible for a national bank. Federal law, as implemented by FDIC regulations, also prohibits FDIC insured state banks and their subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, from engaging as principal in any activity that is not permitted for a national bank or its subsidiary, respectively, unless the bank meets, and continues to meet, its minimum regulatory capital requirements and the FDIC determines the activity would not pose a significant risk to the DIF. Impermissible investments and activities must be divested or discontinued within certain time frames set by the FDIC in accordance with federal law.

Consumer Protection Laws . The Bank's business includes making a variety of types of loans to individuals. In making these loans, we are subject to state usury and regulatory laws and to various federal laws and regulations, including the privacy of consumer financial information provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which prohibit discrimination, specify disclosures to be made to borrowers regarding credit and settlement costs, and regulate the mortgage loan servicing activities of the Bank, including the maintenance and operation of escrow accounts and the transfer of mortgage loan servicing. In receiving deposits, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation under state and federal law and regulations, including the Truth in Savings Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Violation of these laws could result in the imposition of significant damages and fines upon the Bank and its directors and officers.

Branching Authority. &#160; Michigan banks have the authority under Michigan law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Michigan, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Banks may establish interstate branch networks through acquisitions of other banks. The establishment of de novo interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) is allowed only if specifically authorized by state law.

Michigan law permits both U.S. and non-U.S. banks to establish branch offices in Michigan. The Michigan Banking Code permits, in appropriate circumstances and with the approval of DIFS, (1) acquisition of Michigan banks by FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states, (2) sale by a Michigan bank of branches to an FDIC-insured bank, savings bank or savings and loan association located in a state in which a Michigan bank could purchase branches of the purchasing entity, (3) consolidation of Michigan banks and FDIC-insured banks, savings banks or savings and loan associations located in other states having laws permitting such consolidation, (4) establishment of branches in Michigan by FDIC-insured banks located in other states, the District of Columbia or U.S. territories or protectorates having laws permitting a Michigan bank to establish a branch in such jurisdiction, and (5) establishment by foreign banks of branches located in Michigan. A Michigan bank holding company may acquire a non-Michigan bank and a non-Michigan bank holding company may acquire a Michigan bank.
