 Item 1 - Business Overview 

Turtle Beach Corporation, headquartered in San Diego, California and incorporated in the state of Nevada in 2010, is a premier audio technology company with expertise and experience in developing, commercializing and marketing innovative products across a range of large addressable markets under the Turtle Beach&#174; and HyperSound&#174; brands. Turtle Beach is a worldwide leading provider of feature-rich headset solutions for use across multiple platforms, including video game and entertainment consoles, handheld consoles, personal computers, tablets and mobile devices. HyperSound technology is an innovative patent-protected sound technology that delivers immersive, directional audio offering unique potential benefits in a variety of commercial settings and consumer devices, including improved clarity and comprehension for listeners with hearing loss. 

VTB Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;VTBH&#8221;), the parent holding company of the historical headset business, was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2010 with operations principally located in Valhalla, New York. Voyetra Turtle Beach, Inc. (&#8220;VTB&#8221;) was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1975. 

The Company's stock is traded on NASDAQ under the symbol HEAR. 

Headset Business 

Turtle Beach launched its first gaming headset in 2005 and has grown to be the leading brand in gaming audio, and designs and markets premium audio peripherals for video game consoles, personal computers and mobile devices, including headsets for PlayStation&#174;4 consoles and officially-licensed headsets for the Xbox One consoles. Turtle Beach branded headsets are distributed internationally across North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and Asia, and sold at thousands of storefronts, including major retailers such as Amazon, Argos, Best Buy, GameStop, HMV, Sainsbury, Target, Tesco and Walmart. 

We offer a variety of headsets, spanning multiple wired and wireless retail price points ranging from $25 to $300 and have offerings across all major gaming platforms. Our price tiers correspond to customer profiles, beginning with &#8220;Entry-Level&#8221; gamers and progressing through &#8220;Casual,&#8221; &#8220;Enthusiast&#8221; and &#8220;Core.&#8221; Each successive price tier incorporates a higher level of finishing, features and technology, progressing from passive mono to amplified stereo, surround sound, and programmable surround sound. Premium headsets have padded leather headbands, accent stitching, and noise-isolating memory foam ear cups. Other features in certain of our premium headsets include removable microphones, breakaway cables and &#8220;charge-and-play&#8221; batteries that allow gamers to continue playing even as they recharge their batteries. As gaming consoles have evolved from dedicated video game platforms to home entertainment hubs, and as mobile devices have become platforms for entertainment, we have continued to evolve our headsets to reflect how content is consumed. 

Each headset model is designed for a &#8220;primary&#8221; platform, such as a specific console or for the PC platform, though many can be used with multiple platforms, and most are compatible with mobile devices. A primary platform and unique packaging often results in the products being represented in the applicable platform area by retailers, increasing the prominence of Turtle Beach products in physical retail locations and online catalogs. 

Turtle Beach was the leading console gaming headset manufacturer in the U.S. with a 42% dollar share of the market, as noted by the January 2016 sales tracking data from The NPD Group, Inc, driven by the top selling 3rd party headset for both the Xbox One and PlayStation&#174;4. 

Our 2015 was highlighted by: 

&#8226; 

Surpassed $1 billion in lifetime global revenue generated from our gaming headset business. 

&#8226; 

Completely transitioned portfolio to new-generation headsets with eight Xbox One and six PlayStation&#174;4 compatible headsets available at retail. 

&#8226; 

Introduced the first true multiplatform headset that works with PlayStation&#174;4, Xbox One, PC, Mac and mobile/tablet devices. 

HyperSound Business 

HyperSound is a pioneering audio solution that provides an effective means of projecting sound in a highly directional manner, without use of large speaker arrays, to a specific location creating a precise audio zone. HyperSound technology's ability to beam, focus and control sound empowers solutions for hearing health care such as home entertainment listening systems/solutions, commercial applications such as digital signage and kiosks and, consumer audio. 

Our products are designed to deliver controlled audible sound along a tightly formed beam. If the listener is standing outside the path of the beam, the sound is barely audible. This delivery mechanism also maintains sonic clarity and 

intelligibility over longer distances than traditional speakers. We believe our technology offers a number of advantages over regular audio speakers, including: 

&#8226; 

ability to create a beam of sound and place it where it is intended 

&#8226; 

ability to deliver a beam of sound over longer distances 

&#8226; 

ability to penetrate other competing ambient sounds to more effectively communicate 

&#8226; 

ability to directly deliver left and right audio channels to each ear from across the room 

These advantages enable us to create products across a wide variety of applications including: 

&#8226; 

products for individuals with hearing loss that enable better sound clarity without a body-worn device 

&#8226; 

products that create dedicated sound zones for use in retail and commercial environments 

&#8226; 

products that enable headphone-like surround sound without requiring 5 or 7 separate speakers 

HyperSound Clear&#8482; 500P, a medical device launched in November 2015 that received 510(k) clearance permitting over-the-counter (&#8220;OTC&#8221;) commercial distribution from the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), is a first-of-its-kind directed audio solution for individuals with hearing loss that has been shown to improve sound clarity and speech intelligibility for people with hearing loss for a crisp, clear home entertainment listening experience. HyperSound Clear 500P works in parallel with the audio from the television or home theater system, so an individual with hearing loss experiences immersive, 3D audio when sitting in the highly directional, narrow beam of audio, while the room hears audio from the traditional speakers or home theater system at normal volumes. 

In addition the Company has a secondary product that utilizes the technology, HyperSound Professional Audio Solutions, which is being purchased for commercial retail environments where a targeted zone of sound is desired. In the future, the Company expects to introduce additional products including for consumer use outside of individuals with hearing loss. 

Industry Overview 

Gaming Headset Market 

Sales in the gaming accessories market, which includes headsets and other peripherals such as gamepads, specialty controllers, adapters, batteries, memory and interactive gaming toys are heavily dependent on the global video game industry. In 2013, the gaming industry experienced a cyclical event as Microsoft and Sony each announced new consoles for the first time in eight years, and the consumer response to the Xbox One and PlayStation&#174;4 (the &#8220;new generation&#8221; or &#8220;new-gen&#8221; consoles) has been overwhelmingly positive, creating a growing installed base of gamers and a market for new-gen headsets. 

Despite industry analysts' prior expectations that Microsoft and Sony would continue to support their sixth- and seventh-generation of gaming consoles, which include the Xbox 360 and Playstation&#174;3 (the &#8220;old generation&#8221; or &#8220;old-gen&#8221; consoles) over the next few years, in 2015 the market for old generation consoles declined at a more rapid pace than expected. As a result, we anticipate that in 2016, old-gen headsets will take a final, large drop as the market completes the transition to new-gen compatible headsets. 

The May 2015 Intelligence: Worldwide Console Forecast report by DFC Intelligence Forecasts, or &#8220;DFC,&#8221; estimated that cumulative new generation consoles will exceed $65 billion by 2018, and sales tracking data from The NPD Group, Inc. indicated that console gaming headset sales in the U.S. in 2015 were nearly $400 million with the market expected to continue to grow at a steady rate. 

HyperSound Markets 

We are focusing our product development efforts for HyperSound-based products in three areas: health care, commercial and consumer applications. Additionally, we may explore licensing opportunities. 

Hearing Health Care. Gradual hearing loss can affect individuals of all ages, varying from mild to profound and is a growing, widespread issue. In the United States, there are nearly 50 million people with some degree of hearing loss significant enough to require a hearing aid. 

HyperSound technology offers a fundamentally new way to deliver sound, and research indicates that it improves sound clarity and speech intelligibility, particularly for those with hearing loss. We believe that a large percentage of persons with hearing loss may be able to use HyperSound Clear 500P to improve their listening experiences from sources such as TV, CD/DVD players and stereo systems. 

Commercial. We are currently marketing our HyperSound technology to retailers and audio-visual integrators for use in settings where directed audio and sound zones are beneficial, such as digital signage and interactive retail displays. Convenience retailers and fast moving consumer good brands face ever-greater challenges as competition for customers intensifies, and as shoppers increasingly rely on in-store cues. As a result, digital signage is a growing form of direct advertising, capturing an increasing share of advertising spending as restaurants, banks, retail outlets, museums and other outlets and organizations employ commercial displays to communicate with patrons. 

Consumer Applications. Our HyperSound technology has the potential to be developed into consumer products for various applications, including computers, video game consoles, televisions, home theater and home audio. With the advent of flat panel displays for use in televisions and mobile devices, manufacturers have been focused on creating thinner products often at the expense of sound quality. We believe that our ability to create a 3D sound image from two thin emitters, compared to a five- or seven-speaker surround sound set-up using conventional speakers can deliver a compelling and enhanced audio experience. 

Business Strategy 

We intend to build upon the Turtle Beach brand awareness, sophisticated audio technology and high quality products to grow the core console and casual gaming business to increase sales and profitability and as HyperSound&#8217;s healthcare business scales, we will begin to look at other market opportunities for our unique directed audio technology. 

&#8226; 

Console Headset Market Share Growth. &#32;&#32;We have largely completed the transition of our headset portfolio from old generation to new generation with innovative console gaming headsets in every category. We believe that our brand's image among consumers is a competitive advantage and that our success is attributable to our emphasis on delivering the most innovative and advanced headsets. 

To maintain our competitive position in our markets, we are focused on the following: 

&#8226; 

continuing to deliver innovative, high quality console gaming headsets that incorporate advanced audio and wireless technology; 

&#8226; 

growing our gaming headset business in all areas including personal computer headsets; 

&#8226; 

maintaining our strategic relationships that provide our brand a larger presence with consumers and create opportunities for retailers to carry our products; 

&#8226; 

continuing to improve our cost position through increased global sourcing and expanded points of distribution. 

&#8226; 

HyperSound Healthcare Business Growth. We have built the infrastructure to commercialize the HyperSound Clear 500P product for the hearing healthcare audio business, including channel relationships that give us access to 5,600+ prospective hearing health offices and retail locations in the United States. Our goal is to grow a substantial customer base, including internationally, through key channel partners and continued product development. 

&#8226; 

Accelerate International Expansion. We have a strong gaming headset market position in North America, United Kingdom, Germany and Australia, and believe there are additional long-term growth opportunities in Latin America and Asia. In particular in China, where in connection with increased console sales following the Chinese government lifting its ban on video game consoles, we intend to begin our sales efforts of our officially-licensed Xbox One headsets under a Chinese language version of the Turtle Beach brand and logo, phonetically pronounced &#8220;Huan Jing&#8221; (translates as &#8220;Fantasy Space.&#8221;) 

&#8226; 

Expand Our Product Lines. We intend to increase our sales by continuing to develop internally, or through potential acquisitions, products that we offer to our customers. We are investing the resources necessary to maintain and expand our technical capability to manufacture multiple product lines that incorporate the latest technologies. 

Product Development 

We continue to innovate, make improvements to our technology and develop new products, and anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development in the near future. Our product management team takes a disciplined approach to product design that balances iteration, incremental improvement and innovation to achieve a blend of differentiated technology designed to attract customers, maintain product design continuity and exceed expectations as to quality, reliability and profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2015 , we invested $11.6 million &#32;in product development efforts to commercialize the HyperSound Clear 500P product as well as complete our new generation headset portfolio with the 

launch of five new gaming headset models. For the years ended December 31, 2014 &#32;and 2013 , we expended $9.4 million &#32;and $4.9 million , respectively. 

Intellectual Property 

We operate in industries where innovations, investment in new ideas and protection of resulting intellectual property rights are critical to success. We have a substantial base of intellectual property assets to protect our current and future product development, such as key innovations in gaming headsets as well as all of the core technology areas behind HyperSound, and intend to vigorously enforce such rights. 

As a third-party gaming headset company certain technology used in the new generation of consoles, such as integrated voice and chat audio from the Xbox One, requires a license to enable products to connect to that platform. While Playstation&#174;4 does not require any license to produce headsets that can connect, certain connections on the Xbox One require the purchase of proprietary chips to integrate into the locked chat audio. 

While we currently believe that we have the necessary licenses, or can obtain the necessary licenses to produce compatible products, there is no guarantee that licenses will be renewed or granted. Moreover, if these licensing parties enter into exclusive license agreements with companies other than us for their &#8220;closed systems&#8221; or if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these headset adapters or chips, we would be placed at a competitive disadvantage. 

Supply Chain and Operations 

We have a global network of suppliers that manufacture products to meet our cost objectives and quality standards sought by our customers. We have worked closely with component, manufacturing and global logistic partners to build a supply chain that we consider predictable, scalable and consistent to provide high-quality, reliable products and leading cost management practices. The use of outsourced manufacturing facilities is designed to take advantage of specific expertise and allow for flexibility and scalability to respond to seasonality and changing demands for our products. 

In anticipation of new product development and incremental growth, we made additional investments with a focus on making advancements to our planning systems and reconfiguring our supply chain. In connection with our initiative to improve our operating efficiency and reduce costs, we have continued efforts to focus on company-wide overhead and operating expense cost reduction activities including consolidation of warehouses with our global logistics partnership with Keuhne + Nagel and the transition of certain headset models to the world's largest contract manufacturer, Foxconn. 

We believe we have solid relationships with our suppliers and that, subject to the discussion in &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources,&#8221; we will continue to have a sufficient supply of quality products on satisfactory terms. 

Retail Distribution 

Our headsets are sold in over 40 countries, by retailers such as Amazon, Argos, Best Buy, Carrefour, GameStop, HMV, Sainsbury, Target, Tesco and Walmart. We often have a broader assortment and more shelf space than competitors at video game and electronics retailers such as GameStop and Best Buy which we believe reinforces the brand&#8217;s authenticity with gaming enthusiasts, and our presence in mass channel retailers such as Walmart and Target enables the brand to reach a wider audience of casual gamers. Our established presence on Amazon.com and other online retail sites, and positive consumer product ratings on those sites, increases the search visibility of our products and helps to influence both online and in-store sales. We also have exclusive licensing and sponsorship relationships with some of the biggest players in competitive gaming, including Twitch, the world's leading broadcast platform and community for video game enthusiasts. 

TB Europe serves as a sales office and primary warehouse for sales to the European market, and has strengthened Turtle Beach&#8217;s European operations with support for sales, marketing, customer service and distribution. 

TurtleBeach.com is an important focal point for our marketing efforts serving as a destination for paid and earned media. Earned media is favorable publicity gained through promotional efforts other than advertising, as compared with paid media, which refers to publicity gained through advertising. The website acts as a hub for both online and offline activity, and provides a direct sales channel for new and refurbished products.

Seasonality 

Our gaming headset business is seasonal with a significant portion of sales and profits typically occurring around the holiday period. Historically, more than 50% of headset business revenues are generated during the period from September through December as new headsets are introduced and consumers engage in holiday shopping. In addition, launches of major new online multiplayer games and specific retailer purchasing behavior can drive significant revenue shifts between months and quarters in a given year. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , Turtle Beach had approximately 221 employees, of which 181 were full-time salaried employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
