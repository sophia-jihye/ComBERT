 Item 1. BUSINESS 

Kingsway Financial Services Inc. was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) on September 19, 1989. In this report, the terms "Kingsway," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our" mean Kingsway Financial Services Inc. and all entities included in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company's registered office is located at 45 St. Clair Avenue West, Suite 400, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M4V 1K9. The common shares of Kingsway are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "KFS." 

Kingsway is a Canadian holding company with operating subsidiaries located in the United States. The Company operates as a merchant bank primarily engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the property and casualty insurance business. Kingsway conducts its business through the following two reportable segments: Insurance Underwriting and Insurance Services. Insurance Underwriting and Insurance Services conduct their business and distribute their products in the United States. Certain of the business descriptions below, particularly "Investments," "Reinsurance" and "Regulatory Environment," are principally or exclusively related to Insurance Underwriting. The "Debt" description below is unrelated to either segment. 

Financial information about Kingsway's reportable business segments for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;is contained in the following sections of this 2015 &#32;Annual Report: (i) Note 22 , " Segmented Information ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements; and (ii) "Results of Continuing Operations" section of MD&#38;A. 

REPORTING CURRENCY 

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been presented in U.S. dollars because the Company's principal investments and cash flows are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's functional currency is the U.S. dollar since the substantial majority of its operations is conducted in the United States. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated to U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, while revenue and expenses are translated at average monthly rates and shareholders' equity is translated at the rates in effect at dates of capital transactions. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders' equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from transactions which are denominated in currencies other than the entity's functional currency are reflected in foreign exchange losses, net in the consolidated statements of operations. 

All of the dollar amounts in this 2015 &#32;Annual Report are expressed in U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated. References to "dollars" or "$" are to U.S. dollars, and any references to "C$" are to Canadian dollars. 

GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 

Discontinued Operations 

On April 1, 2015, the Company closed on the sale of its subsidiary, Assigned Risk Solutions Ltd. ("ARS") for $47.0 million &#32;in cash. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company received additional post-closing cash consideration of $2.0 million . The terms of the sale also provide for potential future earnout payments to the Company equal to 1.25% &#32;of ARS' written premium and fee income during the earnout periods. The earnout payments are payable in three annual installments beginning in April 2016 through April 2018. The Company recorded a net gain on disposal of ARS, not including future earnout payments, of $11.3 million &#32;during 2015 . As a result of the sale, ARS, previously disclosed as part of the Insurance Services segment, has been classified as a discontinued operation. The earnings of ARS are disclosed as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. Further information is contained in Note 4 , " Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Termination of Management Services Agreement 

On February 24, 2015, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. ("PIH") to terminate the Management Services Agreement ("MSA") previously entered into on February 11, 2014. Pursuant to the transaction, the Company received the following consideration: $2.0 million &#32;in cash; $3.0 million &#32;of 8% &#32;preferred stock of PIH, mandatorily redeemable in five years; a Performance Shares Grant Agreement with PIH, whereby the Company will be entitled to receive 100,000 &#32;shares of PIH common stock if at any time the last sales price of PIH's common stock equals or exceeds $10.00 &#32;per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period; and warrants to purchase 1,500,000 &#32;shares of common stock of PIH with a strike price of $15.00 , expiring in seven years. The Company recorded a gain of $6.0 million &#32;during

KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. 

2015 &#32;related to the termination of the MSA, which is included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations. Further information is contained in Note 24 , " Related Party Transactions ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Deconsolidation 

During the second quarter of 2015, the Company's controlling interest in Kingsway Linked Return of Capital Trust ("KLROC Trust") was reduced to zero upon the Company's repayment of its C$15.8 million &#32;outstanding on its Linked Return of Capital ("LROC") preferred units due June 30, 2015. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on deconsolidation of KLROC Trust of $4.4 million &#32;during 2015 . This reported loss results from removing the net assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss of KLROC Trust from the Company&#8217;s consolidated balance sheets. The deconsolidation reduced consolidated shareholders&#8217; equity by $2.8 million &#32;at June 30, 2015. &#32; Further information is contained in Note 4 , " Disposition, Deconsolidation and Discontinued Operations ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SEGMENT 

The Company's property and casualty insurance business operations are conducted primarily through the following subsidiaries: Mendota Insurance Company ("Mendota"), Mendakota Insurance Company ("Mendakota"), Mendakota Casualty Company (formerly Universal Casualty Company) ("MCC"), Kingsway Amigo Insurance Company ("Amigo") and Kingsway Reinsurance Corporation (collectively, "Insurance Underwriting"). 

The insurance subsidiaries in Insurance Underwriting issue insurance policies and retain the risk of operating profit or loss related to the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred on the underlying policies. Insurance Underwriting provides non-standard automobile insurance to individuals who do not meet the criteria for coverage by standard automobile insurers. Insurance Underwriting has policyholders in 12 &#32;states; however, new business is accepted in only nine &#32;states. In 2015 , the following states accounted for 84.8% &#32;of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written: Florida ( 24.0% ), Texas ( 16.3% ), Illinois ( 15.7% ), California ( 10.3% ), Nevada ( 9.9% ) and Colorado ( 8.6% ). 

The Company previously placed Amigo and MCC into voluntary run-off in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Each of Amigo and MCC entered into a comprehensive run-off plan which was approved by its respective state of domicile. Kingsway continues to manage Amigo and MCC in a manner consistent with the run-off plans. During the first quarter of 2015, MCC sent a letter of intent to the Illinois Department of Insurance to resume writing private passenger automobile policies in the state of Illinois. MCC began writing these policies on April 1, 2015. 

Effective March 31, 2014 , the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, PIH, formerly known as Maison Insurance Holdings, Inc., completed an initial public offering of its common stock. Upon completion of the transaction, the Company maintained a minority ownership interest in the common shares of PIH. The earnings of PIH are included in the consolidated statements of operations through the March 31, 2014 transaction date. Prior to the transaction, PIH was included in the Insurance Underwriting segment. As a result of the disposal of the Company's majority interest in PIH on March 31, 2014, all segmented information has been restated to exclude PIH from the Insurance Underwriting segment. 

Insurance Underwriting Products 

Insurance Underwriting primarily markets automobile insurance products which provide coverage in three major areas: liability, accident benefits and physical damage. Liability insurance provides coverage for claims against the Company's insureds legally responsible for automobile accidents which have injured third-parties or caused property damage to third-parties. Accident benefit policies or personal injury protection policies provide coverage for loss of income, medical and rehabilitation expenses for insured persons who are injured in an automobile accident, regardless of fault. Physical damage policies cover damages to an insured automobile arising from a collision with another object or from other risks such as fire or theft.

Non-standard automobile insurance is principally provided to individuals who do not qualify for standard automobile insurance coverage because of their payment history, driving record, place of residence, age, vehicle type or other factors. Such drivers typically represent higher than normal risks and pay higher insurance rates for comparable coverage. 

Non-standard automobile insurance loss experience is generally driven by higher frequency and lower severity than the standard automobile market. The higher frequency, however, is mitigated to some extent by higher premium rates; the tendency of high-risk individuals to own low-value automobiles; and generally lower limits of insurance coverage as insureds tend to purchase coverage at the minimum prescribed limits. In the United States, non-standard automobile insurance policies generally have lower limits of insurance commensurate with the minimum coverage requirements under the statute of the states in which we write the business. These limits of liability are typically not greater than $50,000 per occurrence. 

The insuring of non-standard automobile drivers is often transitory. When their driving records improve, insureds may qualify to obtain insurance in the standard market at lower premium rates. We often cancel policies for non-payment of premium and, following a period of lapse in coverage, insureds frequently return to purchase a new policy at a later date. As a result, our non-standard automobile insurance policies experience a retention rate that is lower than that experienced for standard market risks. This creates an on-going requirement to replace non-renewing policyholders with new policyholders and to react promptly to issue cancellation notices for non-payment of premiums to mitigate potential bad debt write-offs. Most of our insureds pay their premiums on a monthly installment basis, and we typically limit our risk related to non-payment of premiums by requiring a deposit for future insurance premiums and the prepayment of subsequent installments. 

In the United States, automobile insurers are generally required to participate in various involuntary residual market pools and assigned risk plans that provide automobile insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that are unable to purchase such coverage in the voluntary market. Participation in these pools in most jurisdictions is in proportion to voluntary writings of selected lines of business in those jurisdictions. 

Non-standard automobile insurance accounted for 100.0% &#32;of Insurance Underwriting's gross premiums written in 2015 &#32;and 2014 . For the year ended December 31, 2015 , gross premiums written for non-standard automobile insurance increase d 2.1% &#32;to $116.4 million &#32;as compared to $114.0 million &#32;in 2014 . The increase in gross premiums written resulted primarily from increased premium volumes written in Florida during the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;compared to prior year.

Marketing and Distribution 

Our strategy focuses on developing and maintaining strong relationships with our independent agents. Insurance Underwriting's products and services are marketed through approximately 3,700 &#32;independent agencies. We maintain an "open market" approach which enables these agents to place business with us without the obligation of minimum production commitments, providing us with a broad, flexible and scalable distribution network. We continually strive to provide excellent service in the markets in which we operate, communicating through a variety of channels as we look for opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce operating costs with our agents. Our independent agents have the ability to bind insurance policies on our behalf, subject to our underwriting guidelines. Our proprietary point-of-sale systems, however, prevent any agent from binding an unacceptable risk. We do not, though, delegate authority to settle or adjust claims, establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates or enter into other transactions or commitments through our independent agents. 

Texas business is originated through an affiliated managing general agent and written through an unaffiliated Texas county mutual insurance company. This business is then 100% assumed through a quota-share arrangement by one of our insurance subsidiaries. This represents a common way of originating non-standard automobile business in the state of Texas due to the greater rating and underwriting flexibility accorded Texas county mutual insurance companies under Texas statutes. 

No customer or group of affiliated customers accounts for 10% or more of Insurance Underwriting's revenues, and no loss of a customer or group of affiliated customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Competition 

Insurance Underwriting operates in a highly competitive environment. Our core non-standard automobile offerings are policies at the minimum prescribed limits in each state produced entirely through our independent agents. We compete with large national insurance companies and smaller regional insurance companies which produce through independent agents. We also compete with insurance companies which sell policies directly to their customers. 

Large national insurance companies and direct underwriters typically operate in standard lines of personal automobile and property insurance in addition to non-standard lines and generally bring with them increased name recognition obtained through extensive media advertising, loyalty of the customer base to the insurer rather than to an independent agency and, potentially, reduced policy acquisition costs and increased customer retention. 

From time to time, the non-standard automobile market attracts competition from new entrants. In many cases, these entrants are looking for growth and, as a result, price their insurance below the rates that we believe provide an acceptable return for the related risk. We firmly believe that it is not in our best interest to compete solely on price; consequently, we are willing to experience a loss of market share during periods of intense price competition or soft market conditions. During the last few years, the Company carried out a detailed review of its premium adequacy in the territories in which it operates and implemented steps to terminate business where premium adequacy was unlikely to be achieved within an acceptable period of time. 

In order to stay competitive while striving to generate an economic rate of return, we compete on a number of factors such as distribution strength and breadth, premium adequacy, agency relationships, ease of doing business and market reputation. Ultimately, we believe that our ability to compete successfully in our industry is based, among other things, on our ability to: 

&#8226; 

identify markets that are most likely to produce an underwriting profit; 

&#8226; 

operate with a disciplined underwriting approach; 

&#8226; 

practice prudent claims management; 

&#8226; 

establish an appropriate provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses; 

&#8226; 

strive for cost containment and the economics of shared support functions where deemed appropriate; and 

&#8226; 

provide our independent agents and brokers with competitive commissions, an ease of doing business and additional value-added products and services for them and their customers. 

Insurance Underwriting generally does not compete on the basis of ratings assigned by insurance rating agencies. Previously, the Company's insurance subsidiaries were assigned ratings by A.M. Best. In October, 2011 the Company had the A.M. Best ratings for all of its insurance subsidiaries withdrawn. As a result, the Company's insurance subsidiaries are currently unrated. 

&#160; 

&#32;7 

&#160; 

KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. 

Underwriting 

Our underwriting philosophy stresses receiving an adequate premium and spread of risks for the business we accept. We regularly monitor premium adequacy by territory, line of business and agency and take actions as necessary. Actions include, but are not limited to, tightening underwriting requirements, filing for rate increases, terminating underperforming programs and agents, non-renewing policies (where permitted) and other administrative changes. Typically, we do not reduce our premiums when competitors underwrite at premium rates that we believe are below acceptable levels. Instead, we focus on maintaining our premium per risk rather than writing a large number of risks at premiums that we believe would be inadequate and thus unprofitable. As a result, our premium volumes may be negatively impacted during a soft market. 

Claims Management 

Claims management is the process by which Insurance Underwriting determines the validity and amount of a claim. We believe that claims management is fundamental to our operating results. With respect to Insurance Underwriting, proper and efficient claims management has a direct effect on the operating profit or loss which has been retained related to the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred on the underlying policies. 

The individual operating subsidiaries in Insurance Underwriting primarily employ their own claims adjusters who are responsible for investigating and settling claims. Under certain circumstances, however, our operating subsidiaries will utilize each other's claims expertise where appropriate. Our goal is to settle claims fairly for the benefit of our insureds in a manner that is consistent with the insurance policy language and our regulatory and legal obligations. 

In addition to claims adjusters, our operating subsidiaries also employ appraisers, special investigators and salvage, subrogation and other personnel who are responsible for helping us reduce the net cost of claim-handling, particularly with respect to identifying instances of fraud. We aggressively combat fraud and have processes in place to investigate suspicious claim activity. We may also engage independent appraisers, private investigators, various experts and legal counsel to assist us in adjusting claims. When necessary, we defend litigation against our insureds generally by retaining outside legal counsel. 

INSURANCE SERVICES SEGMENT 

Insurance Services includes the following subsidiaries of the Company: IWS Acquisition Corporation ("IWS") and Trinity Warranty Solutions LLC ("Trinity"), (collectively, "Insurance Services"). 

IWS is a licensed motor vehicle service agreement company and is a provider of after-market vehicle protection services distributed by credit unions in 26 &#32;states to their members. 

Trinity is a provider of warranty products and maintenance support to consumers and businesses in the heating, ventilation, air conditioning ("HVAC"), standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration industries. Trinity distributes its warranty products through original equipment manufacturers, HVAC distributors and commercial and residential contractors. Trinity distributes its maintenance support direct through corporate owners of retail spaces throughout the United States. 

As described above, effective April 1, 2015 , the Company closed on the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, ARS. As a result, ARS has been classified as discontinued operations and the results of their operations are reported separately for all periods presented. Prior to the transaction, ARS was included in the Insurance Services segment. As a result of classifying ARS as a discontinued operation, all segmented information has been restated to exclude ARS from the Insurance Services segment. 

Insurance Services Products 

IWS markets and administers vehicle service agreements and related products for new and used automobiles throughout the United States. A vehicle service agreement is an agreement between IWS and the vehicle purchaser under which IWS agrees to replace or repair, for a specific term, designated vehicle parts in the event of a mechanical breakdown. IWS serves as the administrator on all contracts it originates. Vehicle service agreements supplement, or are in lieu of, manufacturers' warranties and provide a variety of extended coverage options. Vehicle service agreements typically range from three months to seven years and/or 3,000 miles to 100,000 miles. The cost of the vehicle service agreement is a function of the contract term, coverage limits and type of vehicle. 

In addition to marketing vehicle service agreements, IWS also brokers a guaranteed asset protection product ("GAP") through its distribution channel. GAP generally covers a consumer's out-of-pocket amount, related to an automobile loan or lease, if the vehicle is stolen or damaged beyond repair. IWS earns a commission when a consumer purchases a GAP certificate but does not take on any insurance risk. 

&#160;

&#160; 

KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. 

Trinity is a provider of HVAC, standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration warranty products and provider of equipment breakdown and maintenance support services to companies across the United States. As a provider of warranty products, Trinity markets and administers product warranty contracts for certain new and used products in the HVAC, standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration industries throughout the United States. A warranty contract is an agreement between Trinity and the purchaser of such HVAC, standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration equipment to replace or repair, for a specific term, designated parts in the event of a mechanical breakdown. As a provider of equipment breakdown and maintenance support services, Trinity acts as a single point of contact to its clients for both certain equipment breakdowns and scheduled maintenance of equipment. Trinity will provide such repair and breakdown services by contracting with certain HVAC providers. 

Marketing and Distribution 

IWS markets its products primarily through credit unions. IWS enters into an exclusive agreement with each credit union whereby the credit union receives a stipulated access fee for each vehicle service agreement issued to its members. The credit unions are served by IWS employee representatives located throughout the United States in close geographical proximity to the credit unions they serve. IWS distributes and markets its products in 26 &#32;states. 

Trinity directly markets and distributes its warranty products to manufacturers, distributors and installers of HVAC, standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration equipment. As a provider of equipment breakdown and maintenance support, Trinity directly markets and distributes its product through its clients, which are primarily companies that directly own and operate numerous locations across the United States. 

No customer or group of affiliated customers accounts for 10% or more of Insurance Service's revenues, and no loss of a customer or group of affiliated customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Competition 

IWS focuses exclusively on the automotive finance market with its core vehicle service agreement and related product offerings, while much of its competition in the credit union channel has a less targeted product approach. IWS' typical competitor takes a generalist approach to market by providing credit unions with a variety of different product offerings. They are thus unable to deliver specialty expertise on par with IWS and do not give vehicle service agreement products the attention they require for healthy profitability and strong risk management. 

Trinity operates in an environment with few market competitors. Trinity competes on two important facets: its belief that it provides superior customer service relative to its competitors and its ability, through the support of its insurance company partners, to provide warranty solutions to a wider range of HVAC, standby generator, commercial LED lighting and refrigeration equipment than that of its competitors. 

Claims Management 

Claims management is the process by which Insurance Services determines the validity and amount of a claim. We believe that claims management is fundamental to our operating results. The individual operating subsidiaries in Insurance Services primarily employ their own claims adjusters who are responsible for investigating and settling claims. Our goal is to settle claims fairly for the benefit of our insureds and the insureds of our insurance company partners in a manner that is consistent with the insurance policy language and our regulatory and legal obligations. 

IWS effectively and efficiently manages claims by utilizing in-house expertise and information systems. IWS employs an experienced claims staff comprised of Automotive Service Excellence certified mechanics, knowledgeable in all aspects of vehicle repairs and potential claims. Additionally, IWS owns its own proprietary database of historical claims data dating back over twenty years. &#32;&#32; Management analyzes this database to drive real-time pricing adjustments and strategic decision-making. 

Trinity claims on warranty products are managed by the insurance companies with which Trinity partners. Trinity may, at times, act as a third-party administrator of such claims; however at no time does Trinity bear the loss of claims on warranty products. 

PRICING AND PRODUCT MANAGEMENT 

Responsibility for pricing and product management rests with the Company's individual operating subsidiaries in each of Insurance Underwriting and Insurance Services. Typically, teams comprised of pricing actuaries, product managers and business development managers work together by territory to develop policy forms and language, rating structures, regulatory filings and new product ideas. Data solutions and claims groups track loss performance on a monthly basis so as to alert the operating subsidiaries to the potential need to adjust forms or rates.

UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES 

Kingsway records a provision for its unpaid losses that have occurred as of a given evaluation date as well as for its estimated liability for loss adjustment expenses. The provision for unpaid losses includes a provision, commonly referred to as case reserves, for losses related to reported claims as well as a provision for losses related to claims incurred but not reported ("IBNR"). The provision for loss adjustment expenses represents the cost to investigate and settle claims. 

The provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses does not represent an exact calculation of the liability but instead represents management's best estimate at a given accounting date, utilizing actuarial and statistical procedures, of the undiscounted estimates of the ultimate net cost of all unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. Management continually reviews its estimates and adjusts its provision as new information becomes available. In establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, the Company also takes into account estimated recoveries, reinsurance, salvage and subrogation. 

Any adjustments to the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the periods in which they become known, and the adjustments are accounted for as changes in estimates. Even after such adjustments, ultimate liability or recovery may exceed or be less than the revised provisions. An adjustment that increases the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is known as an unfavorable development or a deficiency and will reduce net income while an adjustment that decreases the provision is known as a favorable development or a redundancy and will increase net income. 

Process for Establishing the Provision for Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses 

The process for establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both reported and IBNR claims. As such, the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined. The process of establishing the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals, including the opinions of the Company's actuaries. 

Factors affecting the provision for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses include the continually evolving and changing regulatory and legal environment, actuarial studies, professional experience and expertise of the Company's claims departments' personnel and independent adjusters retained to handle individual claims, the quality of the data used for projection purposes, existing claims management practices including claims handling and settlement practices, the effect of inflationary trends on future loss settlement costs, court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes. 

The process for establishing the provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. Data on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics and evaluated by actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities by product line. Such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. The process of analyzing the provision is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information. 

Multiple estimation methods are available for the analysis of the provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time; therefore, the actual choice of estimation method can change with each evaluation. The estimation methods chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date. 

In most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the evaluation of the provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses. This will result in a range of reasonable estimates for the provision. Reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. These reviews may substantiate the validity of management's recorded provision or lead to a change in the reported provision. 

The exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. As a result, the Company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. In addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process. 

A basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors discussed below. To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses is known, such change is quantified to the extent possible through an analysis of internal 

&#160; 

&#32;10 

&#160; 

KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. 

company data and, if available and when appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. Significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses. 

Informed judgment is applied throughout the process. This includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. In addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. As a result, management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints when establishing the provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses. 

Variables Influencing the Provision for Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses 

The variables discussed above have different impacts on estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line. 

Property and casualty insurance policies are either written on a claims-made or occurrence basis. Claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual policies, claims reported during the policy period. Policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured reports the loss in a later policy period. 

Product lines are generally classifiable as either long-tail or short-tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final resolution of those claims. Short-tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the time before final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty. 

A major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. The reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes estimating IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of IBNR to the total provision for the product line. Writing new products with material reporting lags can result in adding several years' worth of IBNR claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with pricing and reserving such products. 

For some lines, the impact of large individual claims or loss events, such as catastrophes, can be material to the analysis. These lines are generally referred to as being "low frequency/high severity," while lines without this "large claim" sensitivity are referred to as "high frequency/low severity." The provision for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large claims or a small number of significant loss events, such as catastrophes. As a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these provisions. In contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines, the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the range of reasonable provision estimates is narrower and more stable. 

Claim complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim complexity have inherently greater estimation uncertainty. 

Actuaries have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of the provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses. The human element in the application of actuarial judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. Different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas of focus. Hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other. 

Lastly, significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the process for establishing the provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses. 

Property and Casualty Insurance 

The Company's insurance policies are generally written on an occurrence basis. Non-standard automobile includes both short and long-tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage and property damage claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively short, and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. Given that our core non-standard automobile offerings are policies at the minimum prescribed limits in each state, our non-standard automobile business is generally viewed as a high frequency, low severity business. 

Examples of common risk factors that could change and, thus, affect the provision for loss and loss adjustment expenses for the non-standard automobile product line include, but are not limited to:

Historical Development of Property and Casualty Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses 

Table 3 summarizes the changes over time in the Company's provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. 

The first section of the table shows the provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. The original provision for each year is presented on a gross basis as well as net of estimated reinsurance recoverable on unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. 

The second section displays the cumulative amount of payments made through the end of each subsequent year with respect to each original provision. The third section presents the re-estimation over subsequent years of each year's original net liability for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses as more information becomes known and trends become more apparent. The final section compares the latest re-estimation to the original estimate for each year presented in the table on both a gross and net basis. 

The development of the provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is shown by the difference between the original estimates and the re-estimated liabilities at each subsequent year-end. The re-estimated liabilities at each year-end are based on actual payments in full or partial settlement of claims plus re-estimates of the payments required for claims still open or IBNR claims. Favorable development (redundancy) means that the original estimated provision was higher than subsequently re-estimated. Unfavorable development (deficiency) means that the original estimated provision was lower than subsequently re-estimated. The cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years.

Rollforward of Property and Casualty Unpaid Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses 

Table 4 shows a rollforward of the provision for property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers. The effect on the Company's net loss during the past two years due to changes in estimates of prior year property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is shown as the "prior years" contribution to incurred losses. The consolidated financial statements are presented on a calendar year basis for all data. Calendar year results reflect payments and re-estimation of the provision that have been recorded in the consolidated financial statements during the applicable reporting period without regard to the periods in which the original losses were incurred. Calendar year results do not change after the end of the applicable reporting period, even as new information develops.

INVESTMENTS 

We manage our investments to support the liabilities of our insurance operations, preserve capital, maintain adequate liquidity and maximize after-tax investment returns within acceptable risks. The fixed maturities portfolios are managed by a third-party firm and are comprised predominantly of high-quality fixed maturities with relatively short durations. Equity, limited liability and other investments are managed by a team of employees and advisors dedicated to the identification of investment opportunities that offer asymmetric risk/reward potential with a margin of safety supported by private market values. The Investment and Capital Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring the performance of our investments and compliance with the Company's investment policies and guidelines, which it reviews annually. We are also subject to the applicable state regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments that individual insurance companies can make. 

For further descriptions of the Company's investments, see our disclosures under the headings "Net Investment Income," "Net Realized Gains," "Investments," "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions" in the MD&#38;A and Note 5 , " Investments ," and Note 23 , " Fair Value of Financial Instruments ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

REINSURANCE 

For most of the non-standard automobile business that we write, our exposure is generally limited to the minimum statutory liability limits, which are typically not greater than $50,000 per occurrence, depending on the state. We have from time to time, though, entered into different types of reinsurance arrangements as part of the management of our non-standard automobile business. For 2015 and 2014, we entered into an excess of loss reinsurance arrangement to reduce our exposure to losses related to certain catastrophic events which may occur in any of the states in which we write non-standard automobile business. 

Reinsurance ceded does not relieve us of our ultimate liability to our insureds in the event that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations under its reinsurance contracts. We therefore enter into reinsurance contracts with only those reinsurers which we believe have sufficient financial resources to meet their obligations to us. Reinsurance treaties generally have terms of one year and, as a result, are subject to renegotiation annually. 

&#160; 

&#32;14 

&#160; 

KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. 

Because our reinsurance recoverable is generally unsecured, we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor the concentrations of credit risk to minimize our exposure to significant losses as a result of the insolvency of a reinsurer. We believe that the amounts we have recorded as reinsurance recoverable are appropriately established. Estimating our reinsurance recoverable, however, is subject to various uncertainties and the amounts ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. Estimating amounts of reinsurance recoverable is also impacted by the uncertainties involved in the establishment of provisions for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses. As our underlying provision develops, the amounts ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had $1.4 million &#32;recoverable from third-party reinsurers. As shown in Table 5 below, at December 31, 2015 , 100.0% &#32;of the amounts recoverable from third-party reinsurers were due from reinsurers that were rated "A-" or higher by the A.M. Best rating service. We regularly evaluate our reinsurers and their respective amounts recoverable, and an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is provided, if needed.

Further information regarding our debt is discussed within the "Debt" section of MD&#38;A as well as in Note 13 , " Debt ," to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT 

Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in the states in which they do business. Such regulation pertains to a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, policy forms, premium rate plans, licensing of agents, licenses to transact business, trade practices, claims practices, investments, payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates and solvency. The majority of our insurance is written in states requiring prior approval by regulators before proposed rates for property and casualty policies may be implemented. 

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance holding company laws in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. These regulations require that each U.S insurance company in the holding company system register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies in the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers in the holding company domiciled in that state. We have U.S. insurance subsidiaries that are organized and domiciled under the insurance statutes of Illinois, Minnesota and Florida. The insurance laws in each of these states similarly provide that all transactions among members of a holding company system be done at arm&#8217;s length and be shown to be fair and reasonable to the regulated insurer. Transactions between insurance company subsidiaries and their parents and affiliates typically must be disclosed to the state regulators, and any material or extraordinary transaction requires prior approval of the applicable state insurance regulator. A change of control of a domestic insurer or of any controlling person requires the prior approval of the state insurance regulator. In general, any person who acquires 10% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the insurer or its parent company is presumed to have acquired control of the domestic insurer. To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with the regulations discussed above. 

&#160; 

&#32;15 

&#160; 

KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. 

We are a holding company with no business operations of our own. Our ability to meet our debt payment obligations and cover our operating expenses is largely dependent on dividends or other payments from our non-insurance subsidiaries as well as the sale of assets held by the holding company and the issuance of securities to raise capital. Dividends declared and paid by an insurance subsidiary are subject to certain restrictions which may require prior approval by the insurance regulators of the state in which such subsidiary is domiciled. At this time, the U.S. insurance subsidiaries of the Company are restricted from making any dividend payments to the holding company without regulatory approval pursuant to the domiciliary state insurance regulations. Other transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates generally must be disclosed to state regulators, and prior regulatory approval generally is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated or any management agreement, services agreement, expense sharing arrangement or other contract providing for the rendering of services on a regular, systematic basis is executed. 

Insurance companies are required to report their financial condition and results of operation in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed or permitted by state insurance regulators in conjunction with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"). State insurance regulators also prescribe the form and content of statutory financial statements, perform periodic financial examinations of insurers, set minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, establish standards for the types and amounts of investments and require minimum capital and surplus levels. Such statutory capital and surplus requirements reflect risk-based capital ("RBC") standards promulgated by the NAIC. These RBC standards are intended to assess the level of risk inherent in an insurance company's business and consider items such as asset risk, credit risk, underwriting risk and other business risks relevant to its operations. In accordance with RBC formulas, an insurance company's RBC requirements are calculated and compared to its total adjusted capital, as defined by the NAIC, to determine whether regulatory intervention is warranted. In general, insurers reporting surplus as regards policyholders below 200% of the authorized control level, as defined by the NAIC, at December 31 are subject to varying levels of regulatory action, including discontinuation of operations. As of December 31, 2015 , surplus as regards policyholders reported by each of our insurance subsidiaries exceeded the 200% threshold. 

Our insurance subsidiaries are required under the guaranty fund laws of most states in which they transact business to pay assessments up to prescribed limits to fund policyholder losses or liabilities of insolvent insurance companies. Our insurance subsidiaries also are required to participate in various involuntary pools or assigned risk pools. In most states, the involuntary pool participation of our insurance subsidiaries is in proportion to their voluntary writings of related lines of business in such states. 

We operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. These licenses govern, among other things, the types of insurance coverage and agency and claim services that we may offer consumers in these states. Such licenses typically are issued only after we file an appropriate application and satisfy prescribed criteria. We must apply for and obtain the appropriate new licenses before we can implement any plan to expand into a new state or offer a new line of insurance or other new product that requires separate licensing. 

The insurance laws of most states in which our insurance subsidiaries operate require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval. State insurance regulators have broad discretion in judging whether our rates are adequate, not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory and whether our policy forms comply with law. The speed at which we can change our rates depends, in part, on the method by which the applicable state's rating laws are administered. Generally, state insurance regulators have the authority to disapprove our rates or request changes in our rates. In addition, certain states in which we operate have laws and regulations that limit an automobile insurance company's ability to cancel or not renew policies. 

We are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and that limit the amount of investments in certain categories. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, would require divestiture. 

The state insurance departments that have jurisdiction over our insurance company subsidiaries may conduct on-site visits and examinations of the insurance companies' affairs, especially as to their financial condition, ability to fulfill their obligations to policyholders, market conduct, claims practices and compliance with other laws and applicable regulations. Typically, these examinations are conducted every three to five years. In addition, if circumstances dictate, regulators are authorized to conduct special or target examinations of insurance companies to address particular concerns or issues. The results of these examinations can give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial, injunctive or other corrective action on the part of the company that is the subject of the examination or the assessment of fines or other penalties against that company. 

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information. The majority of states have implemented additional regulations to address privacy issues. These laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions, including insurance companies, and require us to maintain appropriate procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our customers and to fully disclose our privacy practices to our customers. We may also be exposed

to future privacy laws and regulations, which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition. 

In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act (the "DFA") was enacted into law. Among other things, the DFA forms within the Treasury Department a Federal Insurance Office ("FIO") that is charged with monitoring all aspects of the insurance industry, gathering data, and conducting a study on methods to modernize and improve the insurance regulatory system in the United States. FIO's report, which was delivered to Congress in 2013, concluded that a hybrid approach to regulation, involving a combination of state and federal government action, could improve the U.S. insurance system by attaining uniformity, efficiency and consistency, particularly with respect to solvency and market conduct regulation. A hybrid approach was also recommended to address the perceived need for uniform supervision of insurance companies with national and global activities. FIO established the Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance ("FACI") whose mission is to provide recommendations to FIO on issues it monitors for Congress. While the NAIC continues to promote the strengths of the U.S. state-based insurance regulatory system, both FIO/FACI and international standard setting authorities such as the International Association of Insurance Supervisors are actively seeking a role in shaping the future of the U.S. insurance regulatory framework. 

Title V of the Wall Street Reform Act instructs the FIO Director to submit an update to the report that FIO submitted to Congress in 2013 describing the impact of Part II of the Nonadmitted and Reinsurance Reform Act of 2010 ("NRRA") on the ability of state regulators to access reinsurance information for regulated entities in their jurisdictions. The update, submitted by FIO in May 2015, concludes that Part II of NRRA has not had an adverse impact on the ability of state regulators to access reinsurance information from regulated companies. It is not yet known whether or how these organizations' recommendations might result in changes to the current state-based system of insurance industry regulation or ultimately impact Kingsway&#8217;s operations. 

Vehicle service agreements are regulated in all states in the United States, and IWS is subject to these regulations. Most states utilize the approach of the Uniform Service Contract Act which was adopted by the NAIC in the early 1990's. Under that scheme, states regulate vehicle service contract companies by requiring them annually to file documentation, together with a copy of the contract of insurance covering their liability under the service contracts, which complies with the particular state's regulatory requirements. IWS is in compliance with the regulations of each state in which it sells vehicle service agreements. 

Certain, but not all, states regulate the sale of HVAC and equipment warranty contracts. Trinity is licensed as a service contract provider in those states where it is required.
