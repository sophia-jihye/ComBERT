 Item 1. Business 

OVERVIEW 

NextEra Energy, Inc. (hereafter, NEE), with approximately 46,400 MW of generating capacity, is one of the largest electric power companies in North America with electric generation facilities located in 27 states in the U.S. and 4 provinces in Canada, and employing approximately 14,300 people as of December 31, 2015 . NEE provides retail and wholesale electric services to more than 5.3 million customers and owns generation, transmission and distribution facilities to support its services, as well as has investments in gas infrastructure assets. It also provides risk management services related to power and gas consumption related to its own generation assets and for a limited number of wholesale customers in selected markets. NEE, through NEER, is the largest generator in North America of renewable energy from the wind and sun based on MWh produced. In addition, NEE owns and operates approximately 15% of the installed base of U.S. wind power production capacity and owns and/or operates approximately 9% of the installed base of U.S. utility-scale solar power production capacity as of December 31, 2015 . NEE also owns and operates one of the largest fleets of nuclear power stations in the U.S., with eight reactors at five sites located in four states, representing approximately 6% of U.S. nuclear power electric generating capacity as of December 31, 2015 . NEE's business strategy has emphasized the development, acquisition and operation of renewable, nuclear and natural gas-fired generation facilities in response to long-term federal policy trends supportive of zero and low air emissions sources of power. NEE's generation fleet has significantly lower rates of emissions of CO 2 , SO 2 &#32;and NOx than the average rates of the U.S. electric power industry with approximately 97% of its 2015 generation, measured by MWh produced, coming from renewable, nuclear and natural gas-fired facilities. 

NEE was incorporated in 1984 under the laws of Florida and conducts its operations principally through two wholly owned subsidiaries, Florida Power &#38; Light Company (hereafter, FPL) and NextEra Energy Resources, LLC (hereafter, NEER). NextEra Energy Capital Holdings, Inc. (hereafter, NEECH), another wholly owned subsidiary of NEE, owns and provides funding for NEER's and NEE's operating subsidiaries, other than FPL and its subsidiaries. NEE's two principal businesses also constitute NEE's reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. During 2014, NEE formed NEP to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows. See II. NEER for further discussion of NEP. NEE's and NEER's generating capacity discussed in this combined Form 10-K includes approximately 480 MW associated with noncontrolling interests related to NEP as of December 31, 2015 . See Item 2. Properties. 

FPL is a rate-regulated electric utility engaged primarily in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in Florida. FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. based on retail MWh sales. FPL is vertically integrated, with approximately 25,300 MW of generating capacity as of December 31, 2015 . FPL's investments in its infrastructure since 2001, such as modernizing less-efficient fossil generation plants to produce more energy with less fuel and fewer air emissions, increasing generating capacity at its existing nuclear units and upgrading its transmission and distribution systems to deliver service reliability that is the best of the Florida investor-owned utilities, have provided significant benefits to FPL's customers, all while providing residential and commercial bills that were among the lowest in Florida and below the national average based on a rate per kWh as of July 2015 (the latest date for which this data is available). With approximately 95% of its power generation coming from natural gas, nuclear and solar, FPL is also one of the cleanest electric utilities in the nation. Based on 2015 information, FPL's emissions rates for CO 2 , SO 2 &#32;and NOx were 35%, 97% and 71% lower, respectively, than the average rates of the U.S. electric power industry. 

NEER, with approximately 21,100 MW of generating capacity at December 31, 2015 , is one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power in the U.S., with 20,120 MW of generating capacity across 25 states, and has 920 MW of generating capacity in 4 

Canadian provinces. NEER produces the majority of its electricity from clean and renewable sources, including wind and solar. NEER also provides full energy and capacity requirements services, engages in power and gas marketing and trading activities and invests in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production and pipeline infrastructure assets. 

NEECH's other business activities are primarily conducted through NEET and FPL FiberNet. Through its subsidiaries, NEET owns and operates rate-regulated transmission facilities, the largest of which is owned by Lone Star, a rate-regulated transmission service provider in Texas. FPL FiberNet delivers wholesale and enterprise telecommunications services in Florida, Texas and certain areas of the South Central U.S. 

NEE seeks to create value in its two principal businesses by meeting its customers' needs more economically and more reliably than its competitors, as described in more detail in the following sections. NEE's strategy has resulted in profitable growth over sustained periods at both FPL and NEER. Management seeks to grow each business in a manner consistent with the varying opportunities available to it; however, management believes that the diversification and balance represented by FPL and NEER is a valuable characteristic of the enterprise and recognizes that each business contributes to NEE's credit profile in different ways. FPL and NEER, as well as other NEE subsidiaries, share common support functions with the objective of lowering costs and creating efficiencies for their businesses. During 2013, NEE and its subsidiaries commenced an enterprise-wide initiative focused mainly on improving productivity and reducing O&#38;M expenses (cost savings initiative), and management expects to continue those efforts going forward. 

In 2014, NEE and Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) announced a proposed merger pursuant to which Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc., HEI's wholly owned electric utility subsidiary, will become a wholly owned subsidiary of NEE. The merger agreement contains certain termination rights for both NEE and HEI, including the right of either party to terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not been completed by June 3, 2016. Completion of the merger and the actual closing date remain subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including Hawaii Public Utilities Commission approval. See Note 1 - Proposed Merger for further discussion. 

NEE'S OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES 

I. FPL 

FPL was incorporated under the laws of Florida in 1925 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of NEE. FPL is a rate-regulated electric utility and is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. based on retail MWh sales. FPL, with 25,254 MW of generating capacity at December 31, 2015 , supplies electric service throughout most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida, serving more than 9.5 million people through approximately 4.8 &#32; million customer accounts. At December 31, 2015 , FPL's service territory and plant locations are as follows (see Item 2. Properties - Generation Facilities): 

FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS AND COMPETITION 

FPL's service to its retail customers is provided primarily under franchise agreements negotiated with municipalities or counties. Alternatively, municipalities and counties may form their own utility companies to provide service to their residents. In a very few cases, an FPL franchise agreement provides the respective municipality the right to buy the electrical assets serving local residents at the end of the agreement. However, during the term of a franchise agreement, which is typically 30 years, the municipality or county agrees not to form its own utility, and FPL has the right to offer electric service to residents. FPL currently holds &#32; 179 franchise agreements with various municipalities and counties in Florida with varying expiration dates through &#32; 2046. &#32; None of these franchise agreements expire in 2016, two expire in 2017 and 177 expire during the period 2018 through 2046. These franchise agreements cover approximately 88% of FPL's retail customer base in Florida. Negotiations are ongoing to renew the franchise agreements that expire in 2017. FPL considers its franchises to be adequate for the conduct of its business. FPL also provides service to 12 &#32; other municipalities and to &#32; 21 unincorporated areas within its service area without franchise agreements pursuant to the general obligation to serve as a public utility. FPL relies upon Florida law for access to public rights of way. 

Because any customer may elect to provide his/her own electric services, FPL effectively must compete for an individual customer's business. As a practical matter, few customers provide their own service at the present time since FPL's cost of service is substantially lower than the cost of self-generation for the vast majority of customers. Changing technology, economic conditions and other factors could alter the favorable relative cost position that FPL currently enjoys; however, FPL seeks as a matter of strategy to ensure that it delivers superior value, in the form of high reliability, low bills and excellent customer service. 

In addition to self-generation by residential, commercial and industrial customers, FPL also faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources. In each of 2015, 2014 and 2013, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented approximately 5%, 5% and 3%, respectively, of FPL's total operating revenues. 

The FPSC promotes cost competitiveness in the building of new steam and solar generating capacity of 75 MW or greater by requiring investor-owned electric utilities, including FPL, to issue an RFP except when the FPSC determines that an exception from the RFP process is in the public interest. The RFP process allows independent power producers and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity. If a bidder has the most cost-effective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and/or operating generating capacity of the type proposed, the investor-owned electric utility would seek to negotiate a purchased power agreement with the selected bidder and request that the FPSC approve the terms of the purchased power agreement and, if appropriate, provide the required authorization for the construction of the bidder's generating capacity. 

New nuclear power plants are exempt from the RFP requirement. See FPL Sources of Generation - Nuclear Operations below. 

CUSTOMERS AND REVENUE 

FPL's primary source of operating revenues is from its retail customer base; it also serves a limited number of wholesale customers within Florida. FPL revenues from wholesale sales increased in both 2015 and 2014, primarily due to an increase in contracted load served under existing and new wholesale contracts. The percentage of FPL's operating revenues and customer accounts &#32; by customer class were as follows: 

&#160; 

For both retail and wholesale customers, the prices (or rates) that FPL may charge are approved by regulatory bodies, by the FPSC in the case of retail customers, and by the FERC in the case of wholesale customers. In general, under U.S. and Florida law, regulated rates are intended to cover the cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Since 

the regulatory bodies have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital employed, there can be no guarantee that FPL will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of its costs through regulated rates. See FPL Regulation below. 

FPL seeks to maintain attractive rates for its customers. Since rates are largely cost-based, maintaining low rates requires a strategy focused on developing and maintaining a low-cost position, including the implementation of ideas generated from the cost savings initiative discussed above. A common benchmark used in the electric power industry for comparing rates across companies is the price of 1,000 kWh of consumption per month for a residential customer. FPL's 2015 average bill for 1,000 kWh of monthly residential usage was the lowest among reporting electric utilities within Florida as indicated below: 

POWER DELIVERY 

FPL provides service to its customers through an integrated transmission and distribution system that links its generation facilities to its customers. FPL also maintains interconnection facilities with neighboring utilities and non-utility generators inside its service territory, enabling it to buy and sell wholesale electricity and to enhance the reliability of its own network and support the reliability of neighboring networks. FPL's transmission system carries high voltage electricity from its generation facilities to substations where the electricity is stepped down to lower voltage levels and is sent through the distribution system to its customers. 

A key element of FPL's strategy is to provide highly reliable service to its customers. The transmission and distribution system is susceptible to interruptions or outages from a wide variety of sources including weather, animal and vegetation interference, traffic accidents, equipment failure and many others, and FPL seeks to reduce or eliminate outages where economically practical and to restore service rapidly when outages occur. A common industry benchmark for transmission and distribution system reliability is the system average interruption duration index (SAIDI), which represents the number of minutes the average customer is without power during a time period. For the five years 2010 - 2014, FPL's average annual SAIDI was the best of the investor-owned utilities in Florida. FPL has accelerated its existing storm hardening and reliability program, to continue strengthening its infrastructure against tropical storms and hurricanes. Also, as part of its commitment to building a smarter, more reliable and efficient electric infrastructure, FPL has installed approximately 4.9 million smart meters and more than 35,000 other intelligent devices throughout the electric grid. 

FPL SYSTEM CAPABILITY AND LOAD 

At December 31, 2015 , FPL's resources for serving load consisted of &#32; 26,073 MW, of which 25,254 MW were from FPL-owned facilities (see Item 2. Properties - Generation Facilities) and approximately 819 &#32; MW were available through purchased power agreements (see FPL Sources of Generation - Purchased Power below). FPL customer usage and operating revenues are typically higher during the summer months, largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in FPL's service territory. Occasionally, unusually cold temperatures during the winter months result in significant increases in electricity usage for short periods of time. The highest peak load FPL has served to date was &#32; 24,346 MW, which occurred on January 11, 2010. FPL had adequate resources available at the time of this peak to meet customer demand. 

FPL's projected reserve margin for the summer of 2016 is approximately 22%. This reserve margin is expected to be achieved through the combination of available output from FPL's active generation units, purchased power agreements and the capability to reduce peak demand through the implementation of demand side management programs, including load management which was estimated at December 31, 2015 &#32;to be capable of reducing demand by approximately 1,700 MW, and energy efficiency and conservation programs. See FPL Sources of Generation - Fossil Operations and - Nuclear Operations below regarding generation projects currently under construction. 

FPL SOURCES OF GENERATION 

FPL relies upon a mix of fuel sources for its generation facilities, along with purchased power, in order to maintain the flexibility to achieve a more economical fuel mix by responding to market and industry developments. See descriptions of fossil, nuclear and solar operations below and a listing of FPL's generation facilities in Item 2. Properties - Generation Facilities. 

FPL's 2015 fuel mix based on MWh produced, including purchased power, was as follows: 

Oil and Solar are collectively less than 1% 

Fossil Operations (Natural Gas, Coal and Oil) 

At December 31, 2015 , FPL owned and operated 70 units that used fossil fuels, primarily natural gas, and had a joint ownership interest in 3 coal units. Combined, the fossil fleet provided 21,766 MW of generating capacity for FPL. These fossil units are out of service from time to time for routine maintenance or on standby during periods of reduced electricity demand. A common industry benchmark for fossil unit reliability is the equivalent forced outage rate (EFOR), which represents a generation unit's inability to provide electricity when required to operate. For the five years 2010 - 2014, FPL's average annual EFOR was in the top decile among its electric utility fossil fleet peers in the U.S. 

FPL's natural gas plants require natural gas transportation, supply and storage. FPL has firm transportation contracts in place for existing pipeline capacity with five &#32; different transportation suppliers. These agreements provide for an aggregate maximum delivery quantity of 2,069,000 &#32; MMBtu/day with expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2036 &#32; that together are &#32; expected to satisfy substantially all of the currently anticipated needs for natural gas transportation through the end of 2016. To the extent desirable, FPL also purchases interruptible natural gas transportation service from these natural gas transportation suppliers based on pipeline availability. FPL has several short- and medium-term natural gas supply contracts to provide a portion of FPL's anticipated needs for natural gas. The remainder of FPL's natural gas requirements is purchased in the spot market. FPL has an agreement for the storage of natural gas that expires in 2017. See Note 14 - Contracts. 

In 2013, the FPSC approved FPL's 25-year natural gas transportation agreements with each of Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection for a quantity of 400,000 MMBtu/day beginning on May 1, 2017 and increasing to 600,000 MMBtu/day on May 1, 2020. These new agreements, when combined with FPL's existing agreements, are expected to satisfy substantially all of FPL's natural gas transportation needs through at least 2020. FPL's firm commitments under the new agreements are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, including the FERC's approval of applications by each of Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection for authorization of their pipeline projects and of the application by Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company, LLC (Transco) for authorization of a pipeline expansion project and the lease of pipeline capacity to Sabal Trail, as well as completion of construction of the pipeline system to be built by Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection. In February 2016, the FERC issued an order granting the requested authorizations, subject to certain conditions. Sabal Trail, Florida Southeast Connection and Transco are 

evaluating the conditions, and one or more of them are currently expected to request a rehearing. See NEER - Generation and Other Operations - Natural Gas Pipelines below and Note 14 - Contracts. 

In March 2015, after receiving FPSC approval, a wholly owned subsidiary of FPL partnered with a third party to develop up to 38 natural gas production wells in the Woodford Shale region in southeastern Oklahoma and in return began receiving its ownership share of the natural gas produced from these wells. In July 2015, the FPSC approved a set of guidelines under which FPL could participate in additional natural gas production projects through investments of up to $500 million annually with an escalating annual production cap as a percent of FPL's total natural gas burn, with an emphasis on investing in proven and probable reserves. These investments in long-term natural gas supplies will provide FPL with a physical hedge on the price of natural gas to fuel its fossil generation fleet. FPL will recover the costs associated with the investments in these natural gas production wells through the fuel clause. In 2015, the State of Florida Office of Public Counsel (Office of Public Counsel) and Florida Industrial Power Users Group have each filed notices of appeal to the Florida Supreme Court challenging the FPSC's approval of FPL's initial investment in the Woodford Shale natural gas production wells and challenging the FPSC's approval of the guidelines, which appeals are pending. 

St. Johns River Power Park (SJRPP) Units Nos. &#160; 1 and 2, coal-fired units in which FPL has a joint ownership interest, have firm coal supply and transportation contracts for all of their fuel and transportation needs through 2017. Scherer Unit No. &#160; 4, the other coal-fired unit in which FPL has a joint ownership interest, has firm coal supply contracts for a portion of its fuel needs through 2016, and transportation contracts for all of its needs through 2019 and a portion of its needs through 2028. Any of the remaining fuel requirements for these coal-fired units, as well as for a 250 MW coal-fired generation facility located in Jacksonville, Florida that was purchased in September 2015 (Cedar Bay), will be obtained in the spot market. See Note &#160; 14 &#160; - Contracts and Note 1 - Rate Regulation. With respect to its oil plants, FPL obtains its fuel requirements in the spot market. 

Capital Initiatives 

New Generation Facility Proposed - &#32;In January 2016, the FPSC approved FPL's proposal to build a new approximately 1,600 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle unit in Okeechobee County, Florida, with a planned in-service date of mid-2019. This new unit is also subject to approval by the Siting Board (comprised of the governor and cabinet) under the Florida Electrical Power Plant Siting Act, which decision is expected by the end of 2016. 

Modernization Project - &#32;FPL is in the process of modernizing its Port Everglades power plant to a high-efficiency natural gas-fired unit that is expected to provide approximately 1,240 MW of capacity and be placed in service by April 2016. 

Peaker Upgrade Project - FPL is in the process of replacing 44 of its 48 gas turbines at its Lauderdale, Port Everglades and Fort Myers facilities, totaling approximately 1,700 MW of capacity, with 7 high-efficiency, low-emission turbines at its Lauderdale and Fort Myers facilities, totaling approximately 1,610 MW of capacity, by December 2016. In addition, FPL is upgrading 2 additional simple-cycle combustion turbines at its Fort Myers facility, which are expected to add an additional 50 MW of capacity by December 2016. 

Nuclear Operations 

At December 31, 2015 , FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated the following four nuclear units with a total net generating capacity of 3,453 MW.

FPL has several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates ranging from late February 2016 through 2031. See Note 14 - Commitments. NRC regulations require FPL to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. FPL's current plans, under the applicable operating licenses, provide for prompt dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 with decommissioning activities commencing in 2032 and 2033, respectively. Current plans provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the prompt dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 commencing in 2043. 

Projects to Add Additional Capacity. &#32;FPL's need petition for two additional nuclear units at its Turkey Point site was approved by the FPSC in 2008 and FPL is moving forward with activities necessary to obtain all permits, licenses and approvals necessary for construction and operation of the units. The two units are expected to add a total of approximately 2,200 MW of capacity. The timing of commercial operation will be subject to various regulatory approvals from the FPSC and other agencies which will be required throughout the licensing and development processes and the nuclear units are expected to be placed in-service in 2027 and 2028. The NRC's decision regarding issuance of the licenses for the two units is expected in mid-2017. 

Nuclear Unit Scheduled Refueling Outages. &#32;FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages typically require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time. The following table summarizes each unit's next scheduled refueling outage:

Spent Nuclear Fuel. &#32;FPL's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel at these facilities through license expiration. In 2014, the NRC issued its Continued Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel Rule which supports the NRC's determination that licensees can safely store spent nuclear fuel at nuclear power plants indefinitely. Various parties have filed petitions with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) challenging the rule and requesting that the NRC suspend final reactor licensing decisions in all open NRC licensing proceedings (including the licensing proceeding for two additional nuclear units at FPL's Turkey Point site) alleging that the rule is deficient. Briefs were filed in November 2015 &#32; and oral argument has been scheduled for late February 2016. 

Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (Nuclear Waste Policy Act) - Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the DOE is responsible for the development of a repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. As required by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, FPL is a party to contracts with the DOE to provide for disposal of spent nuclear fuel from its nuclear units. 

The DOE was required to construct permanent disposal facilities and take title to and provide transportation and disposal for spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998 for a specified fee based on current generation from nuclear power plants which fee was subsequently set to zero effective May 2014. The DOE did not meet its statutory obligation for disposal of spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. In 2009, FPL and certain of FPL's nuclear plant joint owners entered into a settlement agreement (spent fuel settlement agreement) with the U.S. government agreeing to dismiss with prejudice lawsuits filed against the U.S. government seeking damages caused by the DOE's failure to dispose of spent nuclear fuel from FPL's nuclear plants. The spent fuel settlement agreement permits FPL to make annual filings to recover certain spent fuel storage costs incurred by FPL which are reimbursable by the U.S. government on an annual basis. 

Yucca Mountain - In 2010, the DOE filed a motion with the NRC to withdraw its license application for a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, which request was denied. In 2011, the NRC issued an order suspending the Yucca Mountain licensing proceeding, which order was challenged, and in 2013, the D.C. Circuit issued an order requiring the NRC to proceed with the legally mandated licensing process for a nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain. The NRC has completed the technical review of the application and is planning to supplement the DOE's environmental impact statement. Certain requirements must be met before the NRC can issue a license for the repository. 

Solar Operations 

Solar generation can be provided primarily through two conventions: utility-owned and customer-owned or leased. In utility-owned solar generation, the energy generated goes directly to the electric grid, whereas customer-owned or leased solar generation generally goes directly to the location it is serving with any excess over that local need being fed back to the electric grid. There are two principal solar technologies used for utility-scale projects: PV and thermal. At December 31, 2015 , FPL owned and operated two solar PV generation facilities, which provided a total of 35 MW of generating capacity, and a 75 MW solar thermal hybrid facility. FPL supports the advancement of solar generation primarily for its fuel diversity and emissions reduction benefits, and plans to continue to support, study and pursue solar generation that is beneficial for FPL's customers. FPL is in the process of building three solar PV projects that are expected to provide approximately 74 MW each and be placed into service by the end of 2016. 

Purchased Power 

In addition to owning generation facilities, FPL also purchases power and capacity from non-utility generators and other utilities to meet customer demand through long-term purchased power agreements. As of December 31, 2015 , FPL's long-term purchased power agreements provided for the purchase of approximately 819 &#32; MW of power with expiration dates ranging from 2021 through 2034. &#32; See Note 14 - Contracts. On occasion, FPL may procure short-term power and capacity for both economic and reliability purposes. In September 2015, FPL assumed ownership of Cedar Bay and terminated FPL's long-term purchased power agreement for substantially all of the facility&#8217;s capacity and energy. See Note 1 - Rate Regulation. 

FPL ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING 

FPL's Energy Marketing &#38; Trading division (EMT) buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as natural gas, oil and electricity. EMT procures natural gas and oil for FPL's use in power generation and sells excess natural gas, oil and electricity. EMT also uses derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. Substantially all of the results of EMT's activities are passed through to customers in the fuel or capacity clauses. See FPL Regulation - FPL Rate Regulation below, Management's Discussion - Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity and Note 3. 

FPL REGULATION 

FPL's operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and other organizations, including, but not limited to, the following: 

&#8226; 

the FPSC, which has jurisdiction over retail rates, service territory, issuances of securities, planning, siting and construction of facilities, among other things; 

&#8226; 

the FERC, which oversees the acquisition and disposition of generation, transmission and other facilities, transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce, proposals to build interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy, among other things; 

&#8226; 

the NERC, which, through its regional entities, establishes and enforces mandatory reliability standards, subject to approval by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system blackouts; 

&#8226; 

the NRC, which has jurisdiction over the operation of nuclear power plants through the issuance of operating licenses, rules, regulations and orders; and 

&#8226; 

the EPA, which has the responsibility to maintain and enforce national standards under a variety of environmental laws. The EPA also works with industries and all levels of government, including federal and state governments, in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts. 

FPL Rate Regulation 

The FPSC sets rates at a level that is intended to allow FPL the opportunity to collect from retail customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to FPL's cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. To accomplish this, the FPSC uses various ratemaking mechanisms, including, among other things, base rates and cost recovery clauses. 

Base Rates . &#32;In general, the basic costs of providing electric service, other than fuel and certain other costs, are recovered through base rates, which are designed to recover the costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the utility system. These basic costs include O&#38;M expenses, depreciation and taxes, as well as a return on FPL's investment in assets used and useful in providing electric service (rate base). At the time base rates are established, the allowed rate of return on rate base approximates the FPSC's determination of FPL's estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which includes its costs for outstanding debt and an allowed ROE. The FPSC monitors FPL's actual regulatory ROE through a surveillance report that is filed monthly by FPL with the FPSC. The FPSC does not provide assurance that any regulatory ROE will be achieved. Base rates are determined in rate proceedings or through negotiated settlements of those proceedings. Proceedings can occur at the initiative of FPL or upon action by the FPSC. Base rates remain in effect until new base rates are approved by the FPSC. 

In January 2013, the FPSC issued a final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2012 rate agreement). Key elements of the 2012 rate agreement, which is effective from January 2013 through December 2016, include, among other things, the following: 

&#8226; 

New retail base rates and charges were established in January 2013 resulting in an increase in retail base revenues of $350 million on an annualized basis. 

&#8226; 

FPL's allowed regulatory ROE is 10.50%, with a range of plus or minus 100 basis points. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below 9.50%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above 11.50%, any party to the 2012 rate agreement other than FPL may seek a review of FPL's retail base rates. 

&#8226; 

Retail base rates will be increased by the annualized base revenue requirements for FPL's three modernization projects (Cape Canaveral, Riviera Beach and Port Everglades) as each of the modernized power plants becomes operational. (Cape Canaveral and Riviera Beach became operational in April 2013 and April 2014, respectively, and Port Everglades is expected to be operational by April 2016.) 

&#8226; 

Cost recovery of WCEC Unit No. 3, which was placed in service in May 2011, will continue to occur through the capacity clause. 

&#8226; 

Subject to certain conditions, FPL may amortize, over the term of the 2012 rate agreement, a depreciation reserve surplus remaining at the end of 2012 under a previous rate agreement (approximately $224 million) and may amortize a portion of FPL's fossil dismantlement reserve up to a maximum of $176 million (collectively, the reserve), provided that in any year of the 2012 rate agreement, FPL must amortize at least enough reserve to maintain a 9.50% earned regulatory ROE but may not amortize any reserve that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of 11.50%. See below regarding a subsequent reduction in the reserve amount. 

&#8226; 

Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kWh of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $4 surcharge to recover the amount above $800 million. 

&#8226; 

An incentive mechanism whereby customers will receive 100% of certain gains, including, but not limited to, gains from the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas (including transportation and storage), up to a specified threshold; gains exceeding that specified threshold will be shared by FPL and its customers (incentive mechanism). 

In August 2015, the FPSC approved a stipulation and settlement between the Office of Public Counsel and FPL regarding issues relating to the ratemaking treatment for FPL&#8217;s purchase of Cedar Bay. As part of this settlement, the amount of the reserve was reduced by $30 million to $370 million, unless FPL needs the entire $400 million reserve to maintain a minimum regulatory ROE of 9.50%. In October 2015, the Florida Industrial Power Users Group filed a notice of appeal challenging the FPSC's approval of this settlement, which is pending before the Florida Supreme Court. 

In January 2016, FPL filed a formal notification with the FPSC indicating its intent to initiate a base rate proceeding, consisting of a four-year rate plan that would begin in January 2017 following the expiration of the 2012 rate agreement at the end of 2016. The notification stated that, based on preliminary estimates, FPL expects to request an increase to base annual revenue requirements of (i) approximately $860 million effective January 2017, (ii) approximately $265 million effective January 2018, and (iii) approximately $200 million effective when the proposed natural gas-fired combined-cycle unit in Okeechobee County, Florida becomes operational, which is expected to occur in mid-2019 (see FPL Sources of Generation - Fossil Operations - Capital Initiatives above). Under the proposed rate plan, FPL commits that if its requested adjustments to base annual revenue requirements are approved, it will not request further adjustments for 2020. In addition, FPL expects to propose an allowed regulatory ROE midpoint of 11.50%, which includes a 50 basis point performance adder. FPL expects to file its formal request to initiate a base rate proceeding in March 2016. 

Cost Recovery Clauses . &#32;Cost recovery clauses, which are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through the various clauses, include substantially all fuel, purchased power and interchange expense, certain construction-related costs and conservation and certain environmental-related costs. Cost recovery clause costs are recovered through levelized monthly charges per kWh or kW, depending on the customer's rate class. These cost recovery clause charges are calculated at least annually based on estimated costs and estimated customer usage for the following year, plus or minus true-up adjustments to reflect the estimated over or under recovery of costs for the current and prior periods. An adjustment to the levelized charges may be approved during the course of a year to reflect revised estimates. 

Fuel costs and energy charges under the purchased power agreements are recovered from customers through the fuel clause, the most significant of the cost recovery clauses in terms of operating revenues. FPL uses a risk management fuel procurement program which has been approved by the FPSC. The FPSC reviews the program activities and results for prudence annually as part of its review of fuel costs. The program is intended to manage fuel price volatility by locking in fuel prices for a portion of FPL's fuel requirements. See FPL Energy Marketing and Trading above, Note 1 - Rate Regulation and Note 3. Costs associated with FPL&#8217;s investments in natural gas production wells are also recovered through the fuel clause. See FPL Sources of Generation - Fossil Operations above. 

Capacity payments to non-utility generators and other utilities, the cost of WCEC Unit No. 3 (reported as retail base revenues) and a portion of the acquisition cost of Cedar Bay, among other things, are recovered from customers through the capacity clause. See Note 1 - Rate Regulation. In accordance with the FPSC's nuclear cost recovery rule, FPL also recovers pre-construction costs and carrying charges (equal to a pretax AFUDC rate) on construction costs for new nuclear capacity through the capacity clause. As property related to the new nuclear capacity goes into service, construction costs and a return on investment are recovered through base rate increases effective beginning the following January. See FPL Sources of Generation - Nuclear Operations above. 

Costs associated with implementing energy conservation programs are recovered from customers through the energy conservation cost recovery clause. Certain costs of complying with federal, state and local environmental regulations enacted after April 1993 and costs associated with FPL's three operating solar facilities are recovered through the environmental cost recovery clause (environmental clause). 

The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. These costs may include, among others, fuel and O&#38;M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities. 

FERC 

The Federal Power Act grants the FERC exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, electric utilities must maintain tariffs and rate schedules on file with the FERC which govern the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. The Federal Power Act also gives the FERC authority to certify and oversee a national electric reliability organization with authority to establish and independently enforce mandatory reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and operators of the bulk-power system. See NERC below. Electric utilities are subject to accounting, record-keeping and 

reporting requirements administered by the FERC. The FERC also places certain limitations on transactions between electric utilities and their affiliates. 

NERC 

The NERC has been certified by the FERC as the national electric reliability organization. The NERC's mandate is to ensure the reliability and security of the North American bulk-power system through the establishment and enforcement of reliability standards approved by FERC. The NERC's regional entities also enforce reliability standards approved by the FERC. FPL is subject to these reliability standards and incurs costs to ensure compliance with continually heightened requirements, and can incur significant penalties for failing to comply with them. 

FPL Environmental Regulation 

FPL is subject to environmental laws and regulations and is affected by some of the emerging issues described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. FPL expects to seek recovery through the environmental clause for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations. 

FPL EMPLOYEES 

FPL had approximately 8,800 employees at December 31, 2015 . Approximately 34% of the employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) under a collective bargaining agreement with FPL that expires October 31, 2017. 

II. NEER 

NEER was formed in 1998 to aggregate NEE's competitive energy businesses. It is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware and is a wholly owned subsidiary of NEECH. Through its subsidiaries, NEER currently owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets primarily in the U.S., as well as in Canada and Spain. See Note 15. NEER is one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power in the U.S., with 21,140 MW of generating capacity across 25 states, 4 Canadian provinces and 1 Spanish province as of December 31, 2015 . NEER produces the majority of its electricity from clean and renewable sources as described more fully below. NEER is the largest generator in North America of electric power from wind and utility-scale solar energy projects based on MWh produced. 

NEER also engages in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities, including entering into financial and physical contracts, to hedge the production from its generation assets that is not sold under long-term power supply agreements. These contracts primarily include power and gas commodities and their related products, as well as providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets and offering customized power and gas and related risk management services to wholesale customers. In addition, NEER participates in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production through non-operating ownership interests, and in pipeline infrastructure development, construction, management and operations, through either wholly owned subsidiaries or noncontrolling or joint venture interests, hereafter referred to as the gas infrastructure business. NEER also hedges the expected output from its gas infrastructure production assets to protect against price movements. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the natural gas pipeline projects that were previously reported in Corporate and Other were moved to the NEER segment reflecting the overall scale of the natural gas pipeline investments and management of these projects within NEER's gas infrastructure business. See Note 15. 

As discussed in the Overview above, during 2014, NEP was formed to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NEP OpCo. Through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, NEE owns 101,440,000 common units of NEP OpCo representing a noncontrolling interest in NEP's operating projects of approximately 76.8% as of December 31, 2015. &#32; NEE owns a controlling general partner interest in NEP and consolidates NEP for financial reporting purposes. See Note 1 - NextEra Energy Partners, LP. As of December 31, 2015 , NEP, through the combination of NEER's contribution of energy projects to NEP OpCo in connection with NEP&#8217;s IPO in July 2014 and the acquisition of additional energy projects from NEER in 2015, owns a portfolio of 19 wind and solar projects with generating capacity totaling approximately 2,210 MW and long-term contracted natural gas pipeline assets as discussed below. In addition, NEP OpCo has a right of first offer for certain of NEER's assets (ROFO assets) if NEER should seek to sell the assets. The ROFO assets remaining as of December 31, 2015 , include contracted wind and solar projects, some of which are under construction, with a combined capacity of approximately 1,076 MW. Included in the ROFO assets are three solar projects that, upon completion of construction, are expected to have a total generating capacity of 277 MW. In 2015, NEP OpCo issued 2 million NEP OpCo Class B Units to NEER in exchange for an approximately 50% ownership interest in the three solar projects. NEER, as holder of the Class B Units, will retain 100% of the economic interests if, and until, NEER offers to sell the economic interests to NEP and NEP accepts such offer. In October 2015, NEP completed the acquisition of the membership interests in NET Holdings Management, LLC (Texas pipeline business), a developer, owner and operator of a portfolio of seven intrastate long-term contracted natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas (Texas pipelines). See Generation and Other Operations - Contracted, Merchant and Other Operations - Other Operations below. 

MARKETS AND COMPETITION 

Electricity markets in the U.S. and Canada are regional and diverse in character. All are extensively regulated, and competition in these markets is shaped and constrained by regulation. The nature of the products offered varies based on the specifics of regulation in each region. Generally, in addition to the natural constraints on pricing freedom presented by competition, NEER may also face specific constraints in the form of price caps, or maximum allowed prices, for certain products. NEER's ability to sell the output of its generation facilities may also be constrained by available transmission capacity, which can vary from time to time and can have a significant impact on pricing. 

The degree and nature of competition that NEER faces is different in wholesale markets and in retail markets. During 2015, approximately 92% of NEER's revenue was derived from wholesale electricity markets. 

Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants. NEER primarily competes on the basis of price, but believes the green attributes of NEER's generation assets, its creditworthiness and its ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solutions to wholesale customers are competitive advantages. Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NEER competes with depending on the market. In wholesale markets, customers' needs are met through a variety of means, including long-term bilateral contracts, standardized bilateral products such as full requirements service and customized supply and risk management services. 

In general, U.S. electricity markets encompass three classes of services: energy, capacity and ancillary services. Energy services relate to the physical delivery of power; capacity services relate to the availability of MW capacity of a power generation asset; and ancillary services are other services related to power generation assets, such as load regulation and spinning and non-spinning reserves. The exact nature of these classes of services is defined in part by regional tariffs. Not all regions have a capacity services class, and the specific definitions of ancillary services vary from region to region. 

RTOs and ISOs exist in a number of regions within which NEER operates to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic areas and to run markets. NEER also has operations that fall within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council reliability region that are not under the jurisdiction of an established RTO or ISO. Although each RTO and ISO may have differing objectives and structures, some benefits of these entities include regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing larger wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity providers. NEER has operations that fall within the following RTOs and ISOs: 

&#8226; 

Alberta Electric System Operator 

&#8226; 

California Independent System Operator 

&#8226; 

ERCOT 

&#8226;

Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. 

&#8226; 

New York Independent System Operator 

&#8226; 

PJM 

&#8226; 

Southwest Power Pool 

NEER competes in different regions to different degrees, but in general it seeks to enter into long-term bilateral contracts for the full output of its generation facilities, and, as of December 31, 2015 , approximately 66% of NEER's generating capacity is fully committed under long-term contracts. Where long-term contracts are not in effect, NEER sells the output of its facilities into daily spot markets. In such cases, NEER will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contracts, typically of less than three years duration, to hedge the price risk associated with selling into a daily spot market. Such bilateral contracts, which may be hedges either for physical delivery or for financial (pricing) offset, may only protect a portion of the revenue that NEER expects to derive from the associated generation facility and may not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP. Contracts that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of a generation facility but are not recorded as hedges under GAAP are referred to as &#8220;non-qualifying hedges&#8221; for adjusted earnings purposes. See Management's Discussion - Overview - Adjusted Earnings. 

Certain facilities within the NEER wind and solar generation portfolio produce renewable energy credits (RECs) and other environmental attributes which are typically sold along with the energy from the plants under long-term contracts, or may be sold separately for the wind and solar generation not sold under long-term contracts. The purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting rights and ownership of the environmental attributes. 

While the majority of NEER's revenue is derived from the output of its generation facilities, NEER is also an active competitor in several regions in the wholesale full requirements business and in providing structured and customized power and fuel products and services to a variety of customers. In the full requirements service, typically, the supplier agrees to meet the customer's needs for a full range of products for every hour of the day, at a fixed price, for a predetermined period of time, thereby assuming the risk 

of fluctuations in the customer's volume requirements. 

Expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for NEER. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient facilities that can sell power in competitive markets. NEER seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its facilities. 

GENERATION AND OTHER OPERATIONS 

NEER sells products associated with its own generation facilities (energy, capacity, RECs and ancillary services) in competitive markets in regions where those facilities are located. Customer transactions may be supplied from NEER generation facilities or from purchases in the wholesale markets, or from a combination thereof. 

At December 31, 2015 , the locations of NEER's generation facilities in North America are as follows: 

At December 31, 2015 , NEER managed or participated in the management of essentially all of its generation projects in which it has an ownership interest. 

NEER categorizes its portfolio in a number of different ways for different business purposes. See a listing of NEER's generation facilities in Item 2. Properties - Generation Facilities. The following presentation details NEER operations and fuel/technology mix, which NEE commonly uses in communicating information about its business: 

Contracted, Merchant and Other Operations 

NEER's portfolio of generation operations based on the presence/absence of long-term power sales agreements and other operations is described below. 

Contracted Generation Assets. &#32;Contracted generation assets are generation facilities with long-term power sales agreements for substantially all of their capacity and/or energy output and certain wind assets where long-term power sales agreements are expected to be executed. At December 31, 2015 , NEER had 14,317 &#32;MW of contracted generation assets, substantially all of which have long-term power sales agreements, representing approximately 66% of its total operating generation portfolio. Essentially all of the output of these contracted generation assets were under power sales agreements, with a weighted-average remaining contract life of approximately 15 years, and the nuclear facilities have firm nuclear fuel-related contracts with expiration dates ranging from late February 2016 through 2032. See Note 14 - Contracts. Of the total capacity of contracted generation assets, 10,571 &#32;MW is wind generation, 1,621 &#32;MW is nuclear generation and 1,121 &#32;MW is solar generation. The remaining 1,004 &#32;MW use fuels such as natural gas and oil. 

Merchant Generation Assets. &#32;Merchant generation assets are generation facilities that do not have long-term power sales agreements to sell their capacity and/or energy output, or, in the case of certain wind assets, are not expected to have long-term power sales agreements, and therefore require active marketing and hedging. At December 31, 2015 , NEER's portfolio of merchant generation assets consists of 6,823 &#32;MW of owned wind, nuclear, natural gas, oil and solar generation facilities, including 846 MW of peak generation facilities. Approximately 59% (based on net MW capability) of the natural gas-fueled merchant generation assets have natural gas transportation agreements to provide for fluctuating natural gas requirements. See NEER Fuel/Technology Mix - Natural Gas Facilities below and Note 14 - Contracts. Derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) are generally used to lock in pricing and manage the commodity price risk inherent in power sales and fuel purchases. Managing market risk through these instruments introduces other types of risk, primarily counterparty, credit and operational risks. 

Other Operations. &#32;NEER's operations also include the gas infrastructure business and the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses. The gas infrastructure business includes non-operating ownership interests in investments located in oil and gas shale formations primarily in the Midwest and South regions of the U.S. NEER continues to pursue in a selective way opportunities in the upstream (exploration and production) area when it believes the return potential is attractive and to gain insight into the natural gas industry. The gas infrastructure business also has investments in pipeline infrastructure assets located primarily in the South, Southeast and Northeast regions of the U.S. During 2015, NEER, through NEP, acquired the Texas pipeline business, including pipelines with a total existing capacity of approximately 4 Bcf per day, of which 3 Bcf per day is contracted with firm ship-or-pay contracts that have a weighted-average remaining contract life of approximately 16 years as of December 31, 2015. In addition, subsidiaries of NEER are pursuing regulatory approvals to move forward with three natural gas pipeline projects either directly or through joint venture investments. See Natural Gas Pipelines for a description of the natural gas pipelines. &#32; See NEER Customer Supply and Proprietary Power and Gas Trading for a description of the customer supply and propriety power and gas trading businesses. 

NEER Fuel/Technology Mix 

NEER's power generation is produced using a variety of fuel sources as further described below. 

NEER's power generation in terms of MWh produced for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;by fuel type is as follows: 

Wind Facilities 

At December 31, 2015 , NEER had ownership interests in wind generation facilities with a total net generating capacity of 12,414 MW. NEER operates all of these wind facilities, which are located in 19 states in the U.S. and 4 provinces in Canada. During 2015, NEER added approximately 1,031 MW of new U.S. wind generation and 176 MW of new Canadian wind generation, and sold, decommissioned or dismantled wind facilities with generating capacity totaling 220 MW. NEER expects to add new contracted wind generation of approximately 1,400 MW in 2016. See Policy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects below for additional discussion of NEER's expectations regarding wind development and construction. 

Solar Facilities 

At December 31, 2015 , NEER had ownership interests in PV and solar thermal facilities with a total net generating capacity of 1,026 MW, including approximately 285 MW added in 2015. NEER operates the majority of these solar facilities, which are located in 4 states in the U.S. and 1 province in Canada. NEER expects to add new contracted solar generation of approximately 1,100 MW in 2016. In addition, NEER and its affiliates own solar thermal facilities with generating capacity of 99.8 MW in Spain (Spain solar projects). See Note 14 - Spain Solar Projects for developments that impact the Spain solar projects. 

Natural Gas Facilities 

At December 31, 2015 , NEER had ownership interests in and operated natural gas facilities with a total net generating capacity of 4,083 MW. Approximately 1,004 &#32;MW of this net generating capacity is from contracted natural gas assets located throughout the Northeastern U.S. In November 2015, a subsidiary of NEER entered into an agreement to sell its ownership interest in its merchant natural gas generation facilities located in Texas, which have a total generating capacity of 2,884 MW at December 31, 2015. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016, pending the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. 

Nuclear Facilities 

At December 31, 2015 , NEER owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated the following four nuclear units with a total net generating capacity of 2,721 MW.

NEER sells all of its share of the output of Duane Arnold under a long-term contract expiring in December 2025. 

(c) 

NEER sells all of the output of Point Beach Units Nos. 1 and 2 under long-term contracts through their current operating license expiration dates. 

NEER's nuclear facilities have several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates ranging from late February 2016 through 2032. See Note 14 - Contracts. NEER is responsible for all nuclear unit operations and the ultimate decommissioning of the nuclear units, the cost of which is shared on a pro-rata basis by the joint owners for the jointly-owned units. NRC regulations require plant owners to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. 

Nuclear Unit Scheduled Refueling Outages. &#32; NEER's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages typically require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time. The following table summarizes each unit's next scheduled refueling outage:

Spent Nuclear Fuel. &#32;NEER's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel at these facilities through license expiration. 

As owners and operators of nuclear facilities, certain subsidiaries of NEER are subject to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and are parties to the spent fuel settlement agreement described in FPL - FPL Sources of Generation - Nuclear Operations. 

Oil Facilities 

At December 31, 2015 , NEER had 796 &#32;MW of oil-fired generation facilities located in Maine. 

Policy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects 

U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs. Wind and solar projects qualify for the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System depreciation schedule. This schedule allows a taxpayer to recognize the depreciation of tangible property on a five-year basis even though the useful life of such property is generally greater than five years. The PTC currently provides an income tax credit for the production of electricity from utility-scale wind turbines for the first ten years of commercial operation. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and has been extended several times. Most recently, in December 2015, the PTC was extended for five years, subject to the phase down schedule in the table below. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) previously issued guidance related to which projects will qualify for the PTC including, among other things, criteria for the beginning of construction of a project and the continuous program of construction or the continuous efforts to advance the project to completion. The IRS has not updated its guidance for the December 2015 extension. Alternatively, wind project developers can choose to receive a 30% ITC, in lieu of the PTC, subject to the phase down schedule in the table below. 

Solar project developers are also eligible to receive a 30% ITC for new solar projects, or can elect to receive an equivalent cash payment from the U.S. Department of Treasury for the value of the 30% ITC (convertible ITC) for qualifying solar projects where construction began before the end of 2011 and the projects are placed in service before 2017. In December 2015, the 30% ITC for new solar projects was extended, subject to the following phase down schedule.

Other countries, including Canada and Spain, provide for incentives like feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy projects. The feed-in-tariffs promote renewable energy investments by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy producers, typically based on the cost of generation of each technology. 

Natural Gas Pipelines

NEER CUSTOMER SUPPLY AND PROPRIETARY POWER AND GAS TRADING 

NEER's customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading businesses engage in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities, provide commodities-related products to customers and include the operations of a retail electricity provider. PMI, a subsidiary of NEER, buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as electricity, natural gas and oil. PMI sells the output from NEER's plants that is not sold under long-term contracts and procures the fossil fuel for use by NEER's generation fleet. One of its primary roles is to manage the commodity risk of NEER's portfolio. PMI uses derivative instruments such as swaps, options, futures and forwards to manage the risk associated with fluctuating commodity prices and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure production assets. PMI also markets and trades energy-related commodity products and provides a wide range of electricity and fuel commodity products as well as marketing and trading services to customers. PMI's customer supply business provides full energy and capacity requirements to customers. 

The results of the customer supply and proprietary power and gas trading activities are included in NEER's operating results. See Management's Discussion - Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity, Note 1 - Energy Trading and Note 3. 

NEER REGULATION 

The energy markets in which NEER operates are subject to domestic and foreign regulation, as the case may be, including local, state and federal regulation, and other specific rules. 

At December 31, 2015 , NEER had ownership interests in operating independent power projects located in the U.S. that have received exempt wholesale generator status as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which represent approximately 99% of NEER's net generating capacity in the U.S. Exempt wholesale generators own or operate a facility exclusively to sell electricity to wholesale customers. They are barred from selling electricity directly to retail customers. NEER's exempt wholesale generators produce electricity from wind, fossil fuels, solar and nuclear facilities. Essentially all of the remaining 1% of NEER's net generating capacity has qualifying facility status under the PURPA. NEER's qualifying facilities generate electricity primarily from wind, solar and fossil fuels. Qualifying facility status exempts the projects from, among other things, many of the provisions of the Federal Power Act, as well as state laws and regulations relating to rates and financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities. While projects with qualifying facility and/or exempt wholesale generator status are exempt from various restrictions, each project must still comply with other federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, those regarding siting, construction, operation, licensing, pollution abatement and other environmental laws. 

Additionally, most of the NEER facilities located in the U.S. are subject to FERC regulations and market rules, the NERC's mandatory reliability standards and all of its facilities are subject to environmental laws and the EPA's environmental regulations, and its nuclear facilities are also subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. See FPL - FPL Regulation for additional discussion of FERC, NERC, NRC and EPA regulations. With the exception of facilities located in ERCOT, the FERC has jurisdiction over various aspects of NEER's business in the U.S., including the oversight and investigation of competitive wholesale energy markets, regulation of the transmission and sale of natural gas, and oversight of environmental matters related to natural gas projects and major electricity policy initiatives. The PUCT has jurisdiction, including the regulation of rates and services, oversight of competitive markets, and enforcement of statutes and rules, over NEER facilities located in ERCOT. 

NEER and its affiliates are also subject to federal and provincial or regional regulations in Canada and Spain related to energy operations, energy markets and environmental standards. In Canada, activities related to owning and operating wind and solar projects and participating in wholesale and retail energy markets are regulated at the provincial level. In Ontario, for example, electricity generation facilities must be licensed by the Ontario Energy Board and may also be required to complete registrations and maintain market participant status with the Independent Electricity System Operator, in which case they must agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions of the market rules for the Ontario electricity market as well as the mandatory reliability standards of the NERC. 

NEER is subject to environmental laws and regulations, and is affected by some of the emerging issues related to renewable energy resources as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. In order to better anticipate potential regulatory changes, NEER continues to actively evaluate and participate in regional market redesigns of existing operating rules for the integration of renewable energy resources and for the purchase and sale of energy commodities. 

NEER EMPLOYEES 

NEER and its subsidiaries had approximately 5,000 employees at December 31, 2015 . Certain subsidiaries of NEER have collective bargaining agreements with the IBEW, the Utility Workers Union of America, the Security Police and Fire Professionals of America and the International Union of Operating Engineers, which collectively represent approximately 18% of NEER's employees. The majority of the collective bargaining agreements have three-year terms and expire between September 2016 and 2019. 

III. OTHER NEE OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES 

Corporate and Other represents other business activities, primarily NEET and FPL FiberNet. See Note 15. 

NEET 

NEET, a wholly owned subsidiary of NEECH, is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware. Through its subsidiaries, NEET owns and operates &#32; rate-regulated transmission facilities, the largest of which is owned by Lone Star, and is pursuing opportunities to develop, build and operate new transmission facilities throughout North America. In 2013, an entity in which an affiliate of NEET has a joint venture investment was selected to complete development work for a 250-mile transmission line in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. Once development is complete, subject to Ontario Energy Board approval, this entity is expected to construct, own and operate the new transmission line that is projected to begin service in 2020. In 2015, a wholly owned subsidiary of NEET was awarded the rights to develop, construct, own and operate two transmission support projects in California, which projects, subject to certain regulatory approvals, are expected to begin service in 2017 and 2019, respectively. 

Lone Star 

Lone Star, a rate-regulated transmission service provider in Texas, is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware. Lone Star owns and operates approximately 330 miles of 345 kilovolt (kV) transmission lines and other associated facilities. Lone Star is subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and other agencies, including, but not limited to, the PUCT, the ERCOT, the NERC and the EPA, as well as limited regulations of the FERC. See FPL - FPL Regulation for further discussion of FERC, NERC and EPA regulations and NEE Environmental Matters. The PUCT has jurisdiction over a wide range of Lone Star's business activities, including, among others, rates charged to customers and certain aspects of the operation of transmission systems. The 

PUCT sets rates at a level that allows Lone Star the opportunity to collect from customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to Lone Star's cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. 

In 2014, the PUCT approved a stipulation and settlement between Lone Star and all intervenors relating to Lone Star&#8217;s base rate petition. The stipulation and settlement provides for an annual revenue requirement of approximately $102 million based on a $694 million rate base, a regulatory equity ratio of 45%, an allowed regulatory ROE of 9.6% and certain operating expenses. 

FPL FIBERNET 

FPL FiberNet conducts its business through two separate wholly owned subsidiaries of NEECH. One subsidiary was formed in 2000 to enhance the value of NEE's fiber-optic network assets that were originally built to support FPL operations and the other was formed in 2011 to hold fiber-optic network assets which were acquired. Both subsidiaries are limited liability companies organized under the laws of Delaware. FPL FiberNet leases fiber-optic network capacity and dark fiber to FPL and other customers, primarily telephone, wireless, and internet companies. FPL FiberNet's networks cover most of the metropolitan areas in Florida and several in Texas. FPL FiberNet also has a long-haul network providing bandwidth at wholesale rates. The long-haul network connects major cities in Florida and Texas with additional connectivity to the Eastern and South Central U.S. At December 31, 2015 , FPL FiberNet's network consisted of approximately 9,230 route miles. FPL FiberNet is subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission which has jurisdiction over wire and wireless communication networks and by the public utility commissions in the states in which it provides intrastate telecommunication services. 

NEE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

NEE and FPL are subject to domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations. The following is a discussion of certain existing and emerging federal and state initiatives and rules, some of which could potentially have a material effect (either positive or negative) on NEE and its subsidiaries. FPL expects to seek recovery through the environmental clause for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations. 

&#8226; 

Clean Water Act Section 316(b). &#32;In 2014, the EPA issued its final rule under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act outlining the process and framework for determining the Best Technology Available to reduce the impact on aquatic organisms from once-through cooling water intake systems. Under the rule, potentially eleven of FPL's facilities and five of NEER's facilities may be required to add additional controls and/or make operational changes to comply. NEE and FPL are analyzing the final rule, and the ultimate impacts of the rule will evolve over years of site specific studies, permit evaluations and negotiations. Therefore, the impact of any final compliance obligations is uncertain at this time. Several groups filed petitions for review of the EPA's final rule and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is scheduled to hear the case in August 2016. 

&#8226; 

Avian/Bat Regulations and Wind Turbine Siting Guidelines. &#32;FPL, NEER and NEET are subject to numerous environmental regulations and guidelines related to threatened and endangered species and their habitats, &#32; as well as avian and bat species, for the siting, construction and &#32; ongoing operations of their facilities. The facilities most significantly affected are wind and solar facilities and transmission and distribution lines. The environmental laws in the U.S., including, among others, the Endangered Species Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and similar environmental laws in Canada provide for the protection of migratory birds, eagles and bats and endangered species of birds and bats and their habitats. Regulations have been adopted under some of these laws that contain provisions that allow the owner/operator of a facility to apply for a permit to undertake specific activities, including those associated with certain siting decisions, construction activities and operations. In addition to regulations, voluntary wind turbine siting guidelines established by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service set forth siting, monitoring and coordination protocols that are designed to support wind development in the U.S. while also protecting both birds and bats and their habitats. These guidelines include provisions for specific monitoring and study conditions which need to be met in order for projects to be in adherence with these voluntary guidelines. Complying with these environmental regulations and adhering to the provisions set forth in the voluntary wind turbine siting guidelines could result in additional costs or reduced revenues at existing and new wind and solar facilities and transmission and distribution facilities at FPL, NEER and NEET and, in the case of environmental regulations, failure to comply could result in fines and penalties. 

&#8226; 

Regulation of GHG Emissions. &#32;The U.S. Congress and certain states and regions, as well as the Government of Canada and its provinces, have taken and continue to take certain actions, such as finalizing regulation or setting targets or goals, regarding the reduction of GHG emissions and the increase of renewable energy generation. Based on the most recent reference data available from government sources, NEE is among the lowest emitters, among electric generators, of GHG in the U.S. measured by its rate of emissions expressed as pounds of CO 2 &#32;per MWh of generation. 

In October 2015, the EPA's final rule for new fossil fuel-fired electric generation units regulated under Section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act became effective, which is not expected to have an impact on NEE or FPL. In December 2015, the EPA's final rule under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (Clean Power Plan) to reduce carbon emissions from existing fossil fuel-fired electric generation units became effective. The Clean Power Plan sets emission rate targets for each state and requires each state to develop a compliance plan by the fall of 2016 to meet these emissions targets, with the option for states to apply for an extension to 2018. The Clean Power Plan indicates that compliance will start in 2022 with both interim and final target dates, 

each with specific emissions reductions. NEE and FPL are analyzing the Clean Power Plan and the impact of any final compliance obligations cannot be determined until the state plans have been finalized. Numerous parties have challenged the Clean Power Plan and, in February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order staying implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of legal challenges to the rule. The D.C. Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on June 2, 2016. 

NEER's plants operate in certain states and regions in the U.S. and provinces in Canada that continue to consider and implement regulatory proposals to reduce GHG emissions in addition to what is expected to be required for the Clean Power Plan. RPS, currently in place in approximately 30 states and 3 territories and the District of Columbia, require electricity providers in the state, territory or district to meet a certain percentage of their retail sales with energy from renewable sources. These standards vary, but the majority include requirements to meet 20% to 30% of the electricity providers' retail sales with energy from renewable sources by 2025. Approximately 8 other states in the U.S. have set renewable energy goals as well. Many Canadian provinces have enacted renewable energy goals and targets to reduce GHG emissions from historic levels which include various milestones and compliance mechanisms. NEER's plants operate in 23 states in the U.S. and 4 provinces in Canada that have a RPS or renewable energy goals and NEER believes that these standards and goals, as well as any final compliance obligations under the Clean Power Plan, will create incremental demand for renewable energy in the future. 

Other GHG reduction initiatives including, among others, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the California Greenhouse Gas Regulation aim to reduce emissions through a variety of programs and under varying timelines. Based on its clean generation portfolio, NEER expects to continue experiencing a positive impact on earnings as a result of these GHG reduction initiatives. Additionally, these initiatives provide NEER opportunities with regards to wind and solar development as well as favorable energy pricing. 

&#8226; 

Waters of the U.S. &#32;In June 2015, the EPA issued a final rule redefining "waters of the U.S." under the Clean Water Act to expand the definition of waters of the U.S. to encompass previously unregulated waters, such as intermittent streams, non-navigable tributaries, isolated wetlands and adjacent other waters, which rule was subsequently challenged by various parties. In October 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a stay of the EPA's final rule pending further court proceedings to address which court has jurisdiction as well as challenges to the rule. The ultimate resolution of the issues surrounding this final rule is uncertain at this time.
