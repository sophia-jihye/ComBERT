Business of Tri Counties Bank 

The Bank was incorporated as a California banking corporation on June 26, 1974, and received its certificate of authority to conduct banking operations on March 11, 1975. The Bank engages in the general commercial banking business in 26 counties in Northern and Central California. The Bank currently operates from 55 traditional branches and 12 in-store branches. 

The Bank conducts a commercial banking business including accepting demand, savings and time deposits and making commercial, real estate, and consumer loans. It also offers installment note collection, issues cashier&#146;s checks, sells travelers checks and provides safe deposit boxes and other customary banking services. Brokerage services are provided at the Bank&#146;s offices by the Bank&#146;s arrangement with Raymond James Financial Services, Inc., an independent financial services provider and broker-dealer. The Bank does not offer trust services or international banking services. 

The Bank has emphasized retail banking since it opened. Most of the Bank&#146;s customers are retail customers and small to medium-sized businesses. The Bank emphasizes serving the needs of local businesses, farmers and ranchers, retired individuals and wage earners. The majority of the Bank&#146;s loans are direct loans made to individuals and businesses in Northern and Central California where its branches are located. At December 31, 2015, the total of the Bank&#146;s consumer loans net of deferred fees outstanding was $395,283,000 (15.3%), the total of commercial loans outstanding was $194,913,000 (7.8%), and the total of real estate loans including construction loans of $120,909,000 was $1,932,741,000 (76.9%). The Bank takes real estate, listed and unlisted securities, savings and time deposits, automobiles, machinery, equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and notes receivable secured by property as collateral for loans. 

Most of the Bank&#146;s deposits are attracted from individuals and business-related sources. No single person or group of persons provides a material portion of the Bank&#146;s deposits, the loss of any one or more of which would have a materially adverse effect on the business of the Bank, nor is a material portion of the Bank&#146;s loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries. 

Acquisition of Three Branch Offices and Deposits from Bank of America 

On October 28, 2015, the Bank agreed to purchase three branch offices in Humboldt County, California from Bank of America, N.A. The Company expects that the Bank will purchase and assume approximately $235 million in deposits in this transaction. This transaction is expected to occur in March 2016. 

&#160;

Acquisition of North Valley Bancorp 

On October 3, 2014, TriCo completed the acquisition of North Valley Bancorp following receipt of shareholder approval for both institutions and all required regulatory approvals. As part of the acquisition, North Valley Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of North Valley Bancorp, merged with and into Tri Counties Bank. In the acquisition, the outstanding shares of North Valley common stock were converted into an aggregate of approximately 6.58 million shares of TriCo common stock to North Valley Bancorp shareholders, which was valued at a total of approximately $151 million based on the closing trading price of TriCo common stock on October 3, 2014 of $23.01. In addition, the outstanding options to purchase shares of North Valley Bancorp common stock were cancelled and the holders of the options received a total of $1,061,000 in cash. In connection with the merger, TriCo assumed North Valley Bancorp&#146;s obligations with respect to its outstanding trust preferred securities. 

North Valley Bank was a full-service commercial bank headquartered in Redding, California. North Valley conducted a commercial and retail banking services which included accepting demand, savings, and money market rate deposit accounts and time deposits, and making commercial, real estate and consumer loans. North Valley Bank had $935 million in assets and 22 commercial banking offices in Shasta, Humboldt, Del Norte, Mendocino, Yolo, Sonoma, Placer and Trinity Counties in Northern California at June 30, 2014. 

See Note 2 in the financial statements at Item 8 of this report for a discussion about this transaction. 

Other Activities 

The Bank may in the future engage in other businesses either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries acquired or formed by the Bank subject to regulatory constraints. See &#147;Regulation and Supervision.&#148; 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, the Company employed 1,011 persons, including six executive officers. Full time equivalent employees were 963. No employees of the Company are presently represented by a union or covered under a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that its employee relations are good. 

Competition 

The banking business in California generally, and in the Bank&#146;s primary service area of Northern and Central California specifically, is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits. It is dominated by a relatively small number of national and regional banks with many offices operating over a wide geographic area. Among the advantages such major banks have over the Bank is their ability to finance wide ranging advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment assets to regions of high yield and demand. By virtue of their greater total capitalization such institutions have substantially higher lending limits than does the Bank. 

In addition to competing with other banks, the Bank competes with savings institutions, credit unions and the financial markets for funds. Yields on corporate and government debt securities and other commercial paper may be higher than on deposits, and therefore affect the ability of commercial banks to attract and hold deposits. Commercial banks also compete for available funds with money market instruments and mutual funds. During past periods of high interest rates, money market funds have provided substantial competition to banks for deposits and they may continue to do so in the future. Mutual funds are also a major source of competition for savings dollars. 

The Bank relies substantially on local promotional activity, personal contacts by its officers, directors, employees and shareholders, extended hours, personalized service and its reputation in the communities it services to compete effectively. 

Regulation and Supervision 

General 

The Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state law. This regulation is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, the FDIC deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole, and not for the protection of shareholders of the Company. Set forth below is a summary description of the significant laws and regulations applicable to the Company and the Bank. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. 

&#160;

Regulatory Agencies 

The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. As a bank holding company, the Company is regulated under the BHC Act, and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the FRB. The Company is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each administered by the SEC. The Company&#146;s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select market (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;) under the trading symbol &#147;TCBK&#148; and the Company is, therefore, subject to the rules of Nasdaq for listed companies. 

The Bank, as a state chartered bank, is subject to broad federal regulation and oversight extending to all its operations by the FDIC and to state regulation by the DBO. 

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#147;CFPB&#148;) as an independent entity with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services. The CFPB&#146;s functions include investigating consumer complaints, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions, including the Bank. Banks with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to examination by the CFPB. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets, including the Bank, continue to be examined for compliance with federal consumer laws by their primary federal banking agency. 

The Bank Holding Company Act 

The Company is registered as a bank holding company under the BHC Act. In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the FRB has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. As a bank holding company, TriCo is required to file reports with the FRB and the FRB periodically examines the Company. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank. Qualified bank holding companies that elect to be financial holding companies may engage in any activity, or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity, that is either (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity or (ii) complementary to a financial activity, and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally (as determined solely by the FRB). Activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and agency, and making merchant banking investments. The Company has not elected to become a financial holding company. 

The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks. The BHC Act requires the prior approval of the FRB for the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of a commercial bank or its parent holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of an acquiring bank&#146;s primary federal regulator is required before it may merge with another bank or purchase the assets or assume the deposits of another bank. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, the bank regulatory authorities will consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position of the combined organization, the applicant&#146;s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act, consumer compliance, fair housing laws and the effectiveness of the subject organizations in combating money laundering activities. 

Safety and Soundness Standards 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (&#147;FDICIA&#148;) implemented certain specific restrictions on transactions and required the regulators to adopt overall safety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal control, loan underwriting and documentation, and asset growth. Among other things, FDICIA limits the interest rates paid on deposits by undercapitalized institutions, the use of brokered deposits and the aggregate extension of credit by a depository institution to an executive officer, director, principal stockholder or related interest, and reduces deposit insurance coverage for deposits offered by undercapitalized institutions for deposits by certain employee benefits accounts. 

&#160;

Section 39 to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the agencies to establish safety and soundness standards for insured financial institutions covering: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; loan documentation; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; credit underwriting; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; interest rate exposure; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; asset growth; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; compensation, fees and benefits; &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; asset quality, earnings and stock valuation; and &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; excessive compensation for executive officers, directors or principal shareholders which could lead to material financial loss. If an agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard established by the guidelines, the agency may require the financial institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If the agency requires submission of a compliance plan and the institution fails to timely submit an acceptable plan or to implement an accepted plan, the agency must require the institution to correct the deficiency. An institution must file a compliance plan within 30 days of a request to do so from the institution&#146;s primary federal regulatory agency. The agencies may elect to initiate enforcement action in certain cases rather than rely on an existing plan particularly where failure to meet one or more of the standards could threaten the safe and sound operation of the institution. 

Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions 

A California corporation such as TriCo may make a distribution to its shareholders to the extent that either the corporation&#146;s retained earnings meet or exceed the amount of the proposed distribution or the value of the corporation&#146;s assets exceed the amount of its liabilities plus the amount of shareholders preferences, if any, and certain other conditions are met. It is the FRB&#146;s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#146;s expected future needs and financial condition. 

The primary source of funds for payment of dividends by TriCo to its shareholders has been and will be the receipt of dividends and management fees from the Bank. TriCo&#146;s ability to receive dividends from the Bank is limited by applicable state and federal law. Under the California Financial Code, funds available for cash dividend payments by a bank are restricted to the lesser of: (i) retained earnings or (ii) the bank&#146;s net income for its last three fiscal years (less any distributions to shareholders made during such period). However, with the prior approval of the Commissioner of the DBO, a bank may pay cash dividends in an amount not to exceed the greatest of the: (1) retained earnings of the bank; (2) net income of the bank for its last fiscal year; or (3) net income of the bank for its current fiscal year. However, if the DBO finds that the shareholders&#146; equity of the bank is not adequate or that the payment of a dividend would be unsafe or unsound, the Commissioner may order the bank not to pay a dividend to shareholders. 

Additionally, under FDICIA, a bank may not make any capital distribution, including the payment of dividends, if after making such distribution the bank would be in any of the &#147;undercapitalized&#148; categories under the FDIC&#146;s Prompt Corrective Action regulations. A bank is undercapitalized for this purpose if its leverage ratios, Tier 1 risk-based capital level and total risk-based capital ratio are not at least four percent, four percent and eight percent, respectively. 

The FRB, FDIC and the DBO have authority to prohibit a bank holding company or a bank from engaging in practices which are considered to be unsafe and unsound. Depending on the financial condition of TriCo and the Bank and other factors, the FRB, FDIC or the DBO could determine that payment of dividends or other payments by TriCo or the Bank might constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. 

The Community Reinvestment Act 

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (&#147;CRA&#148;) requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to periodically assess a bank&#146;s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA also requires the agencies to consider a financial institution&#146;s record of meeting its community credit when evaluating applications for, among other things, domestic branches and mergers or acquisitions. The federal banking agencies rate depository institutions&#146; compliance with the CRA. The ratings range from a high of &#147;outstanding&#148; to a low of &#147;substantial noncompliance.&#148; A less than &#147;satisfactory&#148; rating could result in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved. As of its most recent CRA examination, the Bank&#146;s CRA rating was &#147;Satisfactory.&#148; 

&#160;

Consumer Protection Laws 

The Bank is subject to many federal consumer protection statues and regulations, some of which are discussed below. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Equal Credit Opportunity Act generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction, whether for consumer or business purposes, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (except in limited circumstances), receipt of income from public assistance programs, or good faith exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Truth-in-Lending Act is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Fair Housing Act regulates many practices, including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing-related lending activities against any person because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, handicap or familial status. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which includes a &#147;fair lending&#148; aspect, requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti-discrimination statutes. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibits certain abusive practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts. In addition, the CFPB has taken a number of actions that may affect the Bank&#146;s operations and compliance costs, including the following: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The issuance of final rules for residential mortgage lending, which became effective January 10, 2013, including definitions for &#147;qualified mortgages&#148; and detailed standards by which lenders must satisfy themselves of the borrower&#146;s ability to repay the loan and revised forms of disclosure under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; The issuance of a policy report on arbitration clauses which could result in the restriction or prohibition of lenders including arbitration clauses in consumer financial services contracts. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Actions taken to regulate and supervise credit bureaus and debt collections. &#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; Positions taken by CFPB on fair lending, including applying the disparate impact theory in auto financing, which could make it harder for lenders, such as the Bank, to charge different rates or apply different terms to loans to different customers. Penalties for violations of the above laws may include fines, reimbursements, injunctive relief and other penalties.

Regulatory Capital Requirements 

The Company and the Bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements of the FDIC and the FRB, respectively. Capital requirements may have an effect on the Company&#146;s and the Bank&#146;s profitability and ability to pay dividends. If the Company or the Bank lacks adequate capital to increase its assets without violating the minimum capital requirements or if it forced to reduce the level of its assets in order to satisfy regulatory capital requirements, its ability to generate earnings would be reduced. 

The Company&#146;s and the Bank&#146;s primary federal regulators, the FRB and the FDIC, have adopted guidelines utilizing a risk-based capital structure. Under the risk-based capital rules applicable through December 31, 2014, banking organizations were required to maintain minimum ratios of Tier 1 capital and total capital to total risk- weighted assets (including certain off- balance sheet items, such as letters of credit). Qualifying capital is divided into two tiers. Tier 1 capital consists generally of common stockholders&#146; equity, retained earnings, qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock (at the holding company level) and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. Tier 2 capital consists of, among other things, allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of weighted risk assets, other perpetual preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt, subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, subject to limitations. Tier 2 capital qualifies as part of total capital up to a maximum of 100% of Tier 1 capital. Under these risk-based capital guidelines, the Company is required to maintain total capital equal to at least 8% of its assets, of which at least 4% must be in the form of Tier 1 capital. In addition, the Bank is subject to minimum capital ratios under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action discussed below under &#147;&#151; Prompt Corrective Action.&#148; 

The Company and the Bank are also required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 4% of Tier 1 capital to total assets (the &#147;leverage ratio&#148;). The leverage ratio is determined by dividing an institution&#146;s Tier 1 capital by its quarterly average total assets, less goodwill and certain other intangible assets. The minimum leverage ratio constitutes a minimum requirement for the most well-run banking organizations. See Note 29 in the financial statements at Item 8 of this report for a discussion about the Company&#146;s risk-based capital and leverage ratios. 

&#160;

In July, 2013, the federal banking agencies approved new capital rules implementing the &#147;Basel III&#148; regulatory capital reforms and other changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. &#147;Basel III&#148; refers to capital guidelines adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors/regulators from the major industrialized countries. The new capital rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which are being phased in from 2015 to 2019, and which refine the definition of what constitutes &#147;capital&#148; for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank as of January 1, 2015 under the new capital rules include: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The new capital rules also establish a &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148; above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital. The capital conservation buffer will be phased-in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, as follows: The buffer will be 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. This will result in the following minimum ratios beginning in 2019: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Under the new capital rules, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its common equity capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. 

The new capital rules provide regulators discretion to impose an additional capital buffer, the &#147;countercyclical buffer,&#148; of up to 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to take into account the macro-financial environment and periods of excessive credit growth. However, the countercyclical buffer only applies to larger banks with $250 billion or more in total assets or $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures and is not expected to have an impact on the Company or the Bank. 

The new capital rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with Basel III regarding the various components of Tier 1 capital, including common equity, unrealized gains and losses, as well as certain instruments including trust preferred securities that will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, some of which will be phased out over time. However, the new capital rules provide that depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, such as the Company, will be able to continue to include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 capital prior to May 19, 2010, such as the Company&#146;s Trust Preferred Securities, as Tier 1. This treatment is grandfathered and will apply even if the Company exceeds $15 billion assets due to organic growth. However, if the Company exceeds $15 billion in assets as the result of a merger or acquisition, then the Tier 1 treatment of its outstanding trust preferred securities will be phased out but may still be treated as Tier 2 capital. 

The new capital rules also include changes for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which are being phased in beginning January 1, 2015. The new capital rules utilizes an increased number of credit risk exposure categories and risk weights, and also addresses: (i) an alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act; (ii) revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation; (iii) rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; (iv) revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions; and (v) disclosure requirements for top-tier banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the &#147;advance approach rules&#148; that apply to banks with greater than $250 billion in consolidated assets. 

We believe that we were in compliance with the requirements applicable to us as set forth in the new capital rules as of January 1, 2016. 

Prompt Corrective Action 

Prompt Corrective Action regulations of the federal bank regulatory agencies establish five capital categories in descending order (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized), assignment to which depends upon the institution&#146;s total risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, and leverage ratio. The new capital rules revised the prompt corrective action framework. Under the new prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to complement the capital conservation buffer included in the new capital rules, insured depository institutions will be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as &#147;well capitalized:&#148; (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (increased from 4%). Institutions classified in one of the three undercapitalized categories are subject to certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions, which include increased monitoring and review, implementation of capital restoration plans, asset growth restrictions, limitations upon expansion and new business activities, requirements to augment capital, restrictions upon deposit gathering and interest rates, replacement of senior executive officers and directors, and requiring divestiture or sale of the institution. The Bank has been classified as well-capitalized since adoption of these regulations. 

&#160;

Deposit Insurance 

Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC, generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. The Bank pays deposit insurance assessments based on its consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital. The assessment rate is based on the risk category of the institution. To determine the total base assessment rate, the FDIC first establishes an institution&#146;s initial base assessment rate and then adjusts the initial base assessment based upon an institution&#146;s levels of unsecured debt, secured liabilities, and brokered deposits. The total base assessment rate ranges from 2.5 to 45 basis points of the institution&#146;s average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital. 

The Bank is generally unable to control the amount of premiums that it is required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines, the Bank may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse affect on the Company&#146;s earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of, or market for, the Company&#146;s common stock. 

The FDIC may terminate a depository institution&#146;s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution&#146;s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the DIF or that may prejudice the interest of the bank&#146;s depositors. The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would also result in the revocation of the Bank&#146;s charter by the DBO. 

Interstate Branching 

The Dodd-Frank Act authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Accordingly, banks will be able to enter new markets more freely. 

Anti-Money Laundering Laws 

A series of banking laws and regulations beginning with the bank Secrecy Act in 1970 requires banks to prevent, detect, and report illicit or illegal financial activities to the federal government to prevent money laundering, international drug trafficking, and terrorism. Under the USA Patriot Act of 2001, financial institutions are subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships, requirements regarding the Customer Identification Program, as well as enhanced due diligence and &#147;know your customer&#148; standards in their dealings with high risk customers, foreign financial institutions, and foreign individuals and entities. 

Transactions with Affiliates 

Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders (including the Company) or any related interest of such persons. Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including its holding company, be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies.

Impact of Monetary Policies 

Banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and other borrowings, and the interest rate earned by banks on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets comprises the major source of banks&#146; earnings. Thus, the earnings and growth of banks are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally, both domestic and foreign, and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the FRB. The FRB implements national monetary policy, such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession, by its open-market dealings in United States government securities, by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements and through adjustments to the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks which are members of the FRB. The actions of the FRB in these areas influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates. The nature and timing of any future changes in such policies and their impact on the Company cannot be predicted.
