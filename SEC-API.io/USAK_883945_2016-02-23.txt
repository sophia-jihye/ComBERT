BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

USA Truck is the nation&#39;s twenty-sixth largest truckload carrier based on 2014 operating revenue according to Transport Topics. In 2015, the Company generated $507.9 million in operating revenue and $23.1 million in operating income. As of December 31, 2015, the Company&#8217;s fleet of 1,832 tractors was comprised of 1,568 company tractors and 264 independent contractor tractors. The Company owned 6,200 trailers as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

The Company transports commodities throughout the continental United States and into and out of portions of Canada. USA Truck also transports general commodities into and out of Mexico by allowing through-trailer service from its terminal in Laredo, Texas. In addition to truckload and dedicated freight service offerings, the Company provides freight brokerage and rail intermodal service offerings through its Strategic Capacity Solutions (&#8220;SCS&#8221;) segment. USA Truck is headquartered in Van Buren, Arkansas, with terminals, offices, and staging facilities located throughout the United States. 

&#160; 

The Company has two reportable segments: (i) trucking, consisting of the Company&#8217;s truckload and dedicated freight service offerings and (ii) SCS, consisting of the Company&#8217;s freight brokerage and rail intermodal service offerings. Based on several factors, including the relatively small size of the Company&#8217;s rail intermodal service offering and the interrelationship of the freight brokerage and rail intermodal operations, the Company aggregates its freight brokerage and rail intermodal service offerings into a single reportable segment. Financial information regarding these segments is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Truckload freight services utilize Company-owned equipment or equipment owned by independent contractors for the pick-up and delivery of freight. Truckload services transport freight over irregular routes as a medium-to long-haul common carrier. Dedicated freight services provides similar transportation services, but does so pursuant to agreements whereby the Company makes equipment available to a specific customer for shipments over particular routes at specified times. 

&#160; 

SCS provides services which complement USA Truck&#8217;s trucking services, primarily to existing customers of its trucking segment. SCS represented approximately 30%, 30%, and 25% of USA Truck&#8217;s consolidated operating revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

Long-Term Turnaround Plan 

&#160; 

USA Truck&#8217;s top priorities remain improving its operating performance and increasing stockholder value. The Company&#8217;s long-term turnaround plan has three main components: profitable revenue, operational excellence, and cost effectiveness. During 2015, progress in executing the Company&#8217;s turnaround plan has contributed to a 160 basis point increase in operating margin versus 2014, positive cash flow, and our most profitable year since 2006. During 2014, the Company achieved a 470 basis point improvement in operating margin versus 2013. 

&#160; 

Profitable Revenue: The Company continues to refine its freight network toward a more efficient mix of lanes and markets in its truckload business, particularly focusing on better utilization of Company tractors with an emphasis on key metrics, such as miles per seated truck per week and base trucking revenue per seated truck per week. Base trucking revenue per seated truck per week improved approximately 2.7% during 2015, compared to 2014. 

&#160; 

Operational Excellence and Cost Effectiveness. During 2015, the Company continued to focus on improving customer service and cost reduction initiatives for fuel, maintenance, interest and debt costs, as well as other areas requiring cost containment. During 2015, the Company took steps to streamline and simplify its operations to better align the Company&#39;s cost structure and better serve its customers. In the Company&#39;s trucking segment, the Company closed its maintenance facilities in Denton, Texas and Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Additionally, the Company began to outsource its road assistance function to a third party during the fourth quarter of 2015. These initiatives are expected to improve operating productivity and enhance capacity utilization. The Company recognized approximately $2.7 million (pretax) in restructuring, severance and related charges. Going forward, the Company intends to focus on operational execution initiatives that it believes will improve safety performance, asset productivity, driver retention, fuel economy, maintenance operations and customer service. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The Company continued to make progress in executing its turnaround plan in 2015. Management believes that the Company is well-positioned to complete the turnaround plan of its trucking segment and generate long-term profitability. To increase stockholder value in 2016, the Company expects to evolve from the stated goal of sustained profitability to maximize the profitability of the business segments and increase the Company&#39;s return on invested capital. 

&#160; 

Operations 

&#160; 

The Company focuses significant marketing efforts on customers with premium service requirements and who have consistent shipping needs within USA Truck&#8217;s primary operating areas which are predominantly located in the eastern half of the United States. One or more of the Company&#8217;s service offerings are marketed to customers, with over 90% of the Company&#8217;s top 100 customers utilizing more than one service in 2015. This permits the strategic positioning of available equipment and allows the Company to provide its customers with a full array of transportation solutions. In addition, USA Truck team members have cultivated a thorough understanding of the needs of shippers in key industries. The Company believes this helps it develop long-term, service-oriented relationships with its customers. 

&#160; 

USA Truck has a diversified freight and customer base. During 2015, the Company&#8217;s largest 5, 10, 25 and 50 customers comprised approximately 27%, 38%, 57% and 71% of its revenues, respectively. No single customer generated more than 10% of the Company&#8217;s revenues in 2015. The Company provided service to more than 900 customers in 2015 across all USA Truck service offerings. 

&#160; 

While the Company prefers direct relationship with customers, obtaining shipments through other providers of transportation or logistics services is a significant opportunity. Securing freight through a third party enables USA Truck to provide services for high-volume shippers to which it might not otherwise have access because many of these shippers require their carriers to conduct business with their designated third party logistics provider. 

&#160; 

Customers are billed at or shortly after delivery and, during 2015, receivables collection averaged approximately 38 days from the billing date, compared to an average of approximately 44 days and 40 days during 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in days to collection has resulted from various initiatives including improvements to the Company&#8217;s billing procedures, an increased focus on customers with aged receivables, improving communication with customers and improving efficiency in the Company&#8217;s internal collection process. 

&#160; 

The Company primarily operates in the United States and operates in Mexico and Canada. Most of the Company&#8217;s operating revenue is generated from within the United States. During 2015, 2014 and 2013 approximately 8%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of the Company&#8217;s operating revenue was generated in Mexico and Canada. All Company tractors are domiciled in the United States. The Company does not separately track domestic and foreign long-lived assets. Providing such information would not be meaningful to the business. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s long-lived assets are, and have been for the last three fiscal years, located within the United States. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s trucking segment is supported primarily by driver managers, load planners and customer service representatives. These teams monitor the location of equipment and direct its movement in a safe, efficient and practicable manner. Each driver manager supervises assigned drivers and is the primary contact with the drivers. Load planners assign all available units and loads in a manner designed to maximize profit and minimize costs. Customer service representatives work to fulfill shippers&#8217; needs, solicit freight, and ensure on-time delivery by monitoring loads. The Company makes trucks available for dispatch, selecting profitable freight with a network and yield management focus, and efficiently matches that freight to available truck capacity, all of which the Company strives to achieve without sacrificing customer service, equipment utilization, driver retention or safety. 

&#160; 

The SCS segment has a network of 13 branch offices located throughout the continental United States. The business model is built around the capabilities of Company team members to make available consistent service to customers. The specific locations of branch offices are selected for the availability of talent in those markets. SCS employed approximately 100 people as of December 31, 2015. Most of the SCS team interacts directly with customers, matching customers&#8217; freight needs with available third party capacity in the marketplace. SCS also has staff that screen and select third party carriers that are used to transport the freight.

&#160; (1) 

Excludes 264 independent contractor tractors. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s equipment purchase and replacement decisions are based on a number of factors, including new equipment prices, the used equipment market, demand for freight services, prevailing interest rates, technological improvements, regulatory changes, cost per mile, fuel efficiency, equipment durability, equipment specifications and driver comfort. Therefore, depending on the circumstances, the Company may accelerate or delay the acquisition and disposition of its tractors or trailers from time to time. Generally, USA Truck&#8217;s primary business strategy of fully leveraging the significant capital investment in the current fleet of tractors and trailers requires the Company to strive to maximize the profitability of its existing assets before considering a material increase in the fleet size. 

&#160; 

During 2015, the Company undertook an initiative to downsize the tractor fleet, resulting in a net decrease of approximately 400 tractors as the Company focused on its network, customer profitability and reduce its unsented tractors in its trucking segment. Goals of this initiative were to further improve fuel economy, reduce maintenance costs and improve the reliability of the Company&#8217;s equipment for the benefit of its drivers and customers. 

&#160; 

To simplify driver and mechanic training, control the cost of spare parts and tire inventory and provide for a more efficient vehicle maintenance program, the Company purchases tractors and trailers manufactured to its specifications. The Company has a comprehensive preventive maintenance program designed to minimize equipment downtime and enhance sale or trade-in values. 

&#160; 

The Company finances the purchase of revenue equipment through its cash flows from operations, revolving credit agreement, capital lease arrangements, fair market value lease agreements and proceeds from sales or trades of used equipment. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s tractors and trailers are pledged to secure its obligations under financing arrangements. 

&#160; 

During 2015, all Company and independent contractor tractors were equipped with PeopleNet in-cab technology, enabling two-way communications between the Company and its drivers, through both standardized and freeform messaging, including electronic logging. This enables USA Truck to dispatch drivers efficiently in response to customers&#8217; requests, to provide real-time information to customers about the status of their shipments and to provide documentation supporting various accessorial charges. Accessorial costs are charges to customers for additional services such as loading, unloading or equipment delays. In addition, the Company utilizes satellite-based equipment tracking devices and cargo sensors on virtually all of its trailers. These tracking devices provide the Company with visibility on the locations and load status of its trailers. 

&#160; 

Safety and Risk Management 

&#160; 

The Company emphasizes safe work habits as a core value throughout the entire organization, and provides proactive training and education relating to safety concepts, processes and procedures. The Company conducts pre-employment, random, reasonable suspicion and post-accident alcohol and substance abuse testing in accordance with the Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) regulations and the Company&#8217;s own policies. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Safety training for new drivers begins in orientation, when newly hired team members are taught safe driving and work techniques that emphasize the Company&#8217;s commitment to safety. Upon completion of orientation, new student drivers are required to undergo on-the-road training for four to six weeks with experienced commercial motor vehicle drivers who have been selected for their professionalism and commitment to safety and who are trained to communicate safe driving techniques to new drivers. New drivers who graduate from the program must also successfully complete post-training classroom and road testing before being assigned to their own tractor. Additionally, all Company drivers participate in on-going training that focuses on collision and injury prevention, among other safety concepts. 

&#160; 

The primary risks for which the Company is insured are cargo loss and damage, liability, personal injury, property damage, workers&#8217; compensation and employee medical expenses. USA Truck also self-insures for a portion of claims exposure in each of these areas. The Company&#8217;s self-insurance retention levels are $0.5 million for workers&#8217; compensation claims per occurrence, $0.05 million for cargo loss and damage claims per occurrence and $1.0 million for bodily injury and property damage claims per occurrence. For medical benefits, the Company self-insures up to $0.25 million per plan participant per year with an aggregate claim exposure limit determined by the Company&#8217;s year-to-date claims experience and its number of covered team members. The Company maintains insurance above the amounts for which it self-insures, to certain limits, with licensed insurance carriers. The Company has excess general, auto and employer&#8217;s liability coverage in amounts substantially exceeding minimum legal requirements. The Company is completely self-insured for physical damage to its own tractors and trailers, except that the Company carries catastrophic physical damage coverage to protect against natural disasters. 

&#160; 

Although the Company believes the aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims, it is possible that one or more claims could exceed the Company&#8217;s aggregate coverage limits. An unexpected loss or changing conditions in the insurance market could adversely affect premium levels. As a result, the Company&#8217;s insurance and claims expense could increase, or USA Truck could raise its self-insured retention or decrease the Company&#8217;s aggregate coverage limits when its policies are renewed or replaced. If these costs increase, if reserves are increased, if claims in excess of coverage limits are experienced, or if a claim is experienced where coverage is not provided, the Company&#8217;s results of operations and financial condition in any one quarter or annual period could be materially and adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Team Members 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 2,300 team members, of which about 73% were Company drivers. No team members are subject to union contracts or part of a collective bargaining unit. The Company believes team member relations to be good. 

&#160; 

Recruitment, training, and retention of a professional driver workforce, the Company&#8217;s most valuable asset, are essential to the Company&#8217;s continued growth and meeting the service requirements of its customers. USA Truck hires qualified professional drivers who hold a valid commercial driver&#8217;s license, satisfy applicable federal and state safety performance and measurement requirements, and meet USA Truck&#8217;s hiring parameters. These guidelines relate primarily to safety history, road test evaluations, and various other evaluations, which include physical examinations and mandatory drug and alcohol testing. In order to attract and retain safe drivers who are committed to customer service and safety, the Company focuses its operations for drivers around a collaborative and supportive team environment. The Company provides comfortable, late model equipment, direct communication with senior management, competitive wages and benefits, and other incentives designed to encourage driver safety, retention, and long-term employment. The Company values its relationship with its drivers and structures its driver retention model with a focus on a long-term career with USA Truck. Drivers are compensated on a per mile basis, based on the length of haul and a predetermined number of miles. Drivers are also compensated for additional services provided to customers. Drivers and other employees are encouraged to participate in the Company&#8217;s 401(k) program, and Company-sponsored health, life, and dental plans. The Company believes these factors help in attracting, recruiting, and retaining professional drivers in a competitive driver market. 

&#160; 

Independent Contractors 

&#160; 

In addition to Company drivers, USA Truck enters into contracts with independent contractors, who provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile. The Company intends to continue to grow the use of independent contractors. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had contracts with 264 independent contractors, representing an increase of approximately 28% compared to the prior year. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The trucking industry includes both private fleets and for-hire carriers. Private fleets consist of trucks owned and operated by shippers that move their own goods. For-hire carriers include both truckload and less-than-truckload operations. The for-hire segment is highly competitive and includes thousands of carriers, none of which dominates the market. This segment is characterized by many small carriers having revenues of less than $1 million per year and as few as one truck and relatively few carriers with revenues exceeding $100 million per year. 

&#160; 

USA Truck competes primarily with other truckload carriers, private fleets and, to a lesser extent, railroads and less-than-truckload carriers. A number of truckload carriers have greater financial resources, own more revenue equipment and carry a larger volume of freight than USA Truck. The principal competitive factors in the truckload segment of the industry are service and price, with rate discounting becoming particularly important during economic downturns. USA Truck&#8217;s focus is to differentiate itself primarily on the basis of service rather than rates. Although an increase in the size of the market would benefit all truckload carriers, management believes that successful carriers are likely to grow by offering additional services to its customers based on customer needs and acquiring a greater market share. 

&#160; 

Environmental Regulation 

&#160; 

EPA regulations limiting exhaust emissions became more restrictive in 2010. In 2010, an executive memorandum was signed directing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (&#8220;NHTSA&#8221;) and the EPA to develop new, stricter fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks. In 2011, the NHTSA and the EPA adopted final rules that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. These standards apply to model years 2014 to 2018, which are required to achieve an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by 2018, and equates to approximately four gallons of fuel for every 100 miles traveled. In addition, in February 2014, President Obama announced that his administration will begin developing the next phase of tighter fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and directed the EPA and NHTSA to develop new fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards by March 31, 2016. In response, in June 2015, the EPA and NHTSA jointly proposed new stricter standards that would apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and tractors beginning with model year 2021. After an extended comment period ending in October 2015, a final rule has not yet been published. If this rule or a similar rule was enacted, the Company believes these requirements could result in increased new tractor prices and additional parts and maintenance costs incurred to retrofit its tractors with technology to achieve compliance with such standards, which could adversely affect its operating results and profitability, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. The Company cannot predict, however, the extent to which its operations and productivity will be impacted. 

&#160; 

The California Air Resource Board (&#8220;CARB&#8221;) also has adopted emission control regulations which will be applicable to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the state of California. The tractors and trailers subject to these regulations must be either EPA Smart Way certified or equipped with low-rolling, resistance tires and retrofitted with Smart Way-approved aerodynamic technologies. Enforcement of these CARB regulations for model year 2011 equipment began in 2010 and will be phased in over several years for older equipment. The Company currently purchases Smart Way certified equipment in its new tractor and trailer acquisitions. Federal and state lawmakers also have proposed potential limits on carbon emissions under a variety of other climate-change proposals. Compliance with such regulations may increase the cost of new tractors and trailers, may require USA Truck to retrofit its equipment, and could impair equipment productivity and increase the Company&#8217;s operating expenses. These adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual value of these vehicles, could materially increase USA Truck&#8217;s operating expenses or otherwise adversely affect its business or operations. 

&#160; 

Other Regulation 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s operations are regulated and licensed by various United States federal and state, Canadian provincial, and Mexican federal agencies. Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. Matters such as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to United States federal and state regulation and Canadian provincial regulations. The Company operates in the United States pursuant to operating authority granted by the DOT, in various Canadian provinces pursuant to operating authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications in such provinces, and within Mexico pursuant to operating authority granted by Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes. To the extent that the Company conducts operations outside the United States, it is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining favorable treatment. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the &#8220;FMCSA&#8221;), imposes safety and fitness regulations on the Company and its drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours-of-service. In December 2011, the FMCSA published its 2011 Hours-of-Service Final Rule (the &#8220;2011 Rule&#8221;). The 2011 Rule requires drivers to take 30-minute breaks after eight hours of consecutive driving and reduces the total number of hours a driver is permitted to work during each week from 82 hours to 70 hours. The 2011 Rule provides that the 34-hour restart may only be used once per week and must include two rest periods between one a.m. and five a.m. (together, the &#8220;2011 Restart Restrictions&#8221;). These rule changes became effective in July 2013. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, the 2015 Omnibus Appropriations bill was signed into law. Among other things, the legislation provided temporary relief from the 2011 Restart Restrictions, and essentially reverted back to the more straight forward 34-hour restart rule that was in effect before the 2011 Rule became effective. In 2016, Congress is expected to consider a study conducted by the FMCSA related to the 2011 Restart Restrictions. Congressional action based on the findings of the study could result in a reinstatement or continued suspension of the 2011 Restart Restrictions. If the 2011 Restart Restrictions are reinstated, the Company may experience a decrease in production similar to that experienced during 2013 and 2014 when the 2011 Restart Restrictions were in effect. 

&#160; 

There are two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers. The first method is the application of a safety rating that is based on an onsite investigation and affects a carrier&#8217;s ability to operate in interstate commerce. The Company currently has a satisfactory DOT safety rating under this method, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If USA Truck were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s business, as some of its existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating. In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining a revised safety rating measurement system, which would replace the current methodology. Under the proposed rules, the current three safety ratings of &#8220;satisfactory,&#8221; &#8220;conditional,&#8221; and &#8220;unsatisfactory&#8221; would be replaced with a single safety rating of &#8220;unfit.&#8221; Moreover, data from roadside inspections and the results from all investigations would be used to determine a carrier&#8217;s fitness on an ongoing basis. This would replace the current methodology of determining a carrier&#8217;s fitness based solely on infrequent comprehensive onsite reviews. The proposed rules will undergo a 90-day public comment period, after which, a final rule could either be published or become subject to further legislative reviews and delays. Therefore, it is uncertain if or when these proposed rules could take effect. 

&#160; 

In addition to the safety rating system, the FMCSA has adopted the Compliance Safety Accountability program (&#8220;CSA&#8221;) as an additional safety enforcement and compliance model that evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program analyzes data from roadside inspections, moving violations, crash reports from the last two years, and investigation results. The data is organized into seven categories. Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (e.g., crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. Currently, these scores do not have a direct impact on a carrier&#8217;s safety rating. However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may (i) affect driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, (ii) cause USA Truck&#8217;s customers to direct their business away from the Company and to carriers with higher fleet safety rankings, (iii) subject the Company to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, or (iv) cause the Company to incur greater than expected expenses in its attempts to improve unfavorable scores, any of which could adversely affect the Company&#8217;s results of operations and profitability. 

&#160; 

Under CSA, these scores were initially made available to the public in five of the seven categories. However, pursuant to the FAST Act, which was signed into law in December 2015, the FMCSA is required to remove from public view the previously available CSA scores while it reviews the reliability of the scoring system. During this period of review by the FMCSA, the Company will continue to have access to its own scores and will still be subject to intervention by the FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. Currently, the Company is exceeding the established intervention thresholds in one of the seven categories of CSA, in comparison to its peer group; however, the Company continues to maintain a satisfactory rating with the DOT. The Company will continue to promote improvement of scores in all seven categories with ongoing reviews of all safety-related policies, programs and procedures for their effectiveness. 

&#160; 

In 2011, the FMCSA issued new rules that would require nearly all carriers, including USA Truck, to install and use electronic on-board recording devices (&#8220;EOBRs,&#8221; now referred to as electronic logging devices, or &#8220;ELDs&#8221;) in their tractors to electronically monitor truck miles and enforce hours-of-service. These rules, however, were vacated by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2011. The final rule related to mandatory use of ELDs was published in December 2015, and requires the use of ELDs by nearly all carriers by December 10, 2017. The Company has proactively installed ELDs on 100% of its tractor fleet. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, federal, state and municipal authorities implemented and continue to implement various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. The Transportation Security Administration (the &#8220;TSA &#8221;) has adopted regulations that require determination by the TSA that each driver who applies for or renews his license for carrying hazardous materials is not a security threat. This could reduce the pool of qualified drivers, which could require USA Truck to increase driver compensation, limit fleet growth, or allow trucks to sit idle. These regulations also could complicate the successful pairing of available equipment with hazardous material shipments, thereby increasing the Company&#8217;s response time and deadhead miles on customer shipments. Consequently, it is possible that the Company may fail to meet the needs of its customers or may incur increased expenses. 

&#160; 

In November 2015, the FMCSA published its final rule related to driver coercion, which took effect on January 29, 2016. Under this rule, carriers, shippers, receivers, or transportation intermediaries that are found to have coerced drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations (including hours-of-service rules) may be fined up to $16,000 for each offense. The FMCSA and certain legislators have proposed other rules that may be published as early as 2016, including (i) the use of speed limiting devices on heavy duty trucks to restrict maximum speeds, (ii) the creation of a national clearinghouse so employers and prospective employers could query to determine if current or prospective drivers have had any drug/alcohol positives or refusals, and (iii) an increase in the allowable length of twin trailers from 28 feet to 33 feet. If these rules take effect, they could result in a decrease in fleet production, driver availability, and freight tonnage available to full truckload carriers, all of which could adversely affect USA Truck&#8217;s business or operations.

Seasonality 

&#160; 

In the trucking industry, revenue has historically followed a seasonal pattern for various commodities and customer businesses. Peak freight demand has historically occurred in the months of September, October and November. After the December holiday season and during the remaining winter months, freight volumes are typically lower as many customers reduce shipment levels. Operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs attributed to adverse winter weather conditions. The Company has historically attempted and expects to continue to attempt to minimize the impact of seasonality through its diverse customer solutions offerings by seeking additional freight from certain customers during traditionally slower shipping periods and focusing on transporting consumer nondurable products. Revenue can and may also be impacted by weather, holidays and the number of business days that occur during a given period, as revenue is directly related to the available working days of shippers.
