Overview 

&#160; 

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for the treatment of acute pain. Our lead product candidates, ARX-04 and Zalviso, utilize sublingual sufentanil, delivered via a non-invasive route of administration. We intend to commercialize our product candidates in the United States and license the development and commercialization rights to our product candidates for sale outside of the United States through strategic partnerships and collaborations. We may also consider the option to enter into strategic partnerships for our product candidates in the United States. 

&#160; 

We have chosen sufentanil as the therapeutic ingredient for all of our product candidates. Opioids have been utilized for pain relief for centuries and are the standard of care for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. Sufentanil is available as an injectable in several markets around the world and is used by anesthesiologists for induction of sedation or as an epidural; however, the injectable formulation is not suitable for the treatment of acute pain. The Company has created a proprietary sublingual (under the tongue) formulation of sufentanil intended for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. The sublingual formulation retains the therapeutic value of sufentanil and novel delivery devices provide a non-invasive route of administration. Sufentanil is highly lipophilic which provides for rapid absorption in the mucosal tissue, or fatty cells, found under the tongue, and for rapid transit across the blood-brain barrier to reach the mu-opioid receptors in the brain. The sublingual delivery used by ARX-04 and Zalviso provides a recognized onset of analgesia. The sublingual delivery system also eliminates the risk of intravenous, or IV, complications, such as catheter-related infections. In addition, because patients do not require direct connection to an IV infusion pump, ARX-04 and Zalviso allow for ease of patient mobility. 

&#160; 

ARX-04 (sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg) 

&#160; 

ARX-04 is an investigational product candidate consisting of a single 30 mcg sufentanil sublingual tablet delivered via a disposable, pre-filled, single-dose applicator, or SDA. We are developing ARX-04 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain to be administered by a healthcare professional to a patient in medically supervised settings. If approved, examples of potential patient populations and settings in which ARX-04 could be used include: emergency room patients; patients who are recovering from short-stay or ambulatory surgery and do not require more long-term patient-controlled analgesia; post-operative patients who are transitioning from the operating room to the recovery floor; patients being treated and transported by paramedics; and for battlefield casualties. 

&#160; 

In September 2015, we reported that SAP301, a pivotal Phase 3 multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ARX-04, met the primary (summed pain intensity, or SPID, over 12 hours, or SPID-12) and secondary endpoints in the short-term treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain following ambulatory abdominal surgery. 

&#160; 

In October 2015, we initiated SAP302, an open-label Phase 3 study of ARX-04 for the treatment of adult patients who present in the emergency room with moderate-to-severe acute pain associated with trauma or injury. Based on discussions with the FDA, we have amended the protocol for SAP302 to allow for multiple dosing of ARX-04. We are planning to enroll up to an additional 60 patients in the extension phase of the SAP302 study. The SAP302 study is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

In December 2015, we, along with representatives from our partner at the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, held a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to review plans for an NDA for ARX-04. Based on discussions with the FDA, we intend to increase the safety database by expanding the clinical program for ARX-04 by approximately 160 additional patients to include individuals from specific populations and settings. Enrollment in the ongoing SAP302 open-label study in the emergency room will be increased, as described above, and a new study, known as SAP303, was initiated in March 2016 in post-operative patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain. SAP303 will focus on enrolling patients greater than 40 years of age and will allow for administration of ARX-04 for up to 12 hours. With these modifications, assuming successful completion of SAP302 and SAP303 by the third quarter of 2016, we anticipate submitting the NDA for ARX-04 in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The FDA has also agreed to allow us to include as supporting safety information in the NDA for ARX-04, data from approximately 323 patients treated in the Zalviso clinical studies who had administered two 15 mcg tablets 20-to-25 minutes apart. AcelRx had previously completed and analyzed pharmacokinetic and modeling data, which demonstrated the equivalency of one ARX-04 sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg, to two sufentanil sublingual tablets, 15 mcg, taken 20-to-25 minutes apart. 

&#160; 

In the fall of 2015, we had informal scientific advice meetings regarding the planned Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, filing for ARX-04. Divergent advice was received regarding the need for an additional active comparator clinical study for product registration in the European Union, or EU. Accordingly, we plan to meet with three additional health authorities in April 2016 to further clarify the need for such a study. 

&#160; 

On May 11, 2015, we entered into an award contract supported by the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command, or USAMRMC, within the DoD, in which the DoD agreed to provide up to $17.0 million to support the development of ARX-04, referred to as the DoD Contract. Under the terms of the contract, the DoD will reimburse us for costs incurred for development, manufacturing, regulatory and clinical costs outlined in the contract in order to submit an NDA to the FDA, including reimbursement for certain personnel and overhead expenses. The period of performance under the DoD Contract began on May 11, 2015. The contract gives the DoD the option to extend the term of the contract and provide additional funding. On March 2, 2016, the DoD Contract was amended to approve enrollment of additional patients in the SAP302 study, approve the addition of the SAP303 study, and extend the contract period of performance by four months from November 10, 2016 to March 9, 2017, to accommodate the increased SAP302 patient enrollment and the SAP303 study. The costs for these changes will be absorbed within the current contract value. If ARX-04 is approved by the FDA, the DoD has the option to purchase a certain number of units of commercial product pursuant to the terms of the contract. 

&#160;

Zalviso&#8482; (sufentanil sublingual tablet system) 

&#160; 

Our U.S. product candidate, Zalviso, is intended for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in hospitalized adult patients. Zalviso consists of sufentanil sublingual tablets, 15 mcg, delivered by the Zalviso System, a needle-free, handheld, patient-administered, pain management system, or together, Zalviso. While still under development in the U.S., as discussed further below, Zalviso is approved in the EU. 

&#160; 

Zalviso is an investigational pre-programmed, non-invasive, secure system to allow hospital patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain to self-dose with sufentanil sublingual tablets, 15 mcg, to manage their pain. Zalviso is designed to help address certain problems associated with post-operative intravenous patient-controlled analgesia, or IV PCA, such as the risk of programming errors and complications associated with IV delivery of pharmaceuticals. 

&#160; 

On December 16, 2013, AcelRx and Gr&#252;nenthal entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, which was amended effective July 17, 2015, or the Amended License Agreement, which grants Gr&#252;nenthal rights to commercialize Zalviso in the countries of the EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway and Australia, or the Territory, for human use in pain treatment within or dispensed by hospitals, hospices, nursing homes and other medically-supervised settings, or the Field. We retain rights with respect to Zalviso in countries outside the Territory, including the United States, Asia and Latin America. In September 2015, the European Commission approved the MAA for Zalviso for the management of acute moderate-to-severe post-operative pain in adult patients. The approval allows Gr&#252;nenthal to market Zalviso in the 28 EU member states as well as in the European Economic Area countries of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, or EEA. 

&#160; 

Under the terms of the Amended License Agreement, we received an upfront cash payment of $30.0 million in December 2013, a milestone payment of $5.0 million related to the MAA submission to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in the third quarter of 2014, and an additional milestone payment of $15.0 million related to the EC approval of the MAA for Zalviso in the third quarter of 2015. In addition, we are eligible to receive approximately $194.5 million in additional milestone payments, based upon successful regulatory and product development efforts ($28.5 million) and net sales target achievements ($166.0 million). Gr&#252;nenthal will also make tiered royalty, supply and trademark fee payments in the mid-teens up to the mid-twenties percent range, depending on the sales level achieved, on net sales of Zalviso in the Territory. A portion of the tiered royalty payment, exclusive of the supply and trademark fee payments, will be paid to PDL in connection with the Royalty Monetization, as discussed below. 

&#160;

Also on December 16, 2013, we entered into the related Manufacture and Supply Agreement with Gr&#252;nenthal, which was amended effective July 17, 2015, or the Amended MSA, and together with the Amended License Agreement, the Amended Agreements. Under the Amended MSA, we will exclusively manufacture and supply Zalviso to Gr&#252;nenthal for the Field in the Territory. For additional information on the Amended Agreements, see Note 6 &#8220;Collaboration Agreement&#8221; in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

On September 18, 2015, we sold a portion of the expected royalty stream and commercial milestones from the sales of Zalviso in the EU and EEA by Gr&#252;nenthal to PDL, or the Royalty Monetization. AcelRx received gross proceeds of $65.0 million in the Royalty Monetization. PDL will receive 75% of the European royalties under the Amended License Agreement with Gr&#252;nenthal, as well as 80% of the first four commercial milestones worth $35.6 million (or 80% of $44.5 million), subject to the capped amount of $195.0 million. For additional information on the Royalty Monetization with PDL, see Note 8 &#8220;Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties&#8221; in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

We submitted an NDA for Zalviso in September 2013, which the FDA accepted for filing in December 2013. On July 25, 2014, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, for the Zalviso NDA. The CRL contains requests for additional information on the Zalviso System to ensure proper use of the device. The requests include submission of data demonstrating a reduction in the incidence of optical system errors, changes to address inadvertent dosing, among other items, and submission of additional data to support the shelf life of the product. Although there were no requests for additional clinical studies in the CRL, in March 2015, we received correspondence from the FDA stating that, in addition to the work we had performed to address the items in the CRL, a clinical study would be required to test the modifications to the Zalviso device. 

&#160; 

Our IAP312 study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of changes made to enhance performance of the Zalviso device and takes into account comments from the FDA on the protocol. The IAP312 study will include approximately 315 post-operative patients and collect information requested by the Division to supplement the three positive Phase 3 trials already completed. AcelRx plans to initiate the study in the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

IAP312 is an open-label Phase 3 study and will enroll adult post-operative patients who will self-administer sufentanil sublingual tablets, 15 mcg, using Zalviso for 24-to-72 hours. Patients will self-administer a tablet as often as once every 20 minutes to manage their moderate-to-severe acute pain. The study will measure the rate of device errors, including the failure to dispense medication, as well as the incidence of any misplaced or dropped tablets. Efficacy pain measurements and safety data will also be collected in the study. The results of the study, including the actual device failure rate and the number of misplaced or dropped tablets, will be subject to final review by the FDA. There can be no assurance that the results of the study will be sufficient to address the issues raised by the Division, or that the Zalviso NDA, once resubmitted, will be approved. 

&#160; 

The initial 505(b)(2) NDA submission for Zalviso was based on a development program that included data from seven Phase 1 clinical studies, three Phase 2 clinical trials, and three Phase 3 clinical trials. The Phase 3 trial program included two placebo-controlled efficacy and safety trials and one open-label active comparator trial, in which Zalviso was compared to IV PCA with morphine. To date, the Zalviso safety database includes more than 600 patients. Zalviso successfully achieved the primary efficacy endpoints for each of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. A summary of the Phase 3 trials completed to-date, and the results, follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Active comparator trial (IAP309) &#8212;in November 2012, we reported top-line data demonstrating that Zalviso met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in a Phase 3 open-label active comparator trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Zalviso (15 mcg/dose, 20 minute lock-out) to IV PCA with morphine (1mg/dose, 6 minute lock-out) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute post-operative pain immediately following major abdominal or orthopedic surgery. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, abdominal surgery trial (IAP310) &#8212;in March 2013, we reported top-line data demonstrating that Zalviso met its primary endpoint in a pivotal Phase 3 trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Zalviso to placebo in the management of moderate-to-severe acute post-operative pain after major open abdominal surgery. Adverse events reported in the trial were generally mild or moderate in nature and similar in both placebo and treatment groups. Utilizing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this pivotal Phase 3 trial enrolled 178 adult patients at 13 U.S. sites. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, orthopedic surgery trial (IAP311) &#8212;in May 2013, we reported top-line data demonstrating that Zalviso met its primary endpoint in a pivotal Phase 3 trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Zalviso to placebo in the management of moderate-to-severe acute post-operative pain after major orthopedic surgery. Utilizing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this pivotal Phase 3 trial enrolled 426 adult patients at 34 U.S. sites. Treatment-emergent adverse events were generally mild-to-moderate in nature and similar for the majority of adverse events between Zalviso and placebo-treated patients, despite the shorter duration of exposure in the placebo-treated patients caused by early termination due to inadequate analgesia. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

ARX-03 

&#160;

In addition to ARX-04 and Zalviso, our product candidate pipeline consists of another sufentanil-based sublingual product candidate. The sufentanil/triazolam sublingual tablet, or ARX-03, is a single, fixed-dose, combination drug product designed to provide mild sedation, anxiety reduction and pain relief for patients undergoing painful procedures in a physician&#8217;s office. We have successfully completed Phase 2 clinical trials for ARX-03. Future development of ARX-03 is contingent on funding from a corporate partnership or other external funding source. 

&#160; 

ARX-02 

&#160;

We have made a strategic decision to focus our pipeline on products delivered in medically-supervised settings and since ARX-02 (Sufentanil Sublingual Tablet BTP Management System) would be used in a broader setting and was not actively being developed, the Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for ARX-02 was withdrawn. 

&#160; 

Sufentanil Sublingual Tablets 

&#160;

Sufentanil, a high therapeutic index opioid, which has no active metabolites, is 5 to 10 times more potent than fentanyl and is used intravenously as a primary anesthetic to produce balanced general anesthesia for surgery, and for epidural administration during labor and delivery. Sufentanil has many pharmacological advantages over other opioids. Published studies demonstrate that sufentanil produces significantly less respiratory depressive effects relative to its analgesic effects compared to other opioids, including morphine and fentanyl. These third-party clinical results correlate well with preclinical trials demonstrating sufentanil&#8217;s high therapeutic index, or the ratio of the toxic dose to the therapeutic dose of a drug, used as a measure of the relative safety of the drug for a particular treatment. Accordingly, we believe that sufentanil can be developed to provide an effective and well-tolerated treatment for acute pain. The following table illustrates the difference between the therapeutic index of different opioids. &#160; 

Opioid 

&#160; Therapeutic 

&#160; Meperidine 

&#160; &#160; 5 &#160; Methadone 

&#160; &#160; 12 &#160; Morphine 

&#160; &#160; 71 &#160; Hydromorphone 

&#160; &#160; 250 &#160; Fentanyl 

&#160; &#160; 277 &#160; Sufentanil 

&#160; &#160; 26,716 &#160; &#160; 

In addition, the pharmaceutical attributes of sufentanil, including lipid solubility and ionization, result in rapid cell membrane penetration and onset of action, which we believe make sufentanil an optimal opioid for the treatment of acute pain. 

&#160; 

Although the analgesic efficacy and safety of sufentanil have been well established, the product&#8217;s use has been historically limited due to its short duration of action when delivered intravenously. Sublingual delivery of sufentanil avoids the high peak plasma levels and short duration of action of IV administration. 

&#160;

Our portfolio of product candidates leverages the above-mentioned advantages of sufentanil delivered via the sublingual route. We believe our non-invasive, proprietary sufentanil tablet sublingual dosage form potentially overcomes many of the limitations of current treatment options available for moderate-to-severe acute pain. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

None of our product candidates have been approved by the FDA. 

We have not generated any revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates.

&#160; 

&#160;

This product candidate has not been approved by the FDA. We have not generated any revenue from the sale of any of our product candidates. 

The Market Opportunity for ARX-04 

&#160;

We believe that ARX-04 could be useful in a variety of medically supervised settings, including emergency room patients; patients who are recovering from short-stay or ambulatory surgery and do not require more long-term patient-controlled analgesia; post-operative patients who are transitioning from the operating room to the recovery floor; patients being treated and transported by paramedics; and for battlefield casualties. According to the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, or NEDS, there were more than 109 million adult emergency room visits in the United States during 2011, of which we estimate more than 51 million were associated with moderate-to-severe acute pain. Based on the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery, in 2006, an estimated 30 million adult patients underwent outpatient surgical procedures in the United States, of which we estimate more than 12 million patients experienced moderate-to-severe acute pain. According to the National Inpatient Sample, in 2011, more than 16 million adult patients in the United States underwent surgical procedures in an inpatient setting, of which we estimate more than 8 million resulted in moderate-to-severe acute pain. In the EU, we estimate that there were more than 95 million adult emergency room visits, of which more than 36 million were associated with moderate-to-severe acute pain. Also in the EU, we estimate 13 million adult patients underwent outpatient surgical procedures, and of these, nearly 3 million patients experienced moderate-to-severe acute pain, while more than 18 million adult patients underwent surgical procedures in an inpatient setting in the EU, of which we estimate more than 9 million of these procedures resulted in moderate-to-severe acute pain. In the EU, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In addition, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. If we are unable to achieve premium pricing for ARX-04 in the EU and/or the United States, the profitability of ARX04, if approved, may be negatively impacted. 

&#160; 

How ARX-04 Addresses the Unmet Medical Need for Moderate-to-Severe Acute Pain 

&#160;

ARX-04 is a proprietary, non-invasive, investigational product candidate consisting of a single 30 mcg sufentanil sublingual tablet delivered via a disposable, pre-filled SDA. We are developing ARX-04 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain to be administered by a healthcare professional in medically supervised settings. Our proprietary sufentanil sublingual tablet technology enables rapid sublingual absorption when the tablet is placed under the tongue. As a result, sufentanil sublingual tablets can provide recognized onset of analgesia and display a consistent pharmacokinetic profile due to a high percentage of drug being absorbed sublingually instead of through the gastrointestinal tract. If approved, examples of potential patient populations and settings where ARX-04 could be used include: emergency room patients; patients who are recovering from short-stay or ambulatory surgery and do not require more long-term patient-controlled analgesia; post-operative patients who are transitioning from the operating room to the recovery floor; patients being transported by paramedics; and battlefield casualties. In the emergency room and in ambulatory care environments, patients often do not have immediate IV access available, or maintaining IV access can be an impediment to rapid discharge. Oral pills and liquids generally have slow and erratic onset of analgesia. Moreover, IV dosing results in high peak plasma levels, thereby limiting the opioid dose and requiring frequent redosing intervals to titrate to satisfactory analgesia. Based on internal market research conducted to date, we believe that additional treatment options are needed that can safely and rapidly treat acute trauma pain, in both civilian and military settings. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Phase 3 Clinical Program for ARX-04 

&#160; 

In September 2015, we reported that SAP301, a pivotal Phase 3 multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ARX-04 that evaluated the efficacy and safety of ARX-04 vs. placebo for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain following ambulatory abdominal surgery, met its primary and secondary endpoints. Results demonstrated that patients receiving ARX-04 administered via a disposable, pre-filled SDA, experienced significantly greater pain reduction compared to placebo, as measured by the SPID-12 (p&#60;0.001). Adverse events reported in the study were typical of opioid therapy and were similar for patients treated with ARX-04 and placebo, the most common of which were nausea, headache and vomiting. SAP301 is considered the second of two pivotal placebo-controlled studies required to be included in the NDA submission. 

&#160; &#160; 

The Phase 3 SAP301 trial enrolled adult patients undergoing outpatient abdominal surgery procedures at four clinical sites in the United States. Following surgery, 163 patients were randomized to receive either ARX-04, or placebo, in a 2:1 active to placebo ratio. ARX-04, or placebo, was administered by site staff as requested by the patient, but not more than once per hour. The intent-to-treat, or ITT, population in this study averaged 40.9 years of age with an average Body Mass Index of 27.5, and had a higher percent of females to males (68%:32%). Eighty-nine percent of patients entering the study completed the 24-hour study period. 

&#160; &#160; 

The primary endpoint of the study was the difference in the SPID-12 score of patients receiving ARX-04 compared to those receiving placebo. SPID&#8209; 12 scores were +25.8 for ARX-04-treated patients and +13.1 for placebo-treated patients; the difference between the two groups being highly statistically significant (p&#60;0.001). Notably, the difference in pain intensity from baseline was superior for ARX-04 over placebo at the earliest time point measured (15 minutes; p=0.002). Secondary efficacy endpoints were also superior for ARX-04 compared to placebo. 

&#160; 

There were two SAEs reported during the study period, both of which were in the placebo group and resulted in early termination of the affected patients. No patient in the ARX-04 group dropped out of the study prior to 24 hours due to an adverse event. A lower percent of patients treated with ARX-04 dropped out of the study prior to 24 hours due to lack of efficacy compared to the placebo group (3.7% and 18.5%, respectively; p=0.002). 

&#160; 

In October 2015, we announced the initiation of an open-label Phase 3 study, SAP302, of ARX-04 for the treatment of adult patients who present in the emergency room with moderate-to-severe acute pain associated with trauma or injury. The primary efficacy endpoint is the summed pain intensity difference, or SPID, over 1-hour, or SPID-1. Safety endpoints, such as adverse events and vital signs will also be assessed, as will the patients&#8217; and healthcare providers&#8217; satisfaction with the method of pain control. Based on a pre-NDA meeting held with the FDA in December 2015, we have amended the protocol for SAP302 to allow for multiple dosing of ARX-04. We are planning to enroll an additional 60 patients in the extension phase of the SAP302 study. The SAP302 study is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

As mentioned above, we met with the FDA in December 2015 to review plans for an NDA for ARX-04. Based on feedback from the FDA, we intend to increase the safety database by expanding the clinical program for ARX-04 by approximately 160 additional patients to include individuals from specific populations and settings. Enrollment in the ongoing SAP302 open-label study in the emergency room will continue, and a new study, known as SAP303, was initiated in March 2016 in post-operative patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain. SAP303 will focus on enrolling patients greater than 40 years of age and will allow for administration of ARX-04 for up to 12 hours. With these modifications, assuming successful completion of SAP302 and SAP303 by the third quarter of 2016, AcelRx anticipates submitting the NDA for ARX-04 in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

The FDA has also agreed to allow us to include as supporting safety information in the NDA for ARX-04, data from approximately 323 patients treated in the Zalviso clinical studies who had administered two sufentanil sublingual 15 mcg tablets 20-to-25 minutes apart. AcelRx had previously completed and analyzed pharmacokinetic and modeling data, which demonstrated the equivalency of one sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg, to two sufentanil sublingual tablets, 15 mcg, taken 20-to-25 minutes apart. 

&#160; 

In June 2014, we completed a pharmacokinetic study in support of the ARX-04 development program. In this study of healthy volunteers, it was shown that two sublingual administrations of a Zalviso sufentanil sublingual tablet, 15 mcg, dosed 20 minutes apart were comparable, in terms of AUC exposure and peak plasma concentration, to one sublingual administration of sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Phase 2 Clinical Trial for ARX-04 

&#160; 

In April 2013, we announced top-line results demonstrating that a placebo-controlled, dose-finding, Phase 2 trial of our investigational single-dose sufentanil sublingual tablet for acute pain, ARX-04, successfully met its primary endpoint. Results demonstrated that patients receiving ARX-04 administered by a healthcare professional, no more frequently than once per hour, had significantly greater pain reduction as measured by SPID-12 than placebo-treated patients (+6.53 for ARX-04-treated patients and -7.12 for placebo-treated patients; p=0.003). The sufentanil sublingual 20 mcg tablet-treated patients did not achieve SPID-12 scores that differentiated from placebo. Adverse events reported in the study were generally mild-to-moderate in nature, with two serious adverse events of post-surgical infection reported, both of which were determined by the investigator to be unrelated to study drug. This dose-ranging study randomized 101 patients following bunionectomy surgery in a 2:2:1 ratio to sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg, sufentanil sublingual tablet, 20 mcg, or placebo treatment arms. The intent-to-treat, or ITT, population in this study averaged 42.5 years of age and was evenly balanced for males and females (51%:49%). Ninety-one percent of patients entering the study completed the full 12-hour study period. 

&#160; 

A number of secondary endpoints were also achieved, as follows: 

&#160; 

For the time-weighted sum of pain relief scores over the 12-hour study period, or TOTPAR12, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of the 30 mcg group over placebo (9.73 vs. 4.37 p = 0.002). Patients treated with the 30 mcg dose of sufentanil sublingual tablet showed a rapid onset of action with a statistically significant beneficial difference in pain relief (p&#60;0.001) and pain intensity (p&#60;0.01) seen at 30 minutes after dosing compared to placebo. Dosing averaged every 2.4 hours over the duration of the 12-hour study. In addition, patient global assessment of the 30 mcg dose at 12 hours was superior to placebo (p=0.002) with 43.6% vs. 5.0% of the patients responding good or excellent for overall pain control. The 20 mcg dose was not significantly different from placebo for either endpoint. 

&#160; 

Two SAEs, both in the 20 mcg-dose group, occurred one week after the study (surgical infections) and were deemed unrelated to study drug. All but two adverse events reported in the study were mild-to-moderate in nature with 58 patients (58%) reporting a total of 135 adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events for all patients were nausea (30%), vomiting (17%), dizziness (14%) and somnolence (11%). Two patients discontinued treatment, one unrelated to study drug (anxiety/chest pain) and the other probably related to study drug (somnolence/respiratory depression), however both patients recovered without medical intervention.

The Market Opportunity for Zalviso 

&#160; 

According to the 2014 Decision Resources Acute Pain Report, or 2014 DR Report, the acute pain market (represented by treatments for post-operative pain, acute musculoskeletal pain and cancer breakthrough pain) in the United States, Europe and Japan realized 2013 revenues of $12.7 billion, and is expected to reach approximately $13.3 billion by 2023. Opioid analgesic use remains a standard the management of acute pain, representing 44% of the 2013 market, and is projected to grow to 46% of the 2023 market. Post-operative acute pain treatment in the United States is projected to grow significantly in the 2013 to 2023 period, from management of 13.8 million procedures in 2011 to 16.0 million procedures in 2023, a 1.5% CAGR. Despite its size, this market remains underserved. Studies report that up to 75% of patients experience inadequate pain relief after surgery. Inadequate pain relief can lead to decreased mobility, which increases the risks of other medical complications, including deep vein thrombosis and partial lung collapse, and can result in extended hospital stays. 

&#160; 

In the United States, we estimate that approximately one third of all procedures conducted are orthopedic in nature, one third are gastrointestinal, obstetric or gynecologic, and the remaining third are a mix of spinal, cardiothoracic and other procedures. Commissioned market research targeting surgeons and anesthesiologists has identified a consistent positive response to the attributes of Zalviso and indicates an interest in using Zalviso in at least 75% of their eligible patients. Additional market research indicated that physicians expressed interest in using Zalviso for patients who stay in the hospital for less than 24 hours and are not traditionally treated with IV PCA. Regardless of size or affiliation of hospitals, the majority of Pharmacy and Therapeutics, or P&#38;T, committees we surveyed were likely to review and approve Zalviso, subject to demonstration of satisfactory pharmacoeconomic value. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

How Zalviso Addresses the Unmet Medical Need in Moderate-To-Severe Acute Pain Management in a Hospital Setting 

&#160; 

While IV PCA does allow patient control over their pain medication, it suffers from the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

side effects associated with the most commonly used opioid, morphine, and its active metabolites; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

infection risk, analgesic gaps and decreased mobility associated with the invasive nature of IV delivery; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

medication errors, which in some instances may be fatal, due to the complexity of IV PCA pumps, many of which arise from programming errors. 

&#160; 

Hospitalized patients in moderate-to-severe acute pain could significantly benefit from the following items: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

recognized onset of analgesia; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

reduction in medication errors, especially relating to the use of opioids, such as wrong drug or wrong drug concentration programmed into PCA pumps which are not possible with Zalviso; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

fewer side effects, including infection and bleeding risks due to invasive routes of delivery such as IV route of administration of opioids; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

enhanced ability for patients to ambulate after surgery and avoid falls; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

patient control over their pain medication which has been shown to increase patient satisfaction. 

&#160; 

For example, epidural catheters delivering local anesthetic are invasive and have a significant risk of lower extremity weakness and tethering the patient to a pump attached to an IV pole, creates multiple mobility impediments and fall risks; nerve blocks of the lower extremities (e.g., femoral nerve blocks) are also invasive and create weakness and fall risks; oral multimodal analgesia is not patient-controlled, is nurse-intensive and suffers from slow onset of action. 

&#160; 

In our clinical studies, Zalviso has demonstrated the following attributes: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

a rapid onset of effect in comparison to intravenous delivery of morphine, and an ability to control pain as a monotherapy after moderately to severely painful surgeries such as knee replacement or colectomies; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

a rate of adverse events that is similar to a placebo-treated patient population, with the exception of opioid induced itching; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

a high level of Patient Satisfaction as a result of Zalviso usage under patient control to manage pain after surgery over 48 to 72 hours; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

a high Nurse Ease of Care rating for ease of set-up and use of Zalviso by the health care professional. 

&#160; 

According to published literature, an estimated 407 errors occur per 10,000 people treated with IV PCA each year in the United States. The most common and serious types of errors involve human factors, such as mis-programming the PCA pump or administering the wrong dose. In 2009, approximately 6.5% of errors associated with PCA pumps were due to operator error and that nearly half of these events (~19,000) lead to patient harm. Between 2005 and 2009, errors associated with infusion pumps led to 70 Class II recalls of devices that could cause temporary or reversible adverse effects and 14 Class I recalls of devices that could cause serious injury or death. These issues have resulted in the issuance of new draft guidance by the FDA, significantly increasing the data required to be submitted by manufacturers to address safety problems. 

&#160; 

Zalviso has the potential to address many of the key disadvantages of IV PCA, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

eliminating the risk of IV PCA related infections, and enhancing mobility; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

eliminating the risk of IV PCA programming errors. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We believe that Zalviso provides a favorable safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, potentially enabling Zalviso to become a new standard of care for moderate-to-severe acute pain control via patient-controlled analgesia. 

&#160; 

Zalviso Description 

&#160; 

The benefits of Zalviso are the result of combining the following three elements: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

sufentanil, a high therapeutic index opioid; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

sufentanil sublingual tablets, our proprietary, non-invasive sublingual dosage form; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

our novel, pre-programmed, handheld PCA device that enables simple patient-controlled delivery of sufentanil sublingual tablets in the hospital setting and eliminates the risk of programming errors. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Zalviso allows patients to self-administer sufentanil sublingual tablets as needed to manage their moderate-to-severe acute pain in the hospital setting, and provides the record-keeping attributes of a conventional IV PCA pump while avoiding some of the key issues, such as programming errors, associated with conventional IV PCA use. 

&#160; 

Zalviso utilizes sufentanil, which has one of the highest therapeutic indices of all commercially available opioids, making it an attractive candidate for the management of post-operative pain. Formulated in our proprietary sublingual tablet dosage form, sufentanil provides for relatively high bioavailability, with lower peak drug levels and a longer duration of action compared to IV delivery. 

&#160; 

The Zalviso System consists of the following components: a disposable dispenser tip (Figure A); a disposable dispenser cap (Figure B); an adhesive thumb tag (Figure C); a cartridge of 40 sufentanil sublingual 15 mcg tablets (approximately a two-day supply) in a disposable radio frequency identification and bar-coded cartridge (Figure D); a reusable, rechargeable handheld controller (as pictured, nurse-side view) (Figure E); a tether (Figure F); and an authorized access card (Figure G). 

&#160; 

&#160; 

This product candidate has not been approved by the FDA. We have not generated any revenue 

from the sale of any of our product candidates. 

&#160; 

Drugs are classified or scheduled by the Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA, according to their potential for abuse and addiction. Sufentanil is scheduled as a class II opioid. Scheduled drugs, when they are under patient control in a hospital setting, must be secured and have adequate dose access control and tracking mechanisms. Our novel handheld PCA device has the following safety features: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

an authorized access card, which is a wireless system access key for the healthcare professional; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

a wireless, electronic, adhesive thumb tag that acts as a single-patient identification key; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

pre-programmed 20-minute lock-out to avoid overdosing; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

tablet singulation, or dispensing, motion that eliminates runaway motor delivery risk; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

a security tether that is designed to prevent theft and misuse; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

fully automated inventory record of sufentanil sublingual tablet usage. 

&#160; 

To set up Zalviso, the nurse or healthcare professional turns on the controller and follows the simple step-by-step instructions on the color graphical user interface screen described below: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

retrieve the sufentanil sublingual tablet cartridge from secure drug storage; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

insert the cartridge into the dispenser and lock the cartridge and dispenser into the controller; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

set up the secure patient access system, which is comprised of a security tether and a wireless, electronic, adhesive thumb tag that acts as a single-patient identification key. 

&#160; 

To use Zalviso, the patient would: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

confirm that the green indicator light is illuminated, meaning the device is available to dose; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

place dispenser tip under tongue and push the large button on the controller with the thumb to which the thumb tag has been applied, which in turn dispenses a single sufentanil sublingual tablet; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

remove the device from mouth upon hearing a tone confirming delivery of the sufentanil sublingual tablet; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

see the blue indicator light illuminate, indicating no new dose can be dispensed for the next 20 minutes. 

&#160; 

Zalviso&#8212;Development Status 

&#160; 

We submitted an NDA for Zalviso in September 2013 and, as mentioned above, the FDA issued a CRL for Zalviso on July 25, 2014. Based on interaction with the FDA we have agreed to complete an additional study, known as IAP312, in post-operative patients. This Phase 3 study is designed to measure the performance of the Zalviso device and to measure any misplaced or dropped tablets. IAP312 is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

The NDA resubmission for Zalviso will be based on a development program that includes data from seven Phase 1 studies, three Phase 2 clinical trials, and four Phase 3 clinical trials. The Phase 3 clinical trial program will have included two placebo-controlled efficacy and safety trials and one open-label active comparator trial, in which Zalviso was compared to IV PCA with morphine, and an additional open-label Phase 3 study in post-operative patients (IAP312), designed to measure the performance of the Zalviso device. To date, the Zalviso safety database includes more than 600 patients, and with the data from IAP312 included in the resubmission, will comprise over 900 total patients. Zalviso has successfully achieved the primary efficacy endpoints for each of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials performed to date. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Zalviso&#8212;Clinical Program 

&#160; 

Summary 

&#160; 

The Phase 3 program for Zalviso to date has consisted of three Phase 3 clinical trials. We have reported positive top-line results from each of these three clinical trials. Prior to our Phase 3 program, we completed three successful Phase 2 clinical trials of sufentanil sublingual tablets in the post-operative setting. 

&#160; 

As mentioned above, in March 2015, we received correspondence from the FDA stating that an additional clinical study is needed. We have completed the protocol review with the FDA for IAP312 and we plan to initiate the study in the first quarter of 2016. IAP312 will be an open-label Phase 3 study conducted in post-operative patients. In the study, Zalviso will be used in patients requiring at least a one night hospital stay. IAP312 will allow for the utilization of additional post-operative treatments for moderate-to-severe acute pain and will not be limited to orthopedic or abdominal surgeries. The study is powered to rule out a device failure rate of 5%. Unlike our other Phase 3 clinical studies, IAP312 will not include a primary endpoint of efficacy. Rather, we will collect pain scores, device performance data and any misplaced or dropped tablets. The results of the study, including the actual failure rate and the number of misplaced or dropped tablets, will be subject to final review by the FDA. 

&#160; 

Phase 3 Clinical Trials for Zalviso 

&#160; 

Active comparator trial (IAP309) 

&#160; 

In November 2012, we reported top-line data showing that Zalviso had met its primary endpoint of non-inferiority in the Phase 3 open-label active comparator trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Zalviso (15 mcg/dose) to IV PCA with morphine (1mg/dose) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute post-operative pain. Utilizing a randomized, open-label, parallel group design, this trial enrolled 359 adult patients at 26 U.S. sites for the treatment of pain immediately following open-abdominal or major orthopedic surgery (hip and knee replacement). Patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with Zalviso or IV PCA morphine and were treated for a minimum of 48 hours and up to 72 hours. 

&#160; 

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, abdominal surgery trial (IAP310) 

&#160; 

In March 2013, we reported top-line data results demonstrating that Zalviso met its primary endpoint in a pivotal Phase 3 trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Zalviso to placebo in the management of acute post-operative pain after major open abdominal surgery. Adverse events reported in the trial were generally mild or moderate in nature and similar in both placebo and treatment groups. Utilizing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this Phase 3 trial enrolled 178 adult patients at 13 U.S. sites. Patients were treated for post-operative pain for a minimum of 48 hours, and up to 72 hours. Patients were randomized 2:1, with 119 patients randomized to sufentanil sublingual tablet treatment and 59 to placebo treatment. Both treatments were delivered by the patient, as needed, using Zalviso with a 20-minute lock-out period. Patients in both groups could receive up to 2 mg morphine intravenously per hour as a rescue medication, the primary purpose of this rescue medication being to provide placebo-treated patients access to pain medication to enable them to stay in the trial as long as possible. Pre-rescue pain scores were imputed to minimize the impact of this rescue opioid on efficacy evaluations. 

&#160; 

The primary endpoint evaluated pain intensity over the 48-hour study period compared to baseline, or Summed Pain Intensity Difference, or SPID-48, in patients following major open abdominal surgery. Patients receiving sufentanil sublingual tablets demonstrated a significantly greater SPID-48 compared to placebo-treated patients during the study period (105.6 and 55.6, respectively; p=0.001). 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Double-blind, placebo-controlled, orthopedic surgery trial (IAP311) 

&#160; 

In May 2013, we reported top-line data results demonstrating that Zalviso met its primary endpoint in a pivotal Phase 3 trial designed to compare the efficacy and safety of Zalviso to placebo in the management of acute post-operative pain after major orthopedic surgery. Adverse events reported in the study were generally mild or moderate in nature and were similar in both placebo and treatment groups for the majority of adverse events. Utilizing a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, this pivotal Phase 3 study enrolled 426 adult patients at 34 U.S. sites for treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain immediately following major orthopedic surgery. Seven patients did not receive study drug, resulting in 419 patients being included in the ITT population. Patients were treated for a minimum of 48 hours, and up to 72 hours. Patients were randomized 3:1, with 323 patients randomized to sufentanil sublingual tablet treatment and 104 to placebo treatment. Both treatments were delivered by the patient, as needed, using the Zalviso System with a 20-minute lock-out period. Patients in both groups could receive up to 2 mg morphine intravenously per hour as a rescue medication, the primary purpose of this rescue medication being to enable placebo-treated patients to stay in the study. Pain scores recorded just prior to the delivery of rescue medication were gathered and imputed forward to minimize the impact of this rescue opioid on efficacy evaluations. 

&#160; 

The primary endpoint evaluated SPID-48 in patients following major orthopedic surgery. Patients receiving Zalviso demonstrated a significantly greater SPID-48 compared to placebo-treated patients during the study period (+76.1 and -11.5, respectively; p &#60; 0.001). Two hundred fifteen (68.3%) sufentanil sublingual tablet-treated patients completed the 48-hour study period, compared to 43 (41.3%) placebo-treated patients. Primary reasons for drop-out in the sufentanil sublingual tablet- and placebo-treated groups were adverse events (7.0% and 6.7%, respectively) and lack of efficacy (14.3% and 48.1%, respectively). 

&#160; 

Two patients (one each in the sufentanil sublingual tablet group and placebo group) experienced a serious adverse event considered possibly or probably related to the study drug by the investigator. 

&#160; 

Combined related adverse events for the two placebo-controlled pivotal studies (IAP310 and IAP311) compared to placebo are shown below. Only pruritus (itching) was statistically different for Zalviso compared to placebo (p = 0.002).

&#160; &#160; 

ARX-03&#8212;Sufentanil/Triazolam Sublingual Tablet 

&#160; 

The Market Opportunity for ARX-03 

&#160; 

Each year in the United States, more than 100 million procedures take place in a physician&#8217;s office that are known to be anxiety-inducing and painful, according to commissioned market research data that was completed in 2010. These include diagnostic procedures such as breast and prostate biopsies, cosmetic procedures such as liposuction and dermal abrasions, interventional radiology procedures, and therapeutic procedures such as vasectomies and endometrial ablation procedures. IV sedative medications are typically not offered to these patients because of the high cost of the specialized personnel and monitoring equipment. Despite the high potential for pain and anxiety, most patients currently undergo these procedures with only a local anesthetic, resulting in unnecessary discomfort during the procedure. We believe there is significant opportunity for a fast-acting, effective and safe product that can provide mild levels of sedation, anxiety reduction and analgesia for painful procedures conducted in a physician&#8217;s office without the need for specialized personnel to monitor the patient. 

&#160; 

ARX-03 Description 

&#160; 

ARX-03 sufentanil/triazolam sublingual tablet is a single, fixed-dose sublingual product candidate designed to be administered by a healthcare professional prior to a painful procedure in a physician&#8217;s office. An important attribute of sufentanil and triazolam compared to current therapies is the rapid uptake from the sublingual mucosa. Our Phase 2 clinical data showed that administering ARX-03 via sublingual route prior to a procedure results in a rapid onset of mild sedation and reduction in anxiety in 15 to 30 minutes. Sufentanil and triazolam have short half-lives compared to many other agents in the same class of compounds, enabling patients treated with ARX-03 to be discharged immediately following completion of the procedure. The sublingual route of administration avoids the high plasma concentrations associated with IV delivery, thereby obviating the need for specialized personnel and extensive monitoring. 

&#160; 

ARX-03 Clinical Program Overview 

&#160; 

We have completed a successful Phase 2 clinical trial of ARX-03 demonstrating rapid onset of mild sedation and anxiety reduction, with a low adverse event profile during an abdominal liposuction procedure. In addition, we participated in an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in May 2010 to discuss the Phase 3 clinical program and requirements for an NDA submission. Based on these discussions, two four-arm factorial Phase 3 clinical trials will be required with a minimum of 700 patients exposed to active drug. 

&#160; 

Further development of the ARX-03 program is contingent on identification of corporate partnership resources. Currently we have no plans to advance the development of ARX-03. 

&#160; 

Our Strategy 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to develop and commercialize our sufentanil sublingual tablet-based products in the United States. We have designed and are developing product candidates that meet clearly defined unmet medical needs, have clearly defined clinical development programs, target large commercial market opportunities and require modestly-sized commercial organizations in the United States. We selectively utilize third-party contractors in order to maximize the capital efficiency of our development and commercialization efforts. We plan to enter into partnerships to market our product candidates outside the United States. In December 2013, we announced a commercial collaboration with Gr&#252;nenthal, covering the territory of the European Union, certain other European countries and Australia for Zalviso for potential use in pain treatment within or dispensed by a hospital, hospice, nursing home or other medically supervised setting. We retain all rights in remaining countries, including the United States. We continue to seek partnerships to market Zalviso in markets outside of the Gr&#252;nenthal territory and the United States. 

&#160; 

ARX-04 

&#160;

ARX-04 is a non-invasive investigational product candidate consisting of a single sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg, delivered via a disposable, pre-filled, single-dose applicator, or SDA. We are developing ARX-04 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain to be administered by a healthcare professional to a patient in medically supervised settings of acute pain. If approved, examples of potential patient populations and settings in which ARX-04 could be used include: emergency room patients; patients who are recovering from short-stay or ambulatory surgery and do not require more long-term patient-controlled analgesia; post-operative patients who are transitioning from the operating room to the recovery floor; patients being treated and transported by paramedics; and for battlefield casualties. We plan to complete our Phase 3 development program for ARX-04 by the third quarter of 2016, and, pending successful completion, we anticipate submitting the NDA to the FDA for ARX-04 in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our specific strategy with respect to ARX-04 is to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

complete our Phase 3 clinical program and seek regulatory approval in the United States and in the EEA; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

further expand our relationship with our existing contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture and packaging of ARX-04; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

build a targeted sales force focused on the emergency room and corporate-owned ambulatory surgery centers in the United States; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

on our own, or with a partner, supply the DoD and other military organizations as requested and appropriate; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

seek commercial partnerships for ARX-04 in countries outside of the United States. 

&#160; 

Zalviso &#160; 

We are seeking FDA approval for the use of Zalviso to treat moderate-to-severe acute pain in the hospital setting. We submitted an NDA for Zalviso in September 2013 and, as mentioned above, the FDA issued a CRL for Zalviso on July 25, 2014. Based on interaction with the FDA we have agreed to conduct the IAP312 study in post-operative patients. We anticipate the initiation of the IAP312 study in the first quarter of 2016. Pending successful completion of IAP312, we plan to resubmit the NDA for Zalviso by the end of 2016. 

&#160; 

Our specific strategy with respect to Zalviso is to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

collaborate with Gr&#252;nenthal to support the launch of Zalviso in their licensed territories; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

strengthen our commercial relationships for the manufacturing of the components and assembly of the Zalviso System; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

seek regulatory approval in the United States; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

build a targeted hospital-directed sales force in the United States; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

seek commercial partnerships for Zalviso in other unlicensed countries outside of the United States. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We anticipate developing a distribution capability and commercial organization in the United States to market and sell our product candidates alone or with partners, while out-licensing commercialization rights outside of the United States. In executing our strategy, our goal is to have significant control over the development process and commercial execution for our product candidates, while retaining meaningful economics. 

&#160; 

We plan to progressively build commercial capability to support introduction of ARX-04 and Zalviso to the United States market as we move toward potential NDA approval. We foresee two stages of commercial execution to support successful introduction of ARX-04 and Zalviso in the United States: 

&#160; 

Prior to FDA approval of ARX-04 and Zalviso, we plan to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

create and deploy a focused scientific support team to gather a detailed understanding of individual emergency room, ambulatory surgery center and hospital needs in order to be prepared to present ARX-04 and Zalviso effectively at the time of commercial launch; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

increase awareness of the clinical profile of sublingual administration of sufentanil through publication of our clinical data; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

establish advisory boards with emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists, surgeons, nurses and P&#38;T committees to provide us with input on appropriate commercial positioning for ARX-04 and Zalviso for each of these key audiences; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

build a sales and marketing organization that can define appropriate segmentation and positioning strategies and tactics for ARX-04 and Zalviso; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

present the clinical and health economic data identifying the limitations of IV PCA and other relevant treatments for moderate-to-severe acute pain in use today. 

&#160; 

Assuming FDA approval, we plan to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

establish ARX-04 and Zalviso on formularies through deployment of an experienced team to explain the clinical and economic attributes of ARX-04 and Zalviso; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

create and progressively deploy a high-quality, customer-focused and experienced sales organization dedicated to bringing innovative, highly-valued healthcare solutions to patients, payors and healthcare providers, including progressively building a targeted sales force of approximately 65 people in the United States; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

conduct post-approval clinical trials for ARX-04 and Zalviso; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

undertake efforts to establish ARX-04 and Zalviso as the products of choice for moderate-to-severe acute pain; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

expand the market through deployment of ARX-04 in medically-supervised settings outside of the hospital and ambulatory surgery centers and, for Zalviso, for 24-hour stay patients and other in-hospital moderate-to-severe acute pain conditions. 

&#160; &#160; 

Collaborative Arrangements 

&#160; 

Gr&#252;nenthal Collaboration 

&#160; 

On December 16, 2013, we and Gr&#252;nenthal entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the License Agreement, and related Manufacture and Supply Agreement, or the MSA, and together with the License Agreement, the Agreements. The License Agreement grants Gr&#252;nenthal rights to commercialize Zalviso, or the Product, in the Territory for human use in pain treatment within or dispensed by hospitals, hospices, nursing homes and other medically-supervised settings, or the Field. The Company retains rights with respect to the Product in countries outside the Territory, including the United States, Asia and Latin America. Under the MSA, we will exclusively manufacture and supply the Product to Gr&#252;nenthal for the Field in the Territory. On July 22, 2015, we entered into amendments to the License Agreement, or the License Amendment, and together with the License Agreement, the Amended License Agreement, and the MSA, or the MSA Amendment, and together with the MSA, the Amended MSA, between AcelRx and Gr&#252;nenthal, each effective as of July 17, 2015, and together, the Amended Agreements. 

&#160; 

In the Amended Agreements, the parties amended the Product supply configurations and packaging of Product components and accessories, and associated pricing therefor, which we will manufacture and supply to Gr&#252;nenthal for the Territory. The parties agreed to increase the pricing of the Product components and accessories, while reducing the total milestone payments due from Gr&#252;nenthal contingent upon achieving specified net sales targets from a total of $171.5 million to $166.0 million. As a result of the Royalty Monetization, PDL will receive 75% of the European royalties under the Amended License Agreement with Gr&#252;nenthal, as well as 80% of the first four commercial milestones worth $35.6 million (or 80% of $44.5 million), subject to the capped amount of $195.0 million. The parties also updated the development plan for the Product in the Territory, providing for additional near-term development services to be rendered by AcelRx in exchange for payments of approximately $0.7 million, primarily in 2015. Simultaneously, we also received a binding Product forecast from Gr&#252;nenthal for approximately $3.7 million. 

&#160; 

Under the terms of the Amended Agreements with Gr&#252;nenthal, we received an upfront cash payment of $30.0 million in December 2013, and in the third quarter of 2014, we received a milestone payment of $5.0 million related to the MAA submission to EMA and an additional milestone payment of $15.0 million related to the EC approval of the MAA for Zalviso in the third quarter of 2015. Under the Amended License Agreement, we are eligible to receive approximately $194.5 million in additional milestone payments, based upon successful regulatory and product development efforts ($28.5 million) and net sales target achievements ($166.0 million). Gr&#252;nenthal will also make tiered royalty, supply and trademark fee payments in the mid-teens up to the mid-twenties percent range, depending on the sales level achieved, on net sales of Zalviso in the Territory. A portion of the tiered royalty payment, exclusive of the supply and trademark fee payments, will be paid to PDL in connection with the Royalty Monetization. For additional information on the Royalty Monetization with PDL, see Note 8 &#8220;Liability Related to Sale of Future Royalties&#8221; in the accompanying notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160;

Gr&#252;nenthal will be responsible for all commercial activities for Zalviso, including obtaining and maintaining pharmaceutical product regulatory approval in the Territory. We will be responsible for obtaining and maintaining device regulatory approval in the Territory and manufacturing and supply of Zalviso to Gr&#252;nenthal for commercial sales. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights developed internally and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. We also rely on trade secrets to protect our product candidates. Our commercial success also depends in part on our non-infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties. For a more comprehensive discussion of the risks related to our intellectual property, please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property&#8221; appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our product candidates; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

defend our patents; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 

&#160; 

We have established and continue to build proprietary positions for our product candidates and related technology in the United States and abroad. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we are the owner of record of 17 issued U.S. patents, which provide coverage for sufentanil sublingual tablets, the device components of Zalviso and the ARX-04 SDA. These patents provide coverage through at least 2027. We also hold four issued European patents, each valid in at least six countries in Europe. In addition, we own five patents in Japan, four in China and six in Korea, and a number of other international patents which provide coverage through at least 2027. We are also pursuing a number of U.S. and foreign patent applications. The patent applications that we have filed and have not yet been granted may fail to result in issued patents in the United States or in foreign countries. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may challenge the patents. 

&#160; 

We continue to seek and expand our patent protection for both compositions of matter and delivery devices, as well as methods of treatment related to our product candidates. In particular, we are pursuing additional patent protection for our Zalviso and ARX-04 and formulations, our Zalviso device, the combination of drugs and our Zalviso device, our ARX-04 SDA, as well as to methods of treatment using such drug and device compositions. 

&#160; 

We have filed for additional patent coverage in the United States, Europe as well as many other foreign jurisdictions including, Japan, China, India, Canada and Korea. If issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, we expect that these patents will expire between 2027 and 2030, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustments or patent term extensions in the United States. We note that the patent laws of foreign countries differ from those in United States, and the degree of protection afforded by foreign patents may be different from the protection offered by U.S. patents. 

&#160; 

Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and internationally where available and when appropriate. We have registered our ACELRX mark in Class 5, &#8220;Pharmaceutical preparations for treating pain; pharmaceutical preparations for treating anxiety,&#8221; and Class 10, &#8220;Drug delivery systems; medical device, namely, a mechanical and electronic device used to administer medications, perform timed medication delivery, and to provide secure access to and delivery of medications,&#8221; in the United States. 

&#160; 

Our ACELRX mark is also registered in the European Community, Canada, and India. We have also registered the mark ACCELERATE. INNOVATE. ALLEVIATE. in the United States. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical technology companies. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are the safety, efficacy and tolerability profile, the patient and healthcare professional satisfaction with using our product candidates in relation to available alternatives and the reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement of our product candidates. 

&#160; 

Many of our potential competitors, including many of the organizations named below, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors&#8217; drugs may be more effective, or may be more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize, which may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover our losses. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Potential Competition for ARX-04 

&#160; &#160; 

Within the civilian environment, there are a wide variety of approved injectable and oral opioid products to treat moderate-to-severe acute pain, including IV opioids such as morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone and meperidine or oral opioids such as oxycodone and hydrocodone. More specifically, competitors for ARX-04 in the emergency department are likely to include generic injectable intravenous opioids such as morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl. In this environment, ARX-04 may also compete with other branded non-invasive products or product candidates, such as Egalet Corporation&#8217;s SPRIX, Hospira Inc.&#8217;s DYLOJECT (Hospira, Inc. acquired by Pfizer, Inc. in September 2015), Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8217; s OXAYDO, Depomed, Inc.&#8217;s NUCYNTA, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company&#8217;s COMBUNOX, Purdue Pharma, L.P.&#8217;s OXYFAST, Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8217;s OPANA, Medical Developments International Limited&#8217;s PENTHROX (methoxyflurane) inhaler, CL-108, a bi-layered tablet , in development by Charleston Laboratories Inc., in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo, or generic oral opioids which have moderate-to-severe acute pain labeling. In the short-stay or ambulatory surgery segment, ARX-04 will likely compete with these products in addition to generic injectable local anesthetics such as bupivacaine, or branded formulations thereof, including Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8217;s EXPAREL. Within the military environment, and in certain civilian settings, ARX-04 competitors may also include intramuscular morphine injections that are marketed by a variety of generic manufacturers. 

&#160;

Potential Competition for Zalviso 

&#160; 

We are developing Zalviso for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain in adult patients during hospitalization. We believe that Zalviso would compete with a number of opioid-based and non-opioid based treatment options that are currently available, as well as some products that are in development. These products can be grouped into three classes &#8211; PCA-based systems, most commonly using an opioid as the pain control agent; non PCA-based systems that require nurse delivery of oral or parenteral opioids; and other non-opioid based treatment modalities. Due to the difficulty of managing moderate-to-severe acute pain, healthcare professionals will often use a combination of PCA opioids, parenteral or oral opioids and non-opioid based treatments to manage pain. 

&#160; 

The primary competition for Zalviso is the IV PCA pump, which is widely used in the moderate-to-severe acute pain in the hospital setting. Leading manufacturers of IV PCA pumps include Hospira, Inc. (acquired by Pfizer, Inc.), CareFusion Corporation (purchased by Becton, Dickinson and Company), Baxter International, Inc., Curlin Medical, Inc. and Smiths Medical. The most common opioids used to treat moderate-to-severe acute pain are morphine, hydromorphone and fentanyl, all of which are available as generics both from generic product manufacturers as well as from compounding pharmacies. In addition, branded manufacturers (e.g., Hospira, Inc.) sell pre-filled glass syringes of morphine to fit their IV PCA pump systems. 

&#160; 

Also available on the market is the Avancen Medication on Demand, or MOD, Oral PCA Device developed by Avancen MOD Corporation. Oral opioids and other agents can be used in this system. In addition, oral and parenteral opioids administered by the nurse are used to manage moderate-to-severe acute pain in the hospital, available both as branded and generic products. These oral opioids, as well as IV PCA opioids, are often used as part of a multi-modal analgesia approach, which might include, in addition to the opioid, NSAIDs, acetaminophen, gabapentanoids and other pain management modalities, as well as local anesthetic blocks to provide temporary blockage of the pain signal, either as a wound infiltration agent or as a nerve block. These local anesthetic agents such as bupivacaine can also utilize controlled-release formulations such as Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#8217;s EXPAREL. In addition, Halyard Health, Inc. has developed a medical device, the ON-Q* Pain Relief System, which is a non-narcotic elastomeric pump that automatically and continuously delivers a regulated flow of local anesthetic to a patient&#8217;s surgical site or in close proximity to nerves, providing targeted pain relief for up to five days. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Additional potential competitors for Zalviso include the fentanyl iontophoretic transdermal system, IONSYS, originally developed by Alza Corporation and Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical, Inc., both Johnson &#38; Johnson subsidiaries, and most recently by The Medicines Company. On April 30, 2015, IONSYS was approved for marketing in the U.S. by the FDA, providing a potential first-to-market advantage for IONSYS. Cara Therapeutics, Inc. is developing a kappa opioid agonist, CR845, as an IV agent for the management of post-operative moderate-to-severe pain. Trevena, Inc. is developing TRV130, an intravenous G protein biased ligand that targets the mu opioid receptor for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain where intravenous therapy is preferred, with a clinical development focus in acute post-operative pain. Trevena, Inc. expects to initiate Phase 3 development of TRV130 in the first quarter of 2016. Recro Pharma, Inc. is developing an intranasal form of dexmedetomidine as a potential agent for the management of post-operative pain, for which it announced positive efficacy results in its Phase II clinical trial. Finally, Innocoll AG is developing XARACOLL a controlled-release resorbable implant containing bupivacaine, and Durect Corporation has been developing POSIDUR, a controlled-release bupivacaine product candidate utilizing Durect Corporation&#8217;s Saber technology. 

&#160; 

Potential Competition for ARX - 03 

&#160; &#160; 

We are developing ARX-03, the sufentanil/triazolam sublingual tablet, for use in diagnostic or therapeutic painful procedures of short duration in a physician&#8217;s office. For these procedures, many practitioners rely primarily on local anesthetics injected to the procedural area to reduce the pain of the procedure, and do not use IV sedatives to manage the anxiety of patients because of the cost of having additional trained staff to monitor the patients. Currently, we are not aware of any products on the market that combine an opioid with a benzodiazepine in a single dosage form to manage the anxiety and pain of procedures in a physician&#8217;s office. However, an anonymous third party filed an Opposition on October 7, 2015 against European patent EP2182902B1, which claims a dosage form related to ARX-03. Although the Opposition is currently pending, the European Patent Office has neither reviewed nor made any initial comments regarding the validity of the EP2182902B1 patent. We are not aware of any approved or development stage non-IV sedative/analgesic products that would present competition to ARX-03. In the future, there may be products developed or approved for this market that could directly compete with ARX-03. 

&#160; 

Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Supply 

&#160; 

We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce sufentanil sublingual tablets for commercial product and for our clinical trials under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, with oversight by our internal managers. Equipment specific to the pharmaceutical manufacturing process was purchased and customized for us and is currently owned by us. We plan to continue to rely on contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing by the FDA. We currently rely on a single manufacturer for the preclinical and clinical supplies of our drug product for each of our product candidates and do not currently have agreements in place for redundant supply or a second source for any of our product candidates. We have identified other manufacturers that could satisfy our commercial supply and packaging requirements and we continue to evaluate those manufacturers. 

&#160; 

In January 2013, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement, or the Services Agreement, with Patheon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Patheon, relating to the manufacture of sufentanil sublingual tablets for use with the Zalviso device. Under the terms of the Services Agreement, Patheon has agreed to manufacture, supply, and provide certain validation and stability services with respect to Zalviso for sale in the United States, Canada, Mexico and other countries, subject to agreement by the parties to any additional fees for such other countries. The term of the Services Agreement extends until December 31, 2017, or the Initial Term, and will automatically renew thereafter for periods of two years, unless terminated by either party upon eighteen months&#8217; prior written notice; provided, however, that the Services Agreement may not be terminated without cause prior to the end of the Initial Term. In addition, we entered into a related Amended and Restated Capital Expenditure and Equipment Agreement, or the Amended Capital Agreement, related to clinical and commercial production of our product candidates. Under the terms of the Amended Capital Agreement, we have made, and may make certain future modifications to Patheon&#8217;s Cincinnati facility. 

&#160; 

Device Manufacturing and Supply 

&#160; 

The device components of Zalviso are manufactured by contract manufacturers, component fabricators and secondary service providers. Suppliers of components, subassemblies and other materials are located in Korea, Japan, Germany, China, Taiwan, Canada and the United States. All contract manufacturers and component suppliers have been selected for their specific competencies in the manufacturing processes and materials that make up Zalviso. FDA regulations require that materials be produced under cGMPs or Quality System Regulation, or QSR. We outsource injection molding of all the plastic parts for the cartridge and device and product sub-assemblies; tablet cartridge filling and packaging; and assembly, packaging and labeling of the dispenser and controller. 

&#160; 

ARX-04 utilizes an SDA in the delivery of the tablets. FDA regulations require that materials be produced under cGMPs or QSR, as required for the respective unit operation within the manufacturing process. We outsource injection molding of all the plastic parts for the SDA, and product sub-assemblies; and filling, packaging and labeling of SDAs. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may legally be marketed in the United States. 

&#160;

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and complying with applicable laws and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply at any time during the product development and approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal trials and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the clinical safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for its intended use; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug product; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product and the drug substance(s) are produced to assess compliance with cGMP; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

payment of application, user and facility fees; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

&#160; 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

&#160; 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Phase 2. Involves trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted conditions and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

&#160; 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an institutional review board, or IRB, can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug or biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

&#160; 

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP and QSR for medical device requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our product candidates, Zalviso, ARX-04 and others, are regulated under IND applications for clinical development and in the case of Zalviso, all device related information is filed under the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls Section, or CMC, of an IND. 

&#160; 

The results of product development, preclinical trials and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on our drug products, proposed labeling and other relevant information, will be submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug product, requesting approval to market the product in the United States. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. During its review of an NDA, FDA may inspect our manufacturers for GMP and QSR compliance, and our pivotal clinical trial sites for GCP compliance. 

&#160; 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. 

&#160; 

The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA issues a Complete Response Letter at the conclusion of its review if the NDA is not yet deemed ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. &#160; 

&#160; 

If one or more of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific conditions and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Our product candidates, if approved, will also require Risk Evaluations and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, which can include a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan, elements to assure safe use and implementation system, and must include a timetable for assessment of the REMS. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after the NDA. 

&#160; 

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160; 

Any drug products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated clinical safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Phase 4 clinical trials are conducted after approval to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication or when otherwise requested by the FDA in the form of postmarketing requirements or commitments. Failure to promptly conduct any required Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of NDA approval. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drug products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers of drug products must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 

&#160; 

Drug product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drug products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. In the case of Zalviso, the device component must comply with FDA&#8217;s Quality Systems Regulation. 

&#160; 

We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical trials, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties. 

&#160; 

Foreign Regulation 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. 

&#160; 

In December 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, confirmed that an MAA for ARX-04 may be submitted in the EU under the EMA&#39;s centralized procedure. This regulatory procedure, reserved for novel products, biotechnology products and new chemical entities, allows for commercialization across 31 EU and EFTA countries based on approval by EMA. 

&#160; 

We are responsible for maintaining Zalviso device regulatory approval in the EU in order to support the manufacturing and supply of Zalviso to Gr&#252;nenthal for commercial sales. We completed the Conformite Europeenne approval process for the Zalviso device, more commonly known as a CE Mark approval. We received CE Mark approval in December 2014, which permits the commercial sale of the Zalviso device in the European Union. In connection with the CE Mark approval, we were also granted International Standards Organization, or ISO, 13485:2003 certification of our quality management system. This is an internationally recognized quality standard for medical devices. Certification of our quality management system was issued by the British Standards Institution, or BSI, a Notified Body. ISO 13485:2003 certification recognizes that consistent quality policies and procedures are in place for the development, design and manufacturing of medical devices. The certification indicates that we have successfully implemented a quality system that conforms to ISO 13485 standards for medical devices. Certification to this standard is one of the key regulatory requirements for a CE Mark in the EU and EEA, as well as to meet equivalent requirements in other international markets. The certification applies to the Redwood City, California location which designs, manufactures and distributes finished medical devices, and includes critical suppliers. In November 2015, we underwent a successful surveillance audit by the Notified Body for the Zalviso CE mark and for our status as an ISO 13485 certified device manufacturer. 

&#160; 

Controlled Substances Regulations 

&#160; 

Sufentanil, a Schedule II controlled substance, is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Zalviso and ARX-04. Controlled substances are governed by the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, of the U.S. Department of Justice. The handling of controlled substances and/or drug product by us, our contract manufacturers, analytical laboratories, packagers and distributors, are regulated by the Controlled Substances Act and regulations thereunder. 

&#160; 

As sufentanil is a controlled substance, until Zalviso is approved in the U.S., we are limited as to the countries we can export sufentanil cartridges to Europe, Japan, Australia, Israel, Switzerland, Canada and South Africa. Gr&#252;nenthal has the commercial rights to the European Union and Australia. As a result, we do not anticipate additional collaborations for Zalviso outside of the Gr&#252;nenthal territories until Zalviso is approved in the U.S. 

&#160; 

The Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements are that manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. Further, manufacturers will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. 

&#160; 

Unforeseen delays to the drug substance and drug product manufacture and supply chain may occur due to delays, errors or other unforeseen problems with the permitting and quota process. Also, any one of our suppliers, contract manufacturers, laboratories, packagers and/or distributors could be the subject of DEA violations and enforcement could lead to delays or even loss of DEA license by the contractors. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations 

&#160; 

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws restrict certain business practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency statutes and regulations. 

&#160; 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term &#8220;remuneration&#8221; has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and/or formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for a statutory exception or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. A claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below). 

&#160; 

The False Claims Act and related laws prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies&#8217; marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Further, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 

&#160; 

In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates&#8212;independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney&#8217;s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

&#160; 

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies, for which federal healthcare program payment is available, report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 

&#160; 

Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. FDA and some states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies. In addition, California requires pharmaceutical companies to implement a comprehensive compliance program that includes a limit on expenditures for, or payments to, individual medical or health professionals. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal, civil and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products will be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

In both domestic and foreign markets, our sales of any approved products will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Sales of our products will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by third-party payers. These third-party payers are increasingly focused on containing healthcare costs by challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare product candidates. Third-party payers may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Because each third-party payer individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming, costly and sometimes unpredictable process. We may be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payer separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any product and could have a negative effect on our future revenues and operating results. We cannot be certain that our products and our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. Because coverage and reimbursement determinations are made on a payer-by-payer basis, obtaining acceptable coverage and reimbursement from one payer does not guarantee that we will obtain similar acceptable coverage or reimbursement from another payer. If we are unable to obtain coverage of, and adequate reimbursement and payment levels for, our product candidates from third-party payers, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition and future success. 

&#160; 

In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. In some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. We may face competition for our product candidates from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products, which could negatively impact our profitability. 

&#160; 

Healthcare Reform 

&#160; 

In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to commercialize our products. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state level that seek to reduce healthcare costs. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our future products will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain from non-governmental payers. Moreover, private payers often follow federal healthcare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the United States to fundamental change. Initiatives to reduce the federal deficit and to reform healthcare delivery are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate that Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid spending, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, price controls on pharmaceuticals and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability. In March 2010, PPACA was signed into law. Among other cost containment measures, PPACA established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents. In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we are able to charge for our products, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls and access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, price controls or patient access constraints under the Medicaid program, and some states are considering price-control regimes that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payer or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Reimbursement and Health Reform 

&#160; 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate that receives regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for product candidates. 

&#160; 

In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Further, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical drug products and medical services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Such payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. 

&#160;

Moreover, the process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the drug product. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor&#8217;s determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment. 

&#160; 

In the United States, the PPACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, was enacted in an effort to, among other things, broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Aspects of the Health Care Reform Law that may impact our business include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

extension of manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers&#8217; Medicaid rebate liability; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

a Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and 

&#160; 

&#160; &#8226; 

creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board which has authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. 

&#160; 

The Health Care Reform Law has the potential to substantially change health care financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 

&#160; 

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. Aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless Congressional action is taken. The American Tax Payer Relief Act further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Moreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act of 2013 imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. 

&#160; 

Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and further restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Conducting research and development is central to our business model. We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital in our research and development operations. Our research and development expenses were $22.5 million, $24.5 million and $26.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We plan to incur significant expenditures for the foreseeable future as we seek to continue the development of ARX-04 and Zalviso and begin commercial preparations for ARX-04 and Zalviso. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed 36 full-time employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

&#160;
