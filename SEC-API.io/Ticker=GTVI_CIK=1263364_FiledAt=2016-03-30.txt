(the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Joway Health&#8221;) is engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of tourmaline-related healthcare products. We are incorporated in the state of Nevada. Our principal executive offices are located at No. 19. Baowang Road, Baodi Economic Development Zone, Tianjin City, PRC 301800. Our website address is www.jowayhealth.com. 

&#160; 

Corporate History 

&#160; 

Joway Health Industries Group, Inc. 

&#160; 

Until October 1, 2010, we were a &#8220;shell company,&#8221; as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We were originally formed as a Texas corporation on March 21, 2003 to acquire most of the assets and certain liabilities of and succeed to the business of G2 Companies, Inc., (formerly Hartland Investment, Inc.), as an independent recording company and artist management company. The acquisition of G2 Companies, Inc. was consummated on April 1, 2003. On May 13, 2008, through a registered offering, we sold 1,284,574 shares of our common stock raising an aggregate of $128,457, before costs of the Offering. Our common stock began trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (&#8220;OTCBB&#8221;) under the symbol &#8220;GTVI&#8221; on September 11, 2009. Prior to the Share Exchange Transaction, discussed below, we were a development stage music recording, production and artist management company that had limited operations, primarily due to our inability to raise sufficient capital. 

&#160; 

On September 28, 2010, Mr. Kepler, our former Chief Executive Officer and majority shareholder, sold to Crystal Globe Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (&#8220;Crystal Globe&#8221;) 3,300,000 shares of common stock in the Company, which at that time represented 68.97% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Company. In connection with the sale, Mr. Kepler resigned as our sole officer and director and appointed Crystal Globe&#8217;s nominees, Mr. Jinghe Zhang, as our new President, Chief Executive Officer and sole director and Mr. Yuan Huang as our new Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. As a result, on September 28, 2010, there was a change in control of the Company. 

&#160; 

On October 1, 2010, as a result of a transaction with Dynamic Elite (the &#8220;Share Exchange&#8221;), Dynamic Elite became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we ceased to be a shell company. Dynamic Elite is the holding company of all the equity of Tianjin Junhe Management Consulting Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Junhe Consulting&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Share Exchange Transaction 

&#160; 

On October 1, 2010, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Crystal Globe, the sole shareholder of Dynamic Elite International Limited, pursuant to which Crystal Globe transferred all of its shares in Dynamic Elite to us in exchange for 15,215,426 shares of our common stock. As a result, Dynamic Elite became our wholly-owned subsidiary and we ceased to be a shell company, and Crystal Globe held a total of 18,515,426 shares (approximately 92.6%) of our issued and outstanding common stock. 

&#160; 

The Share Exchange was treated for accounting purposes as a reverse acquisition. Therefore, the Company&#8217;s financial statements after the Share Exchange were those of Dynamic Elite and its subsidiaries and controlled companies on a consolidated basis, as if the Share Exchange had been in effect retroactively for all periods presented. 

&#160; 

Change of State of Incorporation; Name Change 

&#160; 

In December 2010, the Company changed its jurisdiction of incorporation from the State of Texas to the State of Nevada and changed its name to Joway Health Industries Group, Inc. In connection with these changes, the Company adopted new Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Dynamic Elite 

&#160; 

Dynamic Elite was founded on June 2, 2010 under the laws of the British Virgin Islands by Crystal Globe and Evan Liu, the sole shareholder of Crystal Globe, at the request of Mr. Jinghe Zhang. Mr. Liu is a friend of Mr. Jinghe Zhang. On September 15, 2010, Dynamic Elite established a wholly-owned subsidiary &#8212; Tianjin Junhe Management Consulting Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Junhe Consulting&#8221;), as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WOFE) under the laws of the PRC for the purposes of acquiring Tianjin Joway Shengshi Group Co., Ltd. and engaging in the manufacture, distribution and sale of tourmaline products in China. Under Article 6 of the Law of the People&#8217;s Republic of China on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises, adopted April 12, 1986 at the 4th Sess. of the 6th National People&#8217;s Congress and as amended on October 31, 2000 (&#8220;PRC WOFE Law&#8221;) and Article 7 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation, any person or entity that intends to establish an enterprise in the PRC with foreign capital is required to submit an application for examination and approval to the appropriate department under the State Council. On September 9, 2010, the local Tianjin City government issued a certificate of approval approving the foreign ownership of Junhe Consulting by Dynamic Elite. Mr. Jinghe Zhang was appointed as the Executive Director of Junhe Consulting. 

&#160; 

PRC Operating Entities 

&#160; 

All of our business operations are conducted through our PRC Operating Entities. The chart below sets forth our corporate structure. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Joway Shengshi 

&#160; 

On May 17, 2007, Mr. Jinghe Zhang, Mr. Lijun Si and Mr. Baogang Song founded Tianjin Joway Textile Co., Ltd. as a limited liability company under the PRC law.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Joway Technology was incorporated under PRC law on March 28, 2007, with a registered capital of RMB 1,100,000. Its term of operation expires on March 27, 2017. It was formed to engage in intelligent engineering design and construction, development and sales of electronics, water filters, and other similar products.

As a result of the acquisition, Joway Shengshi became the sole shareholder of Joway Technology. 

&#160; 

Joway Decoration 

&#160; 

Joway Decoration was cofounded by Joway Shengshi and Mr. Jingyun Chen under PRC law on April 22, 2009, with a registered capital of RMB 2,000,000. Its term of operation expires on April 21, 2019. It was formed to engage in the business of intelligent electric heating project design and construction, development and sales of electronics technology and water filters, and the manufacture and sales of wood products. Prior to July 9, 2010, Joway Shengshi owned 90% of Joway Decoration. On July 9, 2010, Joway Shengshi entered into a share acquisition agreement with Mr. Jingyun Chen to acquire the remaining 10% of the shares of Joway Decoration for RMB 200,000 in cash. As a result of the acquisition, Joway Shengshi became the sole shareholder of Joway Decoration. 

&#160; 

Shengtang Trading 

&#160; 

Shengtang Trading was cofounded by Joway Shengshi and Mr. Jingyun Chen under PRC law on September 18, 2009, with a registered capital of RMB 2,000,000. Its term of operation expires on September 17, 2029.

As a result of the acquisition, Joway Shengshi became the sole shareholder of Shengtang Trading. 

&#160; 

VIE Agreements 

&#160; 

On September 16, 2010, prior to the Share Exchange, Junhe Consulting, Dynamic Elite&#8217;s wholly owned subsidiary had entered into a series of control agreements with Joway Shengshi and all of the owners of Joway Shengshi, which agreements allow Junhe Consulting to control Joway Shengshi. Through our ownership of Dynamic Elite, Dynamic Elite&#8217;s ownership of Junhe Consulting and Junhe Consulting&#8217;s agreements with Joway Shengshi, we believe that Joway Health controls Joway Shengshi and therefore, we consolidate the results of operations of Joway Shengshi and its subsidiaries with ours as variable interest entities. 

&#160; 

In connection with the Share Exchange and as consideration for entering into the VIE Agreements, Mr. Jinghe Zhang and Mr. Baogang Song, the shareholders of Joway Shengshi, entered into a Call Option Agreement with the sole shareholder of Crystal Globe, pursuant to which the shareholders of Joway Shengshi have the right to purchase up to 100% of the shares of Crystal Globe at an aggregate price equal to $20,000 over the next three years. The Call Option vested as to 34% of the shares of Crystal Globe on April 2, 2011, and vests as to 33% on April 2 of 2012 and 2013. As a result, the shareholders of Joway Shengshi became the indirect beneficial owners of the shares of the Company held by Crystal Globe. 

&#160; 

Under PRC law the acquisition of Joway Shengshi by Junhe Consulting must be structured as a cash transaction with the purchase price based on the appraised value of the equity interest or assets to be sold. Neither Junhe Consulting nor Dynamic Elite had sufficient cash to pay the appraised value of the equity interest or assets of Joway Shengshi. Alternatively, the shareholders of Joway Shengshi entered into a series of contractual agreements (the &#8220;VIE Agreements&#8221;) which enabled Dynamic Elite to gain control of Joway Shengshi and be entitled to receive 100% of the profits of Joway Shengshi and is obligated for 100% of the losses of Joway Shengshi. As a result of the VIE agreements, we are able to consolidate Joway Shengshi&#8217;s financial statements, including the results of operations, assets and liabilities of Joway Shengshi and its subsidiaries without triggering the regulatory requirements of PRC law. Under PRC law the VIE Agreements are considered commercial transactions among legal entities and individuals, and do not trigger the PRC requirements that apply to acquisitions, although the pledge by Joway Shengshi&#8217;s equity holders of all their equity in Joway Shengshi to Junhe Consulting pursuant to the Equity Pledge Agreement (the &#8220;Equity Pledge&#8221;) must be registered with the appropriate governmental agency. The Equity Pledge was registered with local administration department for industry and commerce pursuant to the Section 1 of Article 226 of PRC Property Law passed by National People's Congress on March 16, 2007. 

&#160; 

Through Junhe Consulting, we effectively and substantially control Joway Shengshi and its three wholly owned subsidiaries Joway Technology, Shengtang Trading and Joway Decoration. 

&#160; 

The VIE Agreements include: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; a Consulting Services Agreement through which Junhe Consulting has the right to advise, consult, manage and operate Joway Shengshi and collect and own all of the net profits or losses of Joway Shengshi; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; an Operating Agreement through which Junhe Consulting has the right to recommend director candidates and appoint the senior executives of Joway Shengshi, approve any transactions that may materially affect the assets, liabilities, rights or operations of Joway Shengshi, and guarantee the contractual performance by Joway Shengshi of any agreements with third parties, in exchange for a pledge by Joway Shengshi of its accounts receivable and assets; &#160; 

&#160; 3 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; a Proxy Agreement under which the two shareholders of Joway Shengshi have vested their collective voting control over Joway Shengshi to Junhe Consulting and may only transfer their respective equity interests in Joway Shengshi to Junhe Consulting or its designee(s); &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; an Option Agreement under which the shareholders of Joway Shengshi have granted to Junhe Consulting the irrevocable right and option to acquire all of their equity interests in Joway Shengshi with a consideration equal to the capital paid in by the shareholders in the amount of RMB 50 million (approximately USD $7.52 million). As executive director of Junhe Consulting, Mr. Jinghe Zhang has the power to exercise the option in his sole discretion; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; an Equity Pledge Agreement under which the owners of Joway Shengshi have pledged all of their rights, titles and interests in Joway Shengshi to Junhe Consulting to guarantee Joway Shengshi&#8217;s performance of its obligations under the Consulting Services Agreement. &#160;

Business Description 

&#160; 

We are, through our PRC Operating Entities, engaged in the manufacture and sales of tourmaline-related healthcare products. As of December 31, 2015, we had 74 employees. Our principal executive offices are located at No. 19 Baowang Road, Baodi Economic Development Zone, Tianjin, PRC 301800. 

&#160; 

Introduction to Tourmaline 

&#160; 

Tourmaline is a crystal silicate mineral compounded with elements such as aluminum, iron, magnesium, sodium, lithium, or potassium. Tourmaline is classified as a semi-precious stone and the gem comes in a wide variety of colors. (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourmaline) 

&#160; 

Tourmaline has the ability to become its own source of electric charge, as it is both pyroelectric, as well as piezoelectric. When it is put under pressure or when it is dramatically heated or cooled, tourmaline creates an electrical charge capable of emitting far infrared rays (&#8220;FIR&#8221;) and negative ions. (Source: http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/tourmaline.html) 

&#160; 

FIRs are invisible waves of energy capable of penetrating deep into the human body. Negative ions are atoms that have a negative electric charge. FIRs and negative ions are perceived to have certain health benefits. (Source: http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/tourmaline.html) 

&#160; 

Because it is a permanent source of FIRs and negative ions, tourmaline is perceived to have certain health benefits (Source: Niwa Institute for Immunology, Japan. Int J. Biometeorol 1993 Sep; 37(3) 133-8). In view of its perceived health benefits, tourmaline has been used to manufacture a wide range of healthcare products, including apparel, bedding, water purifiers, sauna rooms, and personal care products. 

&#160; 

While tourmaline has perceived health benefits, the actual benefits of tourmaline to human health are unknown. The full efficacy of tourmaline to human health requires further significant clinical study. We are not aware of any formal clinical studies which have validated the health benefits of tourmaline. 

&#160; 

We purchase liquid tourmaline from domestic companies which, in turn, import it from South Korea. Liquid tourmaline is readily available and its price has remained relatively stable. We have not experienced any shortage in tourmaline but as a precaution, we closely monitor its price and have several back-up suppliers. 

&#160; 

China&#8217;s Tourmaline Health-Related Products Market 

&#160; 

The use of tourmaline in health-related products in China began in 2001. Although more and more companies are producing tourmaline health-related products every year, the market for these products in China is still in its infancy and highly fragmented. (Source: 2010-2012 China's tourmaline market and investment prospects research report, Institute of China Uniway Economics, August, 2010). 

&#160; 

Currently, there are numerous kinds of tourmaline health-related products on the market, including tourmaline clothes, tourmaline mattresses, tourmaline water machines, etc. In China, users of tourmaline health-related products are typically middle-aged and elderly people and demand for tourmaline health-related products is still relatively low compared to the size of the Chinese population. 

&#160; 

We believe that the main challenge for the tourmaline health-related product companies is market development rather than competition. With rising living standards, increasing disposable income, higher health consciousness and the greater awareness of the health benefits of tourmaline, we believe that the tourmaline health products market will grow rapidly in the next few years. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing Process 

&#160; 

We have two manufacturing processes. 

&#160; 

One manufacturing process consists of applying or infusing raw textiles with liquid or granular tourmaline and then producing products from these tourmaline-infused textiles. This process is used to produce Male and Female Underpants, Tourmaline Scarves and Tourmaline Pillowcases. 

&#160; 

Our second manufacturing process consists of applying or infusing already finished products with liquid or granular tourmaline. We purchase finished products, such as clothing, bedding, and mattresses and then, using one or more of the techniques described below, coat and/or infuse the products with liquid or granular tourmaline. 

&#160; 

We coat or infuse liquid or granular tourmaline into our products using one or more of the following methods: 

&#160; 

The Spray Method 

&#160; 

We use special high-pressure nozzles to spray liquid tourmaline onto the surface of the product. Through this process, the tourmaline particles attach onto the surface of the product. We then use a high-temperature ironing machine to embed the tourmaline particles into the fibers of the product. This method is used in the manufacture of large pieces of textile products, such as mattresses. 

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The Dip Method 

&#160; 

We completely immerse fabrics into liquid tourmaline and then stir the fabrics in the liquid tourmaline to ensure the tourmaline particles attach to the surface of the fabrics. Finally, we embed the tourmaline particles into the fibers by applying heat with our special high-temperature ironing machine. This method is used in the manufacture of smaller products, such as underwear, scarves, and shirts. 

&#160; 

The Filling Method 

&#160; 

We fill the products with tourmaline particles. This method is used to make activated water machines and other water treatment products. 

&#160; 

The three methods mentioned above are keys to our manufacturing process. We protect our manufacturing methods via confidentiality agreements entered into between us and our employees. Pursuant to the confidentiality agreement, the employees are prohibited from unlawfully revealing and using our confidential technology during his/her term of employment and ten years after the termination of employment. 

&#160; 

Our Products and Services 

&#160; 

We primarily manufacture the following three series of tourmaline-related healthcare products: 

&#160; 

1. Healthcare Knit Goods Series 

&#160; 

For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our healthcare knit goods series of products accounted for approximately 30.6% and 28.2% of our annual sales revenue, respectively. This series of products is comprised of tourmaline treated mattresses, bed linen, underwear, and shirts. We use either the spray or dip method to embed tourmaline particles into the fabric of this series of products. 

&#160; 

Set forth below is a list of our major healthcare knit goods products, the trademarks or marks under which they are marketed and the manufacturing method employed: 

&#160; 

No. &#160; Products &#160; Trademark/Mark &#160; Manufacturing Method 1 &#160; Golden Mattress &#160; &#160; &#160; Spray Method 2 &#160; Tourmaline Mattress &#160; &#160; &#160; Spray Method 3 &#160; Tourmaline Undergarment &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Dip Method 4 &#160; Tourmaline Bed Linens &#160; &#160; &#160; Spray Method 5 &#160; Tourmaline Male Shirts &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Dip Method 6 &#160; Tourmaline Pillow &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Spray Method &#160; 

2. Daily Healthcare and Personal Care Series 

&#160; 

For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our daily healthcare and personal care series of products accounted for approximately 19.3% and 21.9% of our annual sales revenue, respectively. This series is comprised of tourmaline-treated wrist protectors, knee protectors, scarves, and shampoo and soap products. We use all three production methods to embed tourmaline particles into these products. We believe these tourmaline-treated daily healthcare products and personal care products produce FIRs and negative ions which have perceived health benefits. 

&#160; 

Set forth below is a list of our major products in the daily healthcare and personal care series, the trademarks or marks under which they are marketed and the manufacturing method employed:

&#160; 

3. Wellness House and Activated Water Machine 

&#160; 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our wellness house and activated water machine series of products accounted for approximately 50.1% and 49.9% of our annual sales revenue, respectively. This series of products is comprised mainly of tourmaline wellness houses, foot sauna bucket, tourmaline activated water machines and drinking mugs. Our tourmaline wellness house resembles a regular sauna room in which users experience heat sessions. However, the inner layer of our wellness house is coated with tourmaline, which emits FIRs and negative ions when heated. We supply two types of wellness houses: one for family use, which is designed to be installed in the corner of a room and can seat two to three people; the other is customized and constructed on site for commercial bathrooms or spas according to their specifications. Our tourmaline activated water machines and drinking mugs are infused tourmaline particles into filters. Our Foot Sauna Bucket is filled with tourmaline particles on the bottom. Tourmaline is perceived to have certain health benefits.

It is the Company&#8217;s normal commercial practice to only allow the return of goods that do not conform to the customer&#8217;s order due to some occasional error in packaging or shipment. The return should be requested within seven days of purchase. Customers may also request a free repair of defective products within 15 days of purchase. For products purchased more than 15 days previously, we charge a service fee of 110% of the cost of repaired or replaced parts. During 2015 and 2014, we did not have sales return occurred.

Services: Wellness House Maintenance 

&#160; 

Our wellness house products generally carry a one-year warranty. When the warranty expires, we provide our customers the option to engage us to service and maintain their wellness houses for a fee equal to 200% of the cost of the repaired or replaced parts. 

&#160; 

There has been very little demand for our wellness house maintenance services in 2015 and 2014. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, there were approximately 137 franchise stores across the PRC that were authorized to sell our products exclusively. Set forth below is a geographical breakdown of the franchise stores: 

&#160;

&#160; Number of Franchise Stores &#160; Northeastern China (Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang) &#160; 13 &#160; Northern China (Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia) &#160; 74 &#160; Eastern China (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi) &#160; 14 &#160; Southern China (Guangdong, Hainan, Guangxi) &#160; 11 &#160; Central China (Henan, Hubei, Hunan) &#160; 15 &#160; Southwestern China (Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet) &#160; 10 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Total &#160; 137 &#160; &#160;

We use multiple criteria to select our franchisees, including financial condition, sales network, sales personnel, and facilities. Generally we approve applicants that meet a minimum working capital requirement of RMB 40,000 and have the requisite business facilities and resources. 

&#160; 

We typically enter into a standard franchising agreement with the applicant. Pursuant to the agreement, the franchisee is authorized to sell our products exclusively at a predetermined retail price. In exchange, we provide them with products at a discounted price, geographical exclusivity, and marketing, training and technological support. The franchisee is also required to adhere to certain standards of product merchandising, promotion and presentment. No initial franchise fees are required from the franchisee, nor is the franchisee required to pay any continuing royalties. The agreement is generally for a term of three years and is renewable on the mutual agreement of both parties.

Cooperative Contract on Investment in Establishing Joway Hezhi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. 

&#160; 

On August 28, 2011, one of our subsidiaries, Joway Shengshi, and Tianjin Hezhi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (referred to herein as &#8220;Tianjin Hezhi&#8221;) entered into a Cooperative Contract, pursuant to which Joway Shengshi and Tianjin Hezhi established a new company named Tianjin Joway Hezhi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (referred to herein as &#8220;Joway Hezhi&#8221;) with a registered capital of RMB 20,000,000. Joway Hezhi was incorporated on October 21, 2011 with initial registered capital of RMB 5,000,000. Joway Hezhi will engage in the production and distribution of Chinese-Western preparations, health food, healthcare products, medical instruments and plain food. On October 11, 2011, Joway Shengshi contributed RMB 1,500,000 in consideration for 30% of the equity in Joway Hezhi. Pursuant to the Cooperative Contract, Joway Shengshi has the obligation to contribute to Joway Hezhi an additional capital of RMB 4,500,000 and 51 mu or approximately 3,400 square meter land use rights. On June 26, 2014, Joway Hezhi returned all of our investment in the amount of RMB 1,500,000 after being failed to finish its early preparatory period for three years. We received no gain or loss from this withdrawal. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

Our primary marketing strategies are directed towards both our franchisees and end users, and the marketing efforts of our franchisees are directed towards end users. The Company assists franchisees on monthly product introduction seminars, which are open to both our franchisees and to the general public. We also host an annual conference and three quarterly conferences, which are open to both our franchisees and to the general public as well. In 2015 and 2014, we held our annual and quarterly conferences in Tianjin City and did not charge entrance fees. 

&#160; 

The franchise stores are responsible for the cost of organizing the monthly product introduction seminars and meetings and we are responsible for the travel expenses of our employees who attend these meetings and seminars to explain and promote our various product lines. There are on average 20 such seminars and meetings each month nationwide. Generally, we choose the venue for the product seminars and meetings based on market prospects, sales volume and the extent of meeting preparation. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we held product seminars and meetings in approximately 57 cities in the PRC. 

&#160; 

Generally, we are responsible for the cost of annual and quarterly conferences. In 2015 and 2014, we incurred costs related to annual and quarterly conferences of $171,508 (RMB 1,070,226) and $51,158 (RMB 314,527), respectively. 

&#160; 

Below is a breakdown of our marketing expenses in the fiscal years 2015 and 2014.

&#160; 

For the fiscal year 2015, we have a marketing and sales budget of $462,057 (RMB 3,000,000), of which, $154,019 (RMB 1,00,000) is budgeted for our 2016 annual and quarterly conference, $154,019 (RMB 1,000,000) for sales personnel, and the remainder for travel, training and other expenses of our sales and marketing department.

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Because our products are for daily use, seasonal variations do not have meaningful impact on the market demand for our products. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Competitive Environment 

&#160; 

China&#8217;s tourmaline health products market is highly segmented and is in the stage with great demand. 

&#160; 

However, given the highly segmented nature of the market, we are unable to locate any information on the size of the tourmaline healthcare-related market in China. Currently, Japanese and Korean companies are leaders in tourmaline technology. However, they have not yet developed a sizeable market share for their products in the PRC (Source: 2010-2012 China's tourmaline market and investment prospects research report, Institute of China Uniway Economics, August 2010). Therefore, we believe that there is a great opportunity for us to create demand and market share and establish ourselves as a leader in the tourmaline-related healthcare products field. 

&#160; 

Our Competitors 

&#160; 

Our major competitors in the PRC are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; Hanya Nano Technology Co., Ltd. operates in Changsha, Hunan province, PRC. They mainly focus on manufacturing tourmaline sauna rooms and tourmaline health products. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Harbin Handu Tourmaline Nano Technology Development Co., Ltd. operates in PRC. They mainly focus on manufacturing tourmaline sauna rooms and tourmaline health products. &#160; 

Our Competitive Advantages 

&#160; 

We believe that by leveraging the following strengths, we can effectively compete and enhance our market position: 

&#160;

We believe the market for tourmaline health-related products in the PRC will grow rapidly. In order to benefit from the market opportunities, we plan to implement the following strategies: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; We will focus on expanding our sales and franchise network in the PRC. Over the past few years, most of our franchises are located in north of China, our target is to cover the most provinces in China especially the southern part in which economy remains high development. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We will continue to expand our product offerings and seek to optimize our product portfolio to include more products with higher profit margins.

We have purchased work injury insurance and medical insurance for all our employees. 

&#160; 

Effective January 1, 2008, the PRC introduced a new labor contract law that enhances rights for the nation's workers, including open-ended work contracts and severance pay. The legislation requires employers to provide written contracts to their workers, restricts the use of temporary laborers and makes it harder to lay off employees. It also requires that employees with fixed-term contracts be entitled to an indefinite-term contract after a fixed-term contract is renewed twice. Although the new labor contract law will increase our labor costs, we do not anticipate there will be any significantly effects on our overall profitability in the near future since such amount was historically not material to our operating cost . Management anticipates this may be a step toward improving candidate retention for skilled workers.

The products we manufacture are not regulated by the CFDA as they are not drugs, diet supplements or food consumed by humans. There are no existing laws or regulations in China governing the manufacture and sale of tourmaline health care products such as those sold by the Company nor are there any inspection requirements applicable to our products. 

We act as a distributor for four edible products including Xin-Nao-Ling Fish Oil Soft Gel and Zhi-Li-Bao Fish Oil Soft Gel , which are subject to CFDA regulation. These products are manufactured by Penglai Huakang Healthcare Industries, Ltd., Tianjin Hezhi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.., and Jilin Luwang Sanbao Biological Technology Co., Ltd., which all have obtained the necessary manufacturing licenses and certifications from the CFDA. 

Environmental Regulations 

The major environmental regulations applicable to us include the PRC Environmental Protection Law, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Water Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution and its Implementation Rules, the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Solid Waste Pollution, and the PRC Law on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution. To date, the Company&#8217;s costs to comply with applicable environmental laws have been minimal. 

According to Article 32 of the PRC Environmental Protection Law, a project that may cause pollution to the environment cannot be undertaken until an environmental impact statement has been approved by the applicable department of environmental protection administration. 

In March 2008, Joway Shengshi submitted an environmental impact statement with respect to the manufacturing of 300,000 sets of knitwear annually to the Tianjin Baodi Environmental Protection Bureau. The environmental impact statement assesses the pollution that the manufacturing is likely to produce and its impact on the environment. In addition, the report stipulates the preventive and curative measures the company will undertake. Tianjin Baodi Environmental Protection Bureau approved the environmental impact statement on March 12, 2008 and on April 22, 2009, the Tianjin Baodi Environmental Protection Bureau approved the manufacture of 300,000 sets of knitwear annually. 

The Company&#8217;s production process does not produce industrial waste water or waste gas emissions of a type that is regulated by current PRC laws and regulations. The Company&#8217;s other emissions, including noise, waste water, solid waste and atmospheric pollutants meet regulatory standards. According to the Letter regarding Environment Protection of Tianjin Joway Shengshi Group Co, Ltd. issued by Tianjin Baodi Environmental Protection Bureau dated August 6, 2014, Joway Shengshi complies with applicable environmental protection laws and regulations and its discharge of pollutants meets with the standards of the state and Tianjin City.
