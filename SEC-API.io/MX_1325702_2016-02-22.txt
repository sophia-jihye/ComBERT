Our Foundry Services Group business represented 45.9%, 51.6% and 53.9% of our net sales for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

We manufacture the majority of our products at our three fabrication facilities located in Korea. We have approximately 488 proprietary process flows we can utilize for our products and offer to our Foundry Services Group customers. Our manufacturing base serves both our display driver and power management businesses and Foundry Services Group customers, allowing us to optimize our asset utilization and leverage our investments across our product and service offerings. Analog and mixed-signal manufacturing facilities and processes are typically distinguished by design and process implementation expertise rather than the use of the most advanced equipment. These processes also tend to migrate more slowly to smaller geometries due to technological barriers and increased costs. For example, some of our products use high-voltage technology that requires larger geometries and that may not migrate to smaller geometries for several years, if at all. As a result, our manufacturing base and strategy do not require substantial investment in leading edge process equipment, allowing us to utilize our facilities and equipment over an extended period of time with moderate required capital investments. 

On December 4, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a plan to close the Company&#146;s six-inch fabrication facility in Cheongju, Korea (the &#147;6-inch fab&#148;). This plan is expected to be substantially implemented and the 6-inch fab is expected to be closed during the first quarter of 2016. The Company currently plans to transfer certain 6-inch fab employees to the Company&#146;s other facilities.

Display Solutions 

Display Driver Characteristics. Display drivers deliver defined analog voltages and currents that activate pixels to exhibit images on displays. The following key characteristics determine display driver performance and end-market application: 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Resolution and Number of Channels. Resolution determines the level of detail displayed within an image and is defined by the number of pixels per line multiplied by the number of lines on a display. For large displays, higher resolution typically requires more display drivers for each panel. Display drivers that have a greater number of channels, however, generally require fewer display drivers for each panel and command a higher selling price per unit. Mobile displays, conversely, are typically single chip solutions designed to deliver a specific resolution. We cover resolutions ranging from VGA (640 x 480) to UHD (3840 x 2160). 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Color Depth. Color depth is the number of colors that can be displayed on a panel. For example, for TFT-LCD panels, 262 thousand colors are supported by 6-bit source drivers; 16 million colors are supported by 8-bit source drivers; and 1 billion colors are supported by 10-bit source drivers. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Operational Voltage. Display drivers are characterized by input and output voltages. Source drivers typically operate at input voltages from 1.62 to 3.6 volts and output voltages between 9 and 18 volts. Gate drivers typically operate at input voltages from 1.62 to 3.6 volts and output voltages from 30 to 45 volts. Lower input voltage results in lower power consumption and electromagnetic interference (EMI). 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Gamma Curve. The relationship between the light passing through a pixel and the voltage applied to the pixel by the source driver is referred to as the gamma curve. The gamma curve of the source driver can correct some imperfections in picture quality in a process generally known as gamma correction. Some advanced display drivers feature up to three independent gamma curves to facilitate this correction. 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Driver Interface. Driver interface refers to the connection between the timing controller and the display drivers. Display drivers increasingly require higher bandwidth interface technology to address the larger data transfer rate necessary for higher definition images. The principal types of interface technologies are embedded clock point to point interface (EPI), advanced intra panel interface (AIPI), mini-low voltage differential signaling (m-LVDS), unified standard interface for notebook and monitor (USI-GF), unified standard interface (USI), unified standard interface for TV (USI-T) and mobile industry processor interface (MIPI). 

&#160;

&#149; &#160; Package Type. The assembly of display drivers typically uses chip-on-film (COF) and COG package types. 

Large Display Solutions. We provide display solutions for a wide range of flat panel display sizes used in LCD televisions, including ultra-high definition televisions, or UHD TVs, FHD TVs, HD TVs, LED TVs, 3D TVs, OLED TVs, LCD monitors, notebooks, tablet PCs, public information displays and automotive. 

Our large display solutions include source and gate drivers and timing controllers with a variety of interfaces, voltages, frequencies and packages to meet customers&#146; needs. These products include advanced technologies such as high channel count, with products in mass production to provide up to 1,440 channels. Our large display solutions are designed to allow customers to cost-effectively meet the increasing demand for high resolution displays. We focus extensively on reducing the die size of our large display drivers and other solutions products to reduce costs without having to migrate to smaller geometries. For example, we have implemented several solutions to reduce die size in large display drivers, such as optimizing design schemes and design rules and applying specific technologies that we have developed internally. We have recently introduced a number of new large display drivers with reduced die size.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio of intellectual property assets included approximately 3,274 registered patents and 454 pending patent applications. Approximately 2,426 and 160 of our patents and pending patents are novel in that they are not a foreign counterpart of an existing patent or patent application. Because we file patents in multiple jurisdictions, we additionally have approximately 1,142 registered and pending patents that relate to identical technical claims in our base patent portfolio. Our patents expire at various times approximately over the next 18 years. While these patents are in the aggregate important to our competitive position, we do not believe that any single registered or pending patent is material to us. 

We have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses and development agreements with third parties relating to the use of intellectual property of the third parties in our products and design processes, including licenses related to embedded memory technology, design tools, process simulation tools, circuit designs and processor cores. Some of these licenses, including our agreements with Silicon Works Co., Ltd. and ARM Limited, are material to our business and may be terminated by the licensors prior to the expiration of these licenses should we fail to cure any breach under such licenses. Our license with Silicon Works Co., Ltd. relates to our large display drivers, and our license from ARM Limited primarily relates to product lines in our Foundry Services Group business. The loss of either license could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Additionally, in connection with the Original Acquisition, SK Hynix retained a perpetual license to use the intellectual property that we acquired from SK Hynix in the Original Acquisition. Under this license, SK Hynix and its subsidiaries are free to develop products that may incorporate or embody intellectual property developed by us prior to October 2004. 

Competition 

We operate in highly competitive markets characterized by rapid technological change and continually advancing customer requirements. Although no one company competes with us in all of our product lines, we face significant competition in each of our market segments. Our competitors include other independent and captive manufacturers and designers of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits, including display driver and power management semiconductor devices, as well as companies providing specialty manufacturing services. 

We compete based on design experience, manufacturing capabilities, the ability to service customer needs from the design phase through the shipping of a completed product, length of design cycle and quality of technical support and sales personnel. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on internal and external variables, both within and outside of our control. These variables include the timeliness with which we can develop new products and technologies, product performance and quality, manufacturing yields, capacity availability, customer service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends. 

Employees 

Our worldwide workforce consisted of 3,220 employees (full- and part-time) as of December 31, 2015, of which 441 were involved in sales, marketing, general and administrative, 432 in research and development (including 237 with advanced degrees), 119 in quality, reliability and assurance and 2,228 in manufacturing (comprised of 338 in engineering and 1,890 in operations). As of December 31, 2015, our workforce consisted of 3,220 employees, of which 2,019 employees, or approximately 63% of our workforce, were represented by the MagnaChip Semiconductor Labor Union. 

Environmental 

We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, governing, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the generation, use, handling, storage and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances (including asbestos) 

&#160; 

and waste, soil and groundwater contamination and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Since 2015, our Korean subsidiary has been subject to a new set of greenhouse gas emissions regulation, the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme, or K-ETS, under the Act on Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emission Allowances. Under K-ETS, our Korean subsidiary was allocated a certain amount of emissions allowance in accordance with the National Allocation Plan prepared by the Korean government and is required to meet its allocated target by either reducing the emission or purchasing the allowances from other participants in the emission trading market. Another example is the newly reinforced regulations on chemicals under Chemicals Control Act and K-REACH, which came into effect on January 1, 2015. Under these laws, our Korean subsidiary is required to comply with various requirements to report, evaluate, manage and ensure the safe usage of the chemicals used in its facilities. There can be no assurance that we have been or will be in compliance with all of these laws and regulations, or that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with these laws and regulations in the future. The adoption of new environmental, health and safety laws and the failure to comply with new or existing laws or issues relating to hazardous substances could subject us to material liability (including substantial fines or penalties), impose the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements upon us, curtail our operations or restrict our ability to expand operations. 

Raw Materials 

We use processes that require specialized raw materials that are generally available from a limited number of suppliers. We continue to attempt to qualify additional suppliers for our raw materials. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;), as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, adopted new disclosure regulations for public companies that manufacture products containing certain minerals that are mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These &#147;conflict minerals&#148; are commonly found in metals used in the manufacture of semiconductors. The implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of metals used in the manufacture of our products. See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Business&#151;Compliance with new regulations regarding the use of &#147;conflict minerals&#148; could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain raw materials used in manufacturing our products.&#148;
