History and Development of the Company 

&#160;

NCLH is a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises brands. We have 22 ships with approximately 45,000 Berths and will introduce five additional ships through 2019. Our ships currently offer itineraries to more than 510 destinations worldwide.

&#160;

Norwegian commenced operations from Miami in 1966. In February 2000, Genting HK acquired control of and subsequently became the sole owner of the Norwegian operations.

&#160;

In January 2008, the Apollo Holders acquired 50% of the outstanding ordinary share capital of NCLC. As part of this investment, the Apollo Holders assumed control of NCLC&#8217;s Board of Directors. Also, in January 2008, the TPG Viking Funds acquired, in the aggregate, 12.5% of NCLC&#8217;s outstanding share capital from the Apollo Holders.

&#160;

In January 2013, NCLH completed its IPO, pursuant to which it sold 27,058,824 ordinary shares for net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and expenses, of approximately $473.9 million.

&#160;

In November 2014, we completed the Acquisition of Prestige. We believe that the combination of Norwegian and Prestige creates a cruise operating company with a rich product portfolio and strong market presence.

&#160;

The Sponsors have completed numerous Secondary Equity Offerings and as of December 31, 2015 owned 29.3% of NCLH&#8217;s ordinary shares.

&#160; 

Corporate Reorganization 

&#160;

In February 2011, NCLH, a Bermuda limited company, was formed with the issuance to the Sponsors of, in aggregate, 10,000 ordinary shares, with a par value of $.001 per share. In connection with the consummation of the IPO, the Sponsors&#8217; ordinary shares in NCLC were exchanged for the ordinary shares of NCLH, and NCLH became the owner of 100% of the ordinary shares and parent company of NCLC (the &#8220;Corporate Reorganization&#8221;). At the same time, NCLH contributed $460.0 million to NCLC and the historical financial statements of NCLC became those of NCLH. The Corporate Reorganization was effected solely for the purpose of reorganizing our corporate structure. NCLH had not, prior to the completion of the Corporate Reorganization, conducted any activities other than those incidental to its formation and to prepare for the Corporate Reorganization and the IPO.

&#160;

NCLC was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the terms of the partnership (including the economic rights with respect thereto) were set forth in an amended and restated tax agreement for NCLC. Economic interests in NCLC were represented by the partnership interests established under the tax agreement, which we refer to as &#8220;NCL Corporation Units.&#8221;

&#160;

In connection with the Corporate Reorganization, NCLC&#8217;s outstanding profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement to management (or former management) of NCLC were exchanged for an economically equivalent number of NCL Corporation Units. We refer to the NCL Corporation Units exchanged for profits interests granted under the profits sharing agreement as Management NCL Corporation Units. As a result of the Corporate Reorganization, the Management NCL Corporation Units created a non-controlling interest within NCLH. The Management NCL Corporation Units received upon the exchange of outstanding profits interests were subject to the same time-based vesting requirements and performance-based vesting requirements applicable to the profits interests for which they were exchanged. The Management NCL Corporation Units issued in exchange for the profits interests represented a 2.7% economic interest in NCLC as of the consummation of the IPO.

&#160;

Subject to certain procedures and restrictions (including the vesting schedules applicable to the Management NCL Corporation Units and any applicable legal and contractual restrictions), each holder of Management NCL Corporation Units had the right to cause NCLC and NCLH to exchange the holder&#8217;s Management NCL Corporation Units for ordinary shares of NCLH at an exchange rate equal to one ordinary share for every Management NCL Corporation Unit (or, at NCLC&#8217;s election, a cash payment equal to the value of the exchanged Management NCL Corporation Units), subject to customary adjustments for stock splits, subdivisions, combinations and similar extraordinary events.

&#160;

When a holder of a Management NCL Corporation Unit exchanged such unit for one of NCLH&#8217;s ordinary shares (or a cash payment equal to the value of one of such ordinary shares), the relative economic interests of the exchanging NCL Corporation Unit holder and the holders of ordinary shares of NCLH were not altered. As a result of the Corporate Reorganization, a non-controlling interest was created within NCLH and NCLH&#8217;s financial statements and financial results differed from NCLC&#8217;s in certain respects.

&#160;

In the fourth quarter of 2014, all Management NCL Corporation Units were exchanged for NCLH ordinary shares and restricted shares. NCLH became the sole member and 100% owner of the economic interests in NCLC and the non-controlling interest no longer exists. Accordingly, NCLC is now treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes. No new NCLC profits interests or Management NCL Corporation Units will be issued; however, NCLH has granted, and expects to continue to grant, equity to its employees and members of its Board of Directors under its long-term incentive plan.

Our Company 

&#160; 

NCLH Business Overview 

&#160;

NCLH is a leading global cruise company which operates the Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent brands. With a combined fleet of 22 ships with approximately 45,000 Berths, these brands offer itineraries to more than 510 destinations worldwide including Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South America, Africa, Canada, Bermuda, Caribbean, Alaska and Hawaii. Norwegian&#8217;s U.S.-flagged ship, Pride of America, provides the industry&#8217;s only entirely inter-island itinerary in Hawaii.

&#160;

In October 2015, Norwegian took delivery of our largest ship to date, Norwegian Escape. We will introduce five additional ships through 2019: Regent&#8217;s Seven Seas Explorer, on order for delivery in the summer of 2016; three Breakaway Plus Class Ships on order for deliveries to the Norwegian fleet in the spring of 2017, spring of 2018 and fall of 2019; and a ship we acquired from a third party to join the Oceania Cruises&#8217; fleet, which will be named Sirena. After its current Bareboat Charter ends in March 2016, we will extensively refurbish Sirena to our standards. Sirena is a sister ship to the R-Class ships currently in the Oceania Cruises&#8217; fleet and will be placed in service in the spring of 2016. These additions to our fleet will increase our total Berths to approximately 59,000. 

&#160;

All of our brands offer an assortment of features, amenities and activities, including a variety of accommodations, multiple dining venues, bars and lounges, spa, casino and retail shopping areas and numerous entertainment choices. All brands also offer a selection of shore excursions at each port of call as well as hotel packages for stays before or after a voyage.

&#160;

Norwegian is an innovator in cruise travel with 14 ships that have been purpose-built to consistently deliver the &#8220;Freestyle Cruising&#8221; product, which offers freedom, flexibility and choice to our guests who prefer to dine when they want, with whomever they want and without having to dress formally. Certain ships in Norwegian&#8217;s fleet offer The Haven by Norwegian (&#8220;The Haven&#8221;), a luxurious, key-card access enclave that has spacious accommodations with suites as large as 1,345 square feet and offers a &#8220;ship within a ship&#8221; experience. The Haven includes two decks of suites, a private pool with multiple hot tubs and sundeck, a private fitness center and steam rooms, fine dining in a private restaurant, casual outdoor dining, 24-hour concierge service and personal butlers. In 2015, Norwegian was named &#8220;Europe&#8217;s Leading Cruise Line&#8221; for the eighth consecutive year, as well as &#8220;Caribbean&#8217;s Leading Cruise Line&#8221; for the third time and &#8220;World&#8217;s Leading Large Ship Cruise Line&#8221; for the fourth straight year by the World Travel Awards.

&#160;

Oceania Cruises offers the finest cuisine at sea and immersive destination experiences with destination-rich itineraries spanning the globe. Oceania Cruises operates a fleet of five mid-size ships, including two 1,250-Berth O-Class ships, and three 684-Berth R-Class ships. Oceania Cruises is ranked as one of the world&#8217;s best cruise lines by Cond&#233; Nast Traveler and Travel + Leisure. Oceania Cruises&#8217; ships received &#8220;Best Dining,&#8221; &#8220;Best Public Rooms&#8221; and &#8220;Best Cabins&#8221; from Cruise Critic Cruisers&#8217; Choice Awards in 2015.

&#160;

Regent Seven Seas Cruises is an all-inclusive cruise line which provides all-suite accommodations, round-trip air transportation, highly personalized service, acclaimed cuisine, fine wines and spirits, Wi-Fi, sightseeing excursions in every port and other amenities included in the cruise fare. The brand operates three award-winning ships, totaling 1,890 Berths. Most recently, Regent Seven Seas Cruises won the &#8220;Best Cruise Ship, Luxury&#8221; award, for Seven Seas Mariner, and the &#8220;Best Cruise Line, Luxury&#8221; award from the TravAlliance Travvy Awards. Regent Seven Seas Cruises also won the 2015 National Association of Career Travel Agents &#8220;Luxury Cruise Line Partner of the Year&#8221; award.

Our Competitive Strengths 

&#160;

We believe that the following business strengths will enable us to execute our strategy:

&#160; 

Rich Stateroom Mix 

&#160;

The Norwegian, Oceania Cruises&#8217; and Regent fleets offer an attractive mix of staterooms, suites and villas. Norwegian&#8217;s accommodations include the groundbreaking Studio staterooms designed for solo travelers centered around the Studio Lounge, a private lounge area solely for Studio guests, as well as ocean views, balconies, and connecting accommodations to meet the needs of all types of cruisers. Norwegian&#8217;s suites range from two bedroom family suites to penthouses and owner suites, as well as three bedroom Garden Villas measuring up to 6,694 square feet. In addition, eight of Norwegian&#8217;s ships offer The Haven, a key-card access enclave on the upper decks with luxurious suite accommodations, exclusive amenities, and 24/7 butler and concierge service. The Haven suites surround a private courtyard with pool, hot tubs, sundeck, fitness center and steam rooms. Onboard Norwegian Epic and Breakaway Class Ships, The Haven also includes a private lounge and fine dining restaurant. Norwegian Escape, the newest and first of the Breakaway Plus Class Ships, offers the largest Haven complex to date with new outdoor fine dining providing expansive ocean views. The spacious and elegant accommodations on Oceania Cruises&#8217; five award-winning ships, the 684-Berth Regatta, Insignia and Nautica, and the 1,250-Berth Marina and Riviera, range from 160-square foot inside staterooms to opulent 2,030-square foot Owner&#8217;s Suites. Oceania Cruises will add a fourth 684-Berth ship with Sirena being placed in service in the spring of 2016. The Regent fleet is comprised of three ships, Seven Seas Voyager and Seven Seas Mariner, which feature all-suite, all-balcony accommodations, and Seven Seas Navigator, with a majority of accommodations including balconies. Regent&#8217;s Seven Seas Explorer, to be delivered in the summer of 2016, will also feature all-suite, all-balcony accommodations including sophisticated designer suites ranging from 300 to 3,875 square feet which are amongst the highest space-to-guest and crew-to-guest ratios in the industry.

&#160; 

High-Quality Service 

&#160;

The Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent brands all offer a high level of onboard service. Norwegian continues to enhance the level of service on its ships through the recently launched (&#8220;The Norwegian Edge&#8221;) program. This program introduces specific standards aimed at enhancing the overall guest experience which we believe will promote further customer loyalty. We believe the Acquisition of Prestige allows for collaboration among the Norwegian, Oceania Cruises and Regent brands which will facilitate our ability to provide an enhanced guest experience across all brands. Oceania Cruises and Regent are known for their quality of service, including some of the highest crew-to-guest ratios in the industry and a staff trained to deliver personalized and attentive service in a country club, casual setting.

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Diverse Selection of Premium Itineraries 

&#160;

We have expanded our already broad range of premium itineraries. Our fleet has a worldwide deployment, offering one to 180 days itineraries to more than 510 ports, including destinations in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, the Greek Isles, Alaska, Canada and New England, Asia, Tahiti and the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, Africa, India, South America, the Panama Canal, and the Caribbean.

&#160; 

Strong Cash Flow 

&#160;

We believe our business model will generate a significant amount of cash flow with high revenue visibility. All three of our brands afford the ability to pre-sell tickets, receive customer deposits and sell onboard activities in advance with long lead times ahead of sailing. In terms of newbuild capital expenditures, the cash flow impact is mitigated as we have export credit financing in place for all newbuild ships to fund approximately 80% of the contract price of each ship.

&#160; 

Highly Experienced Management Team 

&#160;

Our senior management team is comprised of executives with extensive experience in the cruise, travel, leisure and hospitality-related industries. Frank J. Del Rio is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Del Rio has been responsible for the financial and strategic development of Prestige. Mr. Del Rio founded Oceania Cruises in October 2002 and played a vital role in the development of Renaissance Cruises from 1993 to 2001. Andrew Stuart is our President and Chief Operating Officer of our Norwegian brand. Mr. Stuart joined Norwegian in 1988 and has held several Senior Management positions in Sales, Marketing and Passenger Services during his tenure before becoming President and Chief Operating Officer in 2015. Jason M. Montague is our President and Chief Operating Officer for the Regent and Oceania Cruises brands and was instrumental in launching Oceania Cruises in 2002 and is widely regarded as one of its co-founders. Wendy Beck is our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Beck has been with NCLH since 2010 and was instrumental in consummation of the IPO. For more on our senior management, see &#8220;Executive Officers&#8221; below.

&#160; 

Our Business Strategies 

&#160;

We seek to attract vacationers with our products and services and by creating differentiated itineraries in new markets on our current and upcoming ships with the aim of delivering an enhanced, value-added vacation experience to our guests relative to other vacation alternatives. Our business strategies include the following:

&#160; 

Post-Acquisition of Prestige Strategy 

&#160;

We have implemented a corporate-wide strategy following the Acquisition of Prestige which we believe will deliver a quality product to our guests and generate returns to our shareholders. We termed this strategy the &#8220;New Deal&#8221; which includes three main tenets:

&#160; 

Organic growth . We capitalize on the knowledge throughout the organization to identify areas where marginal changes can be implemented that promote growth from organic sources. By sharing best practices across brands, our marketing teams find areas of opportunity to more effectively market to past guests not only within each brand, but across brands as well.

&#160; 

Driving higher per diems to deliver higher yields. We are implementing a market-to-fill strategy which maintains pricing integrity by offering both the best price early in the booking cycle and value-added promotions when necessary to avoid compromising on price. Diversification of deployment is another key initiative to drive higher yields. Our destination management team reviews deployments across the fleet, either repositioning ships to new destinations or fine-tuning itineraries, with the goal of creating scarcity which, in turn, leads to higher pricing. We also look to increase demand through effective marketing and an enhanced sales force.

&#160; 

Leveraging scale to suppress costs. We leverage the combined purchasing power of our three brands to reduce costs throughout the organization. In addition, we have created a shared-services model to manage the newly combined company. This model places vessel operations, finance, accounting, purchasing, legal, information technology and human resources, as well as other departments, as a shared-service for all three brands. This shared-services model not only generates expense-related synergies, but also facilitates the sharing of best practices across all areas. 

&#160; 

Enhanced Product Offerings and Guest Experience 

&#160;

Norwegian&#8217;s ships offer up to 28 dining options, a diverse range of accommodations and what we believe is the widest array of entertainment at sea. Norwegian is also enhancing the guest experience with The Norwegian Edge, a program that includes a multi-year, $400 million investment to enhance the guest experience via extensive ship revitalizations and enriched destination experiences. We plan to complete these revitalizations and destination enhancements by the end of 2017, at which time nine Norwegian ships will have undergone stern to bow refurbishments, bringing them to The Norwegian Edge standards. Oceania Cruises&#8217; award-winning onboard dining, with multiple open seating dining venues, is a central highlight of its cruise experience. Regent&#8217;s all-inclusive offering includes air transportation, shore excursions, hotel packages, specialty restaurants, premium spirits and fine wines, gratuities and other amenities. Regent recently announced a $125 million fleet-wide renovation program aimed at upgrading its existing fleet to the same standards as its upcoming Seven Seas Explorer.

&#160; 

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Maximize Net Yields 

&#160;

We focus on growing revenue through various initiatives aimed at increasing ticket prices and Occupancy Percentages as well as onboard spending to drive higher overall Net Yields. Our specific base-loading initiatives include:

&#160; 

Strategic Relationships. We developed strategic relationships with travel agencies and international tour operators who commit to purchasing a certain level of inventory with long lead times.

&#160; 

Meetings, Incentives and Charters. We increased the focus on the meetings, incentives and charters channel, which typically books very far in advance and can represent a significant portion of the ship, or even an entire sailing, in one transaction.

&#160; 

Casino Player Strategy. We have non-exclusive arrangements with over 100 casino partners worldwide whereby loyal gaming guests are offered cruise reward certificates redeemable for cruises. Through property sponsored events and joint marketing programs, we have the opportunity to market cruises to these guests. These arrangements with casino partners have the dual benefit of filling open inventory and reaching guests that we expect to generate above average onboard revenue through the casino and other onboard spending.

&#160; 

Disciplined Fleet Expansion 

&#160;

We have orders with Meyer Werft shipyard for three Breakaway Plus Class Ships for delivery in the spring of 2017, spring of 2018 and fall of 2019. These ships will be the largest in our fleet, reaching approximately 164,600 Gross Tons. With approximately 4,100 to 4,350 Berths each, they will be similar in design and innovation to our first Breakaway Plus Class Ship, Norwegian Escape, which was delivered in October 2015. We also have a contract with Fincantieri shipyard to build Seven Seas Explorer to be delivered in the summer of 2016. The all-suite, all-balcony Seven Seas Explorer will feature sophisticated designer suites ranging from 300 to 3,875 square feet with amongst the highest guest-to-space ratio of 76.0 gross ton per guest and a crew-to-guest ratio of 1 to 1.4. The ship will include five open-seating gourmet restaurants, Regent&#8217;s signature nine-deck open atrium, a two-story theater, two boutiques and an expansive Canyon Ranch SpaClub. In November 2014, we acquired a ship from a third party to join the Oceania Cruises&#8217; fleet which will be named Sirena. After its current Bareboat Charter ends in March 2016, we will extensively refurbish the ship to meet our standards. The third party provided financing for the contract price. We believe these new ships will allow us to continue expanding the reach of our brands, positioning us for accelerated growth and providing an optimized return on invested capital.

&#160; 

Expand and Strengthen Our Product Distribution Channels 

&#160;

As part of our growth strategy, we continually look for ways to deepen and expand our sales channels. We continue to invest in our brands by enhancing websites and passenger services departments where travel agents and guests have the ability to book cruise vacations.

&#160;

We focus on distribution through our three primary channels: &#8220;Retail/Travel Agent,&#8221; &#8220;International,&#8221; and &#8220;Meetings, Incentives and Charters.&#8221;

&#160; 

Retail/Travel Agent. The retail/travel agent channel represents the majority of our ticket sales. Our travel partner base is comprised of an extensive network of approximately 23,000 independent travel agencies including brick and mortar, internet-based and home-based operators located in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. We have made substantial investments with improvements in booking technologies, transparent pricing strategies, effective marketing tools, improved communication and cooperative marketing initiatives. We have expanded sales force teams who work closely with our travel agency partners on maximizing their marketing and sales effectiveness across all three of our brands. Our focused account management is designed to create solutions catered to the individual retailer through product and sales training. This education creates a deeper understanding of all our offerings.

&#160; 

International. We continue to accelerate our international expansion efforts, building on initiatives rolled out in 2015 that focused on increasing our presence in the fast growing Asia Pacific region. We announced the re-deployment of Norwegian Star to the Australasia region, which was followed by the opening of our sales office in Sydney, Australia which services the growing demand from the Asia Pacific region for cruises across our three brands.

&#160;

Our entry into the Chinese market includes a multi-pronged strategy to expand our presence in what many believe will soon become the world&#8217;s second largest cruise market. We began with the opening of sales and marketing offices in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong that will serve dual purposes. These offices will look to source Chinese guests for international cruises across our three brands, which together combine to form a broad portfolio of voyages and itineraries to every corner of the globe where a Chinese cruiser would look to sail. These offices will support our travel partners to source locally for our China-dedicated venture, our Breakaway Plus Class Ship being launched in the spring of 2017, which will be purpose-built for Chinese consumers. The ship will be designed to deliver a blend of the Norwegian brand&#8217;s offering of freedom and flexibility with amenities and features that will resonate with Chinese guests.

&#160;

For information regarding risks associated with our international operations, see Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor titled &#8220;Conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and risks.&#8221;

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Meetings, Incentives and Charters. This channel focuses on full ship charters as well as corporate meetings and incentive travel. These sales often have very long lead times and can fill a significant portion of the ship&#8217;s capacity, or even an entire sailing, in one transaction. The acquisition of Sixthman in 2012, a company specializing in developing and delivering music-oriented charters, opened up a new market for travel partners to be able to sell high-quality music experiences at sea to guests.

&#160; 

Itineraries 

&#160;

We offer cruise itineraries ranging from one to 180-days calling on over 510 worldwide locations, including destinations in Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, the Greek Isles, Alaska, Canada and New England, Asia, Tahiti and the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, Africa, India, South America, the Panama Canal, and the Caribbean. We have developed, and are continuing to develop, innovative itineraries to position our ships in new and niche markets as well as in the mainstream markets throughout the Americas and Europe.

&#160;

We believe that these destination-focused itineraries, complemented by a comprehensive shore excursion program (which is included in the all-inclusive fare for cruises on the Regent ships), differentiate our brands from many of our competitors. We call on &#8220;must-see&#8221; and exotic destinations, many of which include overnight stays in port, allowing guests to have more in-depth experiences than would otherwise be possible in only a single day port call.

&#160;

For some of our longer itineraries, we maximize profitability by selling segments of the longer itineraries as shorter cruises (i.e., which last 7 to 20 days) in order to capture more time-constrained customers. The deployment flexibility created by the use of longer itineraries translates off-peak seasons into more profitable portions of longer cruises.

&#160; 

Passenger Ticket Revenue 

&#160;

We offer our guests a wide variety of cruise fare options when booking a cruise. Our cruise ticket prices generally include cruise fare and a wide variety of onboard activities and amenities, including meals and entertainment. In some instances, cruise ticket prices include round-trip airfare to and from the port of embarkation, complimentary beverages, unlimited shore excursions and pre-cruise hotel packages. Prices vary depending on the particular cruise itinerary, stateroom category selected and the time of year that the voyage takes place.

&#160; 

Onboard and Other Revenue 

&#160;

All three brands generate onboard and other revenue for additional products and services which are not included in the cruise fare, including casino operations, certain food and beverage, gift shop purchases, spa services, photo services and other similar items. Food and beverage, casino operations and shore excursions are generally managed directly by us while retail shops, spa services, art auctions and internet services are generally managed through contracts with third-party concessionaires. These contracts generally entitle us to a fixed percentage for the gross sales derived from these concessions. Norwegian&#8217;s ticket prices typically include cruise accommodations, meals in certain dining facilities and many onboard activities such as entertainment, pool-side activities and various sports programs. Norwegian generates additional revenue on our ships from casino operations, food and beverage, gift shop purchases, shore excursions, spa services, photo services and other similar items. To maximize onboard revenue, Norwegian uses various cross-marketing and promotional tools which are supported by point-of-sale systems permitting &#8220;cashless&#8221; transactions for the sale of these products and services. Oceania Cruises&#8217; offerings typically include air transportation and certain other amenities. Regent&#8217;s offerings typically include air transportation, a pre-cruise hotel night stay (for concierge level and above), premium wines and top shelf liquors, gratuities and unlimited shore excursions. Both Regent and Oceania Cruises generate additional revenue from casino operations, gift shop purchases, shore excursions and spa services.

&#160;

Onboard and other revenue accounted for 28% of our consolidated revenue in 2015, 30% in 2014 and 31% in 2013.

&#160; 

Revenue Management Practices 

&#160;

Our revenue management function performs extensive analyses in order to determine booking history and trends by sailing, stateroom category, travel partner, market segment, itinerary and distribution channel in order to determine cruise ticket pricing. We concentrate on improving early booking occupancy rates to drive higher Net Yields. We execute targeted and high-frequency marketing campaigns that communicate a message of a value-packed cruise offering in both North American and select international markets. To increase the effectiveness of these targeted marketing programs, we emphasize communication to keep the travel agents engaged and informed and utilize call centers focusing on both inbound calls and outbound calls to high potential targeted customers. This marketing strategy assists in maximizing the revenue potential from each customer contact generated by various marketing campaigns. We believe these strategies and other initiatives executed by our distribution channels will drive sustainable growth in the number of guests carried and in Net Yields achieved.

&#160; 

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160;

Our revenue is seasonal and based on the demand for cruises. Historically, the seasonality of the North American cruise industry generally results in the greatest demand for cruises during the Northern Hemisphere&#8217;s summer months. This predictable seasonality in demand has resulted in fluctuations by quarter in our revenue and results of operations. The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for regularly scheduled Dry-docks, which we typically schedule during non-peak demand periods.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

Our primary competition includes operators such as Carnival Corporation &#38; Carnival plc, which owns and operates Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and Seabourn Cruise Line, among others, and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which owns and operates, Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises, among others, as well as other cruise lines such as Crystal Cruises and Silversea Cruises. In addition, we compete with land-based vacation alternatives, such as hotels and resorts, vacation ownership properties, casinos, and tourist destinations throughout the world.

&#160; 

Marketing Strategy 

&#160;

Our marketing teams work to enhance brand awareness and increase levels of understanding and consideration of our products and services among consumers and trade and travel partners with the ultimate goal of driving sales. We utilize a multi-channel strategy that may include a combination of print, television, radio, website/e-commerce, direct mail, social media, mobile and e-mail campaigns, partnerships, customer loyalty initiatives, market research, and business-to-business events.

&#160;

Building customer loyalty among our past guests is an important element of our marketing strategy. We believe that attending to the needs and motivations of our past guests creates a cost-effective means of attracting business, particularly to our new ships and itineraries, because past guests are familiar with our brands, products and services and often return to cruise with us. We have shared customer databases across our brands to further enhance our communications with our past guests who receive newsletters and mailings with informative destination and product information and promotional amenities. Continued investments in our websites is also key to ensuring the optimal pre-cruise planning experience offering guests the ability to shop, reserve and purchase a breadth of onboard products and services. We have a strong communications stream that provides customized pre-cruise information to help guests maximize their cruise experience as well as a series of communications to welcome them home and ultimately engage them in booking another cruise.

&#160;

Travel agents are crucial to our marketing and distribution efforts. We provide robust marketing support and enhanced tools for our travel agent partners through a variety of programs. Our travel partners can benefit from our online travel partner education programs that include a wide variety of courses about our ships, itineraries and other best-selling practices. Agents can also easily customize a multitude of consumer marketing materials for their use in promoting our products through our online platform. 

&#160;

Guest feedback is also a critically important element in the development of our overall marketing and business strategies. We regularly initiate guest feedback studies among both travel partners and consumers to assess the impact of various programs and/or to solicit information that helps shape future direction.

&#160; 

Ship Operations and Cruise Infrastructure 

&#160; 

Ship Maintenance and Logistics 

&#160;

Sophisticated and efficient maintenance and operations systems support the technical superiority and modern look of our fleet. In addition to routine repairs and maintenance performed on an ongoing basis and in accordance with applicable requirements, each of our ships is generally taken out of service, approximately every 24 to 60 months, for a period of one or more weeks for scheduled maintenance work, repairs and improvements performed in Dry-dock. Dry-dock interval is a statutory requirement controlled under IMO requirements reflected in chapters of the International Convention of the Safety of Life at Seas (&#8220;SOLAS&#8221;) and to some extent the International Load Lines Convention. Under these regulations, it is required that a passenger ship Dry-dock once in five years (depending on age of vessel), twice in 5 years (depending on flag state and age of vessel) and the maximum interval between each Dry-dock cannot exceed 3 years (depending age of vessel and flag state). However, most of our international ships qualify under a special exemption provided by the Bahamas and/or Marshall Islands (flag state), as applicable, after meeting certain criteria set forth by the ship&#8217;s flag state to Dry-dock once every 5 years. To the extent practical, each ship&#8217;s crew, catering and hotel staff remain with the ship during the Dry-dock period and assist in performing repair and maintenance work. Accordingly, Dry-dock work is typically performed during non-peak demand periods to minimize the adverse effect on revenue that results from ships being out of service. Dry-docks are typically scheduled in spring or autumn and depend on shipyard availability.

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160;

Our largest capital expenditures are for ship construction and acquisition. Our largest operating expenditures are for payroll (including our contract with a third party who provides certain crew services), fuel, food and beverage, travel agent services and advertising and marketing. Most of the supplies that we require are available from numerous sources at competitive prices. In addition, owing to the large quantities that we purchase, we can obtain favorable prices for many of our supplies. Our purchases are denominated primarily in U.S. dollars. Payment terms granted by the suppliers are generally customary terms for the cruise industry.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Crew and Staff 

&#160;

Best-in-class guest service levels are paramount in the markets in which we operate, where travelers have discriminating tastes and high expectations for service quality. We have dedicated increasing attention and resources to ensure that our service offerings on all of our ships meet the demands of our guests. Among other initiatives, we have implemented rigorous onboard training programs, with a focus on career development. We believe that our dedication to anticipating and meeting our guests&#8217; every need differentiates our operations and fosters close relationships between our guests and crew, helping to build customer loyalty.

&#160;

We place the utmost importance on the safety of our guests and crew. We operate all of our vessels to meet and exceed the requirements of SOLAS and International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (&#8220;ISM Code&#8221;), the international safety standards which govern the cruise industry. Every crew member is well trained in the Company&#8217;s stringent safety protocols, participating in regular safety trainings, exercises and drills onboard every one of our ships.

&#160;

Our captains are experienced seafarers. We further ensure that our captains regularly undergo rigorous training on navigation and bridge operations. To assist our captains and officers while at sea, we have extensive navigation protocols in place. Our bridge operations are based on robust navigational procedures and risk analysis. Our bridge teams follow pre-set voyage plans which are thoroughly reviewed and discussed by the captain and bridge team prior to port departures and arrivals. In addition, all of our ships employ the latest state-of-the-art navigational equipment and technology to ensure that our bridge teams have the most accurate data regarding the planned itinerary.

&#160;

Prior to every cruise setting sail or upon departure, we hold a mandatory safety drill for all guests during which important safety information is reviewed and demonstrated. We also show an extensive safety video which runs continuously on the stateroom televisions. Our fleet is equipped with modern navigational control and fire prevention and control systems. In recent years, our ships have continuously been upgraded and include internal and external regulatory audits.

&#160;

We have developed Safety Management Systems (&#8220;SMS&#8221;), which establish policies, procedures, training, qualification, quality, compliance, audit and self-improvement standards for all employees, both shipboard and shoreside. SMS also provides real-time reports and information to support the fleet and risk management decisions. Through these systems, our senior managers, as well as ship management, can focus on consistent, high quality operation of the fleet. Our SMS are approved and audited regularly by our classification society, Lloyds Register, and they also undergo regular internal audits as well as annual/semiannual inspections by the U.S. Coast Guard, flag state and other port and state authorities. We screen and train our crew to ensure crew familiarity and proficiency with the safety equipment onboard. Various safety measures have been implemented on all of our ships and additional personnel have been appointed in our ship operations departments.

&#160; 

Insurance 

&#160;

We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of our ships, which are maintained in amounts related to the estimated market value of each ship. The coverage for each of the hull and machinery policies is maintained with syndicates of insurance underwriters from the European and U.S. insurance markets.

&#160;

In addition to the insurance coverage on the hull and machinery of our ships, we seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage and believe that our current coverage is at appropriate levels to protect against most of the accident-related risks involved in the conduct of our business. The insurance we carry includes:

&#160;

&#8226; Protection and indemnity insurance (coverage for passenger, crew and third-party liabilities), including insurance against risk of pollution liabilities; &#160;

&#8226; War risk insurance, including terrorist risk insurance. The terms of our war risk policies include provisions where underwriters can give seven days&#8217; notice to the insured that the policies will be cancelled in the event of a change of risk which is typical for policies in the marine industry. Upon any proposed cancellation the insurer shall, before expiry of the seven day period, submit new terms; and &#160;

&#8226; Insurance for our shoreside property and general liability risks. &#160;

We believe that all of our insurance coverage, including those noted above, is subject to market-standard limitations, exclusions and deductible levels.

&#160;

The Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea (1974) (the &#8220;Athens Convention&#8221;) and the Protocol to the Athens Convention Relating to the Carriage of Passengers and Their Luggage by Sea (1976) (the &#8220;1976 Protocol&#8221;) are generally applicable to passenger ships. The U.S. has not ratified the Athens Convention; however, with limited exceptions, the 1976 Protocol may be contractually enforced with respect to cruises that do not call at a U.S. port. The IMO Diplomatic Conference agreed to a new protocol to the Athens Convention on November 1, 2002 (the &#8220;2002 Protocol&#8221;). The 2002 Protocol, which took effect on April 23, 2014, establishes for the first time a level of compulsory insurance which must be maintained by passenger ship operators with a right of direct action against the insurer. In addition, on December 31, 2012, the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) Passenger Liability Regulation became effective and requires us to carry a minimum level of financial responsibility per passenger per incident. We believe the amount of our protection and indemnity policy coverage provides the compulsory insurance; however, no assurance can be given that affordable and secure insurance markets will remain available to provide the level and type of coverage required.

Trademarks 

&#160;

Under the Norwegian brand, we own a number of registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names &#8220;NORWEGIAN CRUISE LINE,&#8221; &#8220;FEEL FREE&#8221; (an application for this trademark has been filed and is pending), &#8220;CRUISE LIKE A NORWEGIAN,&#8221; the names of our ships (except where trademark applications for these have been filed and are pending), incentive programs and specialty services rendered on our ships and specialty accommodations such as &#8220;THE HAVEN BY NORWEGIAN.&#8221; In addition, we own registered trademarks relating to the &#8220;FREESTYLE&#8221; family of names, including, &#8220;FREESTYLE CRUISING,&#8221; &#8220;FREESTYLE DINING&#8221; and &#8220;FREESTYLE VACATION.&#8221; We believe that these trademarks are widely recognized throughout North America, Europe and other areas of the world and have considerable value.

&#160;

Under the Oceania Cruises brand, we own a number of registered trademarks in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions relating to, among other things, the names &#8220;OCEANIA CRUISES,&#8221; &#8220;REGATTA,&#8221; &#8220;INSIGNIA,&#8221; &#8220;YOUR WORLD. YOUR WAY.&#8221; and the Oceania Cruises&#8217; logo.

&#160;

Under the Regent brand, we own registered trademarks relating to, among other things, the names &#8220;SEVEN SEAS CRUISES,&#8221; &#8220;SEVEN SEAS NAVIGATOR,&#8221; &#8220;SEVEN SEAS MARINER,&#8221; &#8220;SEVEN SEAS VOYAGER,&#8221; &#8220;SEVEN SEAS EXPLORER&#8221; and &#8220;LUXURY GOES EXPLORING.&#8221; We also claim common law rights in trademarks and trade names used in conjunction with our ships, incentive programs, customer loyalty program and specialty services rendered onboard our ships.

&#160;

The Regent ships have been operating under the Regent brand since 2006. We entered into a trademark license agreement with Regent Hospitality Worldwide, Inc., which we amended in February 2011, granting us the right to use the &#8220;Regent&#8221; brand family of marks. The amended trademark license agreement allows Regent to use the Regent trade name, in conjunction with cruises, in perpetuity, subject to the terms and conditions stated in the agreement.

&#160; 

Regulatory Issues 

&#160; 

Registration of Our Ships 

&#160;

Sixteen of the ships that we currently operate are registered in the Bahamas. One of our ships, Pride of America, is a U.S.-flagged ship. Five of our ships are registered in the Marshall Islands. Our ships registered in the Bahamas and the Marshall Islands are inspected at least annually pursuant to Bahamian and Marshall Islands requirements and are subject to International laws and regulations and to various U.S. federal regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Public Health Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. Our U.S.-registered ship is subject to laws and regulations of the U.S. federal government, including, but not limited to, the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Department of Labor. The international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and other legal requirements applicable to our operations change regularly, depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited.

&#160;

Our ships are subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security, environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor regulations applicable to each port as well as with international requirements.

&#160;

Our entire fleet is also subject to the health, safety, security and environmental laws and regulations of the various port locales where the ships dock. The U.S., Bahamas and Marshall Islands are members of the IMO and have adopted and implemented the IMO conventions relating to ocean-going passenger ships. U.S. law generally requires ships transporting passengers exclusively between and among ports in the U.S. to be built entirely in the U.S., documented under U.S. law, crewed by Americans and owned by entities that are at least 75% owned and controlled by U.S. citizens. We have been granted specific authority to operate in and among the islands of Hawaii under legislation, known as the &#8220;Hawaii Cruise Ship Provision,&#8221; which was part of the &#8220;Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003&#8221; enacted in 2003 (Public Law 108-7, Division B, Title II, General Provisions&#8212;Department of Commerce, Section 211 (February 20, 2003) (117 Stat. 11,79)). The Hawaii Cruise Ship Provision permitted two partially completed ships (originally contracted for construction in a U.S. shipyard by an unrelated party), to be completed in a shipyard outside of the U.S. and documented under the U.S. flag even if the owner does not meet the 75% U.S. ownership requirement, provided that the direct owning entity is organized under the laws of the U.S. and meets certain U.S. citizen officer and director requirements. Presently, only one of the two ships completed in compliance with the Hawaii Cruise Ship Provision, Pride of America, operates as a U.S.-flagged ship. The other, Pride of Hawai&#8217;i, was transferred to the Bahamas registry and operates as Norwegian Jade. The Hawaii Cruise Ship Provision also authorized the re-documentation under the U.S. flag of one additional foreign-built cruise ship for operation between U.S. ports in the islands of Hawaii, Pride of Aloha. In May 2008, Pride of Aloha was transferred to the Bahamas registry and operates as Norwegian Sky. The Hawaii Cruise Ship Provision imposes certain requirements, including that any non-warranty work be performed in the U.S., except in case of emergency or lack of availability, and that the ship operates primarily between and among the islands of Hawaii. As a result of this exemption, our U.S.-flagged ship deployed in Hawaii is able to cruise between U.S. ports in Hawaii without the need to call at a foreign port.

&#160;

Certain ships are also subject to periodic class surveys by ship classification societies, including Dry-dock inspections, to verify that they have been maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification societies and that recommended maintenance and required repairs have been satisfactorily completed. Class certification is required for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. For more information on Dry-dock work, see &#8220;Ship Operations and Cruise Infrastructure&#8212;Ship Maintenance and Logistics.&#8221;

&#160; 

&#160; 13 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Health and Environment 

&#160;

Our ships are subject to U.S. and various international, national, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, that govern air emissions, waste discharge, water management and disposal, and use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals, solvents and paints. Under such laws and regulations, we are prohibited from discharging certain materials, such as petrochemicals and plastics, into waterways. Specifically, in the U.S., we comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s Vessel General Permit (&#8220;VGP&#8221;).

&#160;

In the U.S., we must also meet the U.S. Public Health Service&#8217;s requirements, including ratings by inspectors from the Vessel Sanitation Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (&#8220;CDC&#8221;) and the FDA. We rate at the top of the range of CDC and FDA scores achieved by the major cruise lines. In addition, the cruise industry and the U.S. Public Health Service have agreed on regulations for food, water and hygiene to assist cruise lines in achieving the highest health and sanitation standards on cruise ships.

&#160;

The U.S. Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships, which implements the convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (&#8220;MARPOL&#8221;), provides for severe civil and criminal penalties related to ship-generated pollution for incidents in U.S. waters within three nautical miles of land and, in some cases, within the 200-nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (&#8220;EEZ&#8221;).

&#160;

The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA 90&#8221;) provides for strict liability for water pollution caused by the discharge of oil in the 200-nautical mile EEZ of the U.S., subject to defined monetary limits. OPA 90 requires that in order for us to operate in U.S. waters, we must have Certificates of Financial Responsibility (&#8220;COFR&#8221;) from the U.S. Coast Guard for each ship that operates in these waters. Our continued OPA 90 certification signifies our ability to meet the requirements for related OPA 90 liability in the event of an oil spill or release of a hazardous substance. 

&#160;

The Clean Water Act of 1972, and other laws and regulations, provide the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) with the authority to regulate commercial vessels&#8217; incidental discharges of ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling paints and other substances during normal operations while a vessel is on inland waters, within three nautical miles of land, and in designated federally protected waters. The U.S. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System was designed to minimize pollution within U.S. territorial waters. For our affected ships, all of the requirements are laid out in the EPA&#8217;s VGP. The VGP establishes effluent limits for 27 specific discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel. In addition to these discharge and vessel specific requirements, the VGP includes requirements for inspections, monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping.

&#160;

Many coastal U.S. states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law and in some cases have no statutory limits of liability. The State of Alaska enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated state waters and requires that certain discharges be monitored to verify compliance with the established standards. The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters.

&#160;

The European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) has adopted a substantial and diverse range of environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment. To support the implementation and enforcement of European environmental legislation, the EU has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement as well as a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections. The European Commission&#8217;s (&#8220;EC&#8221;) strategy is to reduce atmospheric emissions from seagoing ships. The EC goes beyond the IMO requirement by introducing legislation to use low sulfur (less than 0.1%) marine gas oil in EU ports.

&#160;

MARPOL specifies requirements for Emission Control Areas (&#8220;ECAs&#8221;) with stricter limitations on sulfur emissions in these areas. Ships operating in the Baltic Sea ECA, the North Sea/English Channel ECA, the North American ECA and the U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA are required to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.1% or use approved alternative emission reduction methods. Other additional ECAs may also be established in the future, with areas around Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, the Mediterranean Sea and Mexico being considered.

&#160;

The MARPOL global limit on fuel sulfur content outside of ECAs will be reduced to 0.5% from the current 3.5% global limit after January 2020. The 0.5% global standard will be subject to an IMO review by 2018 to determine the availability of fuel oil to comply with this standard. This review will take into account the global fuel oil market supply and demand, an analysis of trends in fuel oil markets and any other relevant issues. If the IMO determines that there is insufficient fuel to comply with the 0.5% standard in January 2020, then this requirement will be delayed until January 2025, at the latest. However, the European Union Parliament and Council have set January 2020 as the final date for the 0.5% fuel sulfur limit to enter force, regardless of the 2018 IMO review results. This European Union Sulfur Directive will cover European Union Member State territorial waters that are within 12 nautical miles of their coastline.

&#160;

Recently adopted amendments to MARPOL will make the Baltic Sea a &#8220;Special Area&#8221; where sewage discharges from passenger ships will be prohibited. Stricter discharge restrictions are currently in effect for new passenger ships whose construction began after January 1, 2016, and for existing passenger ships starting in 2018. The underlying requirements may impact our operations unless suitable port waste facilities are available, or new technologies for onboard waste treatment are developed. Accordingly, the cost of complying with these requirements is not determinable at this time; however, we do not expect it to be material.

&#160;

In addition to the existing legal requirements, we are committed to helping to preserve the environment, because a clean, unspoiled environment is a key element that attracts guests to our ships. Furthermore, NCL (Bahmas) Ltd. and NCL (America) LLC are certified

&#160;

&#160; 14 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

under the International Organization for Standardization&#8217;s 14001 Standard. This voluntary standard sets requirements for establishment and implementation of a comprehensive environmental management system which we have adopted for our operations. Currently we operate under an Environmental Management System that is incorporated into the Company&#8217;s SMS.

&#160;

If we violate or fail to comply with environmental laws, regulations or treaties, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with changing environmental laws, regulations and treaties. Any fines or other sanctions for violation or failure to comply with environmental requirements or any expenditures required to comply with environmental requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, cash flow or financial condition.

&#160; 

Permits for Glacier Bay, Alaska 

&#160;

In connection with certain Alaska cruise operations, Norwegian relies on concession permits from the U.S. National Park Service to operate its ships in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. Norwegian currently holds a concession permit allowing for 22 calls per summer cruising season through September 30, 2019. However, there can be no assurance that such permit will be renewed when necessary or that regulations relating to the renewal of such permit will remain unchanged in the future.

&#160; 

Security and Safety 

&#160;

The IMO has adopted safety standards as part of SOLAS, which apply to all of our ships. SOLAS establishes requirements for vessel design, structural features, construction methods and materials, refurbishment standards, life-saving equipment, fire protection and detection, safe management and operation and security in order to help ensure the safety and security of our guests and crew. All of our crew undergo regular safety training exercises that meet all international and national maritime regulations.

&#160;

SOLAS requires that all cruise ships are certified as having safety procedures that comply with the requirements of the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention (&#8220;ISM Code&#8221;). We have obtained certificates certifying that our ships are in compliance with the ISM Code. Each such certificate is granted for a five-year period and is subject to periodic verification.

&#160;

The SOLAS requirements are amended and extended by the IMO from time to time. For example, the International Port and Ship Facility Code (&#8220;ISPS Code&#8221;), was adopted by the IMO in December 2002 and provides for measures strengthening maritime security and places new requirements on governments, port authorities and shipping companies in relation to security issues on ships and in ports.

&#160;

In addition to the requirements of the ISPS Code, the U.S. Congress enacted the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (&#8220;MTSA&#8221;), which implements a number of security measures at ports in the U.S. including measures that apply to ships registered outside the U.S. and docking at ports in the U.S. The U.S. Coast Guard has published MTSA regulations that require a security plan for every ship entering the territorial waters of the U.S., provide for identification requirements for ships entering such waters and establish various procedures for the identification of crew members on such ships. The Transportation Workers Identification Credential is a federal requirement for accessibility into and onto U.S. ports and U.S.-flagged ships.

&#160;

Amendments to SOLAS required that ships constructed in accordance with pre-1974 SOLAS requirements install automatic sprinkler systems. IMO adopted an amendment to SOLAS which requires partial bulkheads on stateroom balconies to be of non-combustible construction. The SOLAS regulation implemented Long-Range Identification and Tracking. All of our ships are in compliance with the requirements of SOLAS as amended and/or as applicable to the keel-laying date.

&#160;

Maritime-Labor 

&#160;

In 2006, the International Labor Organization (&#8220;ILO&#8221;), an agency of the United Nations that develops and oversees international labor standards, adopted a new Consolidated Maritime Labor Convention (&#8220;MLC 2006&#8221;). MLC 2006 contains a comprehensive set of global standards based on those that are already found in 68 maritime labor Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the ILO since 1920. MLC 2006 includes a broad range of requirements, such as a broader definition of a seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation, food, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations, wages and entitlements. MLC 2006 added requirements not previously in effect, in the areas of occupational safety and health. MLC 2006 became effective in certain countries commencing August 2013. The Standard of Training Certification and Watch Keeping for Seafarers (&#8220;STCW&#8221;), as amended, establishes minimum standards relating to training, certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers.

&#160; 

Financial Requirements 

&#160;

The Federal Maritime Commission (&#8220;FMC&#8221;) requires evidence of financial responsibility for those offering transportation on passenger ships operating out of U.S. ports to indemnify passengers in the event of non-performance of the transportation. Accordingly, each of our three brands are required to maintain a $30.0 million third-party performance guarantee in respect of liabilities for non-performance of transportation and other obligations to passengers. The guarantee requirements are subject to additional consumer price index-based adjustments. Also, each of our brands has a legal requirement to maintain a security guarantee based on cruise business originated from the U.K. and, accordingly, has established separate bonds with the Association of British Travel Agents currently valued at approximately British Pound Sterling 6.5 million in the aggregate. We also are required to establish

&#160;

&#160; 15 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

financial responsibility by other jurisdictions to meet liability in the event of non-performance of our obligations to passengers from those jurisdictions.

&#160;

From time to time, various other regulatory and legislative changes have been or may in the future be proposed that may have an effect on our operations in the U.S. and the cruise industry in general.

&#160;

For information regarding risks associated with our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, see Part I Item 1A-Risk Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K, including the risk factor titled &#8220;We are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our operations and any changes in the current laws and regulations could lead to increased costs or decreased revenue.&#8221;

&#160;

Taxation 

&#160; 

U.S. Income Taxation 

&#160;

The following discussion is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. Changes in these authorities may cause the tax consequences to vary substantially from the consequences described below.

&#160;

Exemption of International Shipping Income under Section 883 of the Code 

&#160;

Under Section 883 of the Code (&#8220;Section 883&#8221;) and the related regulations, a foreign corporation will be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation on its U.S.-source income derived from the international operation of ships (&#8220;shipping income&#8221;) if: (a) it is organized in a qualified foreign country, which is one that grants an &#8220;equivalent exemption&#8221; from tax to corporations organized in the U.S. in respect of each category of shipping income for which exemption is being claimed under Section 883; and (b) either: (1) more than 50% of the value of its stock is beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by qualified shareholders, which includes individuals who are &#8220;residents&#8221; of a qualified foreign country; (2) one or more classes of its stock representing, in the aggregate, more than 50% of the combined voting power and value of all classes of its stock are &#8220;primarily and regularly traded on one or more established securities markets&#8221; in a qualified foreign country or in the U.S. (the &#8220;publicly traded test&#8221;); or (3) it is a &#8220;controlled foreign corporation&#8221; (a &#8220;CFC&#8221;) for more than half of the taxable year and more than 50% of its stock is owned by qualified U.S. persons for more than half of the taxable year (the &#8220;CFC test&#8221;). In addition, U.S. Treasury Regulations require a foreign corporation and certain direct and indirect shareholders to satisfy detailed substantiation and reporting requirements.

&#160;

NCLH is incorporated in Bermuda, a qualified foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption, and NCLH meets the publicly traded test because its ordinary shares are primarily and regularly traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, which is considered to be an established securities market in the U.S. Therefore, we believe that NCLH qualifies for the benefits of Section 883.

&#160;

We believe and have taken the position that substantially all of NCLH&#8217;s income, including the income of its ship-owning subsidiaries, is properly categorized as shipping income, and that we do not have a material amount of non-qualifying income. It is possible, however, that the IRS interpretation of shipping income could differ from ours and that a much larger percentage of our income does not qualify (or will not qualify) as shipping income. Moreover, the exemption for shipping income is only available for years in which we will satisfy complex tests under Section 883. There are factual circumstances beyond our control, including changes in the direct and indirect owners of NCLH&#8217;s ordinary shares, including as a result of the Acquisition of Prestige, which could cause NCLH or its subsidiaries to lose the benefit of the exemption under Section 883. Further, any changes in our operations could significantly increase our exposure to taxation on shipping income, and we can give no assurances on this matter.

&#160;

Under certain circumstances, changes in the identity, residence or holdings of NCLH&#8217;s direct or indirect shareholders could cause NCLH&#8217;s ordinary shares not to be regularly traded on an established securities market within the meaning of the regulations under Section 883. Therefore, as a precautionary matter, NCLH has provided protections in its bye-laws to reduce the risk of such changes impacting our ability to meet the publicly traded test by prohibiting any person, other than the Sponsors, from owning, directly, indirectly or constructively, more than 4.9% of NCLH&#8217;s ordinary shares unless such ownership is approved by NCLH&#8217;s Board of Directors (the &#8220;4.9% limit&#8221;). Any outstanding shares held in excess of the 4.9% limit will be transferred to and held in a trust.

&#160;

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, Regent and its non-U.S. subsidiaries are disregarded as entities separate from their immediate foreign parent (PCH) and Oceania Cruises is treated as a corporation. For 2015, both Regent and Oceania Cruises relied on NCLH&#8217;s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of Section 883 as discussed above. For 2014, both Regent and Oceania Cruises relied on PCH&#8217;s ability to meet the requirements necessary to qualify for the benefits of Section 883. PCH is organized as a company in Panama, which grants an equivalent tax exemption to U.S. corporations, and is thus classified as a qualified foreign country for purposes of Section 883. PCH was classified as a CFC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2014, and we believe PCH met the ownership and substantiation requirements of the CFC test under the regulations for that year.

&#160; 

Taxation of International Shipping Income Where Section 883 is Inapplicable 

&#160;

Unless exempt from U.S. federal income taxation, a foreign corporation is subject to U.S. federal income tax in respect of its &#8220;shipping income&#8221; that is derived from sources within the U.S. If we fail to qualify for the exemption under Section 883 in respect of our U.S.-sourced shipping income, or if the provision was repealed, then we will be subject to taxation in the U.S. on such income.

&#160;

&#160; 16 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Generally, &#8220;shipping income&#8221; is any income that is derived from the use of vessels, from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use on a time, voyage or Bareboat Charter basis or from the performance of services directly related to those uses. For these purposes, shipping income attributable to transportation that begins or ends, but that does not both begin and end, in the U.S., which we refer to as &#8220;U.S.- source shipping income,&#8221; will be considered to be 50% derived from sources within the U.S.

&#160;

If we do not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the provision was repealed, then any U.S.-sourced shipping income or any other income that is considered to be effectively connected income would be subject to federal corporate income taxation on a net basis (generally at a 35% rate) and state and local taxes, and our effectively connected earnings and profits may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax of 30%, unless a lower treaty rate applies (the &#8220;Net Tax Regime&#8221;). Our U.S.-source shipping income is considered effectively connected income if we have, or are considered to have, a fixed place of business in the U.S. involved in the earning of U.S.-source shipping income, and substantially all of our U.S.-source shipping income is attributable to regularly scheduled transportation, such as the operation of a vessel that follows a published schedule with repeated sailings at regular intervals between the same points for voyages that begin or end in the U.S.

&#160;

If we do not have a fixed place of business in the U.S. or substantially all of our income is not derived from regularly scheduled transportation, the income will generally not be considered to be effectively connected income. In that case, we would be subject to a special 4% tax on our U.S.-source shipping income (the &#8220;4% Tax Regime&#8221;).

&#160; 

Other U.S. Taxation 

&#160;

U.S. Treasury Regulations list several items of income which are not considered to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, to the extent derived from U.S. sources, are subject to U.S. federal income taxes under the Net Tax Regime discussed above. Income items considered non-incidental to the international operation of ships include income from the sale of single-day cruises, shore excursions, air and other transportation, and pre- and post-cruise land packages. We believe that substantially all of our income currently derived from the international operation of ships is shipping income.

&#160; 

Income from U.S.-flagged Operation under NCL America 

&#160;

Income derived from our U.S.-flagged operation generally will be subject to U.S. corporate income taxes both at the federal and state levels. We expect that such income will not be subject to U.S. branch profits tax nor a U.S. dividend withholding tax under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty.

&#160; 

U.K. Income Taxation 

&#160;

As a result of a restructuring, NCLH and NCLC became tax residents of the U.K. and are subject to normal U.K. corporation tax.

&#160; 

U.S. Taxation of Gain on Sale of Vessels 

&#160;

Gains from the sale of vessels should generally also be exempt from tax under Section 883 provided NCLH qualifies for exemption from tax under Section 883 in respect of our shipping income. If, however, our gain does not qualify for exemption under Section 883, or if the provision was repealed, then such gain could be subject to either the Net Tax Regime or the 4% Tax Regime.

&#160; 

Certain State, Local and Non-U.S. Tax Matters 

&#160;

We may be subject to state, local and non-U.S. income or non-income taxes in various jurisdictions, including those in which we transact business, own property or reside. We may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. Our state, local or non-U.S. tax treatment may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax treatment discussed above. We may be required to pay non-U.S. taxes on dispositions of foreign property, or operations involving foreign property may give rise to non-U.S. income or other tax liabilities in amounts that could be substantial.

&#160; 

Changes in Tax Laws 

&#160;

The various tax regimes to which we are currently subject result in a relatively low effective tax rate on our worldwide income. These tax regimes, however, are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. For example, legislation has been proposed in the past that would eliminate the benefits of the exemption from U.S. federal income tax under Section 883 and subject all or a portion of our shipping income to taxation in the U.S. Moreover, we may become subject to new tax regimes and may be unable to take advantage of favorable tax provisions afforded by current or future law including exemption of branch profits and dividend withholding taxes under the U.S.-U.K. Income Tax Treaty on income derived in respect of our U.S.-flagged operation.

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 2,800 full-time employees worldwide in our shoreside operations and approximately 23,700 shipboard employees. Regent and Oceania Cruises&#8217; ships also utilize a third party to provide additional hotel and restaurant employees onboard. We refer you to &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Amendments to the collective bargaining agreements for crew members of our fleet and other employee relation issues may materially adversely affect our financial results&#8221; for more information regarding our relationships with union employees and our collective bargaining agreements that are currently in place.

&#160; 

&#160; 17 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Ports and Facilities 

&#160;

We have an agreement with the Government of Bermuda whereby two of our ships are permitted weekly calls in Bermuda through 2018 from Boston, Baltimore, Charleston and New York. In addition, we own a private island in the Bahamas, Great Stirrup Cay, which we utilize as a port-of-call on certain itineraries. We purchased a future cruise destination in Belize which will be introduced in 2016. We have a contract with the New York City Economic Development Corporation pursuant to which we receive preferential berthing rights at the Manhattan Cruise Terminal. Furthermore, we have contracts with the Port of New Orleans and the Port of Miami pursuant to which we receive preferential Berths to the exclusion of other vessels for certain specified days of the week at the cities&#8217; cruise ship terminals. In addition, we have agreements with similar rights in Port Canaveral and the Port of Tampa. We have an agreement with the Houston Port Authority through April 15, 2017, for certain exclusive berthing rights at the Houston Passenger Cruise Terminal. We have a concession permit with the U.S. National Park Service whereby our ships are permitted to call on Glacier Bay during each summer cruise season through September 30, 2019. We entered into an agreement with the British Virgin Islands Port Authority granting priority berthing rights for a 15-year term with two options to extend the agreement for additional five year terms. In Seattle we have concluded a lease agreement with the port and have committed to a capital investment of approximately $15 million.

&#160; 

Segment Reporting 

&#160;

We have concluded that our business has a single reportable segment. Each brand, Oceania Cruises, Regent and Norwegian constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results and, therefore, each brand is considered an operating segment. Our operating segments have similar economic and qualitative characteristics, including similar margins and similar products and services; therefore, we aggregate all of the operating segments into one reportable segment.

&#160;

Although we sell cruises on an international basis, our passenger ticket revenue is primarily attributed to U.S.-sourced guests who make reservations in the U.S. Revenue attributable to U.S.-sourced guests was 75%, 73 % and 74% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No other individual country&#8217;s revenues exceeded 10% in any of our last three years. Substantially all of our long&#8211;lived assets are located outside of the U.S. and consist primarily of our ships. We have 16 ships with Bahamas registry with a carrying value of $7.2 billion and $6.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We have five ships with Marshall Island registry with a carrying value of $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. We also have one ship with U.S. registry with a carrying value of $0.3 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 and one ship with Bermuda registry with a carrying value of $0.08 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.
