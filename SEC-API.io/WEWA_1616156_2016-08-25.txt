We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future.

All dollar amounts refer to US dollars unless otherwise indicated.

GENERAL 

We were incorporated in Nevada on September 10, 2013, as Betafox Corp. Our limited business until May 11, 2015, when control of our Company changed, was attempting to make candles. Because previous management was unable to raise sufficient capital to enable our Company to develop its intended operations, on that date, Mr. Giorgos Kallides, our previous majority shareholder and sole officer and director, sold his 6,000,000 shares to Future Continental Limited, and resigned all of his positions with our Company. Mr. Pei Lei became our new CEO and Chief Financial Officer, and, as part of the change of control, our previously limited operation was acquired by Mr. Kallides, the former principal, for $1 (see Items 10 and 12 herein). In November, 2015, we changed our corporate name to Future World Group, Inc. 

As reported in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) on August 8, 2016, Mr. Pei&#146;s affiliate company Sky Rover Holdings, Ltd. loaned us $1,000,000 (the &#147;Loan&#148;), pursuant to a three-year, unsecured promissory note bearing interest at 5% (payable in cash or in kind at our option), and convertible into our common shares at $.04 per share (including interest payable in kind). The proceeds of the Loan are intended to be used for working capital. 

The Loan was made recently; and as yet, management has yet to cause our Company to acquire any assets or a business. Therefore, notwithstanding the Loan proceeds, we are deemed to be a &#147;shell&#148; company, as that term is defined pursuant to Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management is now exploring opportunities in internet service, software development, smartphone apps industries, and block chain technology development on commercial applications. We are engaged in discussions with various unaffiliated third parties regarding possible acquisitions in those sectors for our Company, with the purpose of enhancing shareholder value. As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not entered into any definitive agreement to acquire any assets or businesses. Unless and until we acquire assets or a business, we will continue to be a &#147;shell.&#148; 

Our financial statements report no revenue since inception, an accumulated deficit of $ 113,689 as of May 31, 2016 and a net loss of $ 77,452 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion for our Company, which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to successfully acquire assets or a business, we may fail. To date, the only operations we have engaged in were the development of a business plan and the purchase of a candle making machine, which business was sold for $1 in May, 2015. 

Employees. Identification of Certain Significant Employees 

We currently have no employees, other than our sole officer and director Mr. Li Pei, who receives no salary. We currently work with other software providers to explore business opportunities in the block chain industry. We intend to hire additional employees only if and when we acquire assets or a business.

Research and Development Expenditures 

We have not incurred any other research or development expenditures since our incorporation.

Government Regulation 

Because we have not acquired an asset or a business, we are unable at this time to determine what governmental agencies will have jurisdiction over those assets or businesses, or what effect, if any, those government regulations will have over such assets or businesses.

Patents and Trademarks 

We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks.
