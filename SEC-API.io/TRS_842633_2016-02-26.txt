 Item 1. Business 

We are a global designer, manufacturer and distributor of engineered and applied products for commercial, industrial and consumer markets. Most of our businesses share important characteristics, including leading market positions, strong brand names, broad product offerings in focused markets, established distribution networks, relatively high operating margins, relatively low capital investment requirements and both organic and acquisition growth opportunities. We use a common operating model across our businesses. The TriMas Operating Model is the framework that provides, wherever possible given the diverse nature of our businesses, commonality and consistency across TriMas, and drives how we plan, budget, measure, review, incent and reward our people. It provides the foundation for determining our priorities, executing our growth and productivity initiatives and allocating capital and resources. We believe that a majority of our 2015 &#32;net sales were in markets in which our products enjoy the number one or number two market position within their respective product categories. 

Our Reportable Segments 

We operate through four reportable segments which had net sales and operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;as follows: Packaging (net sales: $334.3 million ; operating profit: $78.5 million ), Aerospace (net sales: $176.5 million ; operating profit: $28.3 million ), Energy (net sales: $193.4 million ; operating loss: $97.2 million ) and Engineered Components (net sales: $159.8 million ; operating profit: $18.2 million ). For information pertaining to the net sales and operating profit attributed to our reportable segments, refer to Note 19 , " Segment Information ," included in Item 8, " Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ," within this Form 10-K. 

Due to a significant decline in current and expected profitability levels in our Energy reportable segment and our Arrow Engine business within our Engineered Components reportable segment during 2015, and a decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges in the fourth quarter of 2015 of approximately $70.9 million &#32;and $3.2 million , respectively. For information pertaining to these impairment charges, refer to Note 8, " Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ," included in Item 8, " Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ," within this Form 10-K. 

In addition to our reportable segments as presented, we have discontinued certain lines of businesses over the past three years as follows, the results of which are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the financial statements attached hereto: 

&#8226; 

On June 30, 2015, we completed the spin-off of our Cequent businesses, comprised of the former Cequent Americas and Cequent Asia Pacific Europe Africa ("Cequent APEA") reportable segments, creating a new independent publicly traded company, Horizon Global Corporation ("Horizon"), through the distribution of 100% of the Company's interest in Horizon to holders of the Company's common stock. 

&#8226; 

During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased operations of our NI Industries business. NI Industries manufactured cartridge cases for the defense industry and was party to a U.S. Government facility maintenance contract. We received approximately $6.7 million for the sale of certain intellectual property and related inventory and tooling. As a result of discontinuing operations of NI Industries, we renamed the "Aerospace &#38; Defense" reportable segment "Aerospace." 

Each reportable segment has distinct products, distribution channels, strengths and strategies, which are described below. 

Packaging 

We believe Packaging is a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of specialty, highly-engineered closure and dispensing systems for a range of end markets, including steel and plastic industrial and consumer packaging applications. We believe that Packaging is one of the largest manufacturers of steel and plastic industrial container closures and dispensing products in North America, with a significant presence in Europe, Asia and other geographic markets. Packaging manufactures high-performance, value-added products that are designed to enhance its customers' ability to store, transport, process and dispense various products for the industrial, food and beverage, and health, beauty and home markets. Packaging's products include steel and plastic closure caps, drum enclosures, and specialty plastic closure and dispensing systems, such as foamers, pumps and specialty sprayers. 

Packaging is dual headquartered in the United Kingdom and Indiana. We believe our Packaging brands, which include Rieke&#174;, Arminak &#38; Associates&#174;, E nglass&#174;, Innovative Molding&#8482; and Stolz&#174;, are well established and recognized in their respective markets. 

&#32;4

Over the past few years, Packaging has increased its international manufacturing and sales presence, with advanced manufacturing capabilities in China, India and Vietnam, as well as an increased sales presence in that region. We have also increased our sales coverage in China and India. By maintaining a presence in international locations, Packaging hopes to continue to discover new markets and new applications and to capitalize on lower-cost production opportunities. 

Marketing, Customers and Distribution 

Packaging employs an internal sales force in North America, Europe and Asia. Packaging also uses third-party agents and distributors in key geographic markets, including Europe, South America and Asia. Packaging's agents and distributors primarily sell directly to container manufacturers and to users or fillers of containers. While the point of sale may be to a container manufacturer or bottle filling business, Packaging, via a "pull through" strategy, calls on the container user or filler and suggests that it specify that our product be used on its container. 

To support its "pull-through" strategy, Packaging offers more attractive pricing on products purchased directly from us and on products in which the container users or fillers specify Packaging. Users or fillers that utilize or specify our products include agricultural chemical, food, industrial chemical, paint, personal care, petroleum, pharmaceutical and sanitary supply chemical companies such as BASF, Gechem Gmbh, McDonald's, Pennzoil Quaker State, Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Healthcare, Sherwin-Williams and Wings Food Products, among others. 

Packaging's primary end customers include Colgate, ConAgra Foods, Dial Corporation, Ecolab, L&#8217;Oreal, Mast Global (Bath &#38; Body Works and Victoria Secret), Method, Nestle, Purna Pharmaceuticals, RB (formerly known as Reckitt Benckiser), Starbucks, Thornton &#38; Ross and Unilever. We also supply major container manufacturers around the world such as Berenfield, Berlin Packaging, BWAY, Cleveland Steel Container, Greif, North Coast Container and Tricorbraun. Packaging maintains a customer service center that provides technical support as well as other technical assistance to customers to reduce overall production costs. 

&#32;6

This segment's primary competitors include Ateliers de la Haute Garonne (AHG), Alcoa Fastening Systems, Cherry Aerospace (Precision Castparts Corp.) and LISI Aerospace. We believe that we are a leader in the blind bolt market with significant market share in all blind fastener product categories in which we compete. Aerospace companies supply highly engineered, non-commodity, customer-specific products that principally have large shares of small markets supplied by a limited number of competitors. 

Energy 

We believe Energy is a leading manufacturer and distributor of metallic and non-metallic gaskets, bolts, industrial fasteners and specialty products for the petroleum refining, petrochemical, oil field and industrial markets. &#32; With operations principally in North America and newer locations in Europe and Asia, Energy supplies gaskets and complementary fasteners to both maintenance repair operations ("MRO") and industrial OEMs. Our brands which comprise this segment include Lamons &#174; and Basrur Uniseal Private Limited&#8482; (Basrur). 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe Energy benefits from the following competitive strengths: 

&#8226; 

Comprehensive Product Offering. We offer a full suite of gasket and bolt products to the petroleum refining, petrochemical, oil field and industrial markets. Over the years, Energy has expanded its product offering to include custom-manufactured, specialty bolts of various sizes and made-to-order configurations and other CNC-machined components in Europe, as well as isolation kits, capabilities to produce high quality sheet jointing used in the manufacture of soft gaskets, and PTFE for its chemical customers. While many of the competitors manufacture and distribute either gaskets or bolts, supplying both provides us with an advantage to customers who prefer to deal with fewer suppliers. 

&#8226; 

Established and Extensive Distribution Channels. Our business utilizes an established hub-and-spoke distribution system whereby our primary manufacturing facilities supply products to our own branches and highly knowledgeable network of worldwide distributors and licensees, which are located in close proximity to our primary customers. Our primary manufacturing facilities are in Houston, Texas; Faridabad and Bangalore, India; Wolverhampton, United Kingdom; and the newly opened facility in Reynosa, Mexico; with company-owned branches strategically located around the world to serve our global customer base. Enabled by its branch network and close proximity to its customers, Energy's ability to provide quick turn-around and customized solutions for its customers is also a competitive strength. This established network of branches, enhanced by third-party distributors, allows us to add new customers in various locations and to increase distribution to existing customers. Our experienced in-house sales support teams work with our global network of distributors and licensees to create a strong market presence in all aspects of the oil, gas and petrochemical refining industries. 

&#8226; 

Leading Market Positions and Strong Brand Name. We believe we are one of the largest gasket and bolt suppliers to the global energy market. We believe that Lamons is known as a quality brand and offers premium service to the industry. We also believe that our facilities have the latest proprietary technology and equipment to be able to produce urgent requirement gaskets and bolts locally to meet its customers' demands. 

&#32;9 

Strategies 

The Energy segment has been faced with several external challenges related to the reduction of its upstream business as a result of the decline in oil prices, as well as downstream business postponement of refinery shutdowns and customer capital expenditures. We believe Energy has opportunities to improve its margins, while maintaining its market leadership, including: 

&#8226; 

Reconfiguring its Footprint to Drive Lower-Costs. Over the past year, we have been in the process, and continue to work through, reducing the cost structures through ongoing manufacturing, overhead and administrative productivity initiatives, global sourcing and selectively shifting manufacturing capabilities to countries with lower costs. We have performed a comprehensive review of our physical footprint and have closed and or consolidated locations to reduce our fixed cost structure. We have also moved a portion of our gasket and fastener operations from our Houston facility to a new facility in Reynosa, Mexico. The move to Mexico is expected to improve our global operating model and enhance the competitiveness of the business, while increasing customer service, as we move our higher-volume, longer lead-time products to this facility. In addition to our core domestic manufacturing facility in Houston, we have advanced manufacturing facilities and sourcing capabilities in China and India. Multi-country manufacturing capabilities provide flexibility to move specific manufacturing requirements amongst facilities to leverage lower cost opportunities and better serve our customers. We believe expanding our new Matrix&#174; product and capacity in India will further increase profitability, as we manufacture our own sheet product compared to reliance for comparable product from our competitors. 

&#8226; 

Improve Operational Efficiency at all Locations. We believe that there are additional opportunities to improve our operational efficiency at all of our locations by continuing the implementation of the lean-based TriMas Operating System. Through improved planning, inventory management, pricing and processes, Energy should improve its margins, while reducing its product lead-times and increase customer fill-rates. 

&#8226; 

Expand Engineered and Specialty Product Offering. Over the past couple of years, we have launched several new highly-engineered and specialty products and have broadened our specialty bolt offering. Examples of new products include: WRI-LP gaskets, a hydrofluoric acid gasket solution; inhibitor gaskets designed to prevent corrosion in offshore platform flanges; IsoTek TM &#32;Gaskets, an engineered sealing solution for flanged pipe connections; and intelligent bolts which provide more reliable load indication. Most recently, Energy was the first in Europe approved to manufacture the API 20E fasteners used in subsea critical applications, and the first in the world approved to manufacture to API 6A, 17D, 20E and Q1 quality systems. In &#32; addition to providing revenue growth opportunities, specialty products tend to have higher margins than their standard counterparts. 

Marketing, Customers and Distribution 

Energy relies upon a combination of direct sales forces and established networks of independent distributors and licensees with familiarity of the end users. Gaskets and bolts are supplied directly to major customers through our sales and service facilities in major regional markets, or through a large network of independent distributors/licensees. The sales and distribution network's close proximity to the customer makes it possible for Energy to respond to customer-specific engineered applications and provide a high degree of customer service. Our overseas sales are made either through newer sales and service facilities in Belgium, India, Singapore, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom, licensees or through our many distributors. Significant Energy customers include Dow Chemical, ExxonMobil, Bechtel, DNOW, LyondellBasell, MRC and Valero. 

Competition 

Energy's primary competitors include ERIKS, Flexitallic Group, Garlock (EnPro), Klinger, Lone Star and Teadit. Most of Energy's competitors supply either gaskets or bolts. We believe that providing both gaskets and bolts, as well as our hub-and-spoke distribution model, gives us a competitive advantage with many customers. We believe that our broader product portfolio and strong brand name enables us to maintain our market leadership position as one of the largest gasket and bolt suppliers to the energy market.

Strategies 

We believe the businesses within the Engineered Components segment have opportunities to grow, based on the following: 

&#8226; 

Strong Product Innovation. The Engineered Components segment has a history of successfully creating and introducing new products and there are currently several significant product initiatives underway. Arrow Engine continues to introduce new products in the area of industrial engine spare parts for various industrial engines not manufactured by Arrow Engine, including selected engines manufactured and sold under the Caterpillar &#174; , Waukesha &#174; , Ajax &#174; &#32;and Gemini &#174; &#32; brands. Arrow Engine has also launched an offering of customizable compressors and gas production and meter run equipment, which are used by existing end customers in the oil and natural gas extraction markets, as well as development of a natural gas compressor used for compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations. Norris Cylinder developed a process for manufacturing ISO cylinders capable of holding higher pressure gases and has been awarded a United Nations certification for its ISO cylinders, making Norris Cylinder the first manufacturer approved to distribute ISO cylinders domestically. Norris Cylinder has also created new designs for seamless acetylene applications in marine and international markets. 

&#8226; 

Entry into New Markets and Development of New Customers. Engineered Components has opportunities to grow its businesses by offering its products to new customers, markets and geographies. In November 2013, Norris Cylinder acquired the assets of Worthington Cylinder's Tilbury, Ontario and Jefferson, Ohio facilities, making Norris Cylinder the only manufacturer of steel high-pressure and acetylene cylinders in North America. Norris Cylinder is selling its cylinders internationally into Europe, South Africa, and South and Central America, as well as pursuing new end markets such as cylinders for use at cell towers (hydrogen fuel cells), in mine safety (breathing air and rescue chambers) and in fire suppression. Arrow Engine continues to expand its product portfolio to serve new customers and new applications for oil and natural gas production in all areas of the industry, including shale drilling. Arrow Engine is also expanding international sales, particularly in Mexico, Indonesia and Venezuela. 

&#32;11 

&#8226; 

Reconfigure Capacity to Reflect Expected Demand Levels. Norris Cylinder is in the process of deploying previously acquired assets in both its Huntsville, Alabama and Longview, Texas facilities to support its future expected growth, increasing its capacity for both large and small high pressure cylinders. Norris Cylinder is in process of installing equipment obtained during previous acquisitions in an effort to produce higher volume cylinders more efficiently, while allowing higher technology products to be produced on the current forge asset. At the same time, Arrow Engine, has been unfavorably impacted by reductions in drilling activity driven by the decline in oil prices. In response, Arrow Engine has been focused on right-sizing its business to reflect the current demand levels by lowering costs and maximizing resources until the end market recovers. Where possible, Arrow Engine is variablizing the cost structure to respond quickly to end market changes and enhance flexibility, driving low cost sourcing efforts, and focusing on additional productivity and Lean initiatives. 

Marketing, Customers and Distribution 

Engineered Components' customers operate in the oil, gas, industrial and commercial industries. Given the focused nature of many of our products, the Engineered Components segment relies upon a combination of direct sales forces and established networks of independent distributors with familiarity of the end-users. In many of the markets this segment serves, its companies' brand names are virtually synonymous with product applications. The narrow end-user base of many of these products makes it possible for this segment to respond to customer-specific engineered applications and provide a high degree of customer service. Engineered Components' OEM and aftermarket customers include Airgas, Air Liquide, Chesapeake, Kidde-Fenwal, Midcon Compression, Praxair and Total Operations and Production Services (TOPS). In years with higher levels of drilling activity, DNOW and Weatherford would also be larger customers of engines, parts and compressor products. 

Competition 

Arrow Engine tends to compete against natural gas powered, lower horsepower, multi-cylinder engines from manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Chevy, Cummins and Ford industrial engines and electric motors. Norris Cylinder competes against Worthington, Beijing Tianhai Industry Co., Faber and Vitkovice Cylinders. In May 2012, the U.S. International Trade Commission made a unanimous final determination that Norris Cylinder had been materially injured by imports of DOT high pressure steel cylinders that were being subsidized by the Government of China, as well as being dumped in the U.S. market by producers in China, and as a result, imposed antidumping and countervailing duties on the subject imports to create a fairer competitive environment in the United States. Engineered Components' companies supply highly engineered, non-commodity, customer-specific products with large shares of small markets supplied by a limited number of competitors. 

Acquisition Strategy 

We believe that our businesses have significant opportunities to grow through disciplined, strategic acquisitions that enhance the strengths of our core businesses. We typically seek "bolt-on" acquisitions, in which we acquire another industry participant or adjacent product lines that expand our existing product offerings, gain access to new customers, end markets and distribution channels, expand our geographic footprint and/or capitalize on scale and cost efficiencies. Strategically, our primary focus is on acquisition targets in the Packaging and Aerospace segments, as these segments have higher growth and margin profiles. This is evidenced by our 2014 acquisitions of Allfast Fastening Systems in Aerospace and Lion Holdings and the remaining 30% interest in Arminak &#38; Associates in Packaging, and our 2015 acquisition of certain assets and personnel related to Parker Hannifin&#8217;s Tolleson, Arizona facility, which manufactures complex machined parts for the aerospace industry. We will also consider opportunistic bolt-on acquisitions in our other segments, although such transactions are likely to be more modest in terms of target size and transaction value. 

Materials and Supply Arrangements 

Our largest raw material purchases are for steel, aluminum, titanium, cast iron, polyethylene and other resins. Raw materials and other supplies used in our operations are normally available from a variety of competing suppliers. In addition to raw materials, we purchase a variety of components and finished products from low-cost sources in China, India, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. 

Steel is purchased primarily from steel mills and service centers with pricing contracts principally in the three-to-six month time frame. Changing global dynamics for steel production and supply will continue to present a challenge to our business. Polyethylene is generally a commodity resin with multiple suppliers capable of providing product globally. While both steel and polyethylene are readily available from a variety of competing suppliers, our business has experienced, and we believe will continue to experience, volatility in the costs of these raw materials.

Employees and Labor Relations 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 4,200 people, of which approximately 49% were located outside the United States and 19% &#32;were unionized. We currently have collective bargaining agreements covering seven &#32;facilities worldwide, two &#32;of which are in the United States. Employee relations have generally been satisfactory. 

On January 5, 2015, we finalized the decision to move a portion of the gasket and fastener operations from our Energy facility in Houston, Texas to a new facility in Reynosa, Mexico. This announcement impacts approximately 10% of facility's current unionized work force. The decision to move a portion of the manufacturing is the result of our effort to improve our Energy global operating model and enhance the competitiveness of the business. This transition is expected to be completed over the next 12 to 18 months. 

In August 2015, we concluded, without a work stoppage or strike, a three year extension of our labor agreement with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America at our aerospace facility in California. 

Seasonality and Backlog 

None of our reportable segments experience significant seasonal fluctuations. However, our fourth quarter tends to be our lowest revenue quarter as a result of holiday slowdowns at certain of our significant customers. 

We do not consider sales order backlog to be a material factor in our businesses. Our Aerospace customers often provide a forward view of build rates and needs for products, but firm orders do not extend for more than a few months, and often times are not guaranteed and could change. 

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners' or operators' releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment and compliance with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities. 

Current laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position, while we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords. Future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites. 

Intangible Assets 

Our identified intangible assets, consisting of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names and technology, are recorded at approximately $273.9 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 , net of accumulated amortization. The valuation of each of the identified intangibles was performed using broadly accepted valuation methodologies and techniques. 

Customer Relationships. We have developed and maintained stable, long-term selling relationships with customer groups for specific branded products and/or focused market product offerings within each of our businesses. Useful lives assigned to customer relationship intangibles range from five to 25 years and have been estimated using historic customer retention and turnover data. Other factors considered in evaluating estimated useful lives include the diverse nature of focused markets and products of which we have significant share, how customers in these markets make purchases and these customers' position in the supply chain. We also monitor and evaluate the impact of other evolving risks including the threat of lower cost competitors and evolving technology. 

Trademarks and Trade Names. Each of our operating groups designs and manufactures products for focused markets under various trade names and trademarks (see discussion above by reportable segment). Our trademark/trade name intangibles are well-established and considered long-lived assets that require maintenance through advertising and promotion expenditures. Because it is our practice and intent to maintain and to continue to support, develop and market these trademarks/trade names for the foreseeable future, we consider our rights in these trademarks/trade names to have an indefinite life, except as otherwise dictated by applicable law. 

&#32;13 

Technology. We hold a number of United States and foreign patents, patent applications, and proprietary product and process-oriented technologies within all four of our reportable segments. We have, and will continue to dedicate, technical resources toward the further development of our products and processes in order to maintain our competitive position in the industrial, commercial and consumer end markets that we serve. Estimated useful lives for our technology intangibles range from one to 30 years and are determined in part by any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit useful life. For example, patent rights have a maximum limit of 20 years in the United States. Other factors considered include the expected use of the technology by the operating groups, the expected useful life of the product and/or product programs to which the technology relates, and the rate of technology adoption by the industry. 

International Operations 

Approximately 13.7% &#32;of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 &#32;were derived from sales by our subsidiaries located outside of the United States, and we may significantly expand our international operations through organic growth actions and acquisitions. In addition, approximately 15.0% &#32;of our operating net assets as of December 31, 2015 &#32;were located outside of the United States. We operate manufacturing facilities in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, India, Mexico, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. In addition to the net sales derived from sales by our subsidiaries located outside of the United States, we also generated approximately $82.7 million &#32;of export sales from the United States.
