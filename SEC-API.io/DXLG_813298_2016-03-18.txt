 Item 1. &#160; Business 

Destination XL Group, Inc., together with our subsidiaries (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), is the largest specialty retailer of big &#38; tall men&#8217;s apparel with retail and direct operations in the United States and London, England. We operate under the trade names of Destination XL &#174; , DXL &#174; , Casual Male XL &#174; , Casual Male XL outlets, DXL outlets, Rochester Clothing, ShoesXL &#174; and LivingXL &#174; . We operate 166 Destination XL stores, 125 Casual Male XL retail stores, 40 Casual Male XL outlet stores, 9 DXL outlet stores and 5 Rochester Clothing stores. Our direct business includes our DestinationXL.com and bigandtall.com e-commerce sites which support our stores, brands and product extensions. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;ours,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;the Company&#8221; refer to Destination XL Group, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries. We refer to our fiscal years ended January 30, 2016, January 31, 2015 and February 1, 2014 as &#8220;fiscal 2015&#8221;, &#8220;fiscal 2014&#8221; and &#8220;fiscal 2013,&#8221; respectively. 

OUR INDUSTRY 

We believe that the men&#8217;s big &#38; tall apparel market, which includes pants with a waist size of 42&#8221; and greater, as well as tops sized 1XL and greater, generates approximately $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion in sales annually and represents approximately 11% of the overall men&#8217;s apparel business. Growth in this segment has been driven by rapidly changing market demographics. We estimate that our market share in fiscal 2015 was approximately 12%. We believe that we can increase our market share by catering to the broader target market, attracting customers from various income, age and lifestyle segments and offering the widest selection of sizes and styles that fit well. An opportunity also exists for market share growth from the lower-size range of our market, that is, men in the 38&#8221;-46&#8221; waist size. These sizes are usually at the high end of the size range for most retailers and, as a result, the selection is usually limited at such retailers. 

HISTORY 

Our Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1976 under the name Designs, Inc. Until fiscal 1995, we operated exclusively in Levi Strauss &#38; Co. branded apparel mall and outlet stores. In May 2002, we acquired the Casual Male business from Casual Male Corp. at a bankruptcy court-ordered auction. At the time of the acquisition, Casual Male was the largest specialty retailer of men&#8217;s clothing in the big &#38; tall market in the United States. As a result of the acquisition, on August 8, 2002, we changed our name to &#8220;Casual Male Retail Group, Inc.&#8221; 

Through fiscal 2010, we primarily operated Casual Male XL retail stores, Casual Male XL outlet stores and Rochester Clothing stores, along with the associated websites and catalogs. We catered to all customers through these three store formats, from our value-oriented customer (Casual Male XL outlets) to our luxury-oriented customer (Rochester Clothing stores). During that year, we tested a new store concept, Destination XL (&#8220;DXL&#8221;). The DXL store concept merged all of our existing brands under one roof, offering our customers a superior shopping environment with an extensive assortment of product and an increased presence of name brands, without having to shop multiple stores. In addition to offering our customers a wide assortment, we also wanted to provide them with an outstanding and unique shopping experience. We are focused on providing outstanding customer service through our DXL concept, 

&#160;

&#160;

with everything from larger fitting rooms to professional, trained associates providing both personal attention and on-site tailoring. With the success of this store format, we then made a similar change to our e-commerce business in fiscal 2011 when we launched our DestinationXL.com website which, like our DXL store, merged all of our previous websites into one consolidated site providing our customers the ability to cross-shop our brands easily. 

Our DXL store format has proven to be successful for us and our customers, and, based on the positive performance and future growth opportunities of this concept, we are in the process of completely transitioning our business by opening DXL stores and exiting the majority of our Casual Male XL retail stores and many of our Rochester Clothing stores. As part of our new direction, in December 2012, we changed our NASDAQ stock ticker symbol to &#8220;DXLG&#8221; followed by a change in February 2013 of our corporate name to &#8220;Destination XL Group, Inc.&#8221; We believe the change of our corporate name to Destination XL Group, Inc. better reflects who we are today as we expand the Destination XL concept and rebrand our Company as a whole. 

BUSINESS STRATEGY 

When we initially made the decision in fiscal 2012 to transition, on an accelerated basis, from our Casual Male XL retail and Rochester Clothing stores to the DXL store format , we envisioned it would take three years and that we could eventually have as many as 250 DXL stores. By the end of fiscal 2013, we had closed over 100 Casual Male XL and Rochester stores and opened 51 DXL stores. While our DXL stores performed well, our forecasts, especially with respect to immediate sales contribution, had not adequately taken into account the hurdles we would face trying to convert existing customers of the closed Casual Male XL stores to newly opened DXL stores. As a result, with sales performance below our expectations, we identified several opportunities to improve our roll-out strategy which included slowing down the conversion, taking advantage of our existing Casual Male XL stores to help transition our customer base, keeping our profitable legacy stores open longer to help fund our roll-out and pursuing a smaller DXL store format for smaller market areas. By the end of fiscal 2014, we had successfully implemented these strategies and, as a result, our top-line growth exceeded our expectations and we saw a returned growth in our customer base. 

Our strong financial results for fiscal 2015 have further validated our transition strategy. Our sales have grown from $386.5 million in fiscal 2013 to $442.2 million in fiscal 2015 and EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, has improved from $7.8 million in fiscal 2013 to $23.3 million in fiscal 2015. (See Item 7. &#8220; Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis &#8211; Non-GAAP Measures &#8221; for a reconciliation of GAAP to this non-GAAP measure.) 

With 166 DXL stores opening over a five-year period, coupled with our extensive knowledge, history and customer base of our legacy stores, our DXL store model has proven to be fairly consistent. While our business can be affected by macro-economic conditions that may affect consumer confidence, unlike mall-based retailers, because our customer is primarily a need-based destination shopper, our DXL stores are not dependent on the volatility of mall traffic or the strength of neighboring anchor stores. 

As part of our DXL store roll-out, one of the most significant areas of opportunity for us has been in gaining the &#8220;end of rack&#8221; customer. This &#8220;end of rack&#8221; customer, with a waist size of 46 inches or less, shops 41% more often than our customer with a waist size of 48 inches or above and, on an annual basis, spends twice as much. This new customer has increasingly contributed to our top-line growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, this customer represented only 39% of our bottoms business as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, where he accounted for approximately 46.4% of our bottoms business. As our brand awareness grows among this group, we believe we can further grow this customer base. 

Two of the initiatives that we launched in fiscal 2014 that have also contributed to our sales growth and we believe they will continue to have an impact on our long-term outlook. The successful introduction of our smaller DXL concept (6,500 square feet or less) has allowed us to penetrate into markets that we previously believed were too small for a DXL store. We also developed a successful DXL outlet format that has allowed us to deliver the DXL brand and experience to our outlet customers. Together with increasing brand awareness, the smaller format DXL store and the DXL outlet store provide us with increased opportunities for continued store growth.

In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we completed a market opportunity study of our existing Casual Male XL and DXL store portfolio. We have identified approximately 400 locations nationwide that could support our DXL concept, up from 250 locations we originally identified. Of the 400 locations, we estimate that approximately 340 will be DXL retail stores with the remaining 60 as DXL outlet stores. 

Based on this study, we now expect to open 30 to 40 DXL stores per year through at least fiscal 2020. 

We are currently projecting sufficient free cash flow to fund the remainder of the DXL roll-out. All new DXL stores are subject to demanding ROIC (&#8220;Return on Invested Capital&#8221;) hurdles. We anticipate strong returns based on our experience to date that will drive sales and EBITDA while strengthening our liquidity position. 

&#160;

&#160;

International Growth 

In April 2012, we opened our first franchised Destination XL &#174; store in the Middle East at the Symphony Mall in Kuwait City, Kuwait, pursuant to a franchise agreement with The Standard Arabian Business &#38; Enterprises Company (SABECO).

Based on our experience to date, we believe that the international big &#38; tall market is currently underserved and, based on the success of our DXL concept in the U.S. and the positive customer response for our Kuwait City franchised store, we see an opportunity for growth internationally. Our strategy will be centered on a franchise and license model which requires very little capital commitment. In November 2015, we hired a Senior Vice President of International Business Development to lead this initiative, and we are actively exploring opportunities. We expect that our next international franchised store could open as early as fiscal 2017. 

OUR BUSINESS 

We operate as an omni-channel retailer. Through our multiple brands, which include both branded apparel and private-label, we offer a broad range of merchandise at varying price points, catering from the value-oriented customer to the luxury-oriented customer. Our objective is to appeal to all of our customers by providing a good, better, best array of product assortments in all primary lifestyles with multiple and convenient ways to shop. 

Our DXL stores cater to all income demographics and offer our customers merchandise in all lifestyles from casual to business, young to mature, in all price ranges and in all large sizes from XL and up. Our Casual Male XL stores carry primarily moderately priced branded and private label casual sportswear and dresswear, while our Rochester Clothing stores carry fine quality, designer and branded menswear. We also operate Casual Male XL outlets and DXL outlets for our value-oriented consumer. In addition to our stores, we operate our Destination XL e-commerce site which is similar to our DXL store concept and offers a brand range of merchandise at each price point, including a complete offering of shoes. 

Another critical part of our business operation is managing the number of sizes offered to our customers and optimizing our in-stock position throughout each season. Our best-selling pant has 57 size combinations as compared to an average retailer who may only have 15 different size combinations. We maintain a consolidated inventory across all channels which enables us to manage our in-stock position of all sizes effectively, ultimately improving customer service. Moreover, our planning and allocation methodologies, with respect to store assortment planning, help to optimize each location&#8217;s market potential without excessive inventory levels. 

MERCHANDISE 

A vital component of our business strategy is to offer our customers a broad assortment of apparel that is appropriate to our diverse customer base. Regardless of our customers&#8217; age, socioeconomic status, or lifestyle preference, we are able to assemble a wardrobe to fit our customers&#8217; apparel needs. In addition, we offer such assortments in private-label product, balanced with an array of brand name labels. With over 5,000 styles available, we carry tops in sizes up to 8XL and 6XLT, bottoms with waist sizes 38&#8221; to 66&#8221;, and shoes in sizes 10W to 18. In addition, we added to our product assortment a smaller fit XL and XLT to appeal to our target &#8220;end-of-rack&#8221; customer. 

Our stores are merchandised to showcase entire outfits by lifestyle, including traditional, active, denim, dress wear and contemporary. This format allows us to merchandise key items and seasonal goods in prominent displays and makes coordinating outfits easier for the customer while encouraging multi-item purchases. This lifestyle layout also allows us to manage store space more effectively in each market to target local demographics. The key item strategy is also fully integrated by lifestyle, allowing us to focus on merchandise presentation and offer our customers a compelling value proposition. 

Merchandise assortments in our DXL stores are organized not only by lifestyle, but within each lifestyle, the assortments are shown in a &#8220;good&#8221;, &#8220;better&#8221;, &#8220;best&#8221; and &#8220;luxury&#8221; visual presentation, again to benefit our customers&#8217; ease of shopping. With the &#8220;best&#8221; merchandise assortments featured most prominently in the DXL store, our customers are able to visualize current fashion trends and easily select their wardrobes within their desired price points in a convenient manner. 

We carry several well-known national brands of merchandise as well as a number of our own private-label lines within our &#8220;good&#8221;, &#8220;better&#8221;, &#8220;best&#8221; and &#8220;luxury&#8221; price points. The penetration of branded apparel in our DXL stores can range from 15% to 80%, depending on several factors, but on average, our DXL stores carry approximately 43% of branded merchandise. 

&#160;

&#160;

Higher-End Luxury Fashion Apparel -&#8220;Best&#8221; and &#8220;Luxury&#8221; Merchandise

In addition, we carry several private-label lines:

Twenty Eight Degrees&#8482; is targeted as a contemporary/modern line offering sportswear and loungewear. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Society of One is a jeanswear brand catering to the needs of the fashion denim customer. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Rochester is a line that targets traditional luxury styles. We also offer a complete selection of sportcoats, dress shirts and neckwear under our Rochester Black Label private label. 

Value-Priced Apparel -&#8220;Good&#8221; Merchandise 

For our value-oriented customers, we carry Geoffrey Beene &#174; , Cubavera, Nautica &#174; and Nautica Jeans &#174; , Dockers, Lee, Perry Ellis, Wrangler, Reebok and Creekwood. In addition we carry several private label lines: 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Harbor Bay &#174; was our first proprietary brand and it is a traditional line which continues to represent a significant portion of our business, specifically in terms of our core basic merchandise. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Gold Series&#8482; is our core performance offering of tailored-related separates, blazers, dress slacks, dress shirts and neckwear that blends comfort features such as stretch, stain resistance and wrinkle-free fabrications with basic wardrobe essentials. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Synrgy&#8482; targets the customer looking for a contemporary/modern look.

&#160;

&#9679; 

True Nation &#174; is a denim-inspired line consisting of vintage-screen t-shirts and wovens and is geared towards our younger customers. 

&#160;

&#9679; 

Island Passport &#174; is an island-inspired line of camp shirts, printed woven shirts and relaxed island-inspired pants. 

RETAIL CHANNEL 

Destination XL stores (&#8220;DXL&#8221;) 

Our DXL store concept brings all of our brands together in one format. Within this format, we can cater to our very diverse customer group, with merchandise representing all price points, from our luxury brands to value-oriented brands, and all lifestyles, from business to denim. The size of our current DXL stores, which contain almost triple the product assortments of a Casual Male XL store, currently averages 8,250 square feet, but is expected to average closer to 7,000 to 8,000 square feet as we open future DXL stores. As discussed above, in fiscal 2014, we began opening smaller (5,000-6,500 square feet) DXL stores and through the end of fiscal 2015, 21 of our 166 stores are the smaller store format. Because these locations are smaller, they carry a smaller product offering than our other DXL stores but are representative of the &#8220;good, better, best&#8221; merchandise strategy. The locations of our DXL stores are also an essential aspect of our roll-out. We seek locations where our stores are highly visible, preferably adjacent to regional malls or other high-traffic shopping areas.

&#160;

&#160;

With our larger DXL store format, we are able to provide our customers a spacious store with up to three times the product offeri ng of a Casual Male XL store. The merchandise in our DXL stores is organized by lifestyle: a ctive, t raditional, m odern and denim with a representation of all of our brands and price points , utilizing a &#8220; good, better, best &#8221; pricing structure. Depending on t he customers in each respective market, we can adjust the appropriate mix of merchandise, with varying selections from each of our price points, to cater to each demographic market. This larger store format also provides us the footprint necessary to carry a complete offering of dress wear, including tailored and &#8220;made-to-measure&#8221; custom clothing, as well as a selection of shoes in extended sizes and a broad assortment of accessories such as belts, ties, and socks. 

During fiscal 2015, we opened 29 DXL stores, bringing our store count at January 30, 2016 to 166 DXL stores. For fiscal 2015, the average sales per square foot for our DXL stores increased to $177 as compared to $165 for fiscal 2014 and $150 for fiscal 2013. Once a DXL store matures, which we believe is five years, we expect sales will be approximately $200-220 per square foot. For fiscal 2015, we had 40 DXL stores that had sales greater than $200 per square foot. For fiscal 2016, we plan to open 28 DXL stores resulting in approximately 194 DXL stores operating at the end of fiscal 2016. 

Casual Male XL retail stores 

At January 30, 2016, we operated 125 Casual Male XL full-price retail stores, located primarily in strip centers, power centers or stand-alone locations. The majority of the merchandise carried in our Casual Male XL stores is moderate-priced basic or fashion-neutral items, such as jeans, casual slacks, tee-shirts, polo shirts, dress shirts and suit separates. These stores also carry a full complement of our &#8220;better&#8221; private label collections. The average Casual Male XL retail store is approximately 3,500 square feet and has approximately $183 in sales per square foot annually. 

DXL outlet /Casual Male XL outlet stores 

At January 30, 2016, we operated 40 Casual Male XL and 9 DXL outlet stores designed to offer a wide range of casual clothing for the big &#38; tall customer at prices that are generally 20-25% lower than our moderate-priced merchandise. Much of the merchandise in our outlet stores is offered with the purchasing interests of the value-oriented customer in mind. In addition to private-label and branded merchandise at our &#8220;good&#8221; price tier, our outlets also carry clearance product obtained from DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing stores, offering the outlet customer the ability to purchase branded product and fashion product for a specially reduced price. As we open our DXL stores, the mix of branded product flowing into the outlets will increase to approximately 30% as we move inventory out of our DXL stores to keep it current while enhancing the branded presence in our outlets. 

Through the end of fiscal 2015, we have closed 9 Casual Male XL outlets and replaced them with a DXL outlet store, each with slightly more square footage and better locations. Of the 9 DXL outlets, 7 were open during fiscal 2015. The average Casual Male XL outlet store is approximately 3,150 square feet and the average DXL outlet is approximately 5,000 square feet. The 49 outlets have sales of approximately $197 per square foot annually. 

Rochester Clothing stores 

At January 30, 2016, we operated 5 Rochester Clothing stores, located in major cities in the United States and one store in London, England. The Rochester Clothing stores have a wide selection of our &#8220;best&#8221; merchandise which consists primarily of high-end merchandise from well-recognized brands. In addition, the stores also carry a few private-label lines especially designed for our high-end customer. The average Rochester Clothing store is approximately 10,000 square feet and has approximately $308 in sales per square foot annually. Although some of our Rochester Clothing stores will close over the next few fiscal years as we open DXL stores in the same geographical market, we currently expect that 3 of our high-traffic Rochester Clothing stores will remain open. 

DIRECT CHANNEL 

Our direct business, which consists primarily of our e-commerce business, is a vital part of our growing omni-channel business approach, allowing us to service our customers whether it be in-person at a store, over the telephone, online via a computer, smartphone or tablet. Our direct business bridges that gap for us by encouraging and expecting our store associates to use our website to help fulfill our customers&#8217; clothing needs. If a wider selection of a lifestyle, color or size of an item is not available in our store, then our store associates can order the item for our customer through our direct channel and have it shipped to the store or directly to the customer. Our customers also have the ability to order online and pick-up in store on the same day. Our customer&#8217;s shopping behavior continues to evolve across multiple channels and we are working to meet his needs.

&#160;

&#160;

With the ability to showcase all store inventories onlin e, we are seeing an increase in the number of transactions that are initiated online but are ultimately completed in store. Until fiscal 2014, our direct customer was limited to inventory available in our centralized distribution center but we can now ful fill from the store an item that is out-of-stock in our warehouse. This capability has not only resulted in incremental sales, but it has also helped us reduce clearance merchandise at the store level and improve long-term margins. As a percentage of tota l inventor ies , o ur clearance merchandise at January 30, 2016 was 8.1% as compared to 8.4% at January 31, 2015 and 10.3% at February 1, 2014. 

Destination XL &#174; E-Commerce Site 

In fiscal 2013, we combined all of our then-existing web addresses: www.casualmalexl.com, www.rochesterclothing.com, www.btdirect.com, www.livingxl.com and www.shoesxl.com and redirected our users to our new comprehensive Destination XL website. Similar to our DXL store concept, our www.destinationxl.com website allows our customers to shop across all of our brands and product extensions with ease and brings all of our customers to one website. Our customers were previously classified as a &#8220;Rochester&#8221; customer or a &#8220;Casual Male&#8221; customer. Now, our customers are all &#8220;DXL&#8221; customers, which no longer limits our customer&#8217;s ability to access our full product assortment. 

From the Destination XL homepage, customers can search across all of our brands and, similar to our stores, shop merchandise from value-oriented to luxury price points. In addition, a customer can tailor their search using our &#8220;size profile.&#8221; Our Destination XL website also offers a complete line of men&#8217;s footwear in extended sizes, offering our customers a full range of footwear in hard-to-find sizes. Although our DXL stores all have a selection of footwear available, we are able to offer a full assortment of sizes and styles through our website. The assortment is a reflection of our apparel, with a broad assortment from moderate to luxury and from casual to formal. We currently have a selection of more than 600 styles of shoes, ranging in sizes from 10W to 18M and widths up to 6E. We carry a number of designer brands including Cole Haan &#174; , Allen Edmonds &#174; , Timberland &#174; , Calvin Klein &#174; , Lacoste &#174; , Donald J. Pliner and Bruno Magli &#174; .

In addition to our Destination XL website, our customers can also access our LivingXL website directly from our homepage. LivingXL is an online-only store that specializes in the selling of select high-quality products which help larger people maintain a more comfortable lifestyle. The types of products sold on our website benefit both men and women and include chairs, outdoor accessories, travel accessories, bed and bath and fitness equipment. 

In recent years, we have seen a significant increase in the number of visitors to our websites from a mobile device. As such, in the summer of fiscal 2013, we launched a mobile optimized website, m.destinationxl.com, creating an improved experience around product browsing, checkout, access to loyalty program information, researching inventory in a local store, and finding a local store location. An improved experience was also created for international visitors. Upon entering our full site, these visitors are identified based on where they reside globally and are now able to shop in their local currency. In addition, checkout is customized based on their location, with local payment methods and a guaranteed cost including shipping and taxes. In early 2016, we will be launching t.destinationxl.com, an optimized site for tablet visitors to provide an improved shopping experience for all our DXL online visitors, regardless of the device they are using.

BigandTall.com 

During fiscal 2014, we launched www.bigandtall.com. This website is separate from our Destination XL site, catering to a value-oriented customer and exclusively offering an assortment of promotional and clearance merchandise.

MERCHANDISE PLANNING AND ALLOCATION 

Our merchandise planning and allocation area is critical to the effective management of our inventory, store assortments, product sizes and overall gross margin profitability. The merchandise planning and allocation team has an array of planning and replenishment tools available to assist in maintaining an appropriate level of inventory, in-stock positions at the store and direct levels, and pre-season planning for product assortments for each store and the direct channels. Additionally, in-season reporting identifies opportunities and challenges in inventory performance. Over the past several years, we have made investments in implementing best practice tools and processes for our merchandise planning and allocation. 

Our core basic merchandise makes up over 40% of our &#8220;better&#8221; assortment and over 20% of our &#8220;best&#8221; assortment. Our planning and allocation team estimates quantity and demand several months in advance to optimize gross margin and minimize end-of-season merchandise for all seasonal merchandise. We have implemented an omni-channel approach towards our assortment planning methodology that customizes each store&#8217;s assortment to accentuate lifestyle preferences for each store. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our merchandising data warehouse provides the merchandising team with standardized reporting for monitoring assortment performance by product category and by store, i dentifying in-stock positions by size and generally monitoring overall inventory levels relative to selling. At season end, we analyze the overall performance of product categor ies , overall assortments and specific styles by store to focus on the opportuni ties and challenges for the next season&#8217;s planning cycle. 

During each season, we utilize a markdown optimization tool to monitor the selling performance of our fashion assortments and compare against the planned selling curves. When actual selling performance significantly drops below planned selling curves, we make in-season pricing adjustments so that we maintain planned levels of residual fashion product at season&#8217;s end. 

Utilizing a set of specific universal reporting tools, we are able to fulfill the daily, weekly and monthly roles and responsibilities of the merchandise planning and allocation team. These reporting tools provide focused and actionable views of the business to optimize the overall assortment by category and by store. We believe that by having all members of the merchandise planning and allocation team follow a standardized set of processes with the use of standardized reporting tools, our inventory performance will be optimized. 

STORE OPERATIONS 

We believe that our store associates are the key to creating the highest quality experience for our customer. Over the past six years, we have extensively worked to change the culture in our stores from an operationally-driven organization to a sales-driven, customer-centric organization. Our overall goal is to assist our associates in becoming less task oriented and more focused on serving the customer. We want our associates to help our customer meet his apparel needs through building his wardrobe; not just selling our customer a single item. In order to accomplish this, we have invested in educating our associates. Our associates have been trained to be clothing experts, capable of accommodating our customer&#8217;s style and fit needs with ready-to-wear clothing. Our training approach provides product knowledge as well as behavioral training. A key component to the success of this program is finding the right caliber of store associates. Our multi-unit, field management team receives extensive training on recruiting associates with the correct fit for our stores. Our new DXL store management team hires are enrolled in a training program with time spent in one of our two regional training centers. 

Each new store management team member spends time in a DXL store, working with certified training managers to solidify their training before they are released to their &#8220;home&#8221; store. This allows each new store management team to apply the skills learned during training to successfully managing their respective stores. 

We are able to gauge the effectiveness of our training through measuring sales productivity at each level of the field organization, including individual sales associates. We believe these educational programs, together with monitoring sales metrics to help identify opportunities for further training, will improve sales productivity and strengthen our customer&#8217;s brand loyalty. 

Each DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing store is staffed with a store manager, assistant managers and associates. The store manager is responsible for achieving certain sales and operational targets. Our DXL, Casual Male XL and Rochester Clothing stores have an incentive-based commission plan for managers and selling staff to encourage associates to focus on our customer&#8217;s wardrobing needs and sales productivity. 

Our field organization is overseen by our Chief Sales Officer (Senior Vice President of Store Sales &#38; Operations) and Regional Sales Managers, who provide management development and guidance to individual store managers. Each Regional Sales Manager is responsible for hiring and developing store managers at the stores assigned to that Regional Sales Manager&#8217;s market, and for the overall operations and profitability of those stores. Our Outlet division is overseen by two Outlet Regional Managers, who in turn, have four Outlet Area Managers overseeing the outlet stores, dividing the country by central, east, south, and west. 

The Senior Vice President of Store Sales &#38; Operations, the Vice President of Store Operations &#38; Training and the two Vice Presidents of Sales coordinate all sales and operations initiatives and activities along with the support of the Director of Field Training, the Director of Training &#38; Operations, and the Vice President of Store Communications. 

MARKETING AND ADVERTISING 

In 2015, we continued to see strong growth in DXL awareness. We grew our aided awareness (prompted brand recognition) from 33% at the end of fiscal 2014 to 38% at the end of fiscal 2015. Additionally, &#8220;top of mind&#8221; awareness also increased in fiscal 2015. This is a measure of the first retailer that comes to mind when our target consumers think of men&#8217;s apparel retailers. Our awareness in this category increased from 5% to 9%. We believe that our advertising creative has been a key driver of this awareness increase. Our consumer research studies have shown that the ad that we ran in fiscal 2015, and will continue to run through fiscal 2016, is perceived to be more memorable, impactful, and enjoyable than ads previously aired.

&#160;

&#160;

Additionally, in fiscal 2015, we increased our active 12-month customer count by 6%. This was achieved through higher acquisition of new customers attributed to advertising and a higher overall customer retention rate. DXL stores have experienced a significantly higher retention rate of customers than Casual Male. As we open more DXL stores and close more Casual Male XL stores, we expect that our overall retention rate will continue to improve. 

In addition to growing the active customer base within DXL, we are also growing the &#8220;End of Rack&#8221; customer who is defined as a customer with a 38-46 inch waist. This has been and continues to be a key demographic that we increasingly rely upon for our growth. For the year, the &#8220;End of Rack&#8221; segment contributed twice as much in revenue per customer as consumers with waist sizes above 46 inches. Also, the &#8220;End of Rack&#8221; customer visits us 41% more often than the consumer with a waist size 48 inches and above. 

Moreover, within this &#8220;End of Rack&#8221; segment, we have seen growth in awareness and sales penetration. The awareness of this group increased from 9% at the beginning of fiscal 2013, to 31% at the end of fiscal 2014 to 37% in fiscal 2015. For the year, 43.6% of our bottoms sales were associated with this customer segment versus 41.0% the previous year. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, 46.4% of our bottoms sales were associated with this segment.

As we close more of our Casual Male XL stores in fiscal 2016, we will continue our efforts to increase awareness of DXL and convert Casual Male XL customers to our DXL stores. Our focus will continue to be on transitioning our best Casual Male XL customers first, followed by the other very active, high sales contributing tiers of customers. For DXL stores opened between fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2014, we have converted 48% of Casual Male XL&#8217;s existing customers to new DXL customers. This figure is up from 39% at the start of fiscal 2015. Additionally, of those customers who convert at the outset, more than 40% of them shop again within 4 months of their first DXL experience. 

Our e-commerce business continues to perform well and we seek to continue to drive more customers to our website. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we saw a 15% increase in traffic to our website. Additionally, we saw that our share of online traffic for big and tall specialty retail increased to over 55% from 47% a year ago. Improvements to our website functionality coupled with increased spending in paid-search, affiliate marketing, and banner advertising had the greatest impact on the positive online performance. 

Our marketing spend for fiscal 2016 is expected to be lower than fiscal 2015. We plan to reduce the marketing spend by $2.8 million to $20.8 million, or 4.5% of sales, for fiscal 2016 as compared to $23.6 million, or 5.3% of sales, for fiscal 2015. We anticipate that the marketing spend will remain flat moving forward but the percent of sales will continue to drop over time as we grow our top line. By gaining improved efficiencies in media buying and creative development, we believe this reduction will not have an adverse effect on our sales, awareness, or customer acquisition goals. 

GLOBAL SOURCING 

We have strong experience in sourcing internationally, particularly in Asia, where we manufacture a significant percentage of our private-label merchandise. We have established relationships with some of the leading and specialized agents and factories. Our sourcing network consists of over 50 factories in 6 countries. Currently, approximately 50% of all our product needs are sourced directly. 

Our global sourcing strategy is a balanced approach considering quality, cost and lead time, depending on the requirements of the program. We believe our current sourcing structure is sufficient to meet our operating requirements and provide capacity for growth. The growth and effectiveness of our global direct sourcing program is a key component to our continued merchandise margin improvement. 

In an effort to minimize foreign currency risk, all payments to our direct sourced vendors and buying agents are made in U.S. dollars through the use of letters of credit or payment on account. 

DISTRIBUTION 

All of our distribution operations are centralized at our headquarters located in Canton, Massachusetts. However, if merchandise is available at the store level but not available at the distribution center, our stores are capable of completing the order and shipping it directly to a customer. 

We believe that having one centralized distribution facility minimizes the delivered cost of merchandise and maximizes the in-stock position of our stores. We believe that the centralized distribution system enables our stores to maximize selling space by reducing necessary levels of back-room stock carried in each store. In addition, the distribution center provides order fulfillment services for our e-commerce business. 

&#160;

&#160;

Since 2003, we have utilized United Parcel Services (&#8220;UPS&#8221;) for all of our store shipments as well as our domestic customer deliveries. We segregate our shipments into 3 additional hubs (Nashville , T N , Chicago , I L and New Stanton, P A ) to take advantage of direct ship incentive programs. By utilizing UPS, we are able to track all deliveries from the warehouse to our individual stores, including the status of in-transit shipments. In addition, we are able to provide our Direct-to-Consumer customers with Authorized Return Service and Web labels, making returns more conveni ent for them. We also have the ability, through UPS, to use the United States Postal Service-SurePost. SurePost normally take 1-2 days longer for delivery but provides cost savings when shipping direct to a customer&#8217;s residence. Our current contract wit h UPS is through January 5, 2020 . 

We utilize the Manhattan Associates&#8217; PKMS warehousing application for our distribution center systems, which has streamlined our distribution processes significantly, enhanced our in-transit times, and reduced our distribution costs substantially. Automated packing for single piece orders and barcode scanning technologies were added for Direct-to-Consumer, improving productivity and lowering packing costs. Various software and material handling improvements were made with our store replenishment systems on our retail sorter that enable us to pick size-specific product, by store, efficiently, allowing for quicker and more accurate replenishment to our retail stores. Scanning technologies were added to our sortation systems that improved the accuracy for product selection that is being sent to the various retail stores and Direct-to-Consumer. Supply chain technology was added to provide better visibility for imports, providing more accurate shipping information for buyers and allowing the distribution center to plan accurate staffing models for arriving freight, resulting in reduced costs and improved receipt efficiency. In addition, we have improved our active shelving and reserve racking to enhance our space utilization in our distribution center, while continuing to improve efficiencies through the implementation of engineered productivity standards. 

In-bound calls for our direct businesses are currently handled at our Canton facility and are primarily fulfilled by our distribution center. If an order cannot be fulfilled by our distribution center, the order is completed at the store level. 

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 

The infrastructure of our management information systems has consistently been a priority to us. The investments that we have made in this regard have substantially improved our overall efficiency and most importantly have enabled us to better manage our inventory. 

Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail merchandising and financial systems which include merchandise planning and reporting, distribution center processing, inventory allocation, sales reporting, and financial processing and reporting. Our business operates primarily on an IBM AS/400 platform, with the e-commerce/direct-to-consumer business on the Oracle and Intel/Microsoft environments. We believe that our current infrastructure provides us the ability and capacity to process transactions more efficiently and provides our management team with comprehensive tools with which to manage our business. 

Our suite of merchandising systems consists of the JDA Portfolio Solutions, specifically the MMS Merchandise Management System and the Arthur Merchandise Planning and Advanced Allocation systems. In addition, we also utilize JDA&#8217;s E3 Advanced Replenishment system to optimize fill back from vendors and adjustments from seasonal profiles which we believe has improved sales opportunities and control over our basic merchandise inventory. For our distribution operations, we use Manhattan Associates&#8217; PKMS distribution system. These systems have enabled us to improve sales, better manage inventory levels and streamline operations. 

The business is supported by a POS business application provided by Aptos, formerly known as Epicor. The POS applications capture daily transaction information by item, color and size. Communication between our corporate headquarters and all of our stores is facilitated on a daily basis through the use of an electronic mail system. The POS system includes a multitude of features including CRM tools that enable us to track customer buying habits and provides us with the ability to target customers with specific offers and promotions. During fiscal 2013, we upgraded our DXL stores to a state-of-the-art POS hardware platform supplied by Hewlett-Packard. In fiscal 2015, we implemented the latest store system solution from Aptos Software in our DXL locations to further support our business. 

Our websites have all been standardized on Oracle&#8217;s state-of-the-art hosted platform. We also implemented the e-SPS Product Life Cycle Management system from NGC to support the growth of our direct sourcing initiatives. To support the marketing area, we implemented the PlanSystem3 environment from Quad-Systems to manage marketing assets, schedule promotions and monitor activities. 

Our merchandising management systems are updated daily with all store transactions and provide daily sales, inventory, pricing and merchandise information and management reports to assist us in operating our retail business. Our merchandising system applications also facilitate the placement and tracking of purchase orders and utilize EDI technology. We evaluate this information, together with weekly reports on merchandise statistics, prior to making decisions regarding reorders of fast-selling items and the allocation of merchandise. 

&#160;

&#160;

Using Aptos &#8217; QuantiSense, a business intelligence and data warehous ing application, we are able to provide our management team with the ability to integrate data from several sources into reports that are useful and easily obtained. With its customized reporting capabilities, we have visibility down to the lowest level: s tyle, SKU and store. Over the past few years, we have developed customized reporting that has been beneficial to our business and we now have store grading applications and size scaling to the store level. In an effort to further improve our inventory man agement, we have created a standardized set of &#8220;best practices&#8221; for both our merchandise allocation and planning groups. 

Our direct business and retail business maintain a shared inventory system and we operate a single system platform for DXL, Casual Male and Rochester Clothing which delivers improved efficiencies and makes our full product assortment available to all of our business formats. 

We work to continually improve our web environment. In fiscal 2013, we introduced a mobile optimized site to capitalize on the growing use of mobile devices to look up store information, review product offerings, and complete purchases. In addition, the current website is fully integrated with global ecommerce company, Borderfree, to accommodate international customers by providing multi-currency pricing, payment processing, and international shipping. Functionality was also implemented to support an online custom shirt program and an in-store application to support both a custom suit and custom shirt program. 

Since fiscal 2013, we have been using the BrainShark communication and training platform for our stores. This platform continues to provide efficiencies in delivering information, training, and task management to all our locations. During fiscal 2014, we rolled out an eBay/VendorNet solution enabling us to access our entire DXL store inventory for customer fulfillment, making us truly omni-channel. The solution is fully integrated with UPS to facilitate the store shipments to customers. As a result, we are seeing more transactions that begin online but are ultimately completed at the store level. 

In addition, we deployed improvements to optimize our assortment planning and assortment execution capabilities. We also implemented a new web site in fiscal 2014, www.bigandtall.com, offering promotional and clearance product to appeal to our more value-oriented customers. Other significant technology upgrades in fiscal 2014 included a new web customer preferred shipping functionality with improved shipping service options and the Oracle Endeca Guided Search module to improve search engine optimization and the customer experience on the web. 

During fiscal 2015, we implemented a new in-store customer ordering capability to better service our customers&#8217; needs that are not fully satisfied by in-store inventory. New functionality and infrastructure was implemented to enable our customers to buy online and pickup in store. Also in fiscal 2015, we implemented more accurate store customer traffic counters in the DXL locations. In addition we upgraded of our core financial applications to the latest solutions from Infor.

In fiscal 2016, we will complete the development and implement a tablet optimized web site to further capitalize on the continued growth of mobile e-commerce. We also expect to upgrade our merchandise allocations and planning solutions in fiscal 2016. 

COMPETITION 

Our business faces competition from a variety of sources, including department stores such as Macy&#8217;s and Dillard&#8217;s, mass merchandisers, other specialty stores and discount and off-price retailers, as well as other retailers that sell big &#38; tall merchandise. While we have successfully competed on the basis of merchandise selection, comfort and fit, customer service and desirable store locations, there can be no assurances that other retailers will not adopt purchasing and marketing concepts similar to ours. Discount retailers with significant buying power, such as Wal-Mart and J.C. Penney, represent a source of competition for us. The direct business has several competitors, including the King Size catalog and website. 

The United States men&#8217;s big &#38; tall apparel market is highly competitive with many national and regional department stores, specialty apparel retailers, single market operators and discount stores offering a broad range of apparel products similar to ours. Besides retail competitors, we consider any casual apparel manufacturer operating in outlet malls throughout the United States to be a competitor in the casual apparel market. We believe that we are the only national operator of apparel stores focused on the men&#8217;s big &#38; tall market. 

SEASONALITY 

Historically, and consistent with the retail industry, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations as it relates to our operating income and net income. Traditionally, a significant portion of our operating income and net income is generated in the fourth quarter, as a result of the holiday season. 

&#160;
