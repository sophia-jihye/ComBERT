 Items 1. and 2. &#8195; Business and Properties . 

Overview 

We are a midstream logistics and marketing master limited partnership formed in March 2005 engaged in the purchasing, selling , storing and logistics of transporting petroleum and related products, including domestic and Canadian crude oil, gasoline and gasoline blendstocks (such as ethanol), distillates (such as home heating oil, diesel and kerosene), residual oil, renewable fuels, natural gas and propane. We also receive revenue from convenience store sales and gasoline station rental income. We own, control or have access to one of the largest terminal networks of refined petroleum products and renewable fuels in Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania (collectively, the &#8220;Northeast&#8221;). We own transload and storage terminals in North Dakota and Oregon that extend our origin &#8209;to &#8209;destination capabilities from the mid &#8209;continent region of the United States and Canada to the East and West Coasts. We are one of the largest distributors of gasoline, distillates, residual oil and renewable fuels to wholesalers, retailers and commercial customers in the New England states and New York. As of December 31, 2015, we had a portfolio of 1,509 owned, leased and/or supplied gasoline stations, including 281 directly operated convenience stores, in the Northeast, Maryland and Virginia. 

We purchase refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil, natural gas and propane primarily from domestic and foreign refiners and ethanol producers, crude oil producers, major and independent oil companies and trading companies. We operate our business under three segments: (i) Wholesale, (ii) Gasoline Distribution and Station Operations (&#8220;GDSO&#8221;) and (iii) Commercial. 

Global GP LLC, our general partner, manages our operations and activities and employs our officers and substantially all of our personnel, except for most of our gasoline station and convenience store employees and certain union personnel who are employed by our wholly owned subsidiar y , Global Montello Group Corp. (&#8220;GMG&#8221;). 

Recent Developments and 2015 Transactions 

Strategic Steps in the First Quarter of 2016 

On January 28, 2016, we announced a reduction in the quarterly distribution for the fourth quarter of 2015 on all outstanding common units to $0.4625 . This distribution represented a decrease of 33.7% from the distribution of $0.6975 per unit paid in November 2015 and a decrease of 30.5% from the distribution of $0.6650 per unit paid in February 2015. The reduction in the distribution primarily reflect ed continuing weakness in the crude oil market. &#160; 

During this period of headwinds in the crude oil market, we intend to capitalize on the flexibility of our Oregon facility and take steps to utilize this location for ethanol transloading. This measure is substantially related to cleaning of tanks and associated infrastructure and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2016. 

As part of expense management initiatives, we reduced our workforce by approximately 70 people, which equates to approximately 8% of our headcount excluding employees at our convenience stores. This reduction include d employees at our transloading facilities in Oregon and North Dakota and at our corporate offices. 

Acquisitions 

Warren Equities, Inc. &#8212;On January 7, 2015, we acquired, through GMG, 100% of the equity interests in Warren Equities, Inc. (&#8220;Warren&#8221;), one of the largest independent marketers of petroleum products in the Northeast, from The Warren Alpert Foundation. The acquisition included 147 company &#8209;owned Xtra Mart convenience stores and related fuel 

&#160;

operations , 53 commission agent locations and fuel supply rights for approximately 3 3 0 dealers. The acquired properties are located in the Northeast, Maryland and Virginia. The purchase price, inclusive of post &#8209;closing adjustments, was approximately $38 1.8 million, including working capital. This acquisition complements our existing retail presence in the Northeast and expand ed our footprint into the adjacent Mid &#8209;Atlantic region. As of the acquisition date, t hese assets added approximately 500 million gallons of fuel sold annually through our network and increased the number of our total gasoline stations that we own, lease or supply to more than 1,500. The acquisition was funded with borrowings under our credit facility and with proceeds from our public offering of 3,565,000 common units, which closed on December 10, 2014. 

Revere Terminal &#8212;On January 14, 2015, we acquired the Revere terminal (the &#8220;Revere Terminal&#8221;) located in Boston Harbor in Revere, Massachusetts from Global Petroleum Corp. (&#8220;GPC&#8221;) for a purchase price of approximately $23. 7 million . &#160; GPC is owned by the Estate of Alfred A. Slifka and Richard Slifka. The facility, which had been &#160; leased to us by GPC, has storage capacity of 2.1 million barrels of refined petroleum products, including heating oil, gasoline, distillates, diesel, kerosene and blendstocks. We financed the transaction with available capacity under our revolving credit facility. In connection with the Revere T erminal transaction, the terminal storage rental and throughput agreement between us and GPC terminated effective as of February 1, 2015. 

Capitol Petroleum Group &#8212; On June 1, 2015, we acquired &#160; 97 primarily Mobil and Exxon branded owned or leased retail gasoline stations and seven dealer supply contracts in New York City and Prince George&#8217;s County, Maryland, along with certain related supply and franchise agreements and third-party leases and other assets associated with the operations from Capitol Petroleum Group (&#8220;Capitol&#8221;) . The purchase price was approximately $155.7 million which was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 

Debt Offer ing 

On June 1, 2015 , we closed on an offering of $ 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.00 % notes due 202 3 (the &#8220; 7.00 % Notes&#8221;) in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#8220; Securities Act&#8221;). We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. On June 4, 2015 , we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the 7.00 % Notes, pursuant to which we agreed to file and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement relating to an offer to exchange the 7.00 % Notes for an issue of SEC - registered notes with terms identical to the 7.00 % Notes. The exchange offer was completed on October &#160; 22 , 2015, and 100% of the 7.00% Notes have been exchanged for SEC registered notes. &#160; Please read Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations&#8212;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; for additional information. 

Equity Offering 

On June &#160; 16, 2015 , we completed a public offering of 3, 000 ,000 common units at a price to the public of $ 38.12 per common unit. Net proceeds from the offering were approximately $ 109.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. We used the net proceeds from the offering to reduce indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. 

At-the-Market Offering Program 

On May 19, 2015, we entered into an e quity d istribution a greement pursuant to which we may sell from time to time through our sales agents, our common units having an aggregate offering price of up to $50.0 million. Sales of the common units, if any, will be made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an &#8220;at-the-market&#8221; offering, including ordinary brokers&#8217; transactions through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange, to or through a market maker or directly on or through an electronic communication network, a &#8220;dark pool&#8221; or any similar market venue, at market prices, in block transactions, or as otherwise agreed upon by us and one or more of our sales agents. &#160; We may also sell common units to one or more of our sales agents as principal for our own account at a price to be agreed upon at the time of sale. Any sale of common units to a sales agent as principal would be pursuant to the terms of a separate agreement between us and such sales agent . 

&#160;

We intend to use the net proceeds from any sales pursuant to the &#160; at &#8209; the &#8209; market offering program , after deducting the sales agents&#8217; commissions and our offering expenses, for general partnership purposes, which may include, among other things, repayment of indebtedness, acquisitions and capital expenditures. &#160; As of December 3 1 , 2015 , no common units were sold by us pursuant to the &#160; at &#8209;the &#8209;market offering program . 

Operating Segments 

We purchase refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil, natural gas and propane primarily from domestic and foreign refiners and ethanol producers, crude oil producers , major and independent oil companies and trading companies. We operate our business under three segments: (i) Wholesale, (ii) GDSO and (iii) Commercial. In 2015, our Wholesale, GDSO and Commercial sales accounted for approximately 57 %, 36 % and 7 % of our total sales, respectively. 

Wholesale 

In our Wholesale segment, we engage in the logistics of selling, gathering, storage and transportation of refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane. We sell branded and unbranded gasoline and gasoline blendstocks and diesel to wholesale distributors . &#160; We transport these products by railcars, barges and/or pipelines pursuant to spot or long &#8209;term contract s . We aggregate crude oil by truck or pipeline in the mid &#8209;continent region of the United States and Canada, transport it by train and ship it by barge to refiners on the East and West Coasts. We sell home heating oil, diesel, kerosene, residual oil and propane to home heating oil and propane retailers and wholesale distributors. Generally, customers use their own vehicles or contract carriers to take delivery of the gasoline and distillate s at bulk terminals and inland storage facilities that we own or control or at which we have throughput or exchange arrangements. Ethanol is shipped primarily by rail and by barge. 

Gasoline Distribution and Station Operations 

In our GDSO segment, gasoline distribution includes sales of branded and unbranded gasoline to gasoline stat ion operators and sub-jobbers. Station operations include (i) &#160; convenience stores , &#160; (ii) &#160; rental income from gasoline stations leased to dealers , from commissioned agents and from cobranding arrangements and (iii) &#160; sundries ( such as car wash sales, lottery and ATM commissions). The results of Warren and Capitol are included in the GDSO segment. 

As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio of owned, leased and/or supplied gasoline stations, primarily in the Northeast, consisted of the following:

Commercial 

In our Commercial segment, we include sales and deliveries to end user customers in the public sector and to large commercial and industrial end users of unbranded gasoline, home heating oil, diesel, kerosene, residual oil, bunker fuel and natural gas. In the case of public sector commercial and industrial end user customers, we sell products primarily either through a competitive bidding process or through contracts of various terms. We generally arrange for the delivery of the product to the customer&#8217;s designated location, and we respond to publicly &#160; issued requests for product proposals and quotes. Our Commercial segment also includes sales of custom blended fuels delivered by barges or from a terminal dock to ships through bunkering activity.

Gasoline. We sell all grades of branded and unbranded gasoline, and we sell gasoline blendstocks, such as ethanol, that comply with seasonal and geographical requirements in the areas in which we market. In 2015, we sold unbranded gasoline and diesel, including our propriet ar y premium brand, Diesel One &#174; . 

Crude Oil. We engage in the purchasing, selling , storing and logistics of transporting domestic and Canadian crude oil and other products via rail and barge, establishing a &#8220;virtual pipeline&#8221; from the mid &#8209;continent region of the United States and Canada to the East and West Coasts for distribution to refiners and other customers. 

Distillates. Distillates are primarily divided into home heating oil, diesel and kerosene. In 2015, sales of home heating oil, diesel and kerosene accounted for approximately 5 4 %, 44 % and 2 %, respectively, of our total volume of distillates sold. The distillates we sell are used primarily for fuel for trucks and off &#8209;road construction equipment and for space heating of residential and commercial buildings. 

We sell generic home heating oil and Heating Oil Plus&#8482;, our proprietary premium branded heating oil. Heating Oil Plus&#8482; is electronically blended at the delivery facility. In 2015, approximately 10 % of the volume of home heating oil we sold to wholesale distributors was Heating Oil Plus&#8482;. In addition, we sell the additive used to create Heating Oil Plus&#8482; to some wholesale distributors, make injection systems available to them and provide technical support to assist them with blending. We also educate the sales force of our customers to better prepare them for marketing our products to their customers. 

In 2015, we sold home heating oil, including Heating Oil Plus&#8482;, to approximately 830 wholesale distributors and retailers. We have a fixed price sales program that we market primarily to wholesale distributors and retailers which uses the New York Mercantile Exchange (&#8220;NYMEX&#8221;) heating oil contract as the pricing benchmark and as the vehicle to manage the commodity risk. Please read &#8220;&#8212;Commodity Risk Management.&#8221; In 2015, approximately 33 % of our home heating oil volume was sold using forward fixed price contracts. A forward fixed price contract requires our customer to purchase a specific volume at a specific price during a specific period. The remaining home heating oil volume was sold on either a posted price or a price based on various indices which, in both instances, reflect current market conditions. 

We sell generic diesel and Diesel One &#174; , our proprietary premium diesel fuel product. We offer marketing and technical support for those customers who purchase Diesel One &#174; . 

Residual Oil. We supply oil to industrial, commercial and marine customers. We specially blend product for users in accordance with their individual power specifications and for marine transport. 

Natural Gas. We supply natural gas to industrial and commercial customers. 

Propane. We sell propane to home heating oil and propane retailers and wholesale distributors primarily from our rail &#8209;fed propane storage and distribution facility near our other terminal in Albany, New York. 

&#160;

Convenience Store Items and Sundries . We sell a broad selection of food, beverages, snacks, grocery and non &#8209;food merchandise at our convenience store locations and generate sundry sales from car wash sales, lottery and ATM commissions at our convenience store locations . 

Significant Customers 

None of our customers accounted for greater than 10% of total sales for year ended December 31, 2015. We had one significant customer, ExxonMobil Corporation (&#8220;ExxonMobil&#8221;), that accounted for approximately 17% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 and two significant customers, ExxonMobil and Phillips 66 who accounted for approximately 15% and 12%, respectively, of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. 

Assets 

Terminals 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned, leased or maintained dedicated storage facilities at 25 bulk terminals, each with the capacity of more than 50,000 barrels, with a collective storage capacity of 1 2.2 million barrels. Twenty &#8209;two of these bulk terminals are located throughout the Northeast. Some of our storage tankage is versatile, allowing us to switch tankage from one product to another. 

In addition to refined products, we also own or operate four rail facilities in New York, Oregon and North Dakota capable of handling crude oil or ethanol and maintain dedicated storage at one other marine terminal in New York capable of handling crude oil. At select locations, we have capacity to store renewable fuels , and in Albany, New York, we also have an additional rail &#8209;fed propane storage terminal . 

The bulk terminals and inland storage facilities from which we distribute product are supplied by ship, barge, truck, pipeline and/or rail. The inland storage facilities, which we use primarily to store distillates, are supplied with product delivered by truck from bulk terminals. Our customers receive product from our network of bulk terminals and inland storage facilities via truck, barge, rail and/or pipeline. We support our rail activity with a fleet of approximately 2,7 00 leased railcars. The makeup of this fleet is split between general &#8209;purpose cars, typically used for light crude oil, ethanol and refined products, and coiled, insulated cars typically used for heavy crude oil and residual oil. &#160; 

In connection with our business , we may lease or otherwise secure the right to use certain third - party assets (such as railcars, pipeline s and barges ) . We lease railcars through various lease arrangements with various expiration dates, and we lease barges through various time charter lease arrangement also with various expiration dates. We also have various pipeline connection agreements that extend from five to seven years beginning after the commissioning of the pipeline. Please read Note &#160; 13, &#8220;Commitments and Contingencies,&#8221; for additional information on our railcar leases, barge leases and pipeline commitments . &#160; &#160; 

Many of our bulk terminals operate 24 hours a day and consist of multiple storage tanks and automated truck loading equipment. These automated systems monitor terminal access, volumetric allocations, credit control and carrier certification through the remote identification of customers. In addition, some of the bulk terminals at which we market are equipped with truck loading racks capable of providing automated blending and additive packages which meet our customers&#8217; specific requirements. 

Throughput arrangements allow storage of product at terminals owned by others. Our customers can load product at these terminals, and we pay the owners of these terminals fees for services rendered in connection with the receipt, storage and handling of such product. Compensation to the terminal owners may be fixed or based upon the volume of our product that is delivered and sold at the terminal. 

We have exchange agreements with customers and suppliers. An exchange is a contractual agreement where the parties exchange product at their respective terminals or facilities. For example, we (or our customers) receive product that is owned by our exchange partner from such party&#8217;s facility or terminal, and we deliver the same volume of our product to such party (or to such party&#8217;s customers) out of one of the terminals in our terminal network. Generally, both 

&#160;

sides of an exchange transaction pay a handling fee (similar to a throughput fee), and often one party also pays a location differential that covers any excess transportation costs incurred by the other party in supplying product to the location at which the first party receives product. Other differentials that may occur in exchanges (and result in additional payments) include product value differentials and timing differentials. 

Gasoline Stations 

As of December 31, 2015, we had a portfolio of 1,509 owned, leased and/or supplied gasoline stations, including 281 convenience stores, primarily in the Northeast. 

At our company &#8209;operated stores, we operate the gasoline stations and convenience stores with our employees, and we set the retail price of gasoline at the station. At commission agent locations, we own the gasoline inventory, and we set the retail price of gasoline at the station and pay the commission agent a fee related to the gallons sold. We receive rental income from commission agent leased gasoline stations for the leasing of the convenience store premises , repair bays and other businesses that may be conducted by the commission agent . At dealer &#8209;leased locations, the dealer purchases gasoline from us, and the dealer sets the retail price of gasoline at the dealer&#8217;s station. We also receive rental income from dealer &#8209;leased gasoline stations and from cobranding arrangements . We also supply gasoline to independent contract dealers under agreements with the operators at these locations . Additionally, we have contractual relationships with distributors in certain New England states, pursuant to which we supply these distributors&#8217; gasoline stations with ExxonMobil &#8209;branded gasoline. 

Supply 

Our products come from some of the major energy companies in the world as well as North American crude oil producers. Products can be sourced from the United States, Canada, South America, Europe, Russia and occasionally from Asia. Most of our products are delivered by water, pipeline, rail or truck. During 2015, we purchased an average of approximately 368,000 barrels per day of refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil , natural gas and propane. We enter into supply agreements with these suppliers on a term basis or a spot basis. With respect to trade terms, our supply purchases vary depending on the particular contract from prompt payment (usually three days) to net 30 days. Please read &#8220;&#8212;Commodity Risk Management.&#8221; We obtain our convenience store inventory from traditional suppliers. 

Seasonality 

Due to the nature of our business and our reliance, in part, on consumer travel and spending patterns, we may experience more demand for gasoline during the late spring and summer months than during the fall and winter. Travel and recreational activities are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for gasoline that we distribute. Therefore, our volumes in gasoline are typically higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. As demand for some of our refined petroleum products, specifically home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes, is generally greater during the winter months, heating oil and residual oil volumes are generally higher during the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year. These factors may result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. 

Commodity Risk Management 

When we take title to the products that we sell, we are exposed to commodity risk. Commodity risk is the risk of unfavorable market fluctuations in the price of commodities such as refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil , natural gas and propane. We endeavor to minimize commodity risk in connection with our daily operations through hedging by selling exchange &#8209;traded futures contracts on regulated exchanges or using other over &#8209;the &#8209;counter derivatives, and then lift hedges as we sell the product for physical delivery to third parties. Products are generally purchased and sold at spot market prices, fixed prices or indexed prices. While we use these transactions to seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our commodity product purchase and sales activities, we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of variances in daily purchases and sales and transportation and delivery schedules as well as logistical issues inherent in the business, such as weather conditions. In 

&#160;

connection with managing these positions, we are aided by maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace. We also engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of 250,000 barrels of commodity products at any point in time. Our policy is generally to purchase only products for which we have a market and to structure our sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially affect our profit. While our policies are designed to minimize market risk, as well as inherent basis risk, exposure to fluctuations in market conditions remains. 

In addition, because a portion of our crude oil business is conducted in Canadian dollars (&#8220;CAD&#8221;), we may use foreign currency derivatives to minimize the risks of unfavorable exchange rates. These instruments may include foreign currency exchange contracts and forwards. In conjunction with entering into the commodity derivative, we enter into a foreign currency derivative to hedge the resulting foreign currency risk. These foreign currency derivatives are generally short &#8209;term in nature and not designated for hedge accounting. 

Operating results are sensitive to a number of factors. Such factors include commodity location, grades of product, individual customer demand for grades or location of product, localized market price structures, availability of transportation facilities, daily delivery volumes that vary from expected quantities and timing and costs to deliver the commodity to the customer. Basis risk is the inherent market price risk created when a commodity of a certain grade or location is purchased, sold or exchanged as compared to a purchase, sale or exchange of commodity at a different time or place, including transportation costs and timing differentials. We attempt to reduce our exposure to basis risk by grouping our purchase and sale activities by geographical region and commodity quality in order to stay balanced within such designated region. However, basis risk cannot be entirely eliminated, and basis exposure, particularly in backward markets (when prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices) or other adverse market conditions, can adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 

With respect to the pricing of commodities, we utilize exchange-traded futures contracts and other derivative instruments to minimize or hedge the impact of commodity price changes on our inventories and forward fixed price commitments. Any hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in our results of operations. We utilize regulated exchanges, including the NYMEX, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (&#8220;CME&#8221;) and the Intercontinental &#8209;Exchange (&#8220;ICE&#8221;), which are exchanges for the respective commodities that each trades, thereby reducing potential delivery and supply risks. Generally, our practice is to close all exchange positions rather than to make or receive physical deliveries. We may also enter into derivative agreements which may not have a correlated exchange contract with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit profile in order to hedge market fluctuations and/or lock &#8209;in margins relative to our commitments. 

We monitor processes and procedures to prevent unauthorized trading by our personnel and to maintain substantial balance between purchases and sales or future delivery obligations. We can provide no assurance, however, that these steps will eliminate commodity risk or detect and prevent all violations of such trading processes and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved. 

In our Wholesale segment, we obtain Renewable Identification Numbers (&#8220;RINs&#8221;) in connection with our purchase of ethanol which is used for our bulk supply requirements or for blending with gasoline through our terminal system. A RIN is a renewable identification number associated with government &#8209;mandated renewable fuel standards. To evidence that the required volume of renewable fuel is blended with gasoline and diesel motor vehicle fuels, obligated parties must retire sufficient RINs to cover their Renewable Volume Obligation (&#8220;RVO&#8221;). Our U .S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) obligations relative to renewable fuel reporting are largely limited to the foreign gasoline that we may choose to import and a small amount of blending operations at certain facilities. As a wholesaler of transportation fuels through our terminals, we separate RINs from renewable fuel through blending with gasoline and can use those separated RINs to settle our RVO. While the annual compliance period for the RVO is a calendar year and the settlement of the RVO typically occurs by March 31 of the following year, the settlement of the RVO can occur, upon certain EPA deferral actions, more than one year after the close of the compliance period. Operating results are sensitive to the timing associated with our RIN position relative to our RVO at a point in time, and we may recognize a mark &#8209;to &#8209;market liability for a shortfall in RINs at the end of each reporting period. To the extent that we do not have a sufficient number of RINs to satisfy our RVO as of the balance sheet date, we charge cost of sales for such deficiency based on the market price of the RINs as of the balance sheet date and record a liability representing our obligation to purchase RINs. 

&#160;

Competition 

In each of our operating segments, we encounter varying degrees of competition based on product and geographic locations and available logistics. Our competitors include terminal companies, major integrated oil companies and their marketing affiliates, wholesalers, producers and independent marketers of varying sizes, financial resources and experience. In our Northeast market, we compete in various product lines and for all customers. In the residual oil markets, however, where product is heated when stored and cannot be delivered long distances, we face less competition because of the strategic locations of our residual oil storage facilities. We supply oil to industrial, commercial and marine customers. We compete with other transloaders in our logistics activities including, in part, storage and transportation of crude oil , renewable fuels and gasoline and the movement of product by alternative means (e.g., pipelines). We also compete with natural gas suppliers and marketers in our home heating oil, residual oil and propane product lines. Bunkering requires facilities at ports to service vessels. In various other geographic markets, particularly with respect to unbranded gasoline and distillates markets, we compete with integrated refiners, merchant refiners and regional marketing companies. Our retail gasoline stations compete with unbranded and branded retail gas stations as well as supermarket and warehouse stores that sell gasoline. 

Employees 

To carry out our operations, our general partner and certain of our operating subsidiaries employed approximately 1,890 full &#8209;time employees as of December 31, 2015 , of which &#160; approximately 100 employees were represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements with various expiration dates. We may not be able to renegotiate the collective bargaining agreements when they expire on satisfactory terms or at all. A failure to do so may increase our costs. In addition, existing labor agreements may not prevent a future strike or work stoppage, and any work stoppage could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition . We believe we have good relations with our employees. 

We have a shared services agreement with G PC. The services provided among these entities by any employees shared pursuant to these agreements do not limit the ability of such employees to provide all services necessary to properly run our business. Please read Item 13, &#8220;Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence&#8212;Shared Services Agreements.&#8221; 

Title to Pr operties, Permits and Licenses 

We believe we have all of the assets needed, including leases, permits and licenses, to operate our business in all material respects. With respect to any consents, permits or authorizations that have not been obtained, we believe that the failure to obtain these consents, permits or authorizations will have no material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 

We believe we have satisfactory title to all of our assets. Title to property, including certain sites within our GDSO segment, may be subject to encumbrances, including repurchase rights and use, operating and environmental covenants and restrictions. We believe that none of these encumbrances will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest in these properties, nor will they materially interfere with the use of these properties in the operation of our business.

Environmental 

General 

Our business of supplying refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane involves a number of activities that are subject to extensive and stringent environmental laws. As part of our business, we own and operate various petroleum storage and distribution facilities and gasoline stations and must comply with environmental laws at the federal, state and local levels, which increases the cost of operating terminals and gasoline stations and our business generally. In addition, these laws are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations. 

Our operations also utilize a number of petroleum storage facilities and distribution facilities, including rail transloading facilities and gasoline stations that we do not own or operate, but at which refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane are stored. We utilize these facilities through several different contractual arrangements, including leases and throughput and terminalling services agreements. If facilities with which we contract that are owned and operated by third parties fail to comply with environmental laws, they could be shut down, requiring us to incur costs to use alternative facilities. 

Environmental laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as: 

&#183; 

requiring remedial action to mitigate releases of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes caused by our operations or attributable to former operators; 

&#183; 

requiring capital expenditures to comply with environmental control requirements; and 

&#183; 

enjoining the operations of facilities deemed in noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations. 

Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or wastes have been released or disposed of. Moreover, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or other wastes into the environment. 

Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for our operations under applicable environmental laws and regulations. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures and policies for compliance with permits, laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of noncompliance or permit interpretation is inherent in the operation of our business, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. 

The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment over time. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and minimize the costs of such compliance. 

We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our 

&#160;

unitholders. We can provide no assurance, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws), the promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs or will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 

For additional information concerning certain environmental proceedings, please read Item &#160; 3. &#8220;Legal Proceedings.&#8221; 

Hazardous Material Releases and Waste Handling 

In most instances, the environmental laws and regulations affecting our business relate to the release of hazardous substances into the water or soils and include measures to control pollution of the environment. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances. Under the Superfund law, these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. The Superfund law also authorizes the EPA, and in some instances third parties, to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and seek to recover from the responsible persons the costs they incur. It is possible for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. In the course of our ordinary operations, we may generate, store or otherwise handle materials and wastes that fall within the Superfund law&#8217;s definition of a hazardous substance and, as a result, we may be jointly and severally liable under the Superfund law for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which those hazardous substances have been released into the environment. 

We currently own, lease or utilize storage or distribution facilities and gasoline stations where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where we have contractual arrangements or where these wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under our control. These properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the Superfund law or other federal and state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators, clean up contaminated property, including groundwater contaminated by prior owners or operators , or make capital improvements to prevent future contamination. 

Our operations generate a variety of wastes, including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) and comparable state laws. By way of summary, these regulations impose detailed requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. Our operations also generate solid wastes which are regulated under state law or the less stringent solid waste requirements of the federal Solid Waste Disposal Act. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the existing requirements of RCRA, the Solid Waste Disposal Act and similar state and local laws, and the cost involved in complying with these requirements is not material. 

We incur ongoing costs for monitoring groundwater and/or remediation of contamination at several facilities that we operate. Assuming that we will be able to continue to use common remedial and monitoring methods or associated engineering or institutional controls to demonstrate compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, as we have in the past and regulations currently allow, we believe that these costs will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 

&#160;

Above Ground Storage Tanks 

Above ground tanks that contain petroleum and other hazardous substances are subject to comprehensive regulation under environmental laws. Generally, these laws impose liability for releases and require secondary containment systems for tanks or that the operators take alternative precautions to ensure that no contamination results from tank leaks or spills. We believe we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations applicable to above ground storage tanks. 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA&#8221;) addresses three principal areas of oil pollution&#8212;prevention, containment and cleanup. In order to handle, store or transport various petroleum products and renewable fuels at our terminals, we are required to file spill response plans with either the U .S. Coast Guard (for marine facilities) and/or the EPA. Many of the states in which we operate have enacted laws similar to OPA. Under OPA and comparable state laws, responsible parties for a regulated facility from which oil products so regulated are discharged may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for removal costs and certain other consequences of an oil spill such as natural resource damages, where the spill is into navigable waters or along shorelines. We believe we are in substantial compliance with regulations pursuant to OPA and similar state laws. We follow the American Petroleum Institute&#8217;s inspection, maintenance and repair standard applicable to our above ground storage tanks. 

Under the authority of the federal Clean Water Act, the EPA imposes specific requirements for Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure plans that are designed to prevent, and minimize the impacts of, releases of oil and other products from above ground storage tanks. We believe we are in substantial compliance with these requirements. 

Underground Storage Tanks 

We are required to make financial expenditures to comply with regulations governing underground storage tanks (&#8220;UST s &#8221;) which store gasoline or other regulated substances adopted by federal, state and local regulatory agencies. Pursuant to RCRA, the EPA has established a comprehensive regulatory program for the detection, prevention, investigation and cleanup of leaking USTs . State or local agencies are often delegated the responsibility for implementing the federal program or developing and implementing equivalent or stricter state or local regulations. We have a comprehensive program in place for performing routine tank testing and other compliance activities which are intended to promptly detect and investigate any potential releases. In addition, the Clean Air Act (the &#8220; CAA &#8221;) and similar state laws impose requirements on emissions to the air from motor fueling activities in certain areas of the country, including those that do not meet state or national ambient air quality standards. These laws may require the installation of vapor recovery systems to control emissions of volatile organic compounds to the air during the motor fueling process. We believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements, including those applicable to our USTs . Compliance with existing and future environmental laws regulating UST systems of the kind we use may require significant capital expenditures in the future. These expenditures may include upgrades, modifications, and the replacement of USTs and related piping to comply with current and future regulatory requirements designed to ensure the detection, prevention, investigation and remediation of leaks and spills. 

Water Discharges 

The federal Clean Water Act imposes restrictions regarding the discharge of pollutants, including oil and refined petroleum products, renewable fuels and crude oil, into navigable waters. This law and comparable state laws may require permits for discharging pollutants into state and federal waters and impose substantial liabilities and remedial obligations for noncompliance. The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers (&#8220;Corps&#8221;) released a rule to revise the definition of &#8220;waters of the United States&#8221; (&#8220;WOTUS&#8221;) for all Clean Water Act programs, which went into effect in August 2015. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has stayed the WOTUS rule nationwide pending further action of the court. In response to this decision, the EPA and the Corps resumed nationwide use of the agencies&#8217; prior regulations defining the term &#8220;waters of the United States.&#8221; Those regulations will be implemented as they were prior to the effective date of the new WOTUS rule. The WOTUS rule could significantly expand federal control of land and water resources across the U nited S tates , triggering substantial additional permitting and regulatory requirements. If the WOTUS rule survives judicial review in its current form, it could restrict exploration and production efforts by producers 

&#160;

whose crude oil and other materials we transport. That restriction of supply could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders . 

EPA regulations also may require us to obtain permits to discharge certain storm water runoff. Storm water discharge permits also may be required by certain states in which we operate. We believe that we hold the required permits and operate in material compliance with those permits. While we have experienced permit discharge exceedences at some of our terminals, we do not expect any noncompliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 

Air Emissions 

Under the federal CAA and comparable state and local laws, permits are typically required to emit regulated air pollutants into the atmosphere above certain thresholds . We believe that we currently hold or have applied for all necessary air permits and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable air laws and regulations. Although we can give no assurances, we are aware of no changes to air quality regulations that will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 

Various federal, state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe product quality specifications for the petroleum products and renewable fuels that we sell, largely in an effort to reduce air pollution. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in substantial penalties. Although we can give no assurances, we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with these regulations. 

Changes in product quality specifications could require us to incur additional handling costs or reduce our throughput volume. For instance, different product specifications for different markets could require the construction of additional storage. Also, states in which we operate have considered limiting the sulfur content of home heating oil. If such regulations are enacted, this could restrict the supply of available heating oil, which could increase our costs to purchase such oil or limit our ability to sell heating oil. 

In November 2015, the EPA also revised the existing National Ambient Air Quality Standards (&#8220;NAAQS&#8221;) for ground &#8209;level ozone, which made the standard more stringent. Nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds are recognized as pre &#8209;cursors of ozone, and emissions of those materials are associated with mobile sources and the petroleum industry. The EPA has not yet designated which areas of the country are out of attainment with the new ground level ozone standard, and it will take the states several years to develop compliance plans for their non &#8209; attainment areas. Several states have filed legal challenges to the new standard. If these challenges are unsuccessful, certain areas of the country previously in compliance with the various NAAQS, including areas where we operate, may be reclassified as non &#8209; attainment. Such reclassification may make it more difficult to construct new or modified sources of air pollution in newly designated non &#8209; attainment areas, or subject our existing operations to additional permitting requirements. While we are not able to determine the extent to which this new standard will impact our business at this time, it does have the potential to have a material impact on our operations and cost &#8209;structure. 

Climate Change 

Federal climate change legislation in the United States appears unlikely in the near &#8209; term. As a result, domestic efforts to curb greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions continue be led by the EPA GHG regulations and the efforts of states. To the extent that our operations are subject to the EPA&#8217;s GHG regulations, we may face increased capital and operating costs associated with new or expanded facilities. Significant expansions of our existing facilities or construction of new facilities may be subject to the CAA Prevention of Significant Deterioration requirements under the EPA&#8217;s GHG &#8220;Tailoring Rule.&#8221; Some of our facilities are also subject to the EPA&#8217;s Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases rule, and any further regulation may increase our operational costs. 

Under a consent decree with states and environmental groups, the EPA is due to propose new source performance standards for GHG emissions from refineries. These standards could significantly increase the costs of constructing or adding capacity to refineries and may ultimately increase the costs or decrease the supply of refined 

&#160;

products. Either of these events could have an adverse effect on our business. Likewise, in September 2015, the EPA proposed New Source Performance Standards for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from certain activities in the oil and gas sector, as well as a new definition of oil and gas sources, and new draft control guidance for reducing volatile organic compound emissions from existing oil and gas sources in certain ozone non &#8209; attainment areas. If the rules are adopted as proposed, these rules could impose new compliance costs and permitting burdens on oil and gas operations, which could in turn affect the companies that produce the crude oil that we transport . Currently, however, it is not possible to estimate the likely financial impact of potential future regulation on any of our sites. 

Under Subpart MM of the Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule (&#8220;MRR&#8221;), importers of petroleum products, including distillates, must report the GHG emissions that would result from the complete combustion of all imported products if such combustion would result in the emission of at least 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year. We currently report under Subpart MM because of the volume of petroleum products we typically import. Compliance with the MRR does not substantially impact our operations. However, any change in regulations based on GHG emissions reported in compliance with MRR may limit our ability to import petroleum products or increase our costs to import such products. 

In August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan (&#8220;CPP&#8221;) rules that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants. Though the plan does not regulate hydraulic fracturing operations, it sets a national carbon pollution standard that is projected to cut emissions produced by U .S. power plants. The EPA expects each state to develop implementation plans for power plants in its state to meet the individual state targets established in the CPP, and has also proposed a federal compliance plan to implement the CPP in the event that approvable state plans are not submitted. Judicial challenges have been be filed, which seek a stay of the implementation of the rules. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the implementation of the CPP before the U . S . Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (&#8220;Circuit C ourt&#8221;) even issued a decision. By its terms, this stay will remain in effect throughout the pendency of the appeals process including at the Circuit Court and the Supreme Court through any certiorari petition that may be granted. The stay suspends the rule, including the requirement that states submit their in itial plans by September 2016. The Supreme Court&#8217;s stay applies only to EPA&#8217;s regulations for CO 2 emissions from existing power plants and will not affect EPA&#8217;s standards for ne w power plants. It is not yet clear how the either the Circuit Court or the Supreme Court will rule on the legality of the CPP. 

Overall, there has been a trend towards increased regulation of GHGs and initiatives, both domestically and internationally, to limit GHG emissions. Future efforts to limit emissions associated with transportation fuels and heating fuels could reduce the market for, or pricing of , our products, and thus adversely impact our business. In addition, i t should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations. 

Convenience Store Regulations 

Our convenience store operations are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations that include legal restrictions on the sale of alcohol, tobacco and lottery products, food safety and health requirements and public accessibility, as well as sanitation, safety and fire standards. State and local regulatory agencies have the authority to approve, revoke, suspend or deny applications for, and renewals of, permits and licenses. Our operations are also subject to federal and state laws governing matters such as wage rates, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. At the federal level, there are proposals under consideration from time to time to increase minimum wage rates and to introduce a system of mandated health insurance, each of which could adversely affect our results of operations. In June 2009, Congress gave the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) broad authority to regulate tobacco products through passage of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (&#8220;FSPTCA&#8221;). Under the FSPTCA, the FDA has passed regulations that, among other things, prohibit the sale of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to anyone under the age of 18 years (state laws are permitted to set a higher minimum age); prohibit the sale of single cigarettes or packs with less than 20 cigarettes; and prohibit the sale or distribution of non &#8209;tobacco items such as hats and t &#8209;shirts with tobacco brands, names or logos. Governmental actions and regulations, such as these, could materially 

&#160;

impact our retail price of cigarettes, cigarette unit volume and revenues, merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

Ethanol Market 

The market for ethanol is dependent on several economic incentives and regulatory mandates for blending ethanol into gasoline, including the availability of federal tax incentives, ethanol use mandates and oxygenate blending requirements. For instance, the Renewable Fuels Standard (&#8220;RFS&#8221;) requires that a certain amount of renewable fuels, such as ethanol, be utilized in transportation fuels, including gasoline, in the United States each year. Additionally, the EPA imposes oxygenate blending requirements for reformulated gasoline that are best met with ethanol blending. Gasoline marketers may also choose to discretionally blend ethanol into conventional gasoline for economic reasons. A change or waiver of the RFS mandate or the reformulated gasoline oxygenate blending requirements could adversely affect the availability and pricing of ethanol. Any change in the RFS mandate could also result in reduced discretionary blending of ethanol into conventional gasoline. Discretionary blending is when gasoline blenders use ethanol to reduce the cost of blended gasoline. 

In October 2010 and January 2011, the EPA granted two partial waivers that taken together allow but do not require the introduction into commerce of gasoline that contains greater than 10 volume percent (&#8220;vol%&#8221;) ethanol and up to 15 vol% ethanol (&#8220;E15&#8221;) for use in model year 2001 and newer light &#8209;duty motor vehicles, subject to certain conditions. E15 is not widely available in the United States and requires gasoline stations install &#8220;blender pumps&#8221; in order to sell E15 along with more conventional fuels such as E10 or E0. The USDA is providing financial assistance to help implement more &#8220;blender pumps&#8221; in the United States in order to increase the availability of E15 and to help offset the cost of introducing mid &#8209;level ethanol blends into the U.S. retail gasoline market. However, blender pumps cost approximately $20,000 each, so it may take time before they become widely available in the retail gasoline market. Additionally, according to EPA estimates, E85 flex &#8209;fuel vehicles make up only a small percentage of vehicles on the nation&#8217;s roads and, as of January 2016, there were approximately 2,990 E85 stations in the United States . 

Environmental Insurance 

We maintain insurance which may cover, in whole or in part, certain costs relating to the clean up of releases of the products we store, sell and/or ship . We maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles as we believe are reasonable and prudent. These policies may not cover all environmental risks and costs and may not provide sufficient coverage in the event an environmental claim is made against us. 

Security Regulation 

Since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, the U.S. government has issued warnings that energy infrastructure assets may be future targets of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected our operations to increased risks. Increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business. Where required by federal or local laws, we have prepared security plans for the storage and distribution facilities we operate. Terrorist attacks aimed at our facilities and any global and domestic economic repercussions from terrorist activities could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders. For instance, terrorist activity could lead to increased volatility in prices for home heating oil, gasoline and other products we sell. 

Insurance carriers are currently required to offer coverage for terrorist activities as a result of the federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (&#8220;TRIA&#8221;). We purchased this coverage with respect to our property and casualty insurance programs, which resulted in additional insurance premiums. Pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015, TRIA has been extended through December 31, 2020. Although we cannot determine the future availability and cost of insurance coverage for terrorist acts, we do not expect the availability and cost of such insurance to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders. 

&#160;

Hazardous Materials Transportation 

Our operations include the preparation and shipment of some hazardous materials by truck, rail and marine vessel. We are subject to regulations promulgated under the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (and subsequent amendments) and administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation under the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration, the United States Coast Guard and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. 

We conduct loading and unloading of refined petroleum products, renewable fuels, crude oil and propane to and from cargo transports, including tanker trucks, railcars and marine vessels. In large part, the cargo transports are owned and operated by third parties. However, we lease a fleet of railcars and charter barges associated with the shipment of refined petroleum products, renewable fuels and crude oil. We conduct ongoing training programs to help ensure that our operations are in compliance with applicable regulations. 

The trend in hazardous material transportation is to increase oversight and regulation of these operations. Several derailments of freight trains , including the tragic events in July 2013 in Lac M&#233;gantic and other events , have led federal and state regulators to examine whether the hazardous nature of crude oil from the Bakken Shale is being assessed properly prior to its shipment. In particular, there are concerns that the testing and ensuing designations of the crude oil on the shipping documentation do not in all cases accurately capture the flammability of the Bakken crude oil. On January 2, 2014, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (&#8220;PHMSA&#8221;) released a Safety Alert alerting regulators, emergency responders, transporters and shippers that crude oil from the Bakken Shale may have flammability characteristics that are different from other forms of crude oil and that it was vital that all shipments of crude oil be tested and properly characterized on all shipping documentation. The Safety Alert also notified the regulated community that PHMSA and the Federal Railroad Administration have launched &#8220;Operation Classification,&#8221; which is an ongoing enforcement initiative that involves unannounced inspections on crude oil shipments to test the contents of the shipments in order to ensure that they are properly characterized. In August 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation released a report finding that, based on the results of Operation Classification from August 2013 to May 2014, Bakken crude oil tends to be more volatile and flammable than other crude oils, and thus poses an increased risk for a significant accident. In April 2015, PHMSA and the Federal Railroad Administration (&#8220;FRA&#8221;) issued a number of additional safety advisories related to the operation of trains containing hazardous materials and flammable liquid. 

In addition, these events have also spurred efforts to improve the safety of tank cars that are used in transporting crude oil by rail. Since 2011, all new railroad tank cars that have been built to transport crude oil or other petroleum type fluids (e.g., ethanol) have been built to more stringent safety standards. In May 2015 , PHMSA issued a &#160; final rule that includes , among other things, additional requirements to enhance tank car standards for certain trains carrying crude oil and ethanol, a classification and testing program for crude oil, and a requirement that older DOT &#8209;111 tank cars be phase d out by as early as October 1, 2017 if they are not retrofitted to comply with new tank car design standards. The rule also includes a new braking standard for certain trains, designates new operational protocols for trains transporting large volumes of flammable liquids, such as routing requirements, speed restrictions and information for local government agencies, and provides new sampling and testing requirements to improve classification of energy products placed into transport. In addition, the FRA issued a notice and comment request in April 2015 providing notice that the agency wishes to collect more specific information concerning railcars carrying petroleum crude oil in any train involved in a reportable accident. 

In addition to action taken or proposed by federal agencies, some members of Congress have called for additional legislation regarding railcars carrying crude oil. In 2015, Congress has introduced several bills to place new emergency response and safety requirements on crude oil by rail operations. To date, none of these bills has been enacted into law. Likewise, a number of states proposed or enacted laws in 2015 that encourage safer rail operations or urge the federal government to strengthen requirements for these operations. The new PHMSA rule, and other potential future statutes or regulatory initiatives, may drive up the cost of transport and lead to shortages in availability of tank cars. We cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with standards and regulations emerging from these rulemaking s will not be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any such requirements would apply to the industry as a whole. 

&#160;

Efforts are likewise underway in Canada to assess and address risks from the transport of crude oil by rail. Shortly after the Lac M&#233;gantic tragedy, Transport Canada issued a series of emergency directives aimed at certain practices that were identified immediately after the accident. Likewise, Transport Canada is assessing the compensation and liability scheme for shipments by rail so that sufficient funds are available to compensate victims and respond to the incident without making taxpayers fund any aspect of those efforts. In January 2014, the Canadian Transportation Safety Board made several recommendations to Transport Canada regarding tank car safety, routing of freight trains and the capabilities of emergency responders. In April 2014, Transport Canada issued a protective order prohibiting oil shippers from using 5,000 of the DOT &#8209;111 tank cars and imposing a three &#8209;year phase &#8209;out period for approximately 65,000 tank cars that do not meet certain safety requirements. Transport Canada also imposed a 50 mile &#8209;per &#8209;hour speed limit on trains carrying hazardous materials and required all crude oil shipments in Canada to have an emergency response plan. At the same time that PHMSA released its new rule, Canada&#8217;s Minister of Transport announced Canada&#8217;s new tank car standards, which largely align with the requirements in the PHMSA rule. 

We believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable hazardous materials transportation requirements related to our operations. We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local hazardous materials transportation regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders. We can provide no assurance, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws (including changes in the interpretation of existing laws), the promulgation of new laws and regulations, including any voluntary measures by the rail industry, that result in new requirements for the design, construction or operation of tank cars used to transport crude oil, or, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. 

Employee Safety 

We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA&#8217;s hazard communication standards require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the applicable OSHA requirements .
