Business 

Introduction 

On January 16, 2013, we completed the sale of our III-V product line, including all of the outstanding equity interest in KTC Wireless, LLC (KTC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to IQE KC, LLC (IQE) and IQE plc (Parent, and collectively with IQE, the Buyer). Upon agreement of the final working capital and other adjustments the net purchase price was $70.2 million, and the gain on the sale, net of tax, was $20.1 million. Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the final $15 million of the purchase price was paid on January 16, 2016. We have revised the prior period amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the impact of the sale of the III-V product line, which is reflected as discontinued operations. 

We were incorporated in Delaware in 1984 and are a leading inventor, developer, manufacturer and seller of Wearable technologies which include components and systems. 

The components that we offered for sale in 2015 consisted of our proprietary miniature active-matrix liquid crystal displays (AMLCD), liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS) displays, application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), backlights and optical lenses. In 2016, we also anticipate offering our proprietary noise cancellation chip which we refer to as &#8220;Whisper&#8482; Chip". Our transmissive AMLCDs and reflective LCOS micro-displays are manufactured by us in our facilities in Westborough Massachusetts, USA and Dalgety Bay, Scotland, U.K, respectively, provide either color or monochrome images and are offered in a variety of sizes and resolutions. The ASICs we offer are designed by us and are the electronic interfaces between our displays and the product into which the displays are incorporated. The optical lenses and backlights we offer are based on either our proprietary designs or designs we license from third parties. Our licensed optical lenses are subject to agreements that have termination dates and are therefore subject to renewals. Our Whisper Chip was developed internally. The ASICs, optical lenses, and backlights are manufactured by third parties based on our purchased orders. The Whisper Chip is planned to be manufactured by third parties based on our purchase orders. 

Our components are sold separately or in various configurations. For example, we offer a display module which includes an optical lens and backlight contained in either plastic or metal housings, a binocular display module which has two displays, lenses and backlight or a higher-level assembly which has additional components for military applications. Current products which include our components are augmented reality consumer wearable devices for sports and fitness, virtual reality consumer products such as First Person Viewers for recreational drones, consumer devices such as digital cameras; military soldier devices, such as thermal weapon sights, military pilot devices such as integrated flight helmets, and devices that are capable of accessing the Internet or digital storage devices for viewing data or video. When our reflective display products are configured as spatial light modulators, the applications include industrial equipment for 3D Automated Optical Inspection. We have sold our AMLCD products to Rockwell Collins, Elbit, Raytheon Company, DRS RSTA Inc., BAE Systems (directly and through a third party QiOptiq), and ITT for use in military applications, to Google for consumer wearable products, and to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), and Olympus Corporation (Olympus) for digital still cameras. 

We have designed and offer systems that are focused on the emerging enterprise and consumer markets for head-worn, hands-free voice and gesture controlled wireless computing and communication devices. Our systems connect via Bluetooth or WiFi to a smartphone or similar device in order to access or transmit information from or to the internet or devices that are in close proximity. A unique feature of these systems is the ability to contact a resource, referred to as the &#8220;Remote Expert&#8221;, who can help in solving problems. The system user and the Remote Expert can be in different locations so while the system user may be in a hazardous outside location the Remote Expert may be in an in-house location. This allows companies that purchase enterprise systems the ability to leverage their in-house experts to the system technicians in the field. We currently license our systems under agreements which include a royalty to us and a purchase and supply agreement which requires our customer to buy our components for the system. These systems include our components and a variety of commercially available software packages and our proprietary software. Our business model is to license our concept systems to branded OEM customers who 

wish to develop and market head-worn products for both mobile enterprise and consumer applications. We have licensed our wearable systems to Motorola Inc. and Fujitsu Limited for enterprise wearable systems. 

In 2016, we anticipate offering Solos&#8482;, an augmented wearable headset designed for the consumer fitness market. Solos contains our display, optic, ASIC and Whisper Chip technologies. Solos is a hands-free head worn device which allows the user to access information either from the internet through a smartphone or from the various Bluetooth, WiFi or ANT+ enabled devices. For example, a cyclist user can see the information being provided by the bike computer such as speed or watts, can access the internet for GPS location or can access an internet training application.

Industry Overview 

Wearable Computing/Communicating 

The amount of data being created is increasing at a historic rate. Billions of dollars worth of wireless devices, mainly smart phones and tablets, are sold annually to communicate, input, store and retrieve this data via the Internet. In addition thousands of software applications, &#8220;Apps&#8221;, are available which enable users to access this data to enable them to perform functions, play games, or improve the quality of their life such as setting-up personal wellness programs. A new category of &#8220;wearable&#8221; products, Smart Headsets, is emerging that provides access to data and these Apps, through the use of voice activate hands-free technology. This emerging category of Wearable systems can be used for hundreds of different applications by both enterprise workers and consumers, bringing ever-increasing productivity, fun and convenience. Through the use of Smart Headsets both workers and consumers can have access to their digital files, the Internet, phone, e-mail etc., enabling an &#8220;always connected&#8221; work-style and lifestyle. We believe that advances in wearables will continue to make the &#8220;always connected&#8221; life increasingly convenient and more productive by providing easier access to and control of the information accessible through our electronic devices. 

Wearable products also include body-worn devices such as sensors, scanners and terminals which are sold to enterprise markets to improve worker productivity and the consumer market to monitor health and fitness metrics such as heart rate, speed and temperature. The user interface for these devices is typically either a key pad or a touch screen. Some Wearable products include voice recognition software as an additional feature to allow the user to navigate the device&#8217;s interface &#8220;hands-free&#8221; instead of using a traditional mouse, touch screen or keypad. We believe wireless smartphone makers are looking to create products that work as a complement to the smartphone or to eventually replace the smartphone with more convenient configurations. Wireless network companies are encouraging the development of more products that utilize their network capacity and other companies are developing products which provide continuous access to social media outlets. In order for the markets for these new products to develop, further advances in the devices and application software will be required. Device improvements include smaller higher resolution displays, lower power processors, longer-life batteries, compact optics and software including voice recognition and noise cancellation. In order for the market for these devices to grow, application software must be developed that exploit their new features and functions. 

Our Solution 

Kopin Wearable Technology 

Kopin Wearable technology includes component technologies which can be integrated to create products and proprietary headset systems which use voice as the primary user interface and through the use of wireless technologies can contact other users, devices in close proximity or information from the cloud. 

Components 

The components we offer for sale primarily consist of our displays, backlights, ASICs and optical lenses. In 2016, we also anticipate offering our proprietary noise cancellation chip which we refer to as &#8220;Whisper Chip&#8221;. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; Display Products 

&#32;&#32;&#32;Small form factor displays are used in military, consumer, electronic and industrial products such as thermal weapon sights, digital cameras, virtual and augmented reality gaming, training and simulation products and metrology tools. We expect the market for wireless communications devices, including personal entertainment systems, will continue to grow. In order for these markets to develop, advances and investment in application software, optics and wireless communications systems with greater bandwidth and increased functionality will be necessary. We believe small form factor displays will be a critical component in the development of these markets as these systems must provide high resolution images without compromising the portability of the product. 

There are several display technologies commercially available including transmissive, reflective and emissive. The most commonly used technology in portable applications is based on the traditional liquid crystal display, or LCD, which is now in widespread use. These displays form an image by either transmitting or reflecting light emitted from a source located either behind or in front of the LCD. The principal LCD technologies are passive and active matrix. 

&#8226; 

Passive Matrix Liquid Crystal Display. These displays are primarily used in calculators, simple watches and wireless handsets because of their relatively low cost and low power consumption. Their relatively low image quality, slow response time and limited viewing angle, however, make them inadequate for many demanding applications. 

&#8226; 

Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Display. These displays are used primarily in wireless handsets, headsets, tablets, laptop computers, televisions and projection systems. In contrast to passive matrix LCDs, color active matrix LCDs incorporate transistors at every pixel location. This arrangement allows each sub-pixel to be turned on and off independently which improves image quality and response time and also provides an improved side-to-side viewing angle of the display. 

Our principal display products are miniature high density color or monochrome Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Displays (AMLCDs) with resolutions which range from approximately 320 x 240 resolution to 2048 x 2048 resolution sold in either a transmissive or reflective format. We sell our displays individually or in combination with our other components assembled in a unit. For example we sell a module unit which includes a single display, backlight and optics in a plastic housing, a binocular display module unit which includes two displays, backlights and optics in a plastic housing or in a Higher-Level Assembly (HLA) which contains a display, light emitting diode based illumination, optics, and electronics in a sealed housing, primarily for military applications. 

Our transmissive display products, which we refer to as CyberDisplay&#8482; products, utilize high quality, single crystal silicon-the same high quality silicon used in conventional integrated circuits. This single crystal silicon is not grown on glass; rather, it is first formed on a silicon wafer and patterned into an integrated circuit (including the active matrix, driver circuitry and other logic circuits) in an integrated circuit foundry. The silicon wafer is then sent to our facilities and the integrated circuit is lifted off as a thin film and transferred to glass using our proprietary Wafer&#8482; Engineering technology, so that the transferred layer is a fully functional active matrix integrated circuit which now resides on a transparent substrate. 

Our proprietary technology enables the production of transparent circuits on a transparent substrate, in contrast to conventional silicon circuits, which are on an opaque substrate. Our CyberDisplay products' imaging properties are a result of the inclusion of a liquid crystal layer between the active matrix integrated circuit glass and the transparent cover glass. We believe our manufacturing process offers several advantages over conventional active matrix LCD manufacturing approaches with regard to small form factor displays, including: 

&#8226; 

Greater miniaturization; 

&#8226; 

Higher pixel density; 

&#8226; 

Full color capability; and 

&#8226; 

Lower power consumption. 

Our use of high quality single crystal silicon in the manufacture of our CyberDisplay products offers several performance advantages. The color CyberDisplay products we sell generate colors by using color filters with a white backlight. Color filter technology is a process in which display pixels are patterned with materials, which selectively absorb or transmit the red, green or blue colors of light. 

Our CyberDisplay displays have the additional advantage of being fabricated using conventional silicon integrated circuit lithography processes. These processes enable the manufacture of miniature active matrix circuits, resulting in comparable or higher resolution displays relative to passive and other active matrix displays that are fabricated on glass. Our foundry partners fabricate integrated circuits for our CyberDisplay displays in their foundries in Taiwan and Korea. The fabricated wafers are then returned to our facilities, where we lift the integrated circuits off the silicon wafers and transfer them to glass using our proprietary technology. The transferred integrated circuits are then processed, packaged with liquid crystal and assembled into display panels at our Display Manufacturing Center in Westborough, Massachusetts. 

For military applications which use our CyberDisplay, the display is fabricated, tested and incorporated into a HLA. We offer a variety of models with varying levels of complexity but common to all is our display, illuminations source, optics and electronics in a sealed unit. 

Our reflective LCOS displays products are miniature high density dual mode color sequential/monochrome reflective micro displays with resolutions which range from approximately 1280 x 720 pixels (720P) resolution to 2048 x 1536 pixels (QXGA) resolution. These displays are manufactured at our facility in Scotland, U.K. Our reflective displays are based on a proprietary, very high-speed, ferroelectric liquid crystal on silicon (FLCOS) platform. Our digital software and logic based drive electronics combined with the very fast switching binary liquid crystal enables our micro display to process images purely digitally and create red, green and blue gray scale in the time domain. This architecture has major advantages in visual performance over other liquid crystal, organic light-emitting diode and MEMS based technologies: precisely controlled full color or monochrome gray scale is achieved on a matrix of undivided high fill factor pixels, motion artifacts are reduced to an insignificant level and there are no sub-pixels, no moving mirrors and no analog conversions to detract from the quality of the image. 

The FLCOS device is comprised of two substrates. The first is a pixelated silicon-based CMOS substrate which is manufactured by our foundry partner using conventional silicon integrated circuit lithography processes. The silicon substrate forms the display's backplane, serving as both the active matrix to drive individual pixels and as a reflective mirror. The second substrate is a front glass plate. Between the backplane and the front glass substrate is the ferroelectric liquid crystal material which, when switched, enables the incoming illumination to be modulated. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Optical Lenses and Backlights 

We offer a variety of optical lenses some of which we have developed internally and others we license the rights to sell the lenses. We also offer a variety of backlights some of which we have developed internally and are &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; components. The lenses come in a variety of sizes starting with the smallest being our Pupil lens, followed by our Pearl lenses and then our largest being our Prism lenses. The different sizes of lenses give us and our customers design flexibility when creating headset systems. There is a trade-off between the lens size and the size of the perceived image to the viewer. For example, a Pearl lens will provide the viewer with an image approximately equivalent to what the viewer would see looking at a Smart Phone, whereas as a Prism lens will provide the viewer with an image approximately equivalent to what the viewer would see looking at a tablet. However a Pearl lens is smaller than a Prism which would enable a more fashionable design. Therefore a customer designing a consumer-oriented product may choose a Pearl Lens but a customer designing an enterprise-oriented product might choose a Prism Lens. We use third parties to manufacture these lenses. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Whisper Chip 

The Whisper Chip is designed to enhance the performance of existing audio systems and speech recognition engines by allowing the speaker&#8217;s voice to be clearly &#8220;heard&#8221; by the listener, whether the &#8220;listener&#8221; is a person or a machine. The Whisper chip incorporates our Voice Extraction&#8482; Filter (VEF). VEF is a patented approach to singulating the voice signal without distorting it. The Whisper Chip is an all-digital solution that runs at 16MHz, consumes less than 12mW of power and replaces the CODEC so no ADC or DAC is needed. The Whisper Chip is 4 x 4 mm in size and accepts up to four (4) digital microphone inputs. We use third parties to manufacture the Whisper Chip. 

Headset Systems 

Our headset systems include: 

&#8226; 

Consumer-oriented headsets which resemble typical eyeglasses but include voice and audio capabilities allowing the user to communicate with other users and a Pupil display module; 

&#8226; 

Augmented reality health and fitness sunglasses, called Solos, that have voice and audio capabilities, a Pupil display module which overlays situational information on the glasses, our Whisper Chip; and 

&#8226; 

Industrial headset reference design, called Golden-i, which is essentially a complete head-worn computer that includes an optical pod with one of our display products, a microprocessor, battery, camera, memory and various commercially available software packages that we license. 

&#32;Our headsets receive or transmit data from or to the internet by interfacing with a Smartphone or similar device via WiFi or Bluetooth. They can also receive information from devices in close proximity using ANT+. The display module or optical pod allows users to view the information such as WEB data, emails, text messages, maps or biometric data (heart rate), situational data (speed, distance traveled, Watts produced) at a &#8220;normal&#8221; size because of our specialized optics. Our industrial headset Golden-i provides the capability of viewing technical diagrams, by enabling the user to zoom in to see finer details or zoom out to see a larger perspective. The Golden-i is equipped with a camera to enable a picture to be taken, video to be streamed or face-to-face communication to occur. The camera enables users to send pictures or stream live video to a remote subject matter expert so that both the user and expert can analyze an issue at the same time and collaboratively identify and implement a solution. Our headset reference designs utilize operating system software we developed. 

&#32;&#32;We believe Kopin&#8217;s wearable technology will enable easier and more convenient access to the content individuals carry in their smartphones or &#8220;in the cloud&#8221; and will be embraced by both consumers and commercial users. For commercial users, we believe increased productivity, safety and improved manufacturing quality through more efficient issue resolution and improved communication will drive adoption. Kopin Wearable reference designs are targeted for markets where the user needs a much greater range of functionality than is typically provided by wireless devices such as handsets, smart phones, tablets or Bluetooth headsets and either due to the requirements of their usage patterns, occupation, or for improved productivity the user is better served with voice recognition as the primary interface as opposed to a touch screen or keyboard. 

Strategy 

Our commercial products strategy is to invent, develop, manufacture and sell the leading-edge critical components that enable our customers to create differentiated wearable products in their respective markets and to license wearable headset computing system designs to customers who wish to offer products that enable a better &#8220;always connected&#8221; experience. The core components we offer for sale are: displays and optics, along with headset system software and compact system designs. In 2016, we anticipate also offering our noise cancellation chip, Whisper. Our military strategy is to work with primarily the U.S. military to determine their program needs several years in the future and develop products which meet those needs. Our commercial business model is to enable our customers to move into the market quickly by either licensing our system designs and entering into agreements for the purchase and sale of our components or just selling our components separately. The critical elements of our strategy include: 

&#8226; 

Broad Portfolio of Intellectual Property. &#32;&#32;We believe that our extensive portfolio of patents, trade secrets and non-patented know-how provides us with a competitive advantage in the wearable computing industry and we have been accumulating, either by internal efforts or through acquisition, a significant patent and know-how portfolio. We own, exclusively license or have the sole right to sublicense approximately 300 patents and patent applications issued and pending worldwide. An important piece of our strategy is to continue to accumulate valuable patented and non-patented technical know-how relating to our micro displays as well as other critical technologies for advanced wearable services. 

&#8226; 

Maintain Our Technological Leadership. We are a recognized leader in the design, development and manufacture of high resolution micro displays and modules which incorporate our micro displays with optics and ASICs. We plan on introducing noise canceling technology in 2016, which we anticipate marketing in our Whisper Chip. We believe our ability to develop components, software and noise canceling technology and innovative headset system designs enhances our opportunity to grow within our targeted markets. By continuing to invest in research and development, we are able to add to our expertise as a system and components supplier for our OEM customers, and we intend to continue to focus our development efforts on proprietary wearable computing systems. 

&#8226; 

Develop Headset Systems. The Wearable device market is just beginning and part of our strategy is to develop headset systems which we will either sell directly or license to our customers in order to facilitate our customers&#8217; design-in process of our components into their finished products. We believe our understanding of the needs associated with wearable headset systems and our customers&#8217; products has been an important reason we have previously been successful in developing customer relationships.. We believe our system know-how is a compelling reason customers choose us as their supplier. 

&#8226; 

Internally Manufactured Products and Use of Third Party Manufacturing. We manufacture our display products in facilities that we lease and manage. Our optical lenses, backlights and ASICs are manufactured by third parties who are only authorized to manufacture and to supply us. We plan on using third parties to manufacture and supply us with Whisper Chips. The use of these third party manufacturers reduces our investments in plant and equipment and working capital for new products and enables us to update designs as trends change. 

&#8226; 

Strong U.S. Government Program Support. &#32;&#32;We perform under research and development contracts with U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. Night Vision Laboratory and the U.S. Department of Defense. Under these contracts, the U.S. Government funds a portion of our efforts to develop next-generation micro-display related technologies. This enables us to supplement our internal research and development budget with additional funding. 

Markets and Customers 

Wearable products 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Our business model is to generate revenues by selling components to customers who develop and manufacture, or distribute, products based on our technology and licensing, for a royalty fee, our system designs and know-how, which includes the operating software and patented product designs, and to sell Solos directly. We may also receive development fees from customers to help them integrate our technology into their products. The licensing aspect of our business model is relatively new and to date the revenues have been de minimis and we anticipate offering Solos in 2016. 

Display Products 

We currently sell our display products to our customers in configurations including but not limited to as either a single display component, as a module which includes a display, lens, backlight and focus mechanism and electronics, a binocular display module which includes two displays, lenses, and backlights, and as higher level assemblies or HLA for military customers. A HLA is similar to a module but includes additional components such as an eye cup specific to a military application. 

We have sold our AMLCD products to Rockwell Collins, Elbit, Raytheon Company, DRS RSTA Inc., BAE Systems (directly and through a third party QiOptiq), and ITT for use in military applications, to Google for consumer wearable products, and to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), and Olympus Corporation (Olympus) for digital still cameras. We have licensed our wearable systems to Motorola Inc. and Fujitsu Limited for enterprise wearable systems. 

In order for our display products to function properly in their intended applications, ASICs generally are required. Several companies have designed ASICs to work with our display products and our customers can procure these chip sets directly from the manufacturer or through us. 

For fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , sales to military customers, excluding research and development contracts, as a percentage of total revenue were 32%, 45% and 38%, respectively. 

For fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , research and development revenues, primarily from multiple contracts with various U.S. governmental agencies, accounted for approximately 12%, 15% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenues. 

For additional information with respect to our operating segments including sales and geographical information, see Note 15 to our financial statements for the year ended December 26, 2015 , included with this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our strategy is to sell our components both directly and through distributors to original equipment manufacturers. We sell our military display products directly to prime contractors of the U.S. government or to foreign companies. For our component products we historically have had a few customers who purchase in large volumes and many customers who buy in small 

volumes as part of their product development efforts. &#8220;Large volume&#8221; is a relative term. For consumer display customers, purchases may be in the tens of thousands per week, whereas industrial and military customers may purchase less than a hundred per month. We plan on selling our Solos headset directly via the Internet and to license our other headset system designs to customers who will develop end user products that include our components and software. Other than Solos, our system designs are not finished products because we do not know the specific end user case that our customers are targeting. As a result there are typically additional development efforts which we work with our customers on and we may be reimbursed for these efforts. 

We believe that the technical nature of our products and markets demands a commitment to close relationships with our customers. Our sales and marketing staff, assisted by our technical staff and senior management, visit prospective and existing customers worldwide on a regular basis. We believe these contacts are vital to the development of a close, long-term working relationship with our customers, and in obtaining regular forecasts, market updates and information regarding technical and market trends. We also participate in industry specific trade shows and conferences. 

Our design and engineering staff are actively involved with customers during all phases of prototype design through production by providing engineering data, up-to-date product application notes, regular follow-up and technical assistance. In most cases, our technical staff work with each customer in the development stage to identify potential improvements to the design of the customer's product in parallel with the customer's effort. We have established a prototype product design group in Scotts Valley, California to assist our military product customers and in Santa Clara, California to assist our Whisper Chip product customers. These groups assist customers with incorporating our technologies and products into our customer's products and to accelerate the design process, achieving cost-effective and manufacturable products, and ensuring a smooth transition into high volume production. Our group in Scotts Valley is also actively involved with research and development contracts for military applications. 

Product Development 

We believe that continued introduction of new products in our target markets is essential to our growth. Our commercial products tend to have one to three year life cycles. We have assembled a group of highly skilled engineers who work internally as well as with our customers to continue our product development efforts. Our primary development efforts are focused on displays, noise cancellation, optics and headset system designs. For fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;we incurred total research and development expenses of $17.6 million, $20.7 million and $17.5 million, respectively. 

Component Products 

Our display product development efforts are focused towards continually enhancing the resolution, performance and manufacturability of our display products. A principal focus of this effort is the improvement of manufacturing processes for very small active matrix pixels with our eight-inch manufacturing line. The pixel size of our current transmissive display products ranges from 6.8 to 15 microns. These pixel sizes are much smaller than a pixel size of approximately 100 microns in a typical laptop computer display. The resolutions of our current commercially available display products are 320 x 240, 432 x 240, 640x360, 640 x 480, 854 x 480, 800 x 600, 1,280 x 720 and 1,280 x 1,024. In addition, we have demonstrated 2,048 x 2,048 resolution displays in a 0.96-inch diagonal size. We are also working on further decreasing the power consumption of our display products. The pixel size of our current reflective display products ranges from 8.2 to 13.6 microns. The resolutions of our current commercially available reflective display products are 1,280 x 768, 1,280 x 1,024 and 2,048 x 1,536 pixels. Additional display development efforts include expanding the resolutions offered, increasing the quantity of display active matrix pixel arrays processed on each wafer by further reducing the display size, increasing the light throughput of our pixels, increasing manufacturing yields, and increasing the functionality of our HLA products. 

We offer components such as our optical lenses, backlights and ASICs, which we have manufactured to our specifications, that we buy and resell. The components which are made to order include either intellectual property we developed or licensed from third parties. 

Headset System Design Products 

Our headset system efforts are primarily focused on operating and application software development, improving the optics in the display pod and reducing the size and power consumption of the unit and improving the overall fit and style of the system. 

Funded Research and Development 

We have entered into various development contracts with agencies and prime contractors of the U.S. government and commercial customers. These contracts help support the continued development of our core technologies. We intend to continue to pursue development contracts for applications that relate to our commercial and military product applications. Our contracts contain certain milestones relating to technology development and may be terminated prior to completion of funding. Our policy is to retain our proprietary rights with respect to the principal commercial applications of our technology however we are not always able to retain our proprietary rights. To the extent technology development has been funded by a U.S. federal agency, under applicable U.S. federal laws the federal agency has the right to obtain a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, fully paid license to practice or have practiced this technology for governmental use. For our commercial development agreements customers often obtain exclusive rights to a particular display or technology that is developed either permanently or for some period of time. Revenues attributable to research and development contracts for fiscal years 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;totaled $3.9 million, $4.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively. 

Competition 

Component Products 

The commercial display market is highly competitive and is currently dominated by large Asian-based electronics companies including AUO, Himax, LG Display, Samsung, Sharp, Seiko and Sony. The display market consists of multiple segments, each focusing on different end-user applications applying different technologies. Competition in the display field is based on price and performance characteristics, product quality and the ability to deliver products in a timely fashion. The success of our display product offerings will also depend upon the adoption of our display products by consumers as an alternative to traditional active matrix LCDs and upon our ability to compete against other types of well-established display products and new emerging display products. Particularly significant is the consumer's willingness to use a near eye display device, as opposed to a direct view display which may be viewed from a distance of several inches to several feet. We cannot be certain that we will be able to compete against these companies and technologies, or that the consumer will accept the use of such eyewear in general or our partners' form factor specifically. 

There are also a number of active matrix LCD and alternative display technologies in development and production. These technologies include plasma, organic light emitting diode (OLEDs) and virtual retinal displays, some of which target the high performance small form factor display markets in which our military display products are sold. There are many large and small companies that manufacture or have in development products based on these technologies. Our display products will compete with other displays utilizing these and other competing display technologies. 

&#32;&#32;There are many companies whose sole business is the development and manufacture of optical lenses, backlights, ASICs and software. These companies may have significantly more intellectual property and experience than we do in the design and development of these components. We do not manufacture optical lenses, backlights, or ASICs but we either have them made to our specifications or buy standard off-the-shelf products. 

Headset Concept Design Products 

The markets for our headset systems are targeted at currently used smartphones, laptop computers, personal computers, tablets, ruggedized portable computers referred to as "tough books&#8221;, and a variety of hand-held devices. This market is extremely competitive and is served by companies such as Panasonic, Toshiba, Dell, HTC, Hewlett Packard, Apple, Sony and Samsung. These companies are substantially larger than Kopin from revenue, cash flow and asset perspectives. 

Patents, Proprietary Rights and Licenses 

An important part of our product development strategy is to seek, when appropriate, protection for our products and proprietary technology through the use of various United States and foreign patents and contractual arrangements. We intend to prosecute and defend our proprietary technology aggressively. Many of our United States patents and applications have counterpart foreign patents, foreign applications or international applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty. In addition, we have licensed United States patents and some foreign counterparts to these United States patents from MIT. 

The process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and we cannot be certain that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications or that our existing patents or any new patents that may be issued will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. We may be subject to or may initiate contested patent proceedings in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, foreign patent offices or the courts, which can demand significant financial and management resources. Patent applications in the United States typically are 

maintained in secrecy until they are published about eighteen months after their earliest claim to priority; and since publication of discoveries in the scientific and patent literature lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions. We cannot be certain that our pending patent applications or those of our licensor's will result in issued patents or that any issued patents will afford protection against a competitor. In addition, we cannot be certain that others will not obtain patents that we would need to license, circumvent or cease manufacturing and sales of products covered by these patents, nor can we be sure that licenses, if needed, would be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. 

We cannot be certain that foreign intellectual property laws will protect our intellectual property rights or that others will not independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around any patents issued or licensed to us. Our products might infringe the patent rights of others, whether existing now or in the future. For the same reasons, the products of others could infringe our patent rights. We may be notified, from time to time, that we could be or we are infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Litigation, which could be very costly and lead to substantial diversion of our resources, even if the outcome is favorable, may be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others. These problems can be particularly severe in foreign countries. In the event of an adverse ruling in litigation against us for patent infringement, we might be required to discontinue the use of certain processes, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology or obtain licenses to patents of third parties covering the infringing technology. We cannot be certain that licenses will be obtainable on acceptable terms, if at all, or that damages for infringement will not be assessed or that litigation will not occur. The failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights or litigation arising out of any such claims could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as we presently conduct it. 

We also attempt to protect our proprietary information with contractual arrangements and under trade secret laws. We believe that our future success will depend primarily upon the technical expertise, creative skills and management abilities of our officers and key employees in addition to patent ownership. Our employees and consultants generally enter into agreements containing provisions with respect to confidentiality and employees generally assign rights to us for inventions made by them while in our employ. Agreements with consultants generally provide that rights to inventions made by them while consulting for us will be assigned to us unless the assignment of rights is prohibited by the terms of any agreements with their regular employers. Agreements with employees, consultants and collaborators contain provisions intended to further protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information. To date, we have had no experience in enforcing these agreements. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached or that we would have adequate remedies for any breaches. Our trade secrets may not be secure from discovery or independent development by competitors. 

Government Regulations 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental regulations related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process. The failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production or cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances, or otherwise comply with environmental regulations, could subject us to significant future liabilities. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have not in the past violated applicable laws or regulations, which violations could result in required remediation or other liabilities. We also cannot be certain that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will protect us from required remediation or other liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations. 

We are also subject to federal International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) laws which regulate the export of technical data and export of products to other nations which may use these products for military purposes. The failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. Any failure on our part to control the use of, or adequately restrict the discharge of, hazardous substances, or otherwise comply with environmental regulations, could subject us to significant future liabilities. Any failure on our part to obtain any required licenses for the export of technical data and/or export of our products or to otherwise comply with ITAR, could subject us to significant future liabilities. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have not in the past violated applicable laws or regulations, which violations could result in required remediation or other liabilities. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;We are also subject to federal importation laws which regulate the importation of raw materials and equipment from other nations which are used in our products. The failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, suspension of production, or a cessation of operations. 

Investments in Related Businesses 

We own 100% of the outstanding common stock of Forth Dimension Displays Ltd. (FDD) and we consolidate the financial results of FDD within our consolidated financial statements. 

&#32;In the fourth quarter of 2015 , we increased our ownership in Kopin Software Ltd. (formerly Intoware Ltd.) from 58% to 100% and acquired 17.5% of a new company by paying GBP 1 to a former employee and transferring the rights of certain software programs to the new company. The former employee is a co-founder of the new company. 

In 2015 , we entered into an agreement with the intent to purchase approximately 2% of a company for approximately $2.5 million, subject to certain government approvals and agreement on valuation. 

We had a 12% interest in KoBrite, and accounted for our ownership interest using the equity method. We recorded equity losses from our investment in KoBrite of $0.4 million and $0.6 million in fiscal years 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. During the second quarter of 2014 , we wrote off our $1.3 million investment in Kobrite. 

In 2013 , we increased our ownership of Kowon Technology Co. LTD (Kowon) from 78% to 93% by purchasing stock from the minority stockholders for $3.7 million as part of a plan to cease Kowon&#8217;s operations. We closed Kowon&#8217;s manufacturing operations in 2013 . 

In 2013 , we acquired 51% of the outstanding stock of eMDT America, Inc. (eMDT), a private company, for $0.4 million and began consolidating eMDT into our financial statements in the second quarter of that year. During the second quarter of 2014 , we paid approximately $0.3 million to acquire an additional 29% ownership in eMDT. 

We had a 23% interest in Ask Ziggy which we determined was impaired and we wrote off our investment in 2013. 

On January 16, 2013, we completed the sale of our III-V product line, including all of our interest in Kopin Taiwan Corp (KTC). Previously we owned approximately 90% of KTC and consolidated the financial statements of KTC as part of our financial statements. The Buyer renamed KTC to IQE Taiwan. One of our Directors is a chairman of IQE Taiwan and owns approximately 1% of the outstanding common stock of IQE Taiwan. 

We may from time to time make further equity investments in these and other companies engaged in certain aspects of the display, electronics, optical and software industries as part of our business strategy. In addition, the wearable computing product market is relatively new and there may be other technologies we need to invest in to enhance our product offering. These investments may not provide us with any financial return or other benefit and any losses by these companies or associated losses in our investments may negatively impact our operating results. Three of our Directors have invested in a publicly-held company in which we have invested. The investment is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at approximately $200,000. 

Employees 

As of December 26, 2015 , our consolidated business employed 175 full-time individuals and 1 part-time individual. Of these, 10 hold Ph.D. degrees in Material Science, Electrical Engineering or Physics. Our management and professional employees have significant prior experience in semiconductor materials, device transistor and display processing, manufacturing and other related technologies. However, our employees are located in the U.S., Europe and Asia and the laws regarding employee relationships are different by jurisdiction. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider relations with our employees to be good. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components 

We rely on third party independent contractors for certain integrated circuit chip sets and other critical raw materials such as special glasses, wafers and chemicals. In addition, our higher-level CyberDisplay assemblies, binocular display module, and other modules include lenses, backlights, printed circuit boards and other components that we purchase from third party suppliers. Some of these third party contractors and suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources. In addition, relative to the commercial market, the military buys a small number of units which prevents us from qualifying and buying 

components economically from multiple vendors. As a result, we are highly dependent on a select number of third party contractors and suppliers. 

In addition, we also are subject to rules promulgated by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2012 pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that require us to conduct due diligence on and disclose if we are able to determine whether certain materials (including tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, that originate from mines in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or certain adjoining countries (DRC), are used in our products. The DRC minerals report for a calendar year is due by the second quarter of the next calendar year and we are conducting appropriate diligence measures to comply with such requirements.
