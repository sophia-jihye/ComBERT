 Item 1. Business. 

Business Overview 

We store records, primarily physical records and data backup media, and provide information management services that help organizations around the world protect their information, lower storage rental costs, comply with regulations, enable corporate disaster recovery, and better use their information for business advantages, regardless of its format, location or life cycle stage. We offer comprehensive records and information management services and data management services, along with the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges such as rising storage rental costs, and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. Founded in an underground facility near Hudson, New York in 1951, Iron Mountain Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, has more than 170,000 customers in a variety of industries in 37 countries around the world. We currently provide storage and information management services to legal, financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, businesses services and government organizations, including approximately 94% of the Fortune 1000. As of December 31, 2015, we employed more than 20,000 people. 

Now in our 65th year, we have experienced tremendous growth, particularly since successfully completing the initial public offering of our common stock in February 1996, at which time we operated fewer than 85 facilities (6 million square feet) with limited storage and information management service offerings and annual revenues of approximately $104.0 million. We are now a global enterprise providing storage and a broad range of related records and information management services to customers in markets around the world with approximately 1,100 facilities (69.9 million square feet) and total revenues of more than $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015. We are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). We are a constituent of the Standard &#38; Poor's 500 Index and the MSCI REIT index and, as of December 31, 2015, we were number 726 on the Fortune 1000. 

REIT Conversion 

Consistent with our commitment to delivering stockholder value, and supported by our strong cash flows, we initiated a stockholder payout program in February 2010 and a dividend policy under which we have paid, and in the future intend to pay, cash dividends on our common stock. In June 2012, we announced our intention to pursue REIT conversion. The conversion plan was unanimously approved by our board of directors following a thorough analysis and careful consideration of ways to maximize value through alternative financing, capital and tax strategies. We have been organized and operating as a REIT effective for our taxable year beginning January 1, 2014. Since May 2012, we have returned $2.5 billion of capital to stockholders including $1.4 billion in cash and $1.1 billion in our common stock. 

In connection with our conversion to a REIT and, in particular, to impose ownership limitations customary for REITs, on January 20, 2015, we completed the merger with our predecessor and all outstanding shares of our predecessor's common stock were converted into a right to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock. Accordingly, references herein to our "common stock" refer to our common stock and the common stock of our predecessor, as applicable. 

Proposed Recall Acquisition 

On June 8, 2015, we entered into the Recall Agreement with Recall to acquire Recall by way of recommended court approved Scheme of Arrangement (the "Scheme"). The Recall Transaction, if consummated, would accelerate our already successful growth strategy. The combined company&#8217;s broader footprint, stronger infrastructure, exposure to high growth emerging markets and small to mid-size enterprise customers and increased economies of scale will be well suited to address unmet document storage and information management needs around the globe. Completion of the Scheme is subject to customary closing conditions, as described more fully in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 6 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. 

The Durability of Our Business 

A significant amount of activity generated in the information management industry is the result of legislative requirements. To varying degrees across the world, organizations are required by law to create certain records and to retain them for a specified period of time. These laws may also impose more stringent requirements on personal information regarded as being sensitive, such as financial and medical information. As a third party provider, we assist customers to improve data security and establish programs to ensure compliance with their regulatory obligations. Storage of information can be performed in-house by businesses (unvended) or outsourced, in whole or in part, to a third party provider (vended). We believe the in-house portion still represents a majority of the total global information management market, offering a substantial unvended opportunity even in developed geographic markets with lower rates of economic growth. 

We believe that the creation of document-based information will be sustained, as "paperless" technologies have prompted the creation of hard copies and have also led to increased demand for electronic records services, such as the storage and off-site rotation of computer backup media. In addition, we believe that the proliferation of digital information technologies and distributed data networks has created a growing need for efficient, cost-effective, high quality technology solutions for electronic data protection and the management of electronic documents. Ultimately, we expect that the volume of stored physical and electronic records will continue to increase on a global basis for a number of reasons, including: (1) regulatory requirements; (2) concerns over possible future litigation and the resulting increases in volume and holding periods of records; (3) the continued proliferation of data processing technologies such as personal computers and networks; (4) inexpensive document producing technologies such as desktop publishing software and desktop printing; (5) the high cost of reviewing records and deciding whether to retain or destroy them; (6) the failure of many entities to adopt or follow policies on records destruction; and (7) the need to keep backup copies of certain records in off-site locations for business continuity purposes in the event of disaster. 

Business Strategy 

Overview 

We have transitioned from a growth strategy driven primarily by acquisitions of storage and information management services companies to a strategy that targets multiple sources of revenue growth. Our current strategy is focused on: (1) increasing revenues in developed markets such as the United States, Canada, Australia and western Europe, primarily through improved sales and marketing efforts and attractive fold-in acquisitions; (2) establishing and enhancing leadership positions in high-growth emerging markets such as central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region, primarily through acquisitions; and (3) continuing to identify, incubate and scale adjacent business opportunities ("ABOs") to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. In our developed markets, we expect continuous improvement initiatives will generate modest profit growth. In our existing emerging markets, we expect profits will grow as the local businesses scale, and we will look to reinvest a portion of that improvement to support the growth of these businesses. However, any increases in our international profit margins will be limited as we continue to make acquisitions in new emerging markets. 

Storage rental is the key driver of our economics and allows us to expand our relationships with our customers through value-added services that flow from storage rental. Consistent with our overall strategy, we are focused on increasing incoming volumes on a global basis. There are multiple sources of new volumes available to us, and these sources inform our growth investment strategy. Our investments in sales and marketing support sales to new customers that do not currently outsource some or all of their storage and information management needs, as well as increased volumes from existing customers. We also expect to invest in acquisitions of customer relationships and storage and information management services businesses. In our developed markets, we expect that these acquisitions will primarily be fold-in acquisitions designed to optimize the utilization of existing assets, expand our presence and better serve customers. We also expect to use acquisitions to expand our presence in attractive, higher growth emerging markets. Finally, we continue to pursue new rental streams through ABOs. 

We offer our customers an integrated value proposition by providing them with secure storage and comprehensive service offerings, including records and information management services and data management services. We have the expertise and experience to address complex storage and information management challenges, such as rising storage rental costs and increased litigation, regulatory compliance and disaster recovery requirements. Our objective is to continue to capitalize on our brand, our expertise in the storage and information management industry and our global network to enhance our customers' experience, thereby enhancing our customer retention rates and attracting new customers. Our overall growth strategy will focus on growing our business organically, making strategic customer acquisitions, pursuing acquisitions of storage and information management businesses, and developing adjacent businesses and real estate. We continue to expand our portfolio of products and services, based on our customers' evolving requirements. Adding new products and services allows us to strengthen our existing customer relationships and attract new customers in previously untapped markets. 

Growth from Existing and New Customers 

Our existing customers' storage of physical records contributes to the growth of storage rental and certain records and information management services revenues because, on average, our existing customers generate additional records at a faster rate than old records are destroyed or permanently removed. The absolute number of new document storage cartons from our existing customers has been consistent in the past four years, and we anticipate that this level will be sustained, although the rate of growth is slightly declining, given the continued growth in our total records volume. In order to maximize growth opportunities from existing customers, we seek to maintain high levels of customer retention by providing premium customer service. 

Our sales coverage model is designed to identify and capitalize on incremental revenue opportunities by strategically allocating our sales resources to our customer base and selling additional storage, records and information management services and products in new and existing markets. Our sales force is dedicated to three primary objectives: (1) establishing new customer account relationships; (2) generating additional revenue by expanding existing customer relationships globally; and (3) expanding new and existing customer relationships by effectively selling a wide array of related services and products. In order to accomplish these objectives, our sales forces draw on our United States and international marketing organizations and senior management. We have developed tailored marketing strategies to target customers in the healthcare, financial, insurance, legal, life sciences, energy, business services and federal vertical market segments. 

Growth through Acquisitions 

The storage and information management services industry is highly fragmented with thousands of competitors in North America and around the world. Between 1995 and 2004 there was significant acquisition activity in the industry. Acquisitions were a fast and efficient way to achieve scale, expand geographically and broaden service offerings. After 2004, acquisition activity was reduced as we focused on integrating these recent transactions and diversifying the business. Beginning again in 2012, we saw opportunities for attractive acquisitions in emerging markets and consolidation opportunities in more developed markets, and resumed acquisition activity. We believe this ongoing acquisition activity is due to opportunities for large providers to achieve economies of scale and meet customer demands for sophisticated, technology-based solutions. Attractive acquisition opportunities, in North America and internationally, many of which are small, continue to exist, and we expect to continue to pursue acquisition of these businesses where we believe they present good returns and good opportunities to create value for our stockholders. Lastly, we have a successful record of acquiring and integrating these businesses. 

We have acquired, and we continue to seek to acquire, storage and information management services businesses in developed markets including the United States, Canada, Australia and western Europe. Given the relatively small size of most attractive acquisition targets in these markets, future acquisitions are expected to be less significant to our overall revenue growth in these markets than in the past. Occasionally, however, we may be presented with the opportunity to acquire one of the larger businesses in these markets and will evaluate each opportunity with a focus on return on invested capital and the creation of stockholder value. Such was the case with our acquisition in October 2013 of Cornerstone Records Management, LLC and its affiliates. 

We expect to continue to make acquisitions and investments in storage and information management services businesses in targeted emerging markets outside the United States, Canada, Australia and western Europe. We have acquired and invested in, and seek to acquire and invest in, storage and information management services companies in certain countries, and, more specifically, certain markets within such countries, where we believe there is potential for significant growth. We expect that future acquisitions and investments in our emerging markets will focus primarily on expanding priority markets in central and eastern Europe, Latin America and the Asia Pacific region. 

The experience, depth and strength of local management are particularly important in our emerging market acquisition strategy. Since beginning our international expansion program in January 1999, we have, directly and through joint ventures, expanded our operations such that, as of December 31, 2015, we operated in 37 countries. These transactions have taken, and may continue to take, the form of acquisitions of an entire business or controlling or minority investments with a long-term goal of full ownership. We believe a joint venture strategy, rather than an outright acquisition, may, in certain markets, better position us to expand the existing business. The local partners benefit from our expertise in the storage and information management services industry, our multinational customer relationships, our access to capital and our technology, while we benefit from our local partners' knowledge of the market, relationships with local customers and their presence in the community. In addition to the criteria we use to evaluate developed market acquisition candidates, when looking at an emerging market acquisition we also evaluate risks uniquely associated with an international investment, including those risks described below. Our long-term goal is to acquire full ownership of each business in which we make a joint venture investment. We now own more than 98% of our international operations, measured as a percentage of consolidated revenues. 

Our international investments are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to the indigenous political, social, regulatory, tax and economic structures of other countries, as well as fluctuations in currency valuation, exchange controls, expropriation and governmental policies limiting returns to foreign investors. 

Business Characteristics. 

We generate our revenues by renting storage space to a large and diverse customer base around the globe and providing an expanding menu of related and ancillary products and services. Providing outsourced storage is the mainstay of our customer relationships and serves as the foundation for all our revenue growth. Services are a complementary part of a comprehensive records management program and consist primarily of the handling and transportation of stored records and information, shredding, the scanning, imaging and document conversion services of active and inactive records, or Document Management Solutions ("DMS"), data restoration projects, fulfillment services, consulting services, technology escrow services, product sales (including specially designed storage containers and related supplies), and recurring project revenues. Shredding consists primarily of the scheduled collection and shredding of records and documents generated by business operations and the sale of recycled paper resulting from shredding services. 

Secure Storage 

Our storage operations, our largest source of revenue, consist of providing non-dedicated storage rental space to our customers. Non-dedicated space allows our customers to increase or decrease the volume of their physical storage over the life of the contract based on their storage needs, while also reducing their risk of loss in the event of natural disaster. Given this non-dedicated space dynamic, the large portfolio of customer contracts, and the fact that no customer accounted for more than 1% of our consolidated revenues as of the year ended December 31, 2015, we assess the performance of our storage rental business predominantly by analyzing trends in segment-level storage rental volume and storage rental revenue. Additionally, our storage operations include technology escrow services. 

Records storage consists primarily of the archival storage of records for long periods of time according to applicable laws, regulations and industry best practices. The secure off-site storage of data backup media is a key component of a company's disaster recovery and business continuity programs. Storage rental charges are generally billed monthly on a per storage unit basis and include the provision of space, racking systems, computerized inventory and activity tracking, and physical security. 

Physical Records Storage 

Physical records may be broadly divided into two categories: active and inactive. Active records relate to ongoing and recently completed activities or contain information that is frequently referenced. Active records are usually stored and managed on-site by their owners to ensure ready availability. Inactive physical records are the principal focus of the storage and information management services industry and consist of those records that are not needed for immediate access but which must be retained for legal, regulatory and compliance reasons or for occasional reference in support of ongoing business operations. Inactive physical records are typically stored in cartons packed by the customer for long periods of time with limited activity. For some customers we store individual files on an open shelf basis, and these files are typically more active. 

Physical records may also include critical or irreplaceable data such as master audio and video recordings, film, fine art and other highly proprietary information, such as energy data. We continue to identify additional areas of physical storage that fit with our core competencies in security and transportation, seeking to provide enterprise storage to businesses in much the same manner that self-storage companies serve consumers. Physical records may require special facilities, either because of the data they contain or the media on which they are recorded. Accordingly, our charges for providing enhanced security and special climate-controlled environments for these vital records are higher than for typical storage rental. 

Electronic Records Storage 

Electronic records management focuses on the storage of, and related services for, computer media that is either a backup copy of recently processed data or archival in nature. Computer tapes, cartridges and disk packs are transported off-site by our courier operations on a scheduled basis to secure, climate-controlled facilities, where they are available to customers 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to facilitate data recovery in the event of a disaster. Frequently, backup tapes are rotated from our facilities back to our customers' data centers. We also manage tape library relocations and support disaster recovery testing and execution. Electronic storage consists of (i) storage of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery, including digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets, and (ii) storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients. 

We believe the issues encountered by customers trying to manage their electronic records are similar to the ones they face in their physical records management programs and consist primarily of: (1) storage capacity and the preservation of data; (2) access to and control over the data in a secure environment; and (3) the need to retain electronic records due to regulatory requirements or for litigation support. Customer needs for data backup and recovery and archiving are distinctively different. Backup data exists because of the need of many businesses to be able to recover their data in the event of a system failure, casualty loss or other disaster. It is customary (and a best practice) for data processing groups to rotate backup tapes to offsite locations on a regular basis and to store multiple copies of such information at multiple sites. We expect continued increase in demand for computer media backup, as it provides off-line storage or storage that is not connected to the Internet and provides superior protection against data breaches and hacks. In addition to the physical storage and rotation of backup data that we provide, we offer online backup services through partnerships as an alternative way for businesses to store and access data. Online backup is an Internet-based service that automatically backs up computer data from servers or directly from desktop and laptop computers over the Internet and stores it in secure data centers. 

Service Offerings 

Complementary to any records management program is the handling and transportation and the eventual destruction of records upon the expiration of retention periods. These activities are accomplished through our extensive service and courier operations. Service charges are generally assessed for each activity on a per unit basis. Courier operations consist primarily of the pickup and delivery of records upon customer request. Charges for courier services are based on urgency of delivery, volume and location and are billed monthly. As of December 31, 2015, our courier fleet consisted of approximately 3,700 owned or leased vehicles. Our other services include information destruction services (primarily secure shredding), DMS, Compliant Records Management and Consulting Services, Health Information Storage and Management Solutions, Entertainment Services, Energy Data Services, Discovery Services and other ancillary services. 

Information Destruction Services 

Our information destruction services consist primarily of physical secure shredding operations and typically include the scheduled pick-up of loose office records that customers accumulate in specially designed secure containers we provide. In addition, secure shredding is a natural extension of our hard copy records management services by completing the lifecycle of a record and involves the shredding of sensitive documents for customers that, in many cases, store their records with us. Complementary to our shredding operations is the sale of the resultant waste paper to third-party recyclers. Through a combination of plant-based shredding operations and mobile shredding units consisting of custom built trucks, we are able to offer secure shredding services to our customers throughout the United States, Canada and Latin America. 

Document Management Solutions (DMS) 

The focus of our DMS business is to develop, implement and support comprehensive storage and information management solutions for the complete lifecycle of our customers' information. We seek to develop solutions that solve our customers' document management challenges by integrating the management of physical records, document conversion and digital storage. Our DMS services complement our service offerings and enhance our existing customer relationships. We differentiate our offerings from our competitors by providing solutions that complement and expand our existing portfolio of products and services. The trend towards increased usage of Electronic Document Management ("EDM") systems represents another opportunity for us to manage active records. Our DMS services provide the bridge between customers' physical documents and their EDM solutions. 

Industry Tailored Services 

We offer records and information management services that have been tailored for specific industries, such as healthcare, or to address the needs of customers with more specific requirements based on the critical nature of their records. For example, medical records tend to be more active in nature and are typically stored on specialized open shelving systems that provide easier access to individual files. In addition to storing medical records, we provide health care information services, which include the handling, filing, processing and retrieval of medical records used by hospitals, private practitioners and other medical institutions, as well as recurring project work and ancillary services. 

Other Ancillary Services 

Other services we provide include recurring project work, which involves the on-site removal of aged patient files and related computerized file indexing. Ancillary healthcare information services include release of information (medical record copying and delivery), temporary staffing, contract coding, facilities management and imaging. We offer a variety of additional services which customers may request or contract for on an individual basis. These services include conducting records inventories, packing records into cartons or other containers, and creating computerized indices of files and individual documents. We also provide services for the management of active records programs. We can provide these services, which generally include document and file processing and storage, both offsite at our own facilities and by supplying our own personnel to perform management functions on-site at a customer's premises. Other services that we provide include fulfillment and professional consulting services. 

Business Segments 

Our North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business, Western European Business and our Other International Business segments offer storage and the information management services discussed above, in their respective geographies. The amount of revenues derived from our North American Records and Information Management Business, North American Data Management Business, Western European Business, Other International Business and Corporate and Other Business segments and other relevant data, including financial information about geographic areas and product and service lines, for fiscal years 2013, 2014 and 2015 are set forth in Note 9 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. 

North American Records and Information Management Business 

Our North American Records and Information Management Business segment provides storage and information management services, including the storage of physical records, including other media such as microfilm and microfiche, master audio and videotapes, film, X-rays and blueprints, including healthcare information services, vital records services, service and courier operations, and the collection, handling and disposal of sensitive documents for corporate customers (&#8220;Records Management&#8221;); information destruction services (&#8220;Destruction&#8221;); and DMS throughout the United States and Canada; as well as fulfillment services and intellectual property management in the United States. 

North American Data Management Business 

Our North American Data Management Business segment provides storage and rotation of backup computer media as part of corporate disaster recovery plans, including service and courier operations (&#8220;Data Protection &#38; Recovery&#8221;); server and computer backup services; digital content repository systems to house, distribute, and archive key media assets; and storage, safeguarding and electronic or physical delivery of physical media of all types, primarily for entertainment and media industry clients throughout the United States and Canada. 

Western European Business 

Our Western European Business segment provides storage and information management services, including Records Management, Data Protection &#38; Recovery and DMS throughout the United Kingdom, Ireland, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. Until December 2014, our Western European Business segment offered Destruction in the United Kingdom and Ireland. 

Other International Business 

Our Other International Business segment provides storage and information management services throughout the remaining European countries in which we operate, Latin America and Asia Pacific, including Records Management, Data Protection &#38; Recovery and DMS. Our European operations included within the Other International Business segment provide Records Management, Data Protection &#38; Recovery and DMS. Our Latin America operations provide Records Management, Data Protection &#38; Recovery, Destruction and DMS throughout Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Our Asia Pacific operations provide Records Management, Data Protection &#38; Recovery and DMS throughout Australia, with Records Management and Data Protection &#38; Recovery also provided in certain cities in India, Singapore, Hong Kong&#8209;SAR and China. Until December 2014, our Other International Business segment offered Destruction in Australia. 

Corporate and Other Business 

Our Corporate and Other Business segment primarily consists of our data center and fine art storage businesses in the United States, the primary product offerings of our Adjacent Business operating segment (which was formerly referred to as our Emerging Business operating segment), as well as costs related to executive and staff functions, including finance, human resources and information technology, which benefit the enterprise as a whole. These costs are primarily related to the general management of these functions on a corporate level and the design and development of programs, policies and procedures that are then implemented in the individual segments, with each segment bearing its own cost of implementation. Our Corporate and Other Business segment also includes stock-based employee compensation expense associated with all stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and shares of stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan. 

ABOs, such as our data center and fine art storage businesses, are prospective business lines that we consider investing in to grow and diversify our business. We are seeking businesses with long-term, recurring revenue, preferably with storage rental attributes, which are consistent with and will enhance our REIT structure. A dedicated team is focused on identifying and evaluating these opportunities. We have developed an innovation process that enables us to cautiously and effectively develop these ABOs to leverage our capabilities. If we are able to demonstrate success and meet return thresholds, we may potentially acquire businesses to further accelerate our growth in the relevant ABO. Importantly, the ABO process includes financial hurdles and decision gates to help us evaluate whether we scale or scrap these opportunities, consistent with our disciplined approach to capital allocation. 

With respect to our data center business, we believe that the growth rate of critical digital information is accelerating, driven in part by the use of the Internet as a distribution and transaction medium. The rising cost and increasing importance of storing and managing digital information, coupled with the increasing availability of telecommunications bandwidth at lower costs, may create meaningful opportunities for us to provide solutions to our customers with respect to their digital records storage and management challenges. 

A more recent example of an ABO is our fine art storage business. On December 1, 2015 we completed the acquisition of Crozier Fine Arts ("Crozier"), a storage, logistics and transportation business for high-value paintings, photographs and other types of art belonging to individual collectors, galleries and art museums. Crozier is a leader in art storage and an industry advocate for worldwide standards. This acquisition will build on our expertise in storing, protecting and managing high-value items and supports our strategy to leverage our real estate network to accelerate growth. The fine art storage industry is a growing, but fragmented, industry marked by increasing international interest and changes in acquisition and purchasing habits by collectors and museums. The increase in contemporary art as a focus for collectors has caused a spike in storage needs, while the increase in auction &#8220;turnover&#8221; &#8211; the rate at which catalogs, collections and individual pieces are made available for auction &#8211; has heightened the need for transportation, shipping, and related services. Taken together, we believe these factors have the fine art storage industry poised for significant growth. 

Our Business Fundamentals 

Our business fundamentals are based on the recurring nature of our various revenue streams. We generate attractive returns from our differentiated storage rental business model because our occupancy costs, whether in a leased or owned building, are incurred per square foot while our storage revenue is generally earned per cubic foot. The historical predictability of our revenues and the resulting profitability allows us to operate with a high degree of financial leverage. Our business fundamentals consist of: 

&#8226; 

Recurring Revenues. We derive a majority of our consolidated revenues from fixed periodic, usually monthly, storage rental fees charged to customers based on the volume of their records stored. Once a customer places physical records in storage with us, and until those records are destroyed or permanently removed (for which we typically receive a service fee), we receive recurring payments for storage rental without incurring additional labor or marketing expenses or significant capital costs. Similarly, contracts for the storage of electronic backup media involve primarily fixed monthly rental payments. This stable and growing storage rental revenue base also provides the foundation for increases in service revenues and profitability. 

A customer is allocated a certain amount of storage space in our storage facilities but is not allocated a dedicated building or space in a particular building. In practice, we can, and sometimes will, for a variety of reasons, move records from one facility and into another facility. In order to track net move-in and move-out activity of customer materials, as well as to assess the optimization of our real estate portfolio, we regularly assess the utilization of our overall real estate portfolio. On a per building basis, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to store customer materials to the capacity of the entire building assuming it was fully racked ("Total Building Utilization"). Additionally, we compare the amount of racking that is being used to store customer materials to the capacity of the racking that has been installed ("Total Racking Utilization"). As of December 31, 2015, our Total Building Utilization and Total Racking Utilization were approximately 84% and 92%, respectively, for our records management business and our Total Building Utilization and Total Racking Utilization were approximately 69% and 81%, respectively, for our data management business. 

We occasionally offer inducements to our customers in order to generate new business opportunities. Such inducements most commonly come in the form of providing free intake costs to transport a customer's records to one of our facilities, including labor and transportation costs ("Move Costs"), or payments that are made to a customer's current records management vendor in order to terminate the customer's existing contract with that vendor ("Permanent Withdrawal Fees"). We capitalize Move Costs and Permanent Withdrawal Fees (collectively, "Customer Inducements") as customer acquisition costs. 

&#8226; 

Historically Non-Cyclical Storage Rental Business. Historically, we have not experienced significant reductions in our storage rental business as a result of economic downturns. We believe the durability of our storage rental business is driven by a number of factors, including the trend toward increased records retention, albeit at a lower rate of growth, as well as customer satisfaction with our services and contractual net price increases. The absolute number of new document storage cartons from our existing customers has been consistent in the past four years, and we anticipate this level will be sustained, although the rate of growth is slightly declining, given the continued growth in the total records volume. Total net volume growth, including acquisitions, was approximately 6%, 4% and 2% on a global basis for 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. 

&#8226; 

Diversified and Stable Customer Base. As of December 31, 2015, we had more than 170,000 customers in a variety of industries in 37 countries around the world. We currently provide storage and information management services to legal, financial, healthcare, insurance, life sciences, energy, businesses services and government organizations, including approximately 94% of the Fortune 1000. No single customer accounted for as much as 1% of our consolidated revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015. For each of the three years 2013 through 2015, the average annual volume reduction due to customers terminating their relationship with us was approximately 2%. 

&#8226; 

Capital Allocation. All the characteristics of our business noted above support the durability of our cash flows, which in turn support our dividends and a portion of our investments. Absent a large acquisition or significant investments in real estate, we generally generate cash flows to support our dividends, maintain our operations and infrastructure and invest in core growth opportunities. We plan on funding acquisitions, ABO investments and real estate investments primarily through incremental borrowing at a targeted leverage ratio and/or proceeds from the issuance of equity, dependent on market conditions. Below are descriptions of the major types of investments and other capital expenditures that we have made in recent years or that we are likely to consider in 2016: 

Real Estate: 

&#8226; 

Assets that support core business growth &#32; primarily related to investments in land, buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures that expand our revenue capacity in existing or new geographies, replace a long-term operational obligation or create operational efficiencies, or Real Estate Investment. 

&#8226; 

Real estate assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations primarily related to the repair or replacement of real estate assets such as buildings, building improvements, leasehold improvements and racking structures, or Real Estate Maintenance. 

Non-Real Estate: 

&#8226; 

Non-real estate assets that either (i) support the growth of our business, and/or increase our profitability, such as customer-inventory technology systems, and technology service storage and processing capacity, or (ii) are directly related to the development of new products or services in support of our integrated value proposition and enhance our leadership position in the industry, including items such as increased feature functionality, security upgrades or system enhancements, or Non-Real Estate Investment. 

&#8226; 

Assets necessary to maintain ongoing business operations primarily related to the repair or replacement of customer-facing assets such as containers and shred bins, warehouse equipment, fixtures, computer hardware, or third-party or internally-developed software assets. This category also includes operational support initiatives such as sales and marketing and information technology projects to support infrastructure requirements, or Non-Real Estate Maintenance.

Competition 

We are a global leader in the physical storage and information management services industry with operations in 37 countries as of December 31, 2015. We compete with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities. 

We also compete with numerous storage and information management services providers in every geographic area where we operate. The physical storage and information management services industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of competitors in North America and around the world. We believe that competition for customers is based on price, reputation for reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology, and we believe we generally compete effectively in each of these areas. 

Alternative Technologies 

We derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of physical records and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. Alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than physical documents and tapes, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage related services may decline as the physical records or tapes we store become less active and more archived. To date, none of the alternative technologies has replaced physical documents as the primary means for storing information. We continue to provide, primarily through partnerships, additional services such as online backup, designed to address our customers' need for efficient, cost-effective, high-quality solutions for electronic records and storage and information management. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed more than 8,000 employees in the United States and more than 12,000 employees outside of the United States. At December 31, 2015, fewer than 650 employees were represented by unions in California, Illinois, Georgia and three provinces in Canada. 

All union and non-union employees are generally eligible to participate in our benefit programs, which include medical, dental, life, short and long-term disability, retirement/401(k) and accidental death and dismemberment plans. Certain unionized employees in California receive these types of benefits through their unions and are not eligible to participate in our benefit programs. In addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, all full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits, collections or attainment of specified objectives for the unit in which they work. Management believes that we have good relationships with our employees and unions. All union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement. 

Insurance 

For strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. Property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. Other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include medical, workers' compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors' and officers' liability policies. 

Our customer contracts usually contain provisions limiting our liability for damages with respect to loss or destruction of, or damage to, records or information stored with us. Our liability under physical storage contracts is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage, such as per cubic foot. Our liability under our DMS services and other service contracts is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract. We can provide no assurance that where we have limitation of liability provisions that they will be enforceable in all instances or would otherwise protect us from liability. Also, some of our contracts with large volume accounts and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. In addition to provisions limiting our liability, our standard storage rental and service contracts include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and service pricing and service delivery terms. Our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. While we have had relatively few disputes with our customers with regard to the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, we can give no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. 

Environmental Matters 

Some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances, this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an in-depth environmental review of all of our properties. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today. 

We transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs.
