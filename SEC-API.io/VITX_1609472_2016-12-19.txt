 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

GH Capital Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;), a Florida corporation, has developed an online payment gateway called &#8220;ClickDirectPay&#8221; to process online wire transfer transactions for diversified online merchants with a target market in Europe. We were incorporated on May 5, 2014 in the State of Florida. On November 12, 2015, we filed a certificate of amendment with the State of Florida to change our name from Global Humax Capital Management, Inc. to GH Capital Inc. 

&#160; 

Our service enables web-based merchants to accept ClickDirectPay online, which is available at https://www.clickdirectpay.com . More specifically, we will focus on establishing ClickDirectPay as a cost-effective alternative to current payment gateway systems used throughout Europe. Our service will assist online merchants to increase profits by reducing existing processing costs. Currently, customers and users throughout Europe (including Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy, Greece, and the Netherlands) prefer to pay bills with an online wire transfer instead of paying with credit cards or Paypal. We believe our ClickDirectPay payment gateway will meet the needs of the European online marketplace. 

&#160; 

We were formed to discover and promote new technologies in the financial industry, but our only product or service is currently ClickDirectPay. We will offer our service to potentially high-risk, niche markets. These markets include e-commerce, gaming, adult entertainment, and digital goods. Furthermore, we will market our service to large acquiring and issuing banks, as well as financial institutions in Europe, to provide our service to their clients. 

&#160; 

ClickDirectPay is a real-time, online payment method that offers customers a convenient way to make a payment through their bank's online banking system through online ordering processes. The online merchant receives real-time confirmation of payment through ClickDirectPay, facilitating the direct delivery of the service, good or digital content. 

&#160; 

ClickDirectPay is a merchant payment portal that allows customers to make payments directly into the merchant (retailer) bank account. ClickDirectPay allows the merchant to make and track payments in real time. ClickDirectPay is based in, and developed for, the security standards of German online banking. ClickDirectPay meets the most current security protocols for online transactions. Customer details are encrypted and transactions data is &#8220;tokenized,&#8221; meaning that the customer&#8217;s sensitive data is substituted with a non-sensitive equivalent. ClickDirectPay is cloud-based and is fully hosted on Amazon Cloud, which is Payment Card Industry Security Standard (PCI compliant). 

&#160; 

We hope that our unique ClickDirectpay software in combination with a discounted processing fee structure will attract more merchants. ClickDirectPay intends on marketing its platform to editors and freelance writers associated with large financial European newspapers and online press, however there is no guarantee that traction will occur. 

&#160; 

Going Concern 

&#160; 

These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in our financial statements, we had net losses of $142,463 and $61,144 for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net cash used in operations were $69,559 and $11,056 for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, we had an accumulated deficit of $280,057 at September 30, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are in the process in building our customer base and expect to generate increased revenues and we are seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund its operations in the future. Management cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. Although we have historically raised capital from sales of common stock, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that we will need to curtail our operations. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Software Development Costs 

&#160; 

We entered into a relationship with a third party development company to develop a web-based application in Java/J2EE to develop the application. We committed to pay cash of $67,000 in development fees for the completion of the product of which approximately $39,500 was paid as of September 30, 2016. In July 2015, we issued 70,000 shares of common stock valued at $.16 per common share or $11,200 to this third party development company as part of a product development agreement. The shares were valued at the most recent cash price paid per share. In connection with these shares, we recorded capitalized development costs of $11,200. Additionally, on January 7, 2016, we issued an additional 70,000 shares of common stock valued at $.18 per common share or $12,600 to this third party development company as part of a product development agreement. The shares were valued at the most recent cash price paid per share. In connection with the issuance of these shares, we recorded capitalized development costs of $12,600. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

ClickDirectPay began Beta testing of the system on May 6, 2016. ClickDirectPay is no longer in the Beta stage and was made available to the public in May 2016. 

&#160; 

Marketing 

&#160; 

We market our ClickDirectPay online payment gateway service through a large network of existing resellers and free-lancers from the payment industry in Germany, Austria and Spain. We are not actively marketing our services using any direct marketing campaigns. We have marketed our services primarily through word-of-mouth. 

&#160; 

We are focusing on expanding our offering within Europe by seeking out banks and financial institutions in other European countries in need of our service offering. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our competitors in the online payment industry are numerous in Europe. Our competitors include financial institutions and well-established payment processing companies. In Europe, specifically in Germany, we face competition from both SOFORT GmbH and GIROPAY SOLUTIONS GmbH. We also face competition from PayPal. Our primary competitor is SOFORT and they offer a nearly identical service that we intend on offering. However, we intend on providing the service at reduced costs in the hopes that merchants will prefer our service. 

&#160; 

We also face competition from Giropay Solutions which has a minimal market share of online payment transactions compared to SOFORT GmbH and is only able to process transactions through a smaller percentage of banks in Germany. We also face competition from PayPal in Europe. 

&#160; 

In Europe, financial institutions remain the primary providers of merchant acquiring payment services to merchants, although the outsourcing of these services to third-party service providers is becoming more prevalent. Merchant acquiring payment services have become increasingly complex, requiring significant capital commitments to develop, maintain and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at competitive prices. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We are not aware of any existing governmental regulations that would have a material effect on our business at this time. However, on August 10, 2015, the European Parliament issued a revised directive (the &#8220;Directive&#8221;) on Payment Services, which will not become effective until 1) it is adopted by the EU Council of Ministers, 2) it is published in the Official Journal of the EU, and 3) the EU Member States will have two years to introduce the necessary changes in their national laws to comply with the new rules. Under the Directive, the Company is deemed to be a &#8220;payment initiation service&#8221; and may become subject to rules regarding confidentiality, liability and security on consumer transactions. However, none of these has taken place yet. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We currently have no employees, aside from the Company&#8217;s CEO and Director, Wolfgang Ruecker and our COO, Secretary and Director Carl Podeyn.
