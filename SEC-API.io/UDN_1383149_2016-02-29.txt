 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

Introduction On October 24, 2014, DB Commodity Services LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (&#147;DBCS&#148;), DB U.S. Financial Markets Holding Corporation (&#147;DBUSH&#148;) and Invesco PowerShares Capital Management LLC (&#147;Invesco&#148;) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;). DBCS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of DBUSH. DBCS agreed to transfer and sell to Invesco all of DBCS&#146; interests in PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Trust (the &#147;Trust&#148;), a Delaware statutory trust, and the Trust&#146;s two separate series, one of which is PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish Fund (the &#147;Fund&#148;), including the sole and exclusive power to direct the business and affairs of the Trust and the Fund, as well as certain other assets of DBCS pertaining to the management of the Trust and the Fund, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Agreement (the &#147;Transaction&#148;). 

The Transaction was consummated on February 23, 2015 (the &#147;Closing Date&#148;). Invesco now serves as the managing owner (the &#147;Managing Owner&#148;), commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor of the Trust and the Fund, in replacement of DBCS (the &#147;Predecessor Managing Owner&#148;). 

Organization 

The Fund, a separate series of the Trust, a Delaware statutory trust organized in two separate series, was formed on August 3, 2006. The Predecessor Managing Owner seeded the Fund with a capital contribution of $1,000 in exchange for 40 General Shares of the Fund. The General Shares were sold to the Managing Owner by the Predecessor Managing Owner pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The fiscal year end of the Fund is December 31st. The term of the Fund is perpetual (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances) as provided for in the Fifth Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement of the Trust (the &#147;Trust Agreement&#148;). The Fund has an unlimited number of Shares authorized for issuance. 

The Fund offers common units of beneficial interest (the &#147;Shares&#148;) only to certain eligible financial institutions (the &#147;Authorized Participants&#148;) in one or more blocks of 200,000 Shares, called a Basket. The proceeds from the offering of Shares are invested in the Fund. The Fund commenced investment operations on February 15, 2007. The Fund commenced trading on the American Stock Exchange (which became the NYSE Alternext US LLC (the &#147;NYSE Alternext&#148;)) on February 20, 2007 and, as of November 25, 2008, is listed on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the &#147;NYSE Arca&#148;). 

As of the date of this Annual Report (the &#147;Report&#148;), each of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp., Virtu Financial Capital Markets LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, ABN AMRO Clearing Chicago (USA) LLC, Virtu Financial BD LLC, Knight Capital Americas LLC, Timber Hill LLC, Morgan Stanley &#38; Co. LLC, Jefferies &#38; Company Inc., Nomura Securities International Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, UBS Securities LLC, Cantor Fitzgerald &#38; Co., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Goldman, Sachs &#38; Co., Goldman Sachs Execution &#38; Clearing, L.P. and Citadel Securities LLC has executed a Participant Agreement. 

Fund Investment Overview 

The Fund establishes short positions in certain futures contracts (the &#147;DX Contracts&#148;) with a view to tracking the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index (USDX &#174; ) Futures Index&#150;Excess Return (the &#147;Short Index&#148; or the &#147;Index&#148;) over time. The performance of the Fund also is intended to reflect the excess, if any, of its interest income from its holdings of United States Treasury Obligations over the expenses of the Fund. The Index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of short positions in DX Contracts. DX Contracts are traded through the currency markets of ICE Futures U.S. (formerly known as the New York Board of Trade &#174; ), under the symbol &#147;DX.&#148; The changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts are related to the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the U.S. Dollar Index &#174; (the &#147;USDX &#174; &#148;). The Index provides a general indication of the international value of the U.S. dollar relative to the six major world currencies (each an &#147;Index Currency,&#148; and collectively, the &#147;Index Currencies&#148;), which comprise the USDX &#174; &#151;Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. 

The Shares are designed for investors who want a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in a group of currency futures on U.S. and non-U.S. markets. 

The USDX &#174; mark is a registered service mark owned by ICE Futures U.S., Inc. 

&#160; 

As of the date of this Report, the DX Contracts are not subject to speculative position limits. There can be no assurance that the DX Contracts will not become subject to speculative position limits. Should the Fund become subject to speculative position limits with respect to its DX Contracts holdings, the Fund&#146;s ability to issue new Baskets or the Fund&#146;s ability to reinvest income in additional DX Contracts may be limited to the extent that these activities would cause the Fund to exceed the potential future position limits. Limiting the size of the Fund may affect the correlation between the price of the Shares, as traded on the NYSE Arca, and the net asset value of the Fund. That is, the inability to create additional Baskets could result in Shares trading at a premium or discount to the net asset value of the Fund. 

If the Managing Owner determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that it has become impracticable or inefficient for any reason for the Fund to gain full or partial exposure to the DX Contracts, the Fund may: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invest in a different month DX Contract other than the specific DX Contract that was originally required by the Index, or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invest in another futures contract substantially similar to the DX Contracts, if available, or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invest in the futures contracts referencing the Index Currencies, or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; invest in a forward agreement, swap, or other OTC derivative referencing the Index Currencies, 

if, in the commercially reasonable judgment of the Managing Owner, such above instruments tend to exhibit trading prices that correlate with the DX Contract. 

The Fund is an index tracking fund and does not utilize any trading system, whether discretionary, systematic or otherwise. The Index is calculated to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of short positions in DX Contracts. In turn, the Fund seeks to track the Index by establishing short positions in DX Contracts accordingly. Therefore, the Managing Owner serves in an administrative role in order to ensure that the Fund invests in a manner that seeks to track the Index. 

The Fund holds United States Treasury Obligations for deposit with the Custodian (as defined below) and with the Commodity Broker (as defined below) as margin. The Fund does not borrow money to increase leverage. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Fund had $1,843,588 (or 4.28% of its total assets) and $43,841,021 (or 100.00% of its total assets), respectively, of its holdings of cash, United States Treasury Obligations and unrealized appreciation/depreciation on futures contracts on deposit with its Commodity Broker. Of this, $1,843,588 (or 4.28% of its total assets) and $752,895 (or 1.72% of its total assets) was required to be deposited to satisfy maintenance margin required by the Commodity Broker for the Fund&#146;s short futures positions on DX Contracts as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. All remaining cash and United States Treasury Obligations are on deposit with the Custodian (see Note 4). For additional information, please see the Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 for details of the Fund&#146;s portfolio holdings. 

Index Description 

The Managing Owner pays the Index Sponsor (as defined below) a licensing fee and an index services fee for performing its duties. These fees constitute a portion of the routine operational, administrative and other ordinary expenses which are paid out of the Management Fee and are not charged to or reimbursed by the Fund. 

Neither the Managing Owner nor any affiliate of the Managing Owner has any rights to influence the selection of the futures contracts underlying the Index. After the Closing Date, the Index Sponsor is not affiliated with the Fund or the Managing Owner. The Managing Owner has entered into a license agreement with the Index Sponsor to use the Index. 

The Fund is not sponsored or endorsed by Deutsche Bank AG, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. or any subsidiary or affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG or Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (collectively, &#147;Deutsche Bank&#148;). The Deutsche Bank Short US Dollar Index (USDX &#174; ) Futures Index&#151;Excess ReturnTM (the &#147;DB Index&#148;) is the exclusive property of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. &#147;DBIQ&#148; is a service mark of Deutsche Bank AG and has been licensed for use for certain purposes by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the DB Index makes any representation or warranty, express or implied, concerning the DB Index, the Fund or the advisability of investing in securities generally. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the DB Index has any obligation to take the needs of the Managing Owner or its clients into consideration in determining, composing or calculating the DB Index. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the DB Index is responsible for or has participated in the determination of the timing of, prices at, quantities or valuation of the Fund. Neither Deutsche Bank nor any other party involved in, or related to, making or compiling the DB Index has any obligation or liability in connection with the administration or trading of the Fund. 

&#160; 

NEITHER DEUTSCHE BANK NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE DB INDEX, WARRANTS OR GUARANTEES THE ACCURACY AND/OR THE COMPLETENESS OF THE DB INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR INTERRUPTIONS THEREIN. NEITHER DEUTSCHE BANK NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE DB INDEX, MAKES ANY WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED BY INVESCO POWERSHARES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC FROM THE USE OF THE DB INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN. NEITHER DEUTSCHE BANK NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE DB INDEX, MAKES ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE WITH RESPECT TO THE DB INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OF THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL DEUTSCHE BANK OR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN, OR RELATED TO, MAKING OR COMPILING THE DB INDEX HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR LOSSES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF NOTIFIED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED TO THE CONTRARY, THERE ARE NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES OF ANY AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN DEUTSCHE BANK AND INVESCO POWERSHARES CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC. 

No purchaser, seller or holder of the Shares of this Fund, or any other person or entity, should use or refer to any Deutsche Bank trade name, trademark or service mark to sponsor, endorse, market or promote this Fund without first contacting Deutsche Bank to determine whether Deutsche Bank&#146;s permission is required. Under no circumstances may any person or entity claim any affiliation with Deutsche Bank without the written permission of Deutsche Bank. 

The Index is designed to reflect the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, from investing in the first to expire DX Contracts whose changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, in turn, are tied to the USDX &#174; . The first to expire DX Contracts are the futures contracts that expire in March, June, September and December. DX Contracts are traded exclusively through ICE Futures U.S., under the symbol &#147;DX.&#148; 

The changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of DX Contracts are related to the Index Currencies. (Although the Index tracks the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of short positions in the first to expire DX Contracts, the closing level of the Index is in effect, and in part, a reflection of the changes, whether positive or negative, in the level of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of the underlying Index Currencies.) The Index Currencies are Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc. The Index Currencies represent the currencies of the major trading partners of the U.S. 

The USDX &#174; is composed of notional amounts of each Index Currency. The notional amounts of the Index Currencies included in the USDX &#174; reflect a geometric weighted average of the change in the Index Currencies&#146; exchange rates against the U.S. dollar relative to March 1973. March 1973 was chosen as the base period of the USDX &#174; because it represents a significant milestone in foreign exchange history when the world&#146;s major trading nations allowed their currencies to float freely against each other. 

The fair value of DX Contracts is based on foreign exchange futures prices for the underlying Index Currencies. The fair value of DX Contracts is calculated in the same way as a spot index. DX Contracts, similar to single currency futures contracts, will trade at a forward premium or discount based on the interest rate differential between the U.S. dollar and the Index Currencies. 

Volatility of the USDX &#174; has been historically comparable in range and variability to a broad-based, multi-capitalization stock index future. The DX Contract price is sized at $1,000 times the USDX &#174; closing level. Thus, if the USDX &#174; closing level is 100.00, the DX Contract will be valued $100,000. If the USDX &#174; closing level is 112.50, each DX Contract will have a $112,500 value. 

The sponsor of the Index is Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (the &#147;Index Sponsor&#148;). The Index Sponsor may from time-to-time subcontract the provision of the calculation and other services described below to one or more third parties. 

&#160; 

USDX &#174; Composition 

The Index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of short positions in the first to expire DX Contracts. In turn, the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of DX Contracts are related to the changes, positive and negative, in the level of the USDX &#174; . 

The USDX &#174; provides a general indication of the international value of the U.S. dollar and is composed of notional amounts of each of the Index Currencies. The notional amounts of each Index Currency included in the USDX &#174; are weighted to reflect the currencies of the largest trading partners of the U.S. These largest trading partners constitute the bulk of international trade with the United States and have well-developed foreign exchange markets with rates freely determined by market participants. In addition, many currencies not included in the USDX &#174; move in close correlation with those that are included. The USDX &#174; is computed 24 hours a day, seven days a week based on exchange rates supplied to Reuters by some 500 banks worldwide. 

The following table reflects the index base weights (the &#147;Index Base Weights&#148;) of each Index Currency as of March 1973 with respect to the USDX &#174; : 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; Closing Level at Inception: 

&#160; &#160; 100.00 % &#160; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; The USDX &#174; has been calculated since inception in March 1973. The closing level at inception was 100.00. 

The Euro was included in the USDX &#174; in 1999 and replaced the following currencies that were originally included in the USDX &#174; : Belgian Franc, Dutch Guilder, German Mark, French Franc and Italian Lira. 

Please see http://www.invescopowershares.com with respect to the most recently available weighted composition of the Fund and the composition of the Index on the Base Date (as defined below). 

Index Calculation 

The Index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of short positions in the first to expire DX Contracts relative to the value of the dollar as of December 31, 1986 (the &#147;Base Date&#148;), which expire in March, June, September and December. On the Base Date, the closing level was 100.00. Although the DX Contract started trading in 1985, the Base Date of December 31, 1986 was selected because reasonably reliable pricing data was not available prior to December 31, 1986. A quote of &#147;105.50&#148; means the U.S. dollar&#146;s value has risen 5.50% since the Base Date relative to the underlying basket of Index Currencies which comprise the USDX &#174; . 

The Index Sponsor calculates the closing level of the Index on both an excess return basis and a total return basis. The excess return index reflects the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts. The total return is the sum of the changes in market value over time, whether positive or negative, of the DX Contracts plus the return of 3-month U.S. Treasury bills. The closing levels of the Index have been calculated using historic exchange closing price data of the DX Contracts since the Base Date. 

The use of short positions on DX Contracts in the construction of the Short Index causes the Short Index to rise as a result of any downward price movement in the DX Contracts. In turn, this appreciation in the short DX Contracts reflects the fall of the U.S. dollar relative to the underlying basket of Index Currencies which comprise the USDX &#174; . 

Since the Base Date, the Short Index closing level has ranged on a daily basis from as high as 153.28 on April 22, 2008 to as low as 91.91 on July 5, 2001. Past Index levels are not necessarily indicative of future Index levels. 

Index Rolls and Rebalancing of the USDX &#174; 

The underlying DX Contracts of the Index are rolled quarterly over three consecutive business days starting on the Wednesday prior to the applicable IMM Date (each an &#147;Index Roll Day&#148;). &#147;IMM Date&#148; means the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December, a traditional settlement date in the International Money Market. 

&#160; 

DX Contracts are rolled on each Index Roll Day as follows: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; On each Index Roll Day, 1/3 of the DX Contracts that will expire on the next IMM Date are bought back and positions in the DX Contracts that expire on the IMM Date following the next IMM Date are sold short. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; On each Index Roll Day, new notional holdings are calculated for the old DX Contracts leaving the Index as well as the new DX Contracts entering the Index. 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; On all days that are not Index Roll Days, the notional holdings of the DX Contracts in the Index remain constant. 

There are no regularly scheduled adjustments or rebalancings of the USDX &#174; . The USDX &#174; has only been adjusted once, when the Euro was introduced as the common currency for the European Union (EU) bloc of countries. Without any other adjustments, the combination of components and their respective weightings in the USDX &#174; have yielded performance results similar to other commonly used US dollar indexes, whether those index methodologies are based on trade weights or capital flow weights. 

The Trustee 

Under the Trust Agreement, Wilmington Trust Company, the trustee of the Trust and the Fund (the &#147;Trustee&#148;), has delegated to the Managing Owner the exclusive management and control of all aspects of the business of the Trust and the Fund. The Trustee will have no duty or liability to supervise or monitor the performance of the Managing Owner, nor will the Trustee have any liability for the acts or omissions of the Managing Owner. The Trustee is compensated by the Managing Owner. Under the Trust Agreement, the Managing Owner, from the assets of the Fund, will indemnify the Trustee for any liability or expense relating to the ongoing operations and termination of the Fund incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee. 

The Managing Owner 

The Managing Owner was formed on February 7, 2003. The Managing Owner is an affiliate of Invesco Ltd. The Managing Owner was formed to be the managing owner of investment vehicles such as exchange-traded funds and has been managing non-commodity futures based exchange-traded funds since 2003 and a commodity futures based exchange-traded fund since 2014. The Managing Owner serves as the commodity pool operator, commodity trading advisor and swap firm of the Trust and the Fund. The Managing Owner is registered as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor with the CFTC and is a member of the National Futures Association (the &#147;NFA&#148;). As a registered commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor, with respect to the Fund, the Managing Owner must comply with various regulatory requirements under the Commodity Exchange Act (the &#147;CEAct&#148;) and the rules and regulations of the CFTC and the NFA, including investor protection requirements, antifraud prohibitions, disclosure requirements, and reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The Managing Owner also is subject to periodic inspections and audits by the CFTC and NFA. 

The Managing Owner has served as the managing owner of the Trust and the Fund since the Closing Date on February 23, 2015.

The Fund pays the Managing Owner a management fee monthly in arrears, in an amount equal to 0.75% per annum of the daily net asset value of the Fund (the &#147;Management Fee&#148;). The Management Fee is paid in consideration of the Managing Owner&#146;s currency futures trading advisory services. For the avoidance of doubt, from inception up to and excluding the Closing Date, all Management Fees were payable to the Predecessor Managing Owner. Since the Closing Date, the Managing Owner has served as managing owner of the Fund and all Management Fee accruals since the Closing Date have been paid to the Managing Owner. 

Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Fund will indemnify the Managing Owner against any losses, judgments, liabilities, expenses and amounts paid in settlement of any claims sustained by it in connection with its activities on behalf of the Fund incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

The Commodity Broker 

Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., a Delaware corporation, serves as the Fund&#146;s clearing broker (the &#147;Commodity Broker&#148;). The Commodity Broker is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Deutsche Bank AG and is an affiliate of the Predecessor Managing Owner. In its capacity as clearing broker, the Commodity Broker may execute or receive transactions executed by others and clears each of the Fund&#146;s futures transactions and performs certain administrative and custodial services for the Fund. The Commodity Broker is responsible, among other things, for providing periodic accountings of all dealings and actions taken by the Trust on behalf of the Fund during the reporting period, together with an accounting of all securities, cash or other indebtedness or obligations held by it or its nominees for or on behalf of the Fund. 

&#160; 

A variety of executing brokers execute futures transactions on behalf of the Fund. Such executing brokers &#147;give-up&#148;, or transfer for clearing, all such transactions to the Commodity Broker. The Commodity Broker is registered with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a member of the NFA in such capacity. 

The Fund pays to the Commodity Broker all brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, NFA fees, give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities. The Commodity Broker&#146;s brokerage commissions and trading fees are determined on a contract-by-contract basis. Brokerage commissions and fees in any future fiscal year or any part of any future fiscal year may be greater. On average, total charges paid to the Commodity Broker were less than $6.00, $12.00 and $12.00 per round-turn trade 1 for the Years Ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Regulation 

Futures exchanges in the United States are subject to regulation under the CEAct by the CFTC, the governmental agency having responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and trading on those exchanges. No U.S. governmental agency regulates the over-the-counter (the &#147;OTC&#148;) foreign exchange markets. 

The CEAct and the CFTC also regulate the activities of &#147;commodity trading advisors&#148; and &#147;commodity pool operators&#148; and the CFTC has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons&#146; activities. Pursuant to its authority, the CFTC requires a commodity pool operator (such as the Managing Owner) to keep accurate, current and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates. The CFTC may suspend the registration of a commodity pool operator if the CFTC finds that the operator has violated the CEAct or regulations thereunder and in certain other circumstances. Suspension, restriction or termination of the Managing Owner&#146;s registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, the Fund. The CEAct gives the CFTC similar authority with respect to the activities of commodity trading advisors, such as the Managing Owner. If the registration of a managing owner as a commodity trading advisor were to be terminated, restricted or suspended, the managing owner would be unable, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, to render trading advice to the Fund. The Fund is not registered with the CFTC in any capacity. 

The CEAct requires all &#147;futures commission merchants,&#148; such as the Commodity Broker, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers&#146; funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. 

The CEAct also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.

Shareholders are afforded certain rights for reparations under the CEAct. Shareholders may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the CEAct. The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the CEAct which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the CEAct against a floor broker, futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, and their respective associated persons. 

Pursuant to authority in the CEAct, the NFA was formed and registered with the CFTC as a &#147;registered futures association.&#148; At the present time, the NFA is the only non-exchange self-regulatory organization for commodities professionals. NFA members are subject to NFA standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection. As the self-regulatory body of the commodities industry, the NFA promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals who do not comply with such standards. The CFTC has delegated to the NFA responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers and their respective associated persons and floor brokers. The Commodity Broker and the Managing Owner are members of the NFA (the Fund is not required to become a member of the NFA). 

The CFTC has no authority to regulate trading on foreign commodity exchanges and markets.
