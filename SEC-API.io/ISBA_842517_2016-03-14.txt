Isabella Bank Corporation refers solely to the parent holding company, and Isabella Bank or the &#8220;Bank&#8221; refer to Isabella Bank Corporation&#8217;s subsidiary, Isabella Bank. &#32; 

Our reportable segments are based on legal entities that account for at least 10% &#32;of net operating results. Retail banking operations for 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 &#32;represent approximately 90% &#32;or greater of total assets and operating results. As such, we have only one reportable segment. 

We are a community bank with a focus on providing high quality, personalized service at a fair price. We offer a broad array of banking services to businesses, institutions, and individuals. We compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, mortgage brokers, finance companies, credit unions, and retail brokerage firms. 

Lending activities include loans for commercial and agricultural operating and real estate purposes, residential real estate loans, and consumer loans. We limit lending activities primarily to local markets and have not purchased any loans from the secondary market. We do not make loans to fund leveraged buyouts, have no foreign corporate or government loans, and have limited holdings of corporate debt securities. Our general lending philosophy is to limit concentrations to individuals and business segments. For additional information related to our lending strategies and policies, see &#8220; Note 5 &#8211; Loans and ALLL &#8221; of the &#8220;Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8221; &#32;in Item 8.

Supervision and Regulation 

The earnings and growth of the banking industry and, therefore, our earnings are affected by the credit policies of monetary authorities, including the FRB . An important function of the FRB &#32;is to regulate the national supply of bank credit in order to combat recessions and curb inflationary pressures. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the FRB &#32;to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. Treasury and U.S. Government Agency securities, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings, and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These methods are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for deposits. The monetary policies of the FRB &#32;have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and related financial service providers in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effect of such policies upon our future business and earnings cannot be predicted. 

We, as a financial holding company, are regulated under the BHC Act , and are subject to the supervision of the FRB . We are registered as a financial services holding company with the FRB &#32;and are subject to annual reporting requirements and 

&#32;6 

inspections and audits. Under FRB &#32;policy, we are expected to act as a source of financial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support its subsidiaries. This support may be required at times when, in the absence of such FRB &#32;policy, it would not otherwise be required to provide support. 

Under Michigan law, if the capital of a Michigan state chartered bank has become impaired by losses or otherwise, the Commissioner of the DIFS &#32;may require that the deficiency in capital be met by assessment upon the bank&#8217;s shareholders pro rata on the amount of capital stock held by each, and if any such assessment is not paid by any shareholder within 30 days of the date of mailing of notice thereof to such shareholder, cause the sale of the stock of such shareholder to pay such assessment and the costs of sale of such stock. 

Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment. This priority would apply to guarantees of capital plans under the FDIC &#32;Improvement Act of 1991. 

SOX &#32;contains important requirements for public companies in the area of financial disclosure and corporate governance. In accordance with Section 302(a) of SOX , written certifications by our principal executive, financial, and accounting officers are required. These certifications attest that our quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC &#32;do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact (see the certifications filed as Exhibits 31 (a) and (b) to this Form 10-K for such certification of consolidated financial statements and other information for this 2015 &#32;Form 10-K). We have also implemented a program designed to comply with Section 404 of SOX , which included the identification of significant processes and accounts, documentation of the design of control effectiveness over process and entity level controls, and testing of the operating effectiveness of key controls. See Item 9A. Controls and Procedures &#32;for our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. 

Certain additional information concerning regulatory guidelines for capital adequacy and other regulatory matters is presented herein under the caption &#8220; Capital &#8221; in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#32;and in &#8220; Note 15 &#8211; Commitments and Other Matters &#8221; and &#8220; Note 16 &#8211; Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements &#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data . 

Isabella Bank 

The Bank is supervised and regulated by DIFS &#32;and the FRB . The agencies and federal and state laws extensively regulate various aspects of the banking business including, among other things, permissible types and amounts of loans, investments and other activities, capital adequacy, branching, interest rates on loans and deposits, and the safety and soundness of banking practices. 

Our deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF &#32;of the FDIC &#32;and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF . The FDIC &#32;utilizes a risk-based assessment system that assesses insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account assets and capital levels and supervisory ratings. 

Banking laws and regulations restrict transactions by insured banks owned by a bank holding company, including loans to and certain purchases from the parent holding company, non-bank and bank subsidiaries of the parent holding company, principal shareholders, officers, directors and their affiliates, and investments by the subsidiary bank in the shares or securities of the parent holding company (or any of the other non-bank or bank affiliates), or acceptance of such shares or securities as collateral security for loans to any borrower. 

The Bank is subject to legal limitations on the frequency and amount of dividends that can be paid to Isabella Bank Corporation. For example, a Michigan state chartered bank may not declare a cash dividend or a dividend in kind except out of net profits then on hand after deducting all losses and bad debts, and then only if it will have a surplus amounting to not less than 20% &#32;of its capital after the payment of the dividend. Moreover, a Michigan state chartered bank may not declare or pay any cash dividend or dividend in kind until the cumulative dividends on its preferred stock, if any, have been paid in full. Further, if the surplus of a Michigan state chartered bank is at any time less than the amount of its capital, before the declaration of a cash dividend or dividend in kind, it must transfer to surplus not less than 10% &#32;of its net profits for the preceding six months (in the case of quarterly or semi-annual dividends) or the preceding two consecutive six month periods (in the case of annual dividends). 

The payment of dividends by Isabella Bank Corporation and the Bank is also affected by various regulatory requirements and policies, such as the requirement to keep adequate capital in compliance with regulatory guidelines. Federal laws impose further restrictions on the payment of dividends by insured banks that fail to meet specified capital levels. The FDIC &#32;may 

&#32;7 

prevent an insured bank from paying dividends if the bank is in default of payment of any assessment due to the FDIC . In addition, payment of dividends by a bank may be prevented by the applicable federal regulatory authority if such payment is determined, by reason of the financial condition of such bank, to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The FRB &#32;and the FDIC &#32;have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. Additionally, the FRB &#32;Board of Governors requires a bank holding company to notify the FRB &#32;prior to increasing its cash dividend by more than 10% &#32;over the prior year. 

The aforementioned regulations and restrictions may limit our ability to obtain funds from the Bank for our cash needs, including payment of dividends and operating expenses. 

The activities and operations of the Bank are also subject to various federal and state laws and regulations.
