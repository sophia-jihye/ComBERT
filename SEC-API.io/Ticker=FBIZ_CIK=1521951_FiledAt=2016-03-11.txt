 Item 1. Business 

BUSINESS 

General 

First Business Financial Services, Inc. (together with all of its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as &#8220;Corporation,&#8221; &#8220;FBFS,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is a registered bank holding company originally incorporated in 1986 under the laws of the State of Wisconsin and engaged in the commercial banking business through its three wholly-owned bank subsidiaries, First Business Bank (&#8220;FBB&#8221;), headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, First Business Bank-Milwaukee (&#8220;FBB-Milwaukee&#8221;), headquartered in Brookfield, Wisconsin, and Alterra Bank (&#8220;Alterra&#8221;), headquartered in Leawood, Kansas (together with FBB and FBB-Milwaukee, collectively referred to as the &#8220;Banks&#8221;). All of our operations are conducted through the Banks and certain subsidiaries of FBB. The Banks operate as business banks delivering a full line of commercial banking products and services tailored to meet the specific needs of small and medium sized businesses, business owners, executives, professionals and high net worth individuals. The Banks generally target businesses with annual sales between $2.0 million and $75.0 million. Our business banking focus does not rely on an extensive branch network to attract retail clients; therefore, to supplement the business banking deposit base, the Banks utilize a wholesale funding strategy to fund a portion of their assets. As of December 31, 2015 , on a consolidated basis, we had total assets of $1.783 billion , total gross loans and leases of $1.435 billion , total deposits of $1.577 billion &#32;and total stockholders&#8217; equity of $150.8 million . 

Our Business Lines 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Commercial Lending 

We strive to meet the specific commercial lending needs of small to medium sized companies in our target markets of Wisconsin, Kansas and Missouri, primarily through lines of credit and term loans to businesses with annual sales between $2.0 million and $75.0 million. Through FBB, we have a significant presence in Madison and its surrounding areas. In 2000, we opened FBB-Milwaukee to take advantage of the strong commercial base located in Milwaukee and the surrounding communities. In 2006, FBB opened a loan production office in Appleton to take advantage of the commercial environment in Northeast Wisconsin. Subsequently, FBB opened additional loan production offices in Oshkosh, Green Bay and Manitowoc. In 2014, FBB-Milwaukee opened a loan production office in Kenosha, further expanding within the southeastern area of Wisconsin. Also in 2014, we acquired Aslin Group, Inc. and its bank subsidiary Alterra to add an established business focused team serving similar sized businesses in the Kansas City metropolitan area. 

Our commercial loans are typically secured by various types of business assets, including inventory, receivables and equipment. We also originate loans secured by commercial real estate, including owner-occupied commercial facilities, multi-family housing, office buildings, retail centers, and, to a lesser extent, commercial real estate construction loans. In very limited cases, we may originate loans on an unsecured basis. As of December 31, 2015 , our commercial real estate and commercial loans, excluding asset-based lending and equipment financing, represented approximately 82.8% &#32;of our total gross loans and leases receivable. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Asset-Based Financing 

First Business Capital Corp. (&#8220;FBCC&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FBB, provides asset-based lending to small to medium sized companies. With its sales offices located in several states, FBCC serves clients nationwide. 

FBCC primarily provides revolving lines of credit and term loans for financial and strategic acquisitions (e.g., leveraged or management buyouts), capital expenditures, working capital to support rapid growth, bank debt refinancing, debt restructuring, corporate turnaround strategies and debtor-in-possession financing in the course of bankruptcy proceedings or the exit therefrom. As a bank-owned, asset-based lender with strong underwriting standards, FBCC is positioned to provide cost-effective financing solutions to companies with annual sales between $2.0 million and $75.0 million who do not have the established stable cash flows necessary to qualify for traditional commercial lending products. Asset-based lending typically generates higher yields than traditional commercial lending. This line of business complements our traditional commercial loan portfolio and provides us with more diverse income opportunities. As of December 31, 2015 , our asset-based lending business line represented 11.3% &#32;of our total gross loans and leases receivable. 

First Business Factors (&#8220;FBF&#8221;), a division of FBCC, provides funding to clients by purchasing accounts receivable on a full recourse basis. FBF provides competitive rates to clients starting up, seeking growth and needing cash flow support, or 

who are experiencing financial issues. Similar to asset-based lending, factoring typically generates higher yields than traditional commercial lending and complements our traditional commercial portfolio. We believe we will continue to grow this business line in the future. FBF is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois and with its sales offices located in several states is able to serve clients nationwide. As of December 31, 2015 , our factored receivable financing business line represented approximately 1% &#32;of our total gross loans and leases receivable. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Equipment Financing 

First Business Equipment Finance, LLC (&#8220;FBEF&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FBB, delivers a broad range of equipment finance products, including leases and loans, to address the financing needs of commercial clients in a variety of industries. FBEF&#8217;s focus includes manufacturing equipment, industrial assets, construction and transportation equipment, and a wide variety of other commercial equipment. These financings generally range between $500,000 and $7.5 million with terms of 36 to 84 months. We believe we will continue to grow this business line primarily through our existing offices in Wisconsin. As of December 31, 2015 , our equipment financing business line represented approximately 3.3% &#32;of our total gross loans and leases receivable. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; Small Business Administration (&#8220;SBA&#8221;) Lending 

The SBA guarantees loans originated by lenders to small business borrowers who meet its program eligibility and underwriting guidelines. Specific program guidelines vary based on the SBA loan program; however, all loans must be underwritten, originated, monitored and serviced according to the SBA&#8217;s Standard Operating Procedures. Generally, the SBA provides a guaranty to the lender ranging from 50% to 90% of principal and interest as an inducement to the lender to originate the loan. 

&#160; 

The majority of our SBA loans are originated using the 7(a) term loan program. This program typically provides a guaranty of 75% of principal and interest. In the event of default on the loan, the bank may request that the SBA purchase the guaranteed portion of the loan for an amount equal to outstanding principal plus accrued interest. In addition, the SBA will share on a pro-rata basis in the costs of collection as well as the proceeds of liquidation. 

Alterra is an active participant in the SBA&#8217;s Preferred Lender Program (&#8220;PLP&#8221;). The PLP is part of the SBA's effort to streamline the procedures necessary to provide financial assistance to the small business community. Under this program, the SBA delegates the final credit decision and most servicing and liquidation authority and responsibility to carefully selected PLP lenders. We leverage this expertise and capacity centralized at Alterra to package, underwrite, process, service, and liquidate, if necessary, all SBA loans throughout the Corporation&#8217;s other locations. We believe our ability to reduce the processing time to originate a loan with the SBA creates a competitive advantage in the markets we serve. Since 2012, Alterra has ranked first among all SBA lenders in the Kansas City SBA district measured by loan volume according to data published by the SBA. 

SBA lending is designed to generate new business opportunities for the Banks by meeting the needs of clients whose borrowing needs cannot be met with conventional loans. We earn income from the note rate of interest, generally a variable rate, and by gathering deposits from and providing other services to these clients. In addition, our SBA strategy generates significant non-interest income from two primary sources. First, we typically sell the guaranteed portion of the SBA loans to aggregators who securitize the assets for sale in the secondary market and receive a premium on each loan sold, resulting in the recognition of a gain in the period of sale. Second, we receive servicing income from the holder of the securitized asset. Whereas past practice has been to sell the guaranteed portion of every SBA loan, our future practice will be to evaluate a variety of factors before making the decision to sell or retain the guaranteed portion of each SBA loan we originate. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Treasury Management Services 

The Banks provide comprehensive services for commercial clients to manage their cash and liquidity, including lockbox, accounts receivable collection services, electronic payment solutions, cash vault services, fraud protection, information reporting, reconciliation and data integration solutions. For our clients involved in international trade, the Banks offer international payment services, foreign exchange and trade letters of credit. The Banks also offer a variety of deposit accounts and balance optimization solutions. As we continue to seek to diversify our income and increase our non-interest income, we have focused on increasing sales of these services and have emphasized these offerings with new and existing business clients. 

&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Trust and Investment Services 

FBB, through its First Business Trust &#38; Investments (&#8220;FBTI&#8221;) division, acts as fiduciary and investment manager for individual and corporate clients, creating and executing asset allocation strategies tailored to each client&#8217;s unique situation. FBTI has full fiduciary powers and offers trust, estate, financial planning and investment services, acting in a trustee or agent capacity as well as Employee Benefit/Retirement Plan services. FBTI also provides brokerage and custody-only services, for which it administers and safeguards assets, but does not provide investment advice. At December 31, 2015 , FBTI had $1.021 billion &#32;of assets under management and administration. 

Competition 

The Banks encounter strong competition across all of our lines of business. Such competition includes banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, finance companies, equipment finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage firms and investment banking firms. Furthermore, credit unions exempt from income taxes operate in the Banks&#8217; markets and aggressively price their products and services to a large portion of the market. The Banks also compete with regional and national financial institutions, many of which have greater liquidity, higher lending limits, greater access to capital, more established market recognition and more resources than the Banks. We believe the experience, expertise and responsiveness of our banking professionals and our focus on fostering long-lasting relationships sets us apart from our competitors. 

Employees 

At December 31, 2015 , we had 258 &#32;employees equating to approximately 242 &#32;full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

We acquired Alterra through the acquisition of its parent, Aslin Group, Inc., on November 1, 2014 in order to gain scale, achieve product line synergies and expand geographically through the acquisition of a similarly focused business bank in a thriving Midwestern market.

Specifically, our three target markets in Wisconsin consist of Madison and Milwaukee, and their surrounding communities, and Northeastern Wisconsin, including Appleton, Green Bay, Oshkosh and Manitowoc, and their surrounding communities. We serve our target markets in Kansas and Missouri through our Leawood and Overland Park, Kansas offices which are located in the Kansas City metropolitan statistical area (&#8220;MSA&#8221;). Each of our primary markets provides a unique set of economic and demographic characteristics which provide us with a variety of strategic opportunities. A brief description of each of our primary markets is as follows: 

Madison 

As the capital of Wisconsin and home of the University of Wisconsin - Madison, our Madison market, specifically Dane County, offers an appealing economic environment populated by a highly educated workforce. While the economy of the Madison market is driven in large part by the government and education sectors, there is also a diverse array of industries outside of these segments, including significant concentration of insurance companies and agricultural-related industries. Madison is also home to a concentration of research and development related companies, which benefit from the area&#8217;s strong governmental and academic ties, as well as the University of Wisconsin Hospital, which provides healthcare services to South Central Wisconsin. 

According to preliminary &#32;Bureau of Labor Statistics data, as of December 2015 , the unadjusted unemployment rate in the Madison MSA was 3.1% &#32;compared to the national unemployment rate of 5.0% &#32;and an unemployment rate in the State of Wisconsin of 4.3% .

Our Milwaukee market, the primary commercial and industrial hub for Southeastern Wisconsin, provides a diverse economic base, with both a highly skilled labor force and significant manufacturing base. The most prominent economic sectors in the Milwaukee market include manufacturing, financial services, health care, diversified service companies and education.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of December 2015 , the preliminary &#32;unemployment rate in the three major MSAs in this market ranged from 3.6% &#32;to 3.8% , compared to the national unemployment rate of 5.0% &#32;and an unemployment rate in the State of Wisconsin of 4.3% .

Kansas City 

Geographically located in the center of the U.S., the greater Kansas City area enjoys a vibrant and diverse economy. The metropolitan area includes 18 counties and more than 50 communities in Missouri and Kansas, including a vibrant central business district located in Kansas City, Missouri and thriving communities on both sides of the state line. The area is known for the diversity of its economic base, with major employers in manufacturing and distribution, architecture and engineering, technology, telecommunications, financial services and bioscience as well as local government and higher education. Kansas City is consistently one of the fastest growing major job markets in the Midwest, and offers lower costs of living than most major metropolitan areas. The area offers a thriving environment for entrepreneurship and is consistently ranked as one of the best places to start a business. 

According to data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of December 2015 , the preliminary &#32;unemployment rate in the Kansas City MSA was 3.8% , compared to the national unemployment rate of 5.0% &#32;and an unemployment rate in the State of Kansas of 3.9% .

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 

Below is a brief description of certain laws and regulations that relate to us and the Banks. This narrative does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to applicable laws and regulations. 

General 

FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates are extensively regulated under federal and state law. As a result, our growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Division of Banking of the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions (&#8220;WDFI&#8221;), the Office of the State Bank Commissioner of Kansas (&#8220;OSBC&#8221;), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;Federal Reserve&#8221;), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) and the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (&#8220;CFPB&#8221;). Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, securities laws administered by the SEC and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (&#8220;Treasury&#8221;) have an impact on 

our business. The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to our operations and results, and the nature and extent of future legislative, regulatory or other changes affecting financial institutions are impossible to predict with any certainty. 

Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of financial institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than shareholders. These federal and state laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of business, the kinds and amounts of investments banks may make, reserve requirements, capital levels relative to operations, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, the ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with insiders and affiliates and the payment of dividends. In the last several years, we have experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny following the global financial crisis and as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;). Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time, and the reforms have caused our compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase. 

This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects FDIC-insured institutions and their bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business. These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. 

The following is a summary of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to us and the Banks, beginning with a discussion of the continuing regulatory emphasis on our capital levels. It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described. The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision. 

Regulatory Emphasis on Capital 

Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects our earnings capabilities. While capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress. Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish strengthened capital standards for banks and bank holding companies, require more capital to be held in the form of common stock and disallow certain funds from being included in capital determinations. These standards represent regulatory capital requirements that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously. 

Minimum Required Capital Levels. &#32;&#32;Bank holding companies have historically had to comply with less stringent capital standards than their bank subsidiaries and have been able to raise capital with hybrid instruments such as trust preferred securities. The Dodd-Frank Act mandated the Federal Reserve to establish minimum capital levels for holding companies on a consolidated basis as stringent as those required for FDIC-insured institutions. As a consequence, the components of holding company permanent capital known as &#8220;Tier 1 Capital&#8221; were restricted to those capital instruments that are considered to be Tier 1 Capital for FDIC-insured institutions. A result of this change is that the proceeds of hybrid instruments, such as trust preferred securities, are being excluded from Tier 1 Capital over a phase-out period. However, if such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets, they may be retained, subject to certain restrictions. Because we have assets of less than $15 billion, we are able to maintain our trust preferred proceeds as Tier 1 Capital but we have to comply with new capital mandates in other respects and will not be able to raise Tier 1 Capital in the future through the issuance of trust preferred securities. 

The capital standards for us and the Banks changed on January 1, 2015 to add the requirements of Basel III, discussed below. The minimum &#32;capital standards effective prior to and including December 31, 2015 were: 

&#8226; 

A leverage requirement, consisting of a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly adjusted average assets of 3% for the most highly-rated banks with a minimum requirement of at least 4% for all others, and 

&#8226; 

A risk-based capital requirement, consisting of a minimum ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% and a minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 4%. 

For these purposes, &#8220;Tier 1 Capital&#8221; consists primarily of common stock, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus less intangible assets (other than certain loan servicing rights and purchased credit card relationships). Total Capital consists primarily of Tier 1 Capital plus &#8220;Tier 2 Capital,&#8221; which includes other non-permanent capital items, such as certain other debt and equity instruments that do not qualify as Tier 1 Capital, and each Bank&#8217;s allowance for loan losses, subject to a limitation of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Further, risk-weighted assets for the purpose of the risk-weighted ratio calculations are balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures to which required risk weightings are applied. 

The Basel International Capital Accords. &#32;The risk-based capital guidelines described above are based upon the 1988 capital accord known as &#8220;Basel I&#8221; adopted by the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a committee of central banks and bank supervisors, as implemented by the U.S. federal banking regulators on an interagency basis. In 2008, the banking agencies collaboratively began to phase-in capital standards based on a second capital accord, referred to as &#8220;Basel II,&#8221; for large or &#8220;core&#8221; international banks (generally defined for U.S. purposes as having total assets of $250 billion or more, or consolidated foreign exposures of $10 billion or more). On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations around the world, known as Basel III, to address deficiencies recognized in connection with the global financial crisis. Because of Dodd-Frank Act requirements, Basel III essentially layers a new set of capital standards on the previously existing Basel I standards. 

The Basel III Rule . &#32;In July of 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the &#8220;Basel III Rule&#8221;). In contrast to capital requirements historically, which were in the form of guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of regulations by each of the regulatory agencies. The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies, other than &#8220;small bank holding companies&#8221; (generally bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1 billion). 

The Basel III Rule not only increased most of the required minimum capital ratios effective January 1, 2015, but it introduced the concept of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, which consists primarily of common stock, related surplus (net of Treasury stock), retained earnings, and Common Equity Tier 1 minority interests subject to certain regulatory adjustments. The Basel III Rule also expanded the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (Tier 1 Capital in addition to Common Equity) and Tier 2 Capital. A number of instruments that qualified as Tier 1 Capital do not qualify, or their qualifications will change. For example, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which qualified as simple Tier 1 Capital, does not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but qualifies as Additional Tier 1 Capital. The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and requires deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceed a certain percentage of a banking institution&#8217;s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. 

The Basel III Rule required minimum &#32;capital ratios beginning January 1, 2015, as follows: 

&#8226; 

A new ratio of minimum Common Equity Tier 1 equal to 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

An increase in the minimum required amount of Tier 1 Capital to 6% of risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

A continuation of the current minimum required amount of Total Capital (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) at 8% of risk-weighted assets; and 

&#8226; 

A minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly adjusted average assets equal to 4% in all circumstances. 

Not only did the capital requirements change but the risk weightings (or their methodologies) for bank assets that are used to determine the capital ratios changed as well. For nearly every class of assets, the Basel III Rule requires a more complex, detailed and calibrated assessment of credit risk and calculation of risk weightings. 

Banking organizations (except for large, internationally active banking organizations) became subject to the new rules on January 1, 2015. However, there are separate phase-in/phase-out periods for: (i) the capital conservation buffer; (ii) regulatory capital adjustments and deductions; (iii) nonqualifying capital instruments; and (iv) changes to the prompt corrective action rules discussed below. The phase-in periods commenced on January 1, 2016 and extend until 2019. 

Well-Capitalized Requirements . &#32;The ratios described above are minimum standards in order for banking organizations to be considered &#8220;adequately capitalized.&#8221; Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks and bank holding companies to hold more capital and be &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits. Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. For example, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate 

risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities. Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions ( i.e. , Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels. 

Under the capital regulations of the FDIC and Federal Reserve, in order to be well&#8209;capitalized, a banking organization must maintain: 

&#8226; 

A new Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more; 

&#8226; 

A minimum ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8% (6% under Basel I); 

&#8226; 

A minimum ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10% (the same as Basel I); and 

&#8226; 

A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total quarterly adjusted average assets of 5% or greater. 

It is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer discussed immediately below. 

In addition, institutions that seek the freedom to make capital distributions (including for dividends and repurchases of stock) and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers without restriction must also maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 attributable to a capital conservation buffer to be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. The purpose of the conservation buffer is to ensure that banking institutions maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses during periods of financial and economic stress. Factoring in the fully phased-in conservation buffer increases the minimum ratios depicted above to 7% for Common Equity Tier 1, 8.5% for Tier 1 Capital and 10.5% for Total Capital. 

As of December 31, 2015: (i) no Bank was subject to a directive from its regulatory agencies to increase capital; and (ii) the Banks were each &#8220;well-capitalized,&#8221; as defined by FDIC and Federal Reserve regulations. As of December 31, 2015, FBFS had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s requirements and met the Dodd-Frank Act requirements. 

Prompt Corrective Action . An FDIC-insured institution&#8217;s capital plays an important role in connection with regulatory enforcement as well. Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions. This regime applies to FDIC-insured institutions, not holding companies, and provides escalating powers to bank regulatory agencies as a bank&#8217;s capital diminishes. The extent of the regulators&#8217; powers depends on whether the institution in question is &#8220;adequately capitalized,&#8221; &#8220;undercapitalized,&#8221; &#8220;significantly undercapitalized&#8221; or &#8220;critically undercapitalized,&#8221; in each case as defined by regulation. Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators&#8217; corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution&#8217;s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. 

FBFS 

General. &#32;&#32;We are a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (&#8220;BHCA&#8221;). and are subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve. We are legally obligated to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Banks and to commit resources to support our Banks in circumstances where we might not otherwise do so. Under the BHCA, we are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and are required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of our operations and such additional information regarding us and the Banks as the Federal Reserve may require. 

Acquisitions, Activities and Change in Control . The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. &#32; &#32;The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company. Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA and the Dodd-Frank Act), the Federal Reserve may allow us to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state depository institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company. Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions. For a discussion of the capital requirements, see &#8220;Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#8221; above. 

The BHCA limits the amount of our investment in any company that is not a bank and our ability to engage in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries. This limitation is subject to a number of exceptions. The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999 to be &#8220;so closely related to banking . . . as to be a proper incident thereto.&#8221; This authority would permit us to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a thrift, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage services. The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies. 

Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. We have not elected to operate as a financial holding company. 

Federal law also prohibits any person or company from acquiring &#8220;control&#8221; of an FDIC-insured depository institution or its holding company without prior notice to the appropriate federal bank regulator. &#8220;Control&#8221; is conclusively presumed to exist upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a bank or bank holding company, but may arise under certain circumstances between 10% and 24.99% ownership. 

Capital Requirements. &#32;&#32;Bank holding companies are required to maintain capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy requirements, as affected by the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III. For a discussion of capital requirements, see &#8220;-Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#8221; above. 

Dividend Payments. &#32;&#32; Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies . &#32;&#32;As a Wisconsin corporation, we are subject to the limitations of the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, which prohibit us from paying dividends if such payment would: (i) render us unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or (ii) result in our assets being less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount needed to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of any stockholders with preferential rights superior to those stockholders receiving the dividend. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 attributable to the capital conservation buffer to be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. See &#8220;-Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#8221; above. 

&#32;As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to shareholders if: (i) FBFS&#8217;s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with FBFS&#8217;s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) FBFS will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies. 

Federal Securities Regulation. &#32;&#32; Our common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;). Consequently, FBFS is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act. 

Corporate Governance . &#32;&#32;The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that will affect most U.S. publicly traded companies. The Dodd-Frank Act has increased stockholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments, and authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that allow stockholders to nominate and solicit voters for their own candidates using a company&#8217;s proxy materials. The legislation also directed the Federal Reserve to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of bank holding companies, regardless of whether such companies are publicly traded. 

The Banks 

General. &#32;&#32;The Banks are state-chartered banks, the deposit accounts of which are insured by the FDIC&#8217;s Deposit Insurance Fund (&#8220;DIF&#8221;) to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations. As Wisconsin-chartered FDIC-insured banks, the Wisconsin Banks are subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the WDFI, the chartering authority for Wisconsin banks, and the FDIC, designated by federal law as the primary federal 

regulator of insured state banks that, like the Wisconsin Banks, are not members of the Federal Reserve System (&#8220;non-member banks&#8221;). Alterra is subject to examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the OSBC and is a member of the Federal Reserve System, making the Federal Reserve its primary federal regulator. The Banks are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. 

As of January 1, 2012, FBB had reached total assets of greater than $1 billion, and as a result became subject to further reporting requirements under FDIC rules, specifically 12 C.F.R. Part 363 (&#8220;Annual Independent Audits and Reporting Requirements&#8221;). Pursuant to these rules, management prepares a report that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year. FBB is also required to obtain an independent public accountant&#8217;s attestation report concerning its internal control structure over financial reporting that includes the Reports of Condition and Income (a so-called &#8220;Call Report&#8221;) and/or our FR Y-9C report. In accordance with FDIC rules, we will satisfy these requirements on behalf of FBB. 

Deposit Insurance . &#32;&#32;As FDIC-insured institutions, the Banks are required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC. The FDIC has adopted a risk-based assessment system whereby FDIC-insured institutions pay insurance premiums at rates based on their risk classification. An institution&#8217;s risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators. For deposit insurance assessment purposes, an FDIC-insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories each quarter. An institution&#8217;s assessment is determined by multiplying its assessment rate by its assessment base. The total base assessment rates range from 2.5 basis points to 45 basis points. The assessment base is calculated using average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, will increase or decrease the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking. 

Amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act revised the assessment base against which an FDIC-insured institution&#8217;s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF are calculated to be its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity. This change shifted the burden of deposit insurance premiums toward those large depository institutions that rely on funding sources other than U.S. deposits. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to FDIC-insured institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. In lieu of dividends, the FDIC has adopted progressively lower assessment rate schedules that will take effect when the reserve ratio exceeds 1.15%, 2%, and 2.5%. As a consequence premiums will decrease once the 1.15% threshold is exceeded. The FDIC has until September 3, 2020 to meet the 1.35% reserve ratio target. Several of these provisions could increase West Bank&#8217;s FDIC deposit insurance premiums. 

The Dodd-Frank Act permanently established the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per insured depositor. 

FICO Assessments . &#32; In addition to paying basic deposit insurance assessments, FDIC-insured institutions must pay Financing Corporation (&#8220;FICO&#8221;) assessments. FICO is a mixed-ownership governmental corporation chartered by the former Federal Home Loan Bank Board pursuant to the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 to function as a financing vehicle for the recapitalization of the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FICO issued 30-year noncallable bonds of approximately $8.1 billion that mature in 2017 through 2019. FICO&#8217;s authority to issue bonds ended on December 12, 1991. Since 1996, federal legislation has required that all FDIC-insured institutions pay assessments to cover interest payments on FICO&#8217;s outstanding obligations. The FICO assessment rate is adjusted quarterly and for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 0.60 basis points (60 cents per $100 dollars of assessable deposits). 

&#160; Supervisory Assessments . &#32;&#32;All state-chartered banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the chartering authority to fund their respective operations. The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of total assets. During the year ended December 31, 2015, FBB and FBB - Milwaukee paid supervisory assessments to the WDFI totaling $55,000 &#32;and $11,000 , respectively, and Alterra paid $46,000 &#32;to the OSBC. 

Capital Requirements. &#32;&#32;Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses. For a discussion of capital requirements, see &#8220;-Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#8221; above. 

Liquidity Requirements. &#32;&#32;Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be converted to cash. Liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly if needed to meet financial obligations. To remain viable, FDIC-insured institutions must have enough liquid assets to meet their near-term obligations, such as withdrawals by depositors. Because the global financial crisis was in part a liquidity crisis, Basel III also includes a liquidity framework that requires FDIC-insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. &#32; One test, referred to as &#32; the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (&#8220;LCR&#8221;), is designed to ensure that the banking entity has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario. The other test, known as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (&#8220;NSFR&#8221;), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of FDIC-insured institutions over a one-year horizon. These tests 

provide an incentive for banks and holding companies to increase their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits). 

In addition to liquidity guidelines already in place, the U.S. bank regulatory agencies implemented the Basel III LCR in September 2014, which requires large financial firms to hold levels of liquid assets sufficient to protect against constraints on their funding during times of financial turmoil. While the LCR only applies to the largest banking organizations in the country, certain elements are expected to filter down to all FDIC-insured institutions. We are reviewing our liquidity risk management policies in light of the LCR and NSFR. 

Stress Testing . &#32;&#32;A stress test is an analysis or simulation designed to determine the ability of a given FDIC-insured institution to deal with an economic crisis. In October 2012, U.S. bank regulators unveiled new rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act that require the largest U.S. banks to undergo stress tests twice per year, once internally and once conducted by the regulators and began recommending portfolio stress testing as a sound risk management practice for community banks. While stress tests are not officially required for banks with less than $10 billion in assets, they have become part of annual regulatory exams even for banks small enough to be officially exempted from the process. The FDIC now recommends stress testing as means to identify and quantify loan portfolio risk and the Banks have begun the process. 

Dividend Payments. &#32;&#32;Under Wisconsin banking law, the Wisconsin Banks generally may not pay dividends in excess of their respective undivided profits, and if dividends declared and paid in either of the two immediately preceding years exceeded net income for either of those two years respectively, the Wisconsin Banks may not declare or pay any dividend in the current year that exceeds year-to-date net income. The current dividends of any Kansas-chartered bank must be paid from undivided profits after deducting losses, to be ascertained by generally accepted accounting principles at the time of making such dividend. &#32; The directors of Alterra may declare dividends from the undivided profits, but before the declaration of any dividend Alterra must transfer 25% of its net profits since the last preceding dividend to its surplus fund, until the surplus fund equals the total capital stock. 

The various bank regulatory agencies have authority to prohibit banks under their jurisdiction from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. Under certain circumstances, the payment of a dividend by any of our Banks could be considered an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event that: (i) the FDIC or the WDFI or OSBC increase minimum required levels of capital; (ii) the total assets of a Bank increases significantly; (iii) the income of a Bank decreases significantly; or (iv) any combination of the foregoing occurs, then the board of directors of the Bank may decide or be required by the FDIC or the WDFI or OSBC to retain a greater portion of that Bank&#8217;s earnings, thereby reducing or eliminating dividends. 

The payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and a financial institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 attributable to the capital conservation buffer to be phased in over three years beginning in 2016. See &#8220;-Regulatory Emphasis on Capital&#8221; above. Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, the FDIC may prohibit the payment of dividends by the Banks if it determines such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. 

Insider Transactions. &#32;&#32;The Banks are subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; between the Banks and its &#8220;affiliates.&#8221; We are an affiliate of the Banks for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to us, investments in our stock or other securities and the acceptance of our stock or other securities as collateral for loans made by the Banks. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. 

Limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by each Bank to its directors and officers, to our directors and officers and our subsidiaries, to our principal shareholders and to &#8220;related interests&#8221; of such directors, officers and principal shareholders. In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of FBFS or the Banks, or a principal shareholder of FBFS, may obtain credit from banks with which the Banks maintains a correspondent relationship. 

Safety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. &#32;&#32;The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of FDIC-insured depository institutions. The guidelines set forth standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings. 

In general, the safety and soundness guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each FDIC-insured institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals. If an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines, its primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving 

and maintaining compliance. If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency. Until the deficiency cited in the regulator&#8217;s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the institution&#8217;s rate of growth, require the institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances. Noncompliance with the standards established by the safety and soundness guidelines may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments. 

During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions they supervise. Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets. The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, and reputational risk. In particular, recent regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses. New products and services, third-party risk management and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that financial institutions are expected to address in the current environment. The Banks are expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures, and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring, and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls. 

Branching Authority . &#32; &#32;The Banks have the authority under Wisconsin and Kansas laws to establish branches anywhere in their home state, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) state law limitations requiring the merging banks to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. The establishment of new interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) has historically been permitted only in those states the laws of which expressly authorize such expansion. However, the Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new branches across state lines without these impediments. 

Transaction Account Reserves. &#32;&#32;Federal Reserve regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). For 2016: the first $15.2 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from reserves and have a zero percent reserve requirement; for transaction accounts aggregating more than $15.2 million to $110.2 million, the reserve requirement is 3% of total transaction accounts; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million, the reserve requirement is 3% up to $110.2 million plus 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction accounts in excess of $110.2 million. These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Wisconsin Banks are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago and Alterra is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka (collectively, the &#8220;FHLB&#8221;), which serve as central credit facilities for their members. The FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of obligations of the FHLB system. They make loans to member banks in the form of FHLB advances. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully collateralized as determined by the FHLB. &#32;&#32; 

Community Reinvestment Act Requirements. &#32;&#32;The Community Reinvestment Act requires each Bank to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Federal regulators regularly assess each Bank&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Banks&#8217; effectiveness in meeting its Community Reinvestment Act requirements. 

Anti-Money Laundering. &#32;&#32;The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the &#8220;Patriot Act&#8221;) is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for FDIC-insured institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The Patriot Act mandates financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between institutions and law enforcement authorities. 

Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate. &#32;&#32;Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment. A concentration in commercial real estate is one example of regulatory concern. The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (&#8220;CRE 

Guidance&#8221;) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital. The CRE Guidance does not limit banks&#8217; levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations. On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards. The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending. In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk. We do not expect the CRE Guidance to adversely affect our operations or our ability to execute our growth strategy. 

Consumer Financial Services. The historical structure of federal consumer protection regulation applicable to all providers of consumer financial products and services changed significantly on July 21, 2011, when the CFPB commenced operations to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all providers of consumer products and services, including the Banks, as well as the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over providers with more than $10 billion in assets. FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, like the Banks, continue to be examined by their applicable bank regulators. 

Because abuses in connection with residential mortgages were a significant factor contributing to the global financial crisis, many new rules issued by the CFPB and required by the Dodd-Frank Act address mortgage and mortgage-related products, their underwriting, origination, servicing and sales. The Dodd-Frank Act significantly expanded underwriting requirements applicable to loans secured by 1-4 family residential real property and augmented federal law combating predatory lending practices. In addition to numerous disclosure requirements, the Dodd&#8209;Frank Act imposed new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including all FDIC-insured institutions, in an effort to strongly encourage lenders to verify a borrower&#8217;s &#8220;ability to repay,&#8221; while also establishing a presumption of compliance for certain &#8220;qualified mortgages.&#8221; In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act generally required lenders or securitizers to retain an economic interest in the credit risk relating to loans that the lender sells, and other asset&#8209;backed securities that the securitizer issues, if the loans have not complied with the ability-to-repay standards. Due to our limited consumer mortgage portfolio, we do not currently expect these provisions to have a significant impact on our operations; however, additional compliance resources will be needed to monitor changes.
