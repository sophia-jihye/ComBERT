 Item 1. Business 

General 

Harley-Davidson Motor Company was founded in 1903. Harley-Davidson, Inc. was incorporated in 1981, at which time it purchased the Harley-Davidson &#174; &#32;motorcycle business from AMF Incorporated in a management buyout. In 1986, Harley-Davidson, Inc. became publicly held. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the &#8220;Company&#8221; include Harley-Davidson, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. Harley-Davidson, Inc. is the parent company for the groups of companies doing business as Harley-Davidson Motor Company (HDMC) and Harley-Davidson Financial Services (HDFS). 

Segments 

The Company operates in two reportable segments: the Motorcycles &#38; Related Products (Motorcycles) segment and the Financial Services segment. While the two segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services and are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations, the two segments work closely together as described below. 

The Motorcycles segment consists of HDMC which designs, manufactures and sells at wholesale on-road Harley-Davidson motorcycles as well as a line of motorcycle parts, accessories, general merchandise and related services. The Company&#8217;s products are sold to retail customers through a network of independent dealers. The Company conducts business on a global basis, with sales in the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific. 

The Financial Services segment consists of HDFS which provides wholesale and retail financing and insurance and insurance-related programs primarily to Harley-Davidson dealers and their retail customers. HDFS conducts business principally in the United States and Canada. 

See Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information related to the Company&#8217;s reportable segments and revenue by geographic area. 

Strategy

Harley-Davidson manufactures cruiser and touring motorcycles that feature classic styling, innovative design, distinctive sound, and superior quality with the ability to customize. The Company primarily produces on-road motorcycles with engine displacements of 601cc and greater. Its engines range in displacement from 494cc to 1802cc. 

The on-road motorcycle market is comprised of the following categories: 

&#8226; 

Cruiser (emphasizes styling and owner customization); 

&#8226; 

Touring (emphasizes rider comfort and load capacity and incorporates features such as saddlebags, fairings, or large luggage compartments); 

&#8226; 

Standard (a basic motorcycle which usually features upright seating for one or two passengers); 

&#8226; 

Sportbike (incorporates racing technology, aerodynamic styling, low handlebars with a &#8220;sport&#8221; riding position and high performance tires); and 

&#8226; 

Dual (designed with the capability for use on public roads as well as for some off-highway recreational use). 

The cruiser and touring categories were pioneered by the Company. In 2014, the Company unveiled Project LiveWire&#8482;, an electric motorcycle it is developing and continues to evaluate for possible distribution. 

Competition in the motorcycle markets in which the Company competes is based upon a number of factors, including product capabilities and features, styling, price, quality, reliability, warranty, availability of financing, and quality of dealer network. The Company believes its motorcycles continue to generally command a premium price at retail relative to competitors&#8217; motorcycles. The Company emphasizes remarkable styling, customization, innovation, sound, quality, and reliability in its products and generally offers a two-year warranty for its motorcycles. The Company considers the availability of a line of motorcycle parts and accessories and general merchandise, the availability of financing through HDFS and its global network of premium dealers to be competitive advantages. 

In 2015 , the U.S. and European markets accounted for approximately 78% &#32;of the total annual independent dealer retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The Company also competes in other markets around the world. The most significant other markets for the Company, based on the Company's retail sales data, are Japan, Australia and Canada. 

Harley-Davidson has been the historical market share leader in the U.S. 601+cc motorcycle market. According to the Motorcycle Industry Council (MIC), the cruiser and touring categories accounted for approximately 76% &#32;of total 2015 &#32;601+cc retail unit registrations in the U.S. During 2015 , the 601+cc portion of the market represented approximately 85% &#32;of the total U.S. motorcycle market in terms of new units registered.

This third party data is subject to revision and update. The retail registration data for Harley-Davidson motorcycles presented in this table will differ from the Harley-Davidson retail sales data presented in Item 7 of this report.

In addition, some differences may arise related to the timing of data submissions to the independent sources. 

Licensing &#32;&#8211; The Company creates an awareness of the Harley-Davidson brand among its customers and the non-riding public through a wide range of products for enthusiasts by licensing the name &#8220;Harley-Davidson&#8221; and other trademarks owned by the Company. Royalty revenues from licensing, included in Motorcycles segment net revenue, were $46.5 million , $47.1 million &#32;and $58.9 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Other Products and Services &#32;&#8211; The Company provides a variety of services to its independent dealers including motorcycle service and business management training programs and customized dealer software packages. 

Patents and Trademarks &#32;&#8211; The Company strategically manages its portfolio of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property. 

The Company and its subsidiaries own, and continue to obtain, patent rights that relate to its motorcycles and related products and processes for their production. Certain technology-related intellectual property is also protected, where appropriate, by license agreements, confidentiality agreements or other agreements with suppliers, employees and other third parties. The Company diligently protects its intellectual property, including patents and trade secrets, and its rights to innovative and proprietary technology and designs. This protection, including enforcement, is important as the Company moves forward with investments in new products, designs and technologies. While the Company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, the success of the business is not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. The Company&#8217;s active patent portfolio has an average age for patents of approximately seven and a half years. A patent review committee manages the patent strategy and portfolio of the Company. 

Trademarks are important to the Company&#8217;s motorcycle business and licensing activities. The Company has a vigorous worldwide program of trademark registration and enforcement to maintain and strengthen the value of the trademarks and prevent the unauthorized use of those trademarks. The HARLEY-DAVIDSON trademark and the Bar and Shield trademark are each highly recognizable to the public and are very valuable assets. Additionally, the Company uses numerous other trademarks, trade names and logos which are registered worldwide. The following are among the Company&#8217;s trademarks: 

HARLEY-DAVIDSON, H-D, HARLEY, the Bar &#38; Shield Logo, MOTORCLOTHES, the MotorClothes Logo, HARLEY OWNERS GROUP, H.O.G., the H.O.G. Logo, SOFTAIL, SPORTSTER and V-ROD. The HARLEY-DAVIDSON trademark has been used since 1903 and the Bar and Shield trademark since at least 1910. Substantially all of the Company&#8217;s trademarks are owned by H-D U.S.A., LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, which also manages the Company&#8217;s trademark strategy and portfolio. 

Customers &#32;&#8211; Harley-Davidson appeals to a diverse range of customers across multiple demographics both in the U.S. and worldwide. 

U.S. retail purchasers of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles include both core and outreach customers. The Company defines its U.S. core customers as Caucasian men over the age of 35 and its U.S. outreach customers as women (Caucasian, age 35+), young adults (ages 18-34), African-American adults (age 35+), and Latino adults (age 35+). In 2014 (which is the most recent data available), for the seventh straight year the Company was the market share leader in U.S. new motorcycle registrations (all cc's) within its core-customer segment and in each outreach customer segment. (Based on the Company's analysis of Polk new motorcycle registration data from IHS Automotive) 

Outside the U.S., the Company's definition of core and outreach customers varies depending on the profile of its customers in each market. In general, the Company defines it core customers outside the U.S. as men over the age of 35 and its outreach customers outside the U.S. as women and young adults. 

Marketing and Customer Experiences &#32;&#8211; The Company&#8217;s products are marketed to retail customers worldwide primarily through digital and experiential activities as well as through more traditional promotional and advertising activities. Additionally, the Company's independent dealers engage in a wide range of local marketing and experiential activities supported by cooperative programs with the Company. 

Customer experiences have traditionally been at the center of much of the Company&#8217;s marketing. To attract customers and achieve its goals, the Company participates in motorcycle rallies around the world and also in major motorcycle consumer shows, racing activities, music festivals, mixed martial arts activities and other special promotional events. 

One of the ways the Company promotes its Harley-Davidson products and the related lifestyle is through the Harley Owners Group (H.O.G. &#174; ), which has approximately 1 million members worldwide, is the industry&#8217;s largest company-sponsored motorcycle enthusiast organization. H.O.G. &#174; &#32;also sponsors many motorcycle events, including rallies and rides for Harley-Davidson motorcycle enthusiasts throughout the world. 

The Company's Harley-Davidson &#174; &#32;Riding Academy offers a series of rider education experiences that provide both new and experienced riders with deeper engagement in the sport of motorcycling by teaching basic and advanced motorcycling skills and knowledge. Since its inception, the program has trained more than 445,000 riders. The courses are conducted by a network of participating Harley-Davidson dealerships throughout the U.S., Canada, South Africa, China, Australia, Mexico and Brazil, enabling students to experience the Harley-Davidson lifestyle, environment, people and products as they learn. 

The Harley-Davidson Authorized Tours program allows motorcyclists/enthusiasts to experience riding opportunities worldwide. Riders can also rent Harley-Davidson motorcycles worldwide from participating dealers through the Company&#8217;s Authorized Rentals Program. 

The Company operates the Harley-Davidson Museum (Museum) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Museum is a unique destination that the Company believes builds and strengthens bonds between riders and Harley-Davidson and enhances the Harley-Davidson brand among the public at large. 

Distribution &#32;&#8211; The Company&#8217;s products are retailed through a network of independent dealers, of which the majority sell Harley-Davidson motorcycles exclusively. These dealerships stock and sell the Company&#8217;s motorcycles, P&#38;A, general merchandise and licensed products, and perform service on Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The Company believes the quality retail experience that its independent dealers provide is a differentiating and strategic advantage for the Company. 

P&#38;A, general merchandise and licensed products are also retailed through eCommerce channels in certain markets. In the U.S., the eCommerce model is facilitated by the Company. Retail internet orders are fulfilled and shipped by the Company, which acts as a limited agent for participating authorized U.S. Harley-Davidson dealers who are the merchant of record for all transactions. In China and India, the eCommerce sites are operated by third-parties. 

The Company distributes its motorcycles and related products to a network of independent dealers located in over 95 countries worldwide. The following table includes the number of worldwide Harley-Davidson independent dealerships by geographic region as of December 31, 2015 :

Retail Customer and Dealer Financing &#32;&#8211; The Company believes that HDFS, as well as other financial services companies, provide adequate financing to Harley-Davidson dealers and their retail customers. HDFS provides financing to Harley-Davidson independent dealers and the retail customers of those dealers in the U.S. and Canada. The Company&#8217;s independent dealers and their retail customers in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America are not directly financed by HDFS, but have access to financing through other established financial services companies, some of which have licensing or branding agreements with the Company. 

Seasonality &#32;&#8211; The timing of retail sales made by the Company&#8217;s independent dealers tracks closely with regional riding seasons. The seasonality of the Company&#8217;s wholesale motorcycle shipments primarily correlates with the timing of retail sales. The Company utilizes its flexible or surge manufacturing capabilities to help align the production and wholesale shipments of its motorcycles with the retail selling season. This allows the Company to minimize inventory levels in the Americas region. In the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, the Company utilizes a distribution process whereby Company-owned inventory is maintained locally at a level sufficient to fulfill dealer orders as needed. 

Motorcycle Manufacturing &#32;&#8211; The Company has a flexible manufacturing process designed to help ensure it is well-positioned to meet customer demand in a timely and cost-effective manner. (1) &#32; This flexible or surge manufacturing capability allows the Company to increase the production of motorcycles ahead of and during the peak retail selling season to more closely correlate the timing of production and wholesale shipments to the retail selling season. 

Most of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located in the U.S. Internationally, the Company operates a CKD (Complete Knock Down) assembly facility in Brazil, which assembles motorcycles sold in Brazil from component kits sourced from the Company&#8217;s U.S. plants and its suppliers. The Company also operates a manufacturing facility in India, which includes both CKD assembly of certain motorcycles for sale in India and production of the Company&#8217;s Street motorcycles for distribution to markets outside of North America. Like its U.S. manufacturing facilities, the Company&#8217;s Brazil and India operations are focused on driving world-class performance with flexible or surge production processes to meet customer demands at reduced lead times. The Company also operates a manufacturing facility in Australia for the purpose of producing certain complex, high-finish wheels for its motorcycles. 

Raw Materials and Purchased Components &#32;&#8211; The Company continues to establish and reinforce long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with its suppliers. Through these collaborative relationships, the Company gains access to technical and commercial resources for application directly to product design, development and manufacturing initiatives. In addition, through a continued focus on collaboration and strong supplier relationships, the Company believes it will be positioned to achieve strategic objectives and deliver cost and quality improvement over the long-term (1) . 

The Company's principal raw materials that are purchased include steel and aluminum castings, forgings, steel sheets, coils and bars. The Company also purchases certain motorcycle components, including, but not limited to, electronic fuel injection systems, batteries, certain wheels, tires, seats, electrical components and instruments. The Company closely monitors the overall viability of its supply base. At this time, the Company does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components (1) . 

Research and Development &#32;&#8211; The Company incurred research and development expenses of $161.2 million , $138.3 million &#32;and $152.2 million &#32;during 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Regulation &#32;&#8211; International, federal, state and local authorities have various environmental control requirements relating to air, water and noise that affect the business and operations of the Company. The Company strives to ensure that its facilities and products comply with all applicable environmental regulations and standards. 

The Company&#8217;s motorcycles that are sold in the United States are subject to certification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for compliance with applicable emissions and noise standards. Harley-Davidson motorcycle products are designed to comply with EPA and CARB standards and the Company believes it will comply with future requirements when they go into effect (1) . Additionally, the Company&#8217;s motorcycle products must comply with the motorcycle emissions, noise and safety standards of Canada, the European Union, Japan, Brazil and certain other foreign markets where they are sold, and the Company believes its products currently comply with those 

standards. Because the Company expects that environmental standards will become more stringent over time, the Company will continue to incur research, development and production costs in this area for the foreseeable future (1) . 

The Company, as a manufacturer of motorcycle products, is subject to the U.S. National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which is administered by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Company has certified to NHTSA that its motorcycle products comply fully with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and related regulations. The Company has from time to time initiated certain voluntary recalls. During the last three years, the Company has initiated 27 &#32;voluntary recalls related to Harley-Davidson motorcycles at a total cost of $58.1 million . The Company reserves for all estimated costs associated with recalls in the period that management approves and commits to the recall. 

Employees &#32;&#8211; As of December 31, 2015 , the Motorcycles segment had approximately 5,700 employees. 

Approximately 2,400 unionized employees at the manufacturing facilities are represented as follows: 

&#8226; 

York, Pennsylvania - represented by International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers (IAM), and the collective bargaining agreement will expire on October 15, 2022 

&#8226; 

Kansas City, Missouri - represented by United Steelworkers of America (USW), and IAM and the respective collective bargaining agreements will expire on July 31, 2018 

&#8226; 

Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin - represented by USW, and IAM and the respective collective bargaining agreements will expire on March 31, 2019 

&#8226; 

Tomahawk, Wisconsin - represented by USW, and the collective bargaining agreement will expire on March 31, 2019 

Financial Services Segment 

HDFS is engaged in the business of financing and servicing wholesale inventory receivables and retail consumer loans, primarily for the purchase of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. HDFS is an agent for certain unaffiliated insurance companies providing motorcycle insurance and protection products to motorcycle owners. HDFS conducts business principally in the United States and Canada. The Company&#8217;s independent dealers and their retail customers in EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America are not financed by HDFS, but have access to financing through other third-party financial institutions, some of which have licensing or branding agreements with the Company or HDFS. 

Wholesale Financial Services &#32;&#8211; HDFS provides wholesale financial services to Harley-Davidson dealers, including floorplan and open account financing of motorcycles and motorcycle parts and accessories. HDFS offers wholesale financial services to Harley-Davidson dealers in the United States and Canada, and during 2015 , 100% &#32;of such dealers utilized those services at some point during the year. HDFS also previously offered financial services to the Harley-Davidson distributor in Canada. The wholesale finance operations of HDFS are located in Plano, Texas. 

Retail Financial Services &#32;&#8211; HDFS provides retail financing to consumers, consisting primarily of installment lending for the purchase of new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. HDFS&#8217; retail financial services are available through most Harley-Davidson dealerships in the United States and Canada. HDFS&#8217; retail finance operations are principally located in Carson City, Nevada and Plano, Texas. 

Insurance Services &#32;&#8211; HDFS operates as an agent for certain unaffiliated insurance companies offering point-of-sale protection products through most Harley-Davidson dealers in both the U.S. and Canada, including motorcycle insurance, extended service contracts, credit protection and motorcycle maintenance protection. HDFS also direct-markets motorcycle insurance and extended service contracts to owners of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. In addition, HDFS markets a comprehensive package of business insurance coverages and services to owners of Harley-Davidson dealerships. The HDFS insurance operations are located in Carson City, Nevada and Chicago, Illinois. &#160; 

Licensing &#8211; &#32; HDFS has licensing arrangements with third-party financial institutions that issue credit cards bearing the Harley-Davidson brand. Internationally, HDFS licenses the Harley-Davidson brand to local third-party financial institutions that offer products to the Company&#8217;s retail customers such as financing and insurance. 

Funding &#32;&#8211; The Company believes a diversified and cost effective funding strategy is important to meet HDFS&#8217; goal of providing credit while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. Financial Services operations have been funded with unsecured debt, unsecured commercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities, committed unsecured bank facilities, term asset-backed securitizations and intercompany borrowings. 

Competition &#32;&#8211; The Company regards its ability to offer a package of wholesale and retail financial services in the U.S. and Canada as a significant competitive advantage. Additionally, as the predominant lender to sub-prime customers for the purchase of motorcycles in the U.S. and Canada, HDFS enables retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles with very attractive financial returns. Competitors in the financial services industry compete for business based largely on price and, to a 

lesser extent, service. HDFS competes on convenience, service, brand association, dealer relations, industry experience, terms and price. 

In the United States, HDFS financed 62.2% &#32;of the new Harley-Davidson motorcycles retailed by independent dealers during 2015 , compared to 56.8% &#32;in 2014 . In Canada, HDFS financed 39.2% &#32;of the new Harley-Davidson motorcycles retailed by independent dealers during 2015 , compared to 34.0% &#32;in 2014 . Competitors for retail motorcycle finance business are primarily banks, credit unions and other financial institutions. In the motorcycle insurance business, competition primarily comes from national insurance companies and from insurance agencies serving local or regional markets. For insurance-related products such as extended service contracts, HDFS faces competition from certain regional and national industry participants as well as dealer in-house programs. Competition for the wholesale motorcycle finance business primarily consists of banks and other financial institutions providing wholesale financing to Harley-Davidson dealers in their local markets. 

Trademarks &#32;&#8211; HDFS uses various trademarks and trade names for its financial services and products which are licensed from H-D U.S.A., LLC, including HARLEY-DAVIDSON, H-D and the Bar &#38; Shield logo. 

Seasonality &#32;&#8211; HDFS experiences seasonal variations in retail financing activities based on the timing of regional riding seasons in the U.S. and Canada. In general, from mid-March through August, retail financing volume is greatest. HDFS wholesale financing volume is affected by inventory levels at Harley-Davidson dealers. Although the Company's surge production capabilities help reduce seasonal fluctuations in dealer inventory levels for new motorcycles, dealers generally have higher inventory levels of new and used motorcycles in the late fall and winter than during the spring and summer riding season. As a result, wholesale financing volume is higher during fall and winter as compared to the rest of the year. 

Regulation &#32;&#8211; The operations of HDFS (both U.S. and foreign) are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal administrative agencies and various foreign governmental authorities. Many of the statutory and regulatory requirements imposed by such entities are in place to provide consumer protection as it pertains to the selling and ongoing servicing of financial products and services. Therefore, operations may be subject to various regulations, laws and judicial and/or administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions, which among other things: (a) regulate credit granting activities, including establishing licensing requirements, in applicable jurisdictions; (b) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; (c) regulate customers&#8217; insurance coverage; (d) require disclosure of credit and insurance terms to customers; (e) govern secured transactions; (f) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices; (g) prohibit discrimination in the extension of credit and administration of loans; (h) regulate the use and reporting of information related to a borrower; (i) require certain periodic reporting; (j) govern the use and protection of non-public personal information; (k) regulate the use of information reported to the credit reporting agencies; (l) regulate the reporting of information to the credit reporting agencies; and/or (m) regulate insurance solicitation and sales practices. 

Depending on the provisions of the applicable laws and regulations, the interpretation of laws and regulations and the specific facts and circumstances involved, violations of or non-compliance with these laws may limit the ability of HDFS to collect all or part of the principal or interest on applicable loans. In addition, these violations or non-compliance may entitle the borrower to rescind the loan or to obtain a refund of amounts previously paid, could subject HDFS to the payment of damages or penalties and administrative sanctions, including &#8220;cease and desist&#8221; orders, and could limit the number of loans eligible for HDFS securitization programs. 

Such regulatory requirements and associated supervision could limit the discretion of HDFS in operating its business. Noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of any charter, license or registration at issue, as well as the imposition of civil fines, criminal penalties and administrative sanctions. The Company cannot assure that the applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed in ways that are adverse to HDFS, that new laws or regulations will not be adopted in the future, or that laws or regulations will not attempt to limit the interest rates charged by HDFS, any of which may adversely affect the business of HDFS or its results of operations. 

A subsidiary of HDFS, Eaglemark Savings Bank (ESB), is a Nevada state thrift chartered as an Industrial Loan Company (ILC). As such, the activities of this subsidiary are governed by federal laws and regulations as well as State of Nevada banking laws, and are subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Nevada state bank examiners. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which was passed into law in 2010, granted the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) significant supervisory, enforcement, and rule-making authority in the area of consumer financial products and services. While direct supervision of ESB will remain with the FDIC and the State of Nevada, certain CFPB regulations will directly impact HDFS and its operations. On September 17, 2014, the CFPB proposed a rule that would expand the scope of its supervisory authority to include non-bank larger participants in the vehicle financing market. This proposed rule became effective on August 31, 2015, giving the CFPB supervisory authority over a non-bank subsidiary of HDFS, allowing the CFPB to conduct comprehensive and rigorous on-site examinations that could result in enforcement 

actions, fines, regulatorily-mandated changes to processes and procedures, product-related changes or consumer refunds, or other actions. 

ESB originates retail loans and sells the loans to a non-banking subsidiary of HDFS. This process allows HDFS to offer retail products with many common characteristics across the United States and to similarly service loans to U.S. retail customers. 

Employees &#32;&#8211; As of December 31, 2015 , the Financial Services segment had approximately 600 &#32;employees.
