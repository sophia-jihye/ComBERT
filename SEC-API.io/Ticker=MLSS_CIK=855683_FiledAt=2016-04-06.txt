As of December 31, 2015, Milestone Scientific consolidated the financial statements of Milestone Medical Inc. (&#8220;Milestone Medical&#8221;) into its financial statements as a variable interest entity. Milestone Medical is a 49.98% owned subsidiary of Milestone Scientific, which develops, commercializes, manufactures and markets epidural and intra-articular injection medical instruments (see Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 

BUSINESS

Background

Since its inception, Milestone Scientific has engaged in pioneering proprietary, innovative, computer-controlled injection technologies and solutions for the medical and dental markets. Milestone Scientific has focused its energy and resources on redefining the worldwide standard of care for injection techniques by making the experience more comfortable for the patient and by reducing the anxiety and stress of administering injections for the healthcare provider. 

Milestone Scientific and its technology are widely recognized by key opinion leaders, industry experts and medical and dental practitioners as the noted leader in the emerging, high growth, computer-controlled injection industry; and remains intent on expanding the use and application of its proprietary, patented technologies to achieve greater operational efficiencies, enhanced patient safety and therapeutic adherence, and improved quality of care within a broad range of medical disciplines.

In 1997, Milestone Scientific first introduced The Wand&#174; ( CompuDent&#174; instrument) and the disposable Wand&#174; handpiece. CompuDent&#174; provides painless injections for all routine dental treatments, including implants, root canals, crowns, fillings and cleanings. Milestone Scientific&#8217;s Computer-Controlled Local Anesthetic Delivery (C-CLAD) instrument handpiece does not look or feel like a syringe. And, what&#8217;s more, it works better than a syringe, resulting in a more pleasant experience for the patient and practitioner. 

Milestone Scientific subsequently expanded its product offerings with the introduction of the CompuMed&#174; advanced injection instrument, designed for use in a wide range of applications within the medical industry, including cosmetic surgery, hair restoration surgery, podiatry, colorectal surgery, nasal and sinus surgery, dermatology and orthopedics, among others. 

In 2007, Milestone Scientific received FDA 510(k) Pre-market clearance for marketing and sale of the STA instruments, (dental instrument). Milestone Scientific introduced the instrument to the market in February 2007 and this instrument is currently being marketed throughout the world.

&#160;

Central to Milestone Scientific&#8217;s intellectual property platform and current product development strategy is its patented CompuFlo&#174; technology for the precise delivery of medicaments . The C ompuFlo&#174; pressure/force Computer-Controlled Local Anesthetic Delivery (C-CLAD) technology is an advanced, patented and FDA-approved medical technology for the painless and accurate delivery of drugs, anesthetics and other medicaments into all tissue types, as well as for the aspiration of bodily fluids or previously injected substances. Its regulation and control of flow rate continues to provide the CompuDent&#174; benefits of painless injections, while its Dynamic Pressure Sensing &#174; capability provides visual and audible in-tissue pressure feedback, identifying tissue types to the healthcare provider. This pressure feedback extends the benefit of painlessness from anesthetics with known viscosities to a wide range of liquid drugs an d other medicaments with varying viscosities and flow rates. Dynamic Pressure Sensing also allows the healthcare provider to know when certain types of tissues have been penetrated and permits the healthcare provider to inject medicaments precisely at the desired location. Thus, pressure feedback can prevent the suffusion of tissue outside the intended target area, a vitally important characteristic in the injection of chemotherapeutics and other toxic substances. 

The CompuFlo&#174; technology consists of two critical elements. One element is the ability to determine exit pressure In Situ (in the injection site tissue) at the tip of the needle. This minimizes tissue damage (and eliminates the pain of the injection) because the flow rate and pressure of the injection are controlled. The other critical element of the technology is an integrated injection database of algorithms that have been defined which allow for the measurement of the exit pressure. This database of algorithms contains the critical components of specific drugs, parameters of needles, tubing and syringes and all other pertinent components for the safe and efficacious delivery of medications for all procedures.

The CompuFlo&#174; technology also consists of a disposable injection handpiece that provides for precise tactile control during the injection, an electromechanical (computer-controlled) fluid delivery instrument and the ability to record data from the injection event. As confirmed by numerous noted medical and dental experts within academia and the clinical practice arenas, CompuFlo&#174; has the potential to greatly increase the safety and efficacy of many drug delivery procedures that currently rely upon the over 150-year-old hypodermic syringe technology and the tactile senses and delivery expertise of the administrator.

On September 14, 2004, Milestone Scientific was issued United States Patent No. 6,786,885 for the CompuFlo&#174; technology, entitled &#8220;Pressure/Force Computer Controlled Drug Delivery Instrument with Exit Pressure.&#8221; Proprietary software, working with an innovative technology, allows the instrument to continuously monitor and control the exit pressure of fluid and/or medication during an injection. This same technology also enables doctors to accurately identify different tissue types based on exit pressure during an injection. The technology has numerous applications in both medicine and dentistry, including epidural and intra-articular injections.

In December 2004, the United States Patent Office issued a &#8220;Notice of Allowance&#8221; for patent protection on two additional critical elements of the CompuFlo&#174; automated drug delivery technology: &#8220;Drug Delivery Instrument with Profiles&#8221; and &#8220;Pressure/Force Computer Controlled Drug Delivery with Automated Charging&#8221;.

In December 2005, Milestone Scientific submitted a pre-market notification to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on its CompuFlo&#174; technology, which was subsequently cleared by the FDA in July of 2006. This initial submission was critical for Milestone Scientific&#8217;s continuing efforts to develop and commercialize this important technology. Milestone Scientific has identified a number of potential applications for CompuFlo&#174; , including single-tooth dental injections, self-administered drug delivery, osteoarthritis joint pain management and epidurals. 

Given Milestone Scientific&#8217;s experience and established brand awareness within the dental industry, it elected to focus its initial product development efforts on the integration of CompuFlo&#174; into its legacy computer-controlled dental injection instrument. As a result, Milestone Scientific developed the industry&#8217;s first solution for painlessly administering a single-tooth injection as the only injection necessary for achieving anesthesia, foregoing the need to administer a traditional nerve branch block. This new instrument, which also provides for use of a disposable handpiece, was trademarked the &#8220; STA Single Tooth Anesthesia Instrument &#8482; ,&#8221; now more commonly known as The Wand&#174; STA Instrument .

After receiving FDA 510(k) Pre-market Notification acceptance for the marketing and sale of the STA Instrument, Milestone Scientific introduced the instrument to market in February 2007 at the Chicago Dental Society&#8217;s 143 rd 

&#160;

Midwinter Meeting. The patented STA Instrument incorporates the "pressure feedback" elements of Milestone Scientific's patented CompuFlo&#174; technology, thereby allowing dentists to administer injections accurately and painlessly into the periodontal ligament space, effectively anesthetizing a single tooth. This injection is of sig nificant value in that it allows the dentist to profoundly anesthetize the tooth within one or two minutes, versus up to 15-18 minutes for a block injection to take effect. Utilizing the STA Instrument single tooth injection, the patient will suffer neithe r pain nor collateral anesthesia in the cheek, lips or tongue at any time. The STA Instrument is capable of performing all of the injections that can be done with a conventional dental syringe, including the palatal-anterior superior alveolar, anterior mid dle superior alveolar and inferior alveolar nerve block. The STA Instrument achieves these injections predictably and reliably. 

Initial market response to the STA Instrument following its commercial debut in February 2007 proved to be less than robust. Moreover, at that time, Milestone Scientific had granted exclusive U.S. and Canadian distribution and marketing rights for the STA Instrument to Henry Schein, Inc., the largest distributor of healthcare products and services to office-based practitioners in the combined North American and European markets. Following several months of lackluster sales and after making critical senior management changes, Milestone Scientific initiated an in-depth market study to reassess its positioning and marketing strategies for the STA Instrument . The insight gained from this study led management to redefine and implement a new messaging platform, created to emphasize key benefits that Milestone Scientific discovered are of most value to dental professionals. This new product messaging was launched in January 2008 and has remained in constant review.

In the spring of 2009, Milestone Scientific signed an Exclusive Distribution and Marketing Agreement with China National Medicines Corporation, dba Sinopharm, which is China&#8217;s largest domestic manufacturer, distributor and marketer of pharmaceuticals and importer of medical devices and the country&#8217;s largest domestic distributor of dental anesthetic carpules to the Chinese dental industry. Prior to the end of 2009, China National Medicines issued Milestone Scientific a blanket purchase order for 12,000 STA instruments and related handpieces to be delivered over 36 months, thereby marking Milestone Scientific&#8217;s initial penetration into China&#8217;s emerging dental market. The agreement was terminated in September 2014 and a new distributor, Milestone China Ltd. became the distributor for the STA Instruments and handpieces in China. Milestone China is owned forty (36) percent by Milestone Scientific. 

In early October 2012, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of the People&#8217;s Republic of China approved Milestone Scientific&#8217;s Single Tooth Anesthesia System &#8482; (STA System). Unfortunately, the SFDA bifurcated approval of the STA Systems from The Wand&#174; handpieces. CFDA, (previously the SFDA), approval of The Wand&#174; handpieces was received in May 2014 and the distribution of these handpieces has begun in China

According to a 2011 report published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, titled &#8220;China&#8217;s Emerging Markets: Opportunities in the Dental and Dental Lab Industry,&#8221; China&#8217;s dental market lags behind other healthcare services and has largely been neglected in the past. In fact, CS Market Research reports that &#8220;of China&#8217;s 1.3 billion plus population, 50% of the adults and 70% of the children are estimated to have decayed tooth problems, and over 90% have periodontal disease.&#8221; However, with increasing affluence of the Chinese population, as well as increasing attention towards personal care, demand for dental services has been growing. Market research firm Freedonia agrees, noting that demand for dental products in China is expected to climb due primarily to escalating personal income levels and government programs promoting awareness of the benefits of good oral care. 

Shortly before the end of the second quarter of 2009, Milestone Scientific elected to refine its international marketing strategy to gain greater access to and penetration of the international dental markets. The new sales strategy provides for increasing hands-on oversight and support of its existing international distribution network, while also attracting new distributors throughout Europe, Asia and South America. 

In November 2012, Milestone Scientific signed an exclusive distributor and marketing agreement with a well-known US domestic manufacturer and distributor, for the sale and distribution of the STA instrument and handpieces in the United States and Canada. The marketing initiative will include participation in U.S. and Canadian dental shows, as well as pediatric dental shows; an active advertising initiative targeting major dental publications; and direct mailing campaigns to over 150,000 dentists across the U.S. and Canada. The exclusive distributor and marketing agreement was converted to a non-exclusive agreement on December 31, 2015. In addition, on January 1, 2016 Henry Schein was added as an additional non-exclusive distributor of the STA instruments and handpieces in the United States and Canada.

&#160;

In May of 2014, Milestone Scientific completed a private placement, which raised gross proceeds in the total of $10 million, for the sale of $3 million of common stock (2 million shares at $1.50 pe r share) and $7 million on the sale of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, convertible into common stock at $2.545 per share on May 14, 2019, or $1.50 per share unless certain conditions are not met, both subject to an anti-dilution adjustment. 

In January of 2015, Milestone Scientific added a President, a full time CEO for Wand Dental, a Senior Business Brand Manager, and a Senior Manager, Project Management. The increase in staffing is to support the growth of the company&#8217;s initiative in our CompuFlo&#174; software for anticipated new medical and dental instruments.

CompuFlo&#174; Advanced Injection Technology &#8211; Core Technology

The CompuFlo&#174; technology is patented and embedded in the STA Instrument that is being sold worldwide in the dental market. CompuFlo&#174; technology has been tried and proven in human and animal studies, as well as by dentists in most parts of the world who are using the STA Instrument in their practices. 

CompuFlo&#174; is a revolutionary new technology for injections. CompuFlo&#174; enables health care practitioners to monitor and precisely control &#8220;pressure,&#8221; &#8220;rate&#8221; and &#8220;volume&#8221; during all injections and can be used to inject all liquid medicaments as well as anesthetics. CompuFlo&#174; can also be used to aspirate body fluids. 

Negative side effects from the use of traditional hypodermic drug delivery injection instruments are well documented in dental and medical literature and include risk of death, transient or permanent paralysis, pain, tissue damage and post-operative complications. The pain and tissue damage are a direct result of uncontrolled flow rates and pressures that are created during the administration of drug solutions into human tissue. While several technologies have been capable of controlling flow rate, the ability to accurately and precisely control pressure has been unobtainable until the development of CompuFlo&#174;. 

Precisely controlling in-tissue pressure increases patient safety by reducing the risk of tissue damage and post-treatment pain related to excessive pressure that may occur during certain injections. Identification of the tissue, in which the needle tip is imbedded, is believed to be highly important in epidural injections, intra-articular injections and numerous organ, subcutaneous and intramuscular injections. 

CompuFlo&#174; pressure sensing technology provides an objective tool that consistently and accurately identifies the epidural space by detecting the difference in pressure between the ligamentum flavum and the extraligamentary tissue. In studies utilizing the CompuFlo&#174; technology the epidural space has been correctly identified 100% of the time. Knowing the precise location of a needle during an epidural injection procedure provides a measure of safety not presently available to doctors using conventional syringes, who identify the epidural space by relying on the subjective perception of loss of resistance to saline. 

In the absence of curative procedures, arthritis patients are obliged to endure multiple painful injections annually for a lifetime. Often these injections are not efficacious, because the doctor using a syringe failed to locate the intra-articular space or did not inject the appropriate volume of hyaluronic acid or other medicament into that space. The CompuFlo&#174; technology has been successful in administering viscous hyaluronic acid and other medicaments into the intra-articular space in both small and large joints using its computer-controlled pressure sensing capabilities in an independent animal study.

There are a number of injectable drugs routinely self-administered in a home or office setting using spring loaded automatic injection devices by people who suffer from long term chronic conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, diseases of the auto immune system and Rheumatoid Arthritis. The CompuFlo&#174; technology, using pressure sensing capabilities, can serve as a painless subcutaneous injection method for these self-administered drugs. A significant reduction in pain during delivery should have a positive impact on compliance, which is a major consideration when physicians are treating patients. 

&#160;

Milestone Medical Inc. 

In March 2011, Milestone Scientific entered into a joint venture agreement with Beijing 3H (Heart-Help-Health) Scientific Technology Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Beijing 3H&#8221;) for the development, commercialization, manufacture and marketing of an epidural and intra-articular injection instruments. Milestone Scientific, with the consent of the investors, organized a domestic research and development joint venture corporation, now known as Milestone Medical (&#8220;Milestone Medical&#8221;). Milestone Scientific held a 50% interest in Milestone Medical, and collectively, certain shareholders of Beijing 3H and a group of individual investors, including a large shareholder in Milestone Scientific, who is also a principal of a supplier to Milestone Scientific, also held a 50% interest in Milestone Medical.

The joint venture agreement provided for Milestone Scientific&#8217;s contribution of an exclusive worldwide royalty-free license to use its patents. Shareholders of Beijing 3H, and a group of individual investors contributed $1.5 million to Milestone Medical to design and develop two commercial instruments using Milestone&#8217;s CompuFlo&#174; technology and disposables. Milestone Scientific has distribution responsibility in the U.S. and Canada. Milestone Medical has distribution responsibility for the rest of the world, except that Beijing 3H had rights to distribute products exclusively in the People&#8217;s Republic of China, Macao, Hong Kong and other regions of Asia. In September 2014, the shareholders of Beijing 3H sold their shares in Milestone Medical (shares individually owned by two shareholders of Beijing 3H to other founding investors). Along with selling their shares, the joint venture agreement and their distribution responsibilities for the medical instruments was terminated. Subsequently, in 2015 Milestone Medical entered into an agreement with Milestone China Ltd. (Hong Kong Company) (&#8220;Milestone China&#8221;), forty (40) percent owned by Milestone Scientific, to distribute both medical instruments in the People&#8217;s Republic of China, Macao, Hong Kong and other regions of Asia.

In the fourth quarter of 2013, Milestone Medical sold 2 million shares of its common stock for $1.50 per share in a private placement transaction in Poland. As a result of the sale Milestone Medical received net proceeds of $2,363,000. The effect of the sale reduced Milestone Scientific&#8217;s ownership from 50% to 45.5% post transaction.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, Milestone Scientific purchased an additional 995,000 shares of Milestone Medical from another shareholder for $447,750 ($0.45 per share), which increased its percentage of ownership to 49.98% of Milestone Medical.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, Milestone Medical has been consolidated as a subsidiary of Milestone Scientific as they were determined to be the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. (See Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements)

Instruments Platform-Medical and Dental

Milestone Scientific has developed and brought to market a highly differentiated portfolio of industry innovations. Milestone Scientific&#8217;s proprietary solutions have succeeded in elevating the innovation in the professional dental arena. The product portfolio includes:

STA Single Tooth Anesthesia Instrument &#8482; 

The STA Single Tooth Anesthesia Instrument&#8482; (STA Instrument) is a patented, computer-controlled local anesthesia delivery instrument that incorporates the &#8220;pressure feedback&#8221; elements of Milestone Scientific&#8217;s patented CompuFlo&#174; technology, thereby allowing dentists to administer injections accurately into the periodontal ligament space, effectively anesthetizing a single tooth. While the periodontal ligament injection has been available for some time, there has been no effective technology that allows dentists to easily perform the procedure painlessly, safely and predictably until now. With this STA Instrument dentists can easily and predictably anesthetize a single tooth root in one minute as the primary and sole injection, as compared to a general blocking injection with a waiting time of up to 18 minutes (or longer if the blocking injection needs to be re-administered) before proceeding to perform a procedure on the targeted tooth. An instrument which allows dentists to effectively anesthetize a single tooth will greatly enhance the productivity of dental practices and, when combined with the painless injection capabilities already present in the CompuDent&#174; instrument, such an instrument should provide a compelling value in the marketplace. The STA Instrument will generate recurring revenues from per-patient disposable handpieces.

&#160;

Since its market introduction in the spring of 2007, the STA Instrument has received favorable reviews and awards from the dental industry. In July 2007, noted industry publication Dentistry Today featured the STA Instrument as one of the &#8220;Top 100 Products in 2007,&#8221; helping to promote much broader recognition of the instrument and validating STA &#8217;s value proposition for dentists and patients, alike. In ear ly 2008, Medical Device &#38; Diagnostic Industry magazine distinguished the STA Instrument as a 2008 Medical Design Excellence Award winner in the &#8220;Dental Instruments, Equipment and Supplies&#8221; product category. Of the 33 products to receive this coveted award , the STA was one of only two winning products that serve dental practitioners. In December 2008, Milestone Scientific continued to win broad acclaim for the STA Instrument by winning a &#8220;Townie Choice Award &#8221; . The &#8220;Townie Choice&#8221; awards were originally s tarted by Dr. Howard Darran and Farran Media, publisher of Dentaltown Magazine , to assist dentists in making product purchasing decisions, and are considered the &#8220;people&#8217;s choice&#8221; of the products and services available to the dental industry today. That s ame month, the STA Instrument was also named as a Dental Products Report &#8220;Top 100 2008 Product of Distinction.&#8221; Additionally, the STA Instrument was named one of Dentistry Today&#8217;s &#8220;Top 100 Products&#8221; for the third consecutive year in 2010. 

CompuDent&#174;

CompuDent&#174; (also known as The Wand Plus &#174; internationally) is Milestone Scientific&#8217;s proprietary, patented Computer-Controlled Local Anesthetic Delivery (C-CLAD) instrument and predecessor of the STA Instrument . CompuDent&#174; delivers anesthesia at a precise and consistent rate below a patient&#8217;s pain threshold. Over the years, CompuDent&#174; has been widely heralded as a revolutionary instrument, considered one of the major advances in dentistry in the 20 th Century. The instrument has been favorably evaluated in more than 50 peer reviewed or independent clinical research reports. CompuDent&#174; , including its ergonomically designed single-use handpieces ( The Wand&#174;) , provides numerous, well documented benefits: 

&#160;

&#183; 

CompuDent&#174; minimizes the pain associated with palatal, mandibular block and all other injections, resulting in a more comfortable injection experience for the patient; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the pencil grip used with The Wand&#174; handpieces allows unprecedented tactile sense and accurate control; 

&#160;

&#183; 

new injections made possible with the CompuDent&#174; technology eliminate collateral numbness of the tongue, lips and facial muscles; 

&#160;

&#183; 

bi-directional rotation of The Wand&#174; handpieces eliminates needle deflection resulting in greater success and more rapid onset of anesthesia in mandibular block injections; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the use of a single patient use, disposable handpieces minimizes the risk of cross contamination; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

the ergonomic design of The Wand&#174; handpieces makes an injection easier and less stressful to administer, lowering the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. 

Despite CompuDent&#174; many benefits, including the administration of less painful and more comfortable injections, dentists in the United States have been slow to give up the use of traditional syringes. Dentists have all been trained to use syringes in dental school and often have become accustomed to and are comfortable with their use during many years of clinical practice, in spite of the obvious reluctance and/or fear of the patient in relation to injections administered by hypodermic syringe. There are approximately 40 million dental phobics, those people afraid to visit a dentist, in the United States. Therefore, Milestone Scientific believes there is a disconnect in the way dentists perceive their patients&#8217; attitudes toward injection by hypodermic syringe. The CompuDent&#174; is used today by thousands of dentists around the world, many of whom have long since abandoned the over 150-year old syringe. 

CompuMed&#174;

CompuMed&#174; is a patented computer-controlled injection instrument geared to the needs of the medical market and providing benefits similar to CompuDent&#174;. CompuMed&#174; allows many medical procedures, now requiring intravenous sedation, to be performed with only local anesthesia due to dramatic pain reduction. Also, dosages of local anesthetic can often be significantly reduced, thus reducing side effects, accelerating recovery times, lowering costs and eliminating potential complications. CompuMed&#174; has accumulated clinical evidence demonstrating benefits from use in colorectal surgery; podiatry; dermatology, including surgery for the removal of basal cell carcinomas and other oncological dermatologic procedures; nasal and sinus surgery, including rhinoplasty; hair transplantation and cosmetic 

&#160;

surgery, among others. The CompuMed&#174; is being replaced by instruments that include CompuFlo&#174; technology geared to specific medical disciplines. 

The Wand&#174; 

The Wand&#174; handpiece is used in conjunction with the STA, CompuDent&#174; and CompuMed&#174; instruments. It is an ergonomically designed and patented handpiece that enables all traditional and newer injections, such as AMSA, P-ASA and Modified-PDL, to be more comfortable and easier to deliver. Moreover, the pen-like grasp of The Wand&#174; allows bi-directional rotation during injection, which prevents needle deflection that occurs with a traditional syringe. A straighter path results in a more accurate injection, meaning fewer missed mandibular blocks, and more rapid onset of anesthesia. Missed blocks are reported in the literature to occur 30% of the time. This raises both patient anxiety and difficulties for the dentists in managing their business. While awaiting profound anesthesia, the dentist loses time and money. 

Competition

Milestone Scientific&#8217;s proprietary, patented Computer-Controlled Local Anesthesia Delivery (C-CLAD) instruments compete with disposable and reusable syringes that generally sell at lower prices and that use established and well-understood methodologies in both the dental and medical marketplaces. Upon commercial introduction and sale, Milestone Medical&#8217;s epidural injection instrument will also compete with Apad, a computer controlled injection instrument which claims to be able to reliably identify the epidural space.

Milestone Scientific&#8217;s instruments compete on the basis of their performance characteristics and the benefits provided to the practitioner, patient and the dental business operations. Clinical studies have shown that the instruments reduce fear, pain and anxiety for many patients, and Milestone Scientific believes that they can reduce practitioner stress levels, as well. Milestone Scientific&#8217;s newest product introduction, the STA Instrument , can be used for all dental injections that can be performed with a traditional dental syringe. Moreover, the STA Instrument can also be used for new and modified dental injection techniques that cannot be performed with traditional syringes. These new techniques allow for faster procedures shortening chair-time, minimizing the numbing of the lips and facial muscles, enhancing practice productivity, reducing stress and virtually eliminating pain and anxiety for both the patient and the dentist.

Milestone Scientific faces intense competition from many companies in the medical and dental device industry, possessing substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel, and other resources. Most competitors have established reputations, stemming from their success in the development, sale, and service of competing dental products. Further, rapid technological change and research may affect the products. Current or new competitors could, at any time, introduce new or enhanced products with features that render the products less marketable or even obsolete. Therefore, Milestone Scientific must devote substantial efforts and financial resources to improve existing products, bring products to market quickly, and develop new products for related markets. In addition, the ability to compete successfully requires that Milestone Scientific establish an effective distribution network with a strong marketing plan. Historically, Milestone Scientific has been unsuccessful in executing the marketing plans for the products, primarily due to resource constraints. New products must be approved by regulatory authorities before they may be marketed. Milestone Scientific cannot assure that it can compete successfully, that competitors will not develop technologies or products that render the products less marketable or obsolete, or, that Milestone Scientific will succeed in improving the existing products, effectively develop new products, or obtain required regulatory approval for those products.

During the 2015 and 2014 fiscal years, Milestone Scientific expensed $100,856 and $88,243, respectively, on research and development activities. 

Milestone Scientific relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws and employee and third party non-disclosure agreements to protect intellectual property rights. Despite the precautions taken by Milestone Scientific to protect the products, unauthorized parties may attempt to reverse engineer, copy, or obtain and use products and information that Milestone Scientific regarded as proprietary, or may design products serving similar purposes that do not infringe on Milestone Scientific&#8217;s patents. Milestone Scientific&#8217;s failure to protect its proprietary information and the expenses of doing so could have a material adverse effect on the operating results and financial condition of the Company.

In the event that the products infringe upon patent or proprietary rights of others, Milestone Scientific may be required to modify processes or to obtain a license. There can be no assurance that Milestone Scientific would be able to do so in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all. The failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on Milestone Scientific.

Government Regulation

The FDA cleared the CompuDent&#174; instrument and its disposable handpieces for marketing in the U.S. for dental applications in July 1996; the CompuMed&#174; instrument for marketing in the U.S. for medical applications in May 2001; and The Safety Wand&#174; for marketing in the U.S. for dental applications in September 2003. For us to commercialize the other products in the U.S., Milestone Scientific would have to submit additional 510(k) applications with the FDA. Milestone Scientific received FDA 510 (k) approval for the STA Instrument in August 2006.

The manufacture and sale of medical devices and other medical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA pursuant to the FDC Act, and by other federal, state and foreign authorities. Under the FDC Act, medical devices 

&#160;

must receive FDA clearance before they can be marketed commercially in the U.S. Some medical products must undergo rigorous pre-clinical a nd clinical testing and an extensive FDA approval process before they can be marketed. These processes can take a number of years and require the expenditure of substantial resources. The time required for completing such testing and obtaining such approva ls is uncertain, and FDA clearance may never be obtained. Delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in FDA policy during the period of product development and FDA regulatory review of each product submitted. Similar delays also may be enco untered in other countries. Following the enactment of the Medical Device Amendments to the FDC Act in May 1976, the FDA classified medical devices in commercial distribution into one of three classes. This classification is based on the controls necessary to reasonably ensure the safety and effectiveness of the medical devices. Class I devices are those devices whose safety and effectiveness can reasonably be ensured through general controls, such as adequate labeling, pre-market notification, and adherenc e to the FDA&#8217;s Quality Instrument Regulation (&#8220;QSR&#8221;), also referred to as &#8220;Good Manufacturing Practices&#8221; (&#8220;GMP&#8221;) regulations. Some Class I devices are further exempted from some of the general controls. Class II devices are those devices whose safety and e ffectiveness reasonably can be ensured through the use of special controls, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidelines. Class III devices are those which must receive pre-market approval by the FDA to en sure their safety and effectiveness. Generally, Class III devices are limited to life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. 

If a manufacturer or distributor can establish that a proposed device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; to a legally marketed Class I or Class II medical device or to a Class III medical device for which the FDA has not required pre-market approval, the manufacturer or distributor may seek FDA marketing clearance for the device by filing a 510(k) Pre-market Notification. The 510(k) Pre-market Notification and the claim of substantial equivalence may have to be supported by various types of data and materials, including test results indicating that the device is as safe and effective for its intended use as a legally marketed predicate device. Following submission of the 510(k) Pre-market Notification, the manufacturer or distributor may not place the device into commercial distribution until an order is issued by the FDA. By regulation, the FDA has no specific time limit by which it must respond to a 510(k) Pre-market Notification. At this time, the FDA typically responds to the submission of a 510(k) Pre-market Notification within 180 days. The FDA response may declare that the device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device and allow the proposed device to be marketed in the U.S. However, the FDA may determine that the proposed device is not substantially equivalent or may require further information, such as additional test data, before the FDA is able to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. Such determination or request for additional information could delay market introduction of products and could have a material adverse effect on us. If a device that has obtained 510(k) Pre-market Notification clearance is changed or modified in design, components, method of manufacture, or intended use, such that the safety or effectiveness of the device could be significantly affected, separate 510(k) Pre-market Notification clearance must be obtained before the modified device can be marketed in the U.S. If a manufacturer or distributor cannot establish that a proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device, the manufacturer or distributor will have to seek pre-market approval of the proposed device, a more difficult procedure requiring extensive data, including pre-clinical and human clinical trial data, as well as extensive literature to prove the safety and efficacy of the device.

Though the STA Instrument, CompuDent&#174; , The Safety Wand&#174; and CompuMed&#174; have received FDA marketing clearance, there can be no assurance that any of the other products under development will obtain the required regulatory clearance in a timely manner, or at all. If regulatory clearance of a product is granted, such clearance may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed. In addition, modifications may be made to the products to incorporate and enhance their functionality and performance based upon new data and design review. There can be no assurance that the FDA will not request additional information relating to product improvements; that any such improvements would not require further regulatory review, thereby delaying the testing, approval and commercialization of product improvements; or, that ultimately any such improvements will receive FDA clearance.

Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and will be monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer, or facility may result in restrictions on such product or manufacturer, including fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution and could have a material adverse effect on Milestone Scientific.

Milestone Scientific is subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, whose regulations require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain QSR requirements as defined by the FDC Act. QSR compliance 

&#160;

requires testing, quality control and documentation procedures. Failure to comply with QSR requirements can result in the suspension or termination of production, product recall or fines and penaltie s. Products also must be manufactured in registered establishments. In addition, labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the Federal Trade Commission. The export of devices is also subject to regulation in certain instances. 

The Medical Device Reporting (&#8220;MDR&#8221;) regulation obligates us to provide information to the FDA on product malfunctions or injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of the product or in connection with certain product failures that could cause serious injury. If, as a result of FDA inspections, MDR reports or other information, the FDA believes that Milestone Scientific is not in compliance with the law, the FDA can institute proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and/or criminal penalties against us, the officers or employees. Any action by the FDA could result in disruption of operations for an undetermined amount of time.

In March 2012, Milestone Scientific received approval for The Wand&#174; STA Single Tooth Anesthesia Instrument &#8482; from ANVISA in Brazil. In June 2007, Milestone Scientific received a CE mark for the marketing of the STA Instrument in Europe. In June 2003 Milestone Scientific received a CE mark for the marketing of The Safety Wand&#174; and The Wand&#174; Handpieces with Needle in Europe. In July 2003, Milestone Scientific obtained regulatory approval to sell CompuDent&#174; and its handpieces in Australia and New Zealand.

As of May 2014, China National Medicines received the appropriate registration approval from the regulatory body in China, therefore, shipment of STA handpieces began in China. In the fourth quarter of 2014, the distribution agreement with China National Medicines was terminated and Milestone China Ltd. (owned 40% by Milestone Scientific) became the authorized distributor of the STA instruments and handpieces in China.

Product Liability

Failure to use any of the products in accordance with recommended operating procedures could potentially result in health hazards or injury. Failures of the products to function properly could subject Milestone Scientific to claims of liability. Milestone Scientific maintains liability insurance in an amount that Milestone Scientific believes is adequate. However, there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be sufficient to pay product liability claims brought against Milestone Scientific. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on Milestone Scientific

Employees

On December 31, 2015, Milestone Scientific had a total of 15 employees, consisting of three executive officers of Milestone Scientific and an executive officer of Wand Dental, a director of International and Professional Relations, a director of engineering, a director of marketing, a senior brand manager, a senior project manager, two customer service representatives, two accountants, a quality care person, a personal assistant and an administrative manager. Milestone Scientific also has a consultant who serves as a Director of Clinical Affairs and a consultant for business development.

Item 1A. Certain Risk Factors that may affect Growth and Profitability.

The following factors may affect the growth and profitability of Milestone Scientific and should be considered by any prospective purchaser or current holder of Milestone Scientific&#8217;s securities:

Milestone Scientific does not have a consistent history of profitable operations. Continuing losses could exhaust capital resources and force Milestone Scientific to discontinue operations.

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, revenues were approximately $9.4 million and $10.3 million, respectively. Milestone Scientific has a net loss of approximately $5.4 million for year ended December 31, 2015 and a net loss of approximately $1.7 million for year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, Milestone Scientific has had losses for each year since the commencement of operations with the exception of 2013. Milestone Scientific has an accumulated deficit of approximately $78.6 million. At December 31, 2015, Milestone Scientific had cash and cash equivalents approximately $4.2 million, and working capital of approximately $8.2 million. The working capital in 2015 decreased by 

&#160;

approximately $4.9 million from December 31, 2014. The change in wo rking capital is primarily due to the use of cash for operations and the consolidation of Milestone Medical liabilities. As of December 31, 2015 Milestone Scientific believes that with the new Dental Distributor Agreement with Henry Schein Inc. (effective January 1, 2016), the world&#8217;s largest supplier of medical, dental and veterinary supplies and devices, that dental revenues are projected to improve in the upcoming 12 months. To further reduce our expenditures, Milestone Medical expenses related to USA FD A clearance for the epidural and intra-articular instruments can be controlled as required to meet our budget. By limiting the FDA related expenses and increasing the dental instrument revenue through the new distribution agreement, management believes tha t Milestone Scientific will have sufficient cash reserves to meet all of its anticipated obligations over the next twelve months. 

Milestone Scientific management continues to examine all areas of the business to manage our cash flow. Milestone Scientific is actively pursuing the generation of positive cash flows from operating activities through an increase in revenue based upon management&#8217;s assessment of present contracts and current negotiations and reductions in operating expenses. 

We cannot become successful unless we gain greater market acceptance for our products and technology.

As with any new technology, there is substantial risk that the marketplace will not accept the potential benefits of this technology or be unwilling to pay for any cost differential with the existing technologies. Market acceptance of CompuDent&#174; , STA Instrument , The Safety Wand&#174;, CompuMed&#174; and CompuFlo&#174; depends , in large part, upon the ability to educate potential customers of the product&#8217;s distinctive characteristics and benefits and will require substantial marketing efforts and expense. More than 43,000 instruments of the STA Instrument and its predecessors have been sold worldwide since 1998. Since being introduced to market in February 2007, more than 15,000 of the STA Instrument have been sold. Milestone Scientific cannot assure that its current or proposed products will be accepted by practitioners or that any of the current or proposed products will be able to compete effectively against current and alternative products.

Our limited distribution channels must be expanded in order to become successful. 

Future revenues depend on Milestone Scientific&#8217;s ability to market and distribute its computer-controlled injection products successfully. In November 2012, Milestone Scientific signed on an exclusive distributor and marketing company to sell and distribute the STA instruments and handpieces in the USA and Canada. This exclusive agreement was modified to a non-exclusive agreement in December 31, 2015 and will expire on March 31, 2016. Beginning January 1, 2016, Henry Schein, the leading distributor of dental products in the USA and Canada, will have a non-exclusive distribution agreement with Milestone Scientific. To be successful, Milestone Scientific will need to engage additional distributors, provide for their proper training and ensure adequate customer support. Milestone Scientific cannot assure that it will be able to hire and retain an adequate sales force or engage suitable distributors, or that the sales force or distributors will be able to successfully market and sell the products.

We depend on two principal manufacturers. If Milestone Scientific cannot maintain its existing relationships or develop new ones, it may have to cease operations . 

Milestone Scientific and its subsidiary has informal arrangements with the manufacturer of the STA Instrument , CompuDent&#174; and CompuMed&#174; instruments and with one of the principal manufacturers of the handpieces, for those items, respectively. Pursuant to the informal arrangements, they manufacture these products under specific purchase orders without minimum purchase commitment. However, in November 2009, Milestone Scientific issued a purchase order to Tricor System Inc. to manufacture 12,000 STA Instruments, over the following three years. Milestone Scientific has a manufacturing agreement with one of the principal manufacturers, which is a related party, of its handpieces pursuant to which they manufacture products under specific purchase orders but without minimum purchase commitments. Milestone Scientific has been supplied by the manufacturer of the STA Instrument, CompuDent&#174; and CompuMed&#174; since the commencement of production in 1998, the manufacturer of its handpieces since 2003. However, termination of the manufacturing relationship with any of these manufacturers could significantly and adversely affect the ability to produce and sell the products. Though other alternate sources of supply for handpieces exist, Milestone Scientific would need to recover its existing tools or have new tools produced to establish relationships with new suppliers. Establishing new manufacturing relationships could involve significant expense and delay. Any curtailment or interruptions of the supply, whether or not as a result or termination of the relationship, would have an adverse effect.

&#160;

We may be subject to product liability claims that are not fully covered by insurance and that could put Milestone Scientific under financial strain. 

Milestone Scientific could be subject to claims for personal injury from the alleged malfunction or misuse of the dental and medical products. While Milestone Scientific carries liability insurance that is believed to be adequate, Milestone Scientific cannot assure that the insurance coverage will be sufficient to pay such claims should they be successful. A partially or completely uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on Milestone Scientific. 

Milestone Scientific relies on the continuing services of the Chief Executive Officer and Director of Clinical Affairs.

Milestone Scientific depends on the personal efforts and abilities of the Chief Executive Officer and the Director of Clinical Affairs. Milestone Scientific maintains a key man life insurance policy in the amount of $1,000,000 on the life of the Chief Executive Officer. However, the loss of his services or Director of Clinical Affairs, on whom Milestone Scientific maintains no insurance, could have a materially adverse effect on the business. 

The market price of Milestone Scientific&#8217;s common stock has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of various factors, some of which are beyond Milestone Scientific&#8217;s control.

Milestone Scientific&#8217;s stock price has been extremely volatile, fluctuating during the last two years between $4.00 and $1.17. The market price of common shares could continue to fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, some of which may be beyond Milestone Scientific&#8217;s control.

Milestone Scientific is controlled by a limited number of shareholders. 

Milestone Scientific&#8217;s principal shareholders, Leonard Osser, Gian Domenico Trombetta, K. Tucker Andersen, and Robert Gintel beneficially own approximately 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, they have the ability to exercise substantial control over Milestone Scientific&#8217;s affairs and corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including electing directors, selling all or substantially all of the assets, merging with another entity or amending its certificate of incorporation. This de facto control could delay, deter or prevent a change in control and could adversely affect the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for Milestone Scientific&#8217;s securities.

Future sales or the potential for sale of a substantial number of shares of Milestone Scientific&#8217;s common stock could cause the trading price of common stock to decline and could impair Milestone Scientific&#8217;s ability to raise capital through subsequent equity offerings.

Sales of a substantial number of shares of Milestone Scientific&#8217;s common stock in the public markets, or the perception that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of the stock to decline and could materially impair its ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. At December 31, 2015, Milestone Scientific had outstanding options to purchase 1,427,769 shares of common stock at prices ranging from $0.36 to $3.89 per share with a weighted average exercise price of $1.56. Holders of these options are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of the common stock and are likely to exercise their securities at a time when Milestone Scientific would be able to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms. Thus, the terms upon which Milestone Scientific will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected, since the holders of outstanding options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when Milestone Scientific would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable than the exercise terms provided by such outstanding securities. The market price of the common shares has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly because of various factors, some of which are beyond Milestone Scientific&#8217;s control. 

Adherence to Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC rules concerning internal controls may be so costly that compliance could have an adverse effect on Milestone Scientific.

The Management of Milestone Scientific has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Milestone Scientific complied with Sarbanes-Oxley requirements to include in the annual report a management report on 

&#160;

the effectiveness of the inter nal control over financial reporting. In 2005, Milestone Scientific hired an outside consultant to assist with the development and implementation of the necessary internal controls and reporting procedures. In 2015 and 2014, Milestone Scientific utilized the outside consultant on a quarterly basis to review compliance with the internal controls over financial reporting. This expense amounted to approximately $10,000 and $5,000 in 2015 and 2014, respectively and the cost is expected to continue in 2016.
