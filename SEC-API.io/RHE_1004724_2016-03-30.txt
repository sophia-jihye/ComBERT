 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

AdCare Health Systems, Inc. (&#8220;AdCare&#8221;), through its subsidiaries (together, the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;), is a self-managed real estate investment company that invests primarily in real estate purposed for long-term care and senior living. Our business primarily consists of leasing and subleasing such facilities to third-party tenants, which operate the facilities. As of December 31, 2015, the Company owned, leased, or managed for third parties 38 &#32;facilities primarily in the Southeast. The Company's facilities provide a range of healthcare and related services to patients and residents, including skilled nursing and assisted living services, social services, various therapy services, and other rehabilitative and healthcare services for both long-term and short-stay patients and residents. 

We were incorporated in Ohio on August 14, 1991, under the name Passport Retirement, Inc. In 1995, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of AdCare Health Systems, Inc. and changed our name to AdCare Health Systems, Inc. AdCare completed its initial public offering in November 2006. Initially based in Ohio, we expanded our portfolio through a series of strategic acquisitions to include properties in a number of other states, primarily in the Southeast. In 2012, we relocated our executive offices and accounting operations to Georgia, and AdCare changed its state of incorporation from Ohio to Georgia on December 12, 2013. 

Historically, our business focused on owning, leasing and operating skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. The Company also managed certain facilities on behalf of unaffiliated owners and operators with whom we entered into management contracts. In July 2014, our Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a strategic plan to transition (the &#8220;Transition&#8221;) the Company to a healthcare property holding and leasing company through a series of leasing and subleasing transactions. As of December 31, 2015, we completed the Transition through: (i) leasing to third-party operators all of the healthcare properties which we own and previously operated; (ii) subleasing to third-party operators all of the healthcare properties which we lease (but does not own) and previously operated; and (iii) continuing one remaining management agreement to manage two skilled nursing facilities and one assisted living facility. 

We lease our currently-owned healthcare properties, and sublease our currently-leased healthcare properties, on a triple net basis, meaning that the lessee ( i.e ., the new third-party operator of the property) is obligated under the lease or sublease, as applicable, for all costs of the property in respect to insurance, taxes and facility maintenance, as well as the lease or sublease payments, as applicable. These leases are generally long-term in nature with renewal options and annual rent escalation clauses. 

As a result of the Transition, the Company now has many of the characteristics of a real estate investment trust ("REIT") and is focused on the ownership, acquisition and leasing of healthcare related properties. The Board is analyzing and considering: (i) whether and, if so, when, we could satisfy the requirements to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;); (ii) the structural and operational complexities which would need to be addressed before we could qualify as a REIT, including the disposition of certain assets or the termination of certain operations which may not be REIT compliant; and (iii) if we were to qualify as a REIT, whether electing REIT status would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders in light of various factors, including our significant consolidated Federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $58.3 million &#32;as of December 31, 2015. There is no assurance that the Company will qualify as a REIT in future taxable years or, if it were to so qualify, that the Board would determine that electing REIT status would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 

On March 29, 2016, the Company announced that given that the transition to a healthcare property holding and leasing company is complete, the Board of Directors has begun to explore strategic alternatives for the Company. 

Our principal executive offices are located at 1145 Hembree Road, Roswell, GA 30076, and our telephone number is (678) 869-5116. We maintain a website at www.adcarehealth.com. The contents of this website are not incorporated into this Annual Report. 

Portfolio of Healthcare Investments 

As of December 31, 2015 , our owned, leased, and managed portfolio consisted of 35 skilled nursing facilities, two assisted living facilities, and one independent living facility. Skilled nursing facilities provide daily nursing care, therapeutic rehabilitation, social services, housekeeping, nutrition and administrative services for individuals requiring certain assistance with activities in daily living. A typical skilled nursing facility includes mostly two bed units, each equipped with a private or shared bathroom and community dining facilities. Assisted living facilities provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help 

with activities of daily living, such as bathing, eating and dressing, yet require limited medical care. Assisted living facilities typically are comprised of one and two bedroom suites equipped with private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens. 

Our leases generally have initial terms of five to fifteen years with renewal options. The leases are "triple net leases" under which the tenant is responsible for the payment of all taxes, utilities, insurance premium costs, repairs and other charges relating to the operation of the properties. The tenant is obligated at its expense to keep all improvements, fixtures and other components of the properties covered by "all risk" insurance and to maintain specified minimal personal injury and property damage insurance, protecting us as well as the tenant. All of our leases contain annual escalators in rent payments. Leases are typically guaranteed by the parent corporation of the lessee or affiliates of the lessee. Leases are also typically backed by other collateral such as security deposits, machinery, equipment, furnishings and other personal property.

AdCare subleased through its subsidiaries nine facilities located in Arkansas to affiliates of Aria Health Group, LLC pursuant to separate sublease agreements. Eight of the Aria subleases commenced on May 1, 2015 and one sublease commenced on November 1, 2015. Effective February 3, 2016, each sublease was terminated due to the failure to pay rent pursuant to the terms of such sublease. Subsequently, on February 5, 2016, the Company entered into a Master Lease Agreement, as amended, 

with Skyline Healthcare LLC to lease the facilities commencing April 1, 2016. (See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplemental Data , Note 19, Subsequent Events ) 

(2) &#32;&#32; 

On January 22, 2016, New Beginnings Care LLC and its affiliates ("New Beginnings") filed a petition to reorganize its finances under the Bankruptcy Code. To date, New Beginnings has neither affirmed nor rejected the Master Lease entered into on November 3, 2015 with respect to the Jeffersonville, Oceanside, and Savannah Beach facilities. The Company is in discussions with New Beginnings and other potential operators about leasing such facilities. 

Acquisitions, Dispositions, and Leasing Transactions 

Acquisitions . The Company did not complete any acquisitions during the three years ended December 31, 2015 . 

Dispositions . On July 1, 2015, the Company sold its Bentonville Manor Nursing Home, an 83-bed skilled nursing facility located in Bentonville, Arkansas, for approximately $3.4 million. Net proceeds were used to repay certain mortgage indebtedness with respect to the facility. 

On October 30, 2015, the Company sold its Companions Specialized Care Center, a 102-bed skilled nursing facility located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, for approximately $3.5 million. Net proceeds were used to repay certain mortgage indebtedness with respect to the facility. 

On November 20, 2015, Riverchase Village ADK, LLC (&#8220;Riverchase&#8221;) completed the sale to an unrelated third party of the Riverchase Village facility, a 105-unit assisted living facility located in Hoover, Alabama, for a purchase price of $6.9 million. Until the sale of the Riverchase Village facility, Riverchase was a consolidating variable interest entity (a &#8220;VIE&#8221;) of the Company. Riverchase was owned by Christopher F. Brogdon, a former director of the Company and a greater than 5% beneficial holder of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Riverchase financed its acquisition of the Riverchase Village facility using the proceeds of revenue bonds issued by the Medical Clinic Board of the City of Hoover (the &#8220;Riverchase Bonds&#8221;), as to which the Company was a guarantor. In connection with the sale of the Riverchase Village facility, the Riverchase Bonds were repaid in full and AdCare was released from its guaranty. 

Leasing Transactions . During the three years ended December 31, 2015, the Company leased or subleased, as applicable, to tenants:

Industry Trends 

The skilled nursing segment of the long-term care industry has evolved to meet the growing demand for post-acute and custodial healthcare services generated by an aging population, increasing life expectancies and the trend toward shifting of patient care to lower cost settings. The growth of the senior population in the United States continues to increase healthcare costs, often faster than the available funding from government-sponsored healthcare programs. In response, federal and state governments have adopted cost-containment measures that encourage the treatment of patients in more cost-effective settings, such as skilled nursing facilities, for which the staffing requirements and associated costs are often significantly lower than acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and other post-acute care settings. As a result, skilled nursing facilities are generally serving a larger population of higher acuity patients than in the past. The skilled nursing industry is large, highly fragmented, and characterized 

predominantly by numerous local and regional providers. Based on a decrease in the number of skilled nursing facilities over the past few years, we expect that the supply and demand balance in the skilled nursing industry will continue to improve. We also anticipate that, as life expectancy continues to increase in the United States, the overall demand for skilled nursing services will increase. At present, the primary market demographic for skilled nursing services is primarily individuals age 75 and older. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, there were over 40 million people in the United States in 2010 that are over 65 years old. The 2010 U.S. Census estimates this group is one of the fastest growing segments of the United States population and is expected to more than double between 2000 and 2030. We believe the skilled nursing industry has been and will continue to be impacted by several other trends. The use of long-term care insurance is increasing among seniors as a means of planning for the costs of skilled nursing services. In addition, as a result of increased mobility in society, reduction of average family size, and the increased number of two-wage earner couples, more seniors are looking for alternatives outside their own family for their care. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe we possess the following competitive strengths: 

Long-Term, Triple-Net Lease Structure. All of our real estate properties are leased under triple-net operating leases with initial terms ranging from five to fifteen years pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for all facility maintenance, insurance and taxes, and utilities. As of December 31, 2015, the leases had an average remaining initial term of approximately 10 years. In addition, the average rent escalator is approximately 2.5%. We also typically receive additional security under these leases in the form of security deposits from the lessee and guarantees from the parent of the lessee or other related entities. 

Operator Diversification. &#32; As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio of 38 properties (including three facilities that are managed by us) was operated by seven operators or their affiliates. Each of our tenants operate between two and nine of our facilities, with our most significant tenant, Aria Health Group LLC, operating nine facilities, or 24% of the total number of our facilities. Tenants are typically local or regionally-focused operators. We believe that our tenant diversification should limit the effect of any operator&#8217;s financial or operating performance decline on our overall performance. 

Geographically Diverse Property Portfolio . Our portfolio of 38 properties, comprising 4,081 beds/units, is diversified across seven states. Our properties in any one state did not account for more than 40% of our total beds/units as of December 31, 2015. We believe this geographic diversification will limit the effect of a decline in any one regional market on our overall performance. 

Experienced Management Team. &#32; Our management team has extensive healthcare services, real estate, acquisitions, and capital raising experience. William McBride, III, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has more than 30 years of healthcare, financing, real estate and corporate leadership experience in both the long-term care and REIT sectors. Allan J. Rimland, our President and Chief Financial Officer has more than 25 years of experience in investment banking and expertise within the healthcare services and related real estate sectors, including positions with leading bulge bracket and mid-sized investment banks. Through years of public company experience, our management team also has extensive experience accessing both debt and equity capital markets to fund growth. 

Business Strategy 

Our business strategy primarily is focused on investing capital in our current portfolio and growing our portfolio through the acquisition of skilled nursing and other healthcare facilities. More specifically, we seek to: 

Focus on Senior Housing Segment. &#32;We intend to continue to focus our investment program on senior housing, primarily the skilled nursing facility segment of the long-term care continuum. We have historically been focused on senior housing, and senior management has operating and financial experience and a significant number of relationships in the long-term care industry. In addition, we believe investing in the sector bests meets our investing criteria. 

Invest Capital in Our Current Portfolio. We intend to continue to support our operators by providing capital to them for a variety of purposes, including facility modernization and potentially replacing or renovating facilities in our portfolio that may have become less competitive. We expect to structure these investments as either lease amendments that produce additional rent or as loans that are repaid by operators during the applicable lease term. 

Provide Capital to Underserved Operators. &#32; We believe that there is a significant opportunity to be a capital source to long-term care operators through the acquisition and leasing of healthcare properties that are consistent with our investment and financing strategy, but that, due to size and other considerations, are not a focus for large healthcare REITs. We seek primarily small to mid-size acquisition transactions with a focus on individual facilities with existing operators, as well as small groups of facilities and 

larger portfolios. In addition to pursuing acquisitions using triple-net lease structures, we may pursue other forms of investment, including mortgage loans and joint ventures. 

Identify Talented Operators. &#32; As a result of our management team&#8217;s operating experience, network of relationships and industry insight, we have been able and expect to continue to be able to identify qualified tenants. We seek tenants who possess local market knowledge, demonstrate hands-on management, have proven track records and focus on patient care. 

Monitor Investments. &#32;We monitor our real estate investments through, among other things: (i) reviewing and evaluating tenant financial statements to assess operational and financial trends and performance; (ii) reviewing the state surveys, occupancy rates and patient payor mix of our facilities; (iii) verifying the payments of property and other taxes and insurance with respect to our facilities; and (iv) conducting periodic physical inspections of our facilities. For tenants or facilities that do not meet performance expectations, we may seek to work with our tenants to ensure our mutual success or seek to re-lease facilities to stronger operators. 

Competition 

We generally compete for real property investments with publicly traded, private and non-listed healthcare REITs, real estate partnerships, healthcare providers, healthcare lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition challenges our ability to identify and successfully capitalize on opportunities that meet our investment criteria, which is affected by, among other factors, the availability of suitable acquisition or investment targets, our ability to negotiate acceptable transaction terms and our access to and cost of capital. 

Our ability to generate rental revenues from our properties also depends on the competition faced by our tenants. Our tenants compete on a local and regional basis with other healthcare operating companies that provide comparable services. Our tenants compete to attract and retain patients and residents based on scope and quality of care, reputation and financial condition, price, location and physical appearance of the properties, services offered, qualified personnel, physician referrals and family preferences. The ability of our tenants to compete successfully could be affected by private, federal and state reimbursement programs and other laws and regulations. 

Revenue Sources and Recognition 

Triple-Net Leased Properties. Our triple-net leases provide for periodic and determinable increases in rent. We recognize rental revenues under these leases on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term when collectibility is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis generally results in recognized revenues during the first half of a lease term exceeding the cash amounts contractually due from our tenants, creating a straight-line rent receivable that is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. 

Other. We recognize management fee revenues received currently under one contractual agreement with a third party. Further, we recognize interest income from lease inducements receivables and capital loans as made to tenants. 

Allowances. We assess the collectibility of our rent receivables, including straight-line rent receivables. We base our assessment of the collectibility of rent receivables (other than straight-line rent receivables) on several factors, including, payment history, the financial strength of the tenant and any guarantors, the value of the underlying collateral, and current economic conditions. If our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to recover the full value of the receivable, then we provide a reserve against the portion of the receivable that we estimate may not be recovered. If our evaluation of these factors indicates it is probable that we will be unable to receive the rent payments, then we provide a reserve against the recognized straight-line rent receivable asset for the portion that we estimate may not be recovered. If we change our assumptions or estimates regarding the collectibility of future rent payments required by a lease, then we may adjust our reserve to increase or reduce the rental revenue recognized in the period we make such change in our assumptions or estimates. 

At December 31, 2015, we allowed for approximately $12.5 million &#32;on approximately $20.9 million &#32;of gross patient care related receivables. Allowance for patient care receivables are estimated based on an aged bucket method incorporating different payor types. All patient care receivables exceeding 365 days are fully allowed at December 31, 2015. The increase in the reserves for patient care is primarily included in discontinued operations. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation &#32; 

Healthcare Regulation . Our tenants are typically subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to quality of care, licensure and certificate of need (&#8220;CON&#8221;), government reimbursement, fraud and abuse practices, qualifications of personnel, adequacy of plant and equipment, data privacy and security, and other laws and regulations governing 

the operation of healthcare facilities. We expect that the healthcare industry will, in general, continue to face increased regulation and pressure in these areas. The applicable rules are wide-ranging and can subject our tenants to civil, criminal, and administrative sanctions, including: the possible loss of accreditation or license; denial of reimbursement; imposition of fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs; or facility closure. Changes in laws or regulations, reimbursement policies, enforcement activity and regulatory non-compliance by tenants, operators and managers can all have a significant effect on their operations and financial condition, which in turn may adversely impact us, as detailed below and set forth under &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report. 

Although the properties within our portfolio may be subject to varying levels of governmental scrutiny, we expect that the healthcare industry, in general, will continue to face increased regulation and pressure in the areas of fraud, waste and abuse, including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Federal Stark Law, the Federal False Claims Act, and comparable state counterparts, as well as cost control, healthcare management and provision of services, among others. We also expect that efforts by third-party payors, such as the federal Medicare program, state Medicaid programs and private insurance carriers (including health maintenance organizations and other health plans), to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls upon tenants (through changes in reimbursement rates and methodologies, discounted fee structures, the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk or otherwise) will intensify and continue. A significant expansion of applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations, existing or future healthcare reform measures, new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, changes in enforcement priorities, or significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed or reductions in reimbursement rates could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants&#8217; liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and, in turn, their ability to satisfy their contractual obligations, including making rental payments under and otherwise complying with the terms of our leases. 

Licensure, Certification and CONs. In general, the operators of our skilled nursing facilities must be licensed and periodically certified through various regulatory agencies that determine compliance with federal, state and local laws to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Legal requirements pertaining to such licensure and certification relate to the quality of medical care provided by the operator, qualifications of the tenant&#8217;s administrative personnel and clinical staff, adequacy of the physical plant and equipment and continuing compliance with applicable laws and regulations. A loss of licensure or certification could adversely affect a skilled nursing facility&#8217;s ability to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its obligations to us. 

In addition, many of our skilled nursing facilities are subject to state CON laws that require governmental approval prior to the development or expansion of healthcare facilities and services. The approval process in these states generally requires a facility to demonstrate the need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services. CONs, where applicable, are also sometimes necessary for changes in ownership or control of licensed facilities, addition of beds, investment in major capital equipment, introduction of new services or termination of services previously approved through the CON process. CON laws and regulations may restrict a tenant's ability to expand our properties and grow its business in certain circumstances, which could have an adverse effect on the tenant&#8217;s revenues and, in turn, its ability to make rental payments under and otherwise comply with the terms of our leases. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator. If we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state healthcare program (as discussed below), our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state&#8217;s CON laws, regulations, and applicable guidance governing changes in provider control. 

Compared to skilled nursing facilities, seniors housing communities (other than those that receive Medicaid payments) do not receive significant funding from governmental healthcare programs and are subject to relatively few, if any, federal regulations. Instead, to the extent they are regulated, such regulation consists primarily of state and local laws governing licensure, provision of services, staffing requirements and other operational matters, which vary greatly from one jurisdiction to another. Although recent growth in the U.S. seniors housing industry has attracted the attention of various federal agencies that believe more federal regulation of these properties is necessary, Congress thus far has deferred to state regulation of seniors housing communities. However, as a result of this growth and increased federal scrutiny, some states have revised and strengthened their regulation of seniors housing communities, and more states are expected to do the same in the future. 

Fraud and Abuse Enforcement, Other Related Laws, Initiatives, and Considerations. &#32;&#32;Long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by healthcare providers. Certain of these laws prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government healthcare programs. Other laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service. Still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety, health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violations of these laws, regulations, and other applicable guidance may include, but 

are not limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate termination of government payments, and exclusion from any government healthcare program. In certain circumstances, violation of these rules (such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as other government healthcare programs. In the ordinary course of its business, a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations, and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. 

Long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are also subject to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which generally prohibits persons from offering, providing, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Long-term/post-acute care facilities are also subject to the Federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. The Stark Law generally prohibits the submission of claims to Medicare for payment if the claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that does not qualify under one of the exceptions for a financial relationship under the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions on physician self-referrals and submission of claims apply to state Medicaid programs. Further, long-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments), are subject to substantial financial penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the Federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions under the Federal False Claims Act&#8217;s &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; provisions. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud has increased due in large part to amendments to the Federal False Claims Act that encourage private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits brought by private individuals, known as qui tam actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former patients, nurses and other employees, and competitors. Significantly, if a claim is successfully adjudicated, the Federal False Claims Act provides for treble damages and a civil penalty of up to $11,000 per claim. 

Prosecutions, investigations, or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator&#8217;s liquidity, financial condition, and operations, which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us. Finally, various state false claim act and anti-kickback laws may also apply to each property operator. Violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal and/or civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its financial obligations to us. 

Other legislative developments, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), have greatly expanded the definition of healthcare fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include private healthcare plans in addition to government payors. Congress also has greatly increased funding for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General ("OIG") of the Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") to audit, investigate and prosecute suspected healthcare fraud. Moreover, a significant portion of the billions in healthcare fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution efforts. 

Additionally, other HIPAA provisions and regulations provide for communication of health information through standard electronic transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information. In order to comply with the regulations, healthcare providers often must undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts. Operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health information about individuals. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (&#8220;HITECH&#8221;) Act, passed in February 2009, strengthened the HHS Secretary&#8217;s authority to impose civil money penalties for HIPAA violations occurring after February 18, 2009. HITECH directs the HHS Secretary to provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates (as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HITECH requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in an enforcement action. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") issued an interim Final Rule which conformed HIPAA enforcement regulations to HITECH, increasing the maximum penalty for multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to $1.5 million. Higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple requirements or prohibitions. Additionally, on January 17, 2013, CMS released an omnibus final rule, which expands the applicability of HIPAA and HITECH and strengthens the government&#8217;s ability to enforce these laws. The final rule broadens the definition of &#8220;business associate&#8221; and provides for civil money penalty liability against covered entities and business associates for the acts of their agents regardless of whether a business associate agreement is in place. This rule also modified the standard for when a breach of unsecured personally identifiable health information must be reported. Some covered entities have entered into settlement agreements with HHS for allegedly failing to adopt policies and procedures sufficient to implement the breach notification provisions in the HITECH Act. Additionally, the final rule adopts certain changes to the HIPAA enforcement regulations to incorporate the increased and tiered civil monetary penalty structure provided by HITECH, and makes business associates of covered entities directly liable under HIPAA for compliance with certain of the HIPAA privacy standards and HIPAA security standards. HIPAA violations are also potentially subject to criminal penalties. 

There has been increased federal and state HIPAA privacy and security enforcement efforts and we expect this trend to continue. Under HITECH, state attorneys general have the right to prosecute HIPAA violations committed against residents of their states. Several such actions have already been brought against both covered entities and a business associate, and continued enforcement actions are likely to occur in the future. In addition, HITECH mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities and business associates. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby individuals who are harmed by HIPAA violations may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty fine or monetary settlement paid by the violator. 

In addition to HIPAA, numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health information. In addition, some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the confidentiality, privacy or security of medical records or other types of medical or personal information. These laws may be similar to or even more stringent than the federal provisions and are not preempted by HIPAA. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but some afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. 

Most recently with respect to HIPAA, in September, 2015, OIG issued two reports calling for better privacy oversight of covered entities by the CMS Office for Civil Rights ("OCR"). The first report, titled &#8220;OCR Should Strengthen its Oversight of Covered Entities&#8217; Compliance with the HIPAA Privacy Standards,&#8221; found that OCR&#8217;s oversight is primarily reactive, as OCR has not fully implemented the required audit program to proactively assess possible noncompliance from covered entities. OIG recommended, among other things, that OCR fully implement a permanent audit program and develop a policy requiring OCR staff to check whether covered entities had previously been investigated for noncompliance. The second report, titled &#8220;OCR Should Strengthen its Follow-up of Breaches of Patient Information Reported by Covered Entities,&#8221; found that (1) OCR did not record corrective action information for 23% of closed &#8220;large-breach&#8221; cases in which it made determinations of noncompliance, and (2) OCR did not record &#8220;small-breach&#8221; information in its case-tracking system, which limits its ability to track and identify covered entities with multiple small breaches. OIG recommended, among other things, that OCR enter small-breach information into its case-tracking system and maintain complete documentation of corrective actions taken. OCR agreed with OIG&#8217;s recommendations in both reports. If followed, these reports and recommendations may impact our tenants. 

Congress has significantly increased funding to the governmental agencies charged with enforcing the healthcare fraud and abuse laws to facilitate increased audits, investigations and prosecutions of providers suspected of healthcare fraud. As a result, government investigations and enforcement actions brought against healthcare providers have increased significantly in recent years and are expected to continue. A violation of federal or state anti-fraud and abuse laws or regulations, or other related laws or regulations discussed above, by a tenant of our properties could have a material adverse effect on the tenant&#8217;s liquidity, financial condition or results of operations, which could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, including making rental payments under and otherwise complying with the terms of our leases. 

Government Reimbursement 

The majority of skilled nursing facilities' reimbursement is through Medicare and Medicaid. These programs are often their largest source of funding. Senior housing communities generally do not receive funding from Medicare or Medicaid, but their ability to retain their residents is impacted by policy decisions and initiatives established by the administrators of Medicare and Medicaid. In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 , which represents significant changes to the current U.S. healthcare system (collectively the &#8220;Healthcare Reform Law&#8221;). The passage of the Healthcare Reform Law allowed formerly uninsured Americans to acquire coverage and utilize additional healthcare services. In addition, the Healthcare Reform Law gave the CMS new authorities to implement Medicaid waiver and pilot programs that impact healthcare and long term custodial care reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid. These activities promote &#8220;aging in place&#8221;, allowing senior citizens to stay longer in seniors housing communities, and diverting or delaying their admission into skilled nursing facilities. The potential risks that accompany these regulatory and market changes are discussed below. 

&#32; 

&#8226; 

Enabled by the Medicare Modernization Act (2003) and subsequent laws, Medicare and Medicaid have implemented pilot programs (officially termed demonstrations or models) to &#8220;divert&#8221; elderly from skilled nursing facilitates and promote &#8220;aging in place&#8221; in &#8220;the least restrictive environment.&#8221; Several states have implemented Home and Community-based Medicaid waiver programs that increase the support services available to senior citizens in senior housing, lengthening the time that many seniors can live outside of a skilled nursing facility. These Medicaid waiver programs are subject to re-approval and pilots are time-limited. Roll-back or expiration of these programs could have an adverse effect on the senior housing market. 

&#8226; 

Changes in certification and participation requirements of the Medicare and Medicaid programs have restricted, and are likely to continue to restrict further, eligibility for reimbursement under those programs. On July 16, 2015, CMS issued a proposed 

rule that, for the first time in nearly 25 years, would comprehensively update the skilled nursing facility ("SNF") requirements for participation under Medicare and Medicaid. Among other things, the proposed rule addresses requirements relating to quality of care and quality of life, facility responsibilities and staffing considerations, resident assessments, and compliance and ethics programs. We cannot accurately predict the effect the final rule will have on our tenants&#8217; business once it is promulgated. Failure to obtain and maintain Medicare and Medicaid certification by our tenants would result in denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments which would likely result in a significant loss of revenue. In addition, private payors, including managed care payors, increasingly are demanding that providers accept discounted payments resulting in lost revenue for specific patients. Efforts to impose reduced payments, greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue. Any reforms that significantly limit rates of reimbursement under the Medicare and Medicaid programs could have a material adverse effect on our tenants&#8217; profitability and cash flows which, in turn, could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us. We are unable to predict what reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be adopted in the future or the effect such changes will have on our tenants&#8217; operations. No assurance can be given that such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our tenants or on their ability to fulfil their obligations to us. 

&#8226; 

As a result of the Healthcare Reform Law, and specifically Medicaid expansion and establishment of Health Insurance Exchanges providing subsidized health insurance, an estimated seventeen million more Americans have health insurance. These newly-insured Americans utilize services delivered by providers at medical buildings and other healthcare facilities. The Healthcare Reform Law remains controversial and continued attempts to repeal or reverse aspects of the law could result in insured individuals losing coverage, and consequently foregoing services offered by provider tenants in medical buildings and other healthcare facilities. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the individual mandate of the Health Reform Laws but partially invalidated the expansion of Medicaid. The ruling on Medicaid expansion will allow states not to participate in the expansion - and to forego funding for the Medicaid expansion - without losing their existing Medicaid funding. Given that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants&#8217; revenues, through new patients, but could also further strain state budgets. While the federal government will pay for approximately 100% of those additional costs from 2014 to 2016, states will be expected to pay for part of those additional costs beginning in 2017. We cannot predict whether other current or future efforts to repeal or amend the Healthcare Reform Laws will be successful, nor can we predict the impact that such a repeal or amendment would have on our operators or tenants and their ability to meet their obligations to us. We cannot predict whether the existing Healthcare Reform Laws, or future healthcare reform legislation or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on our operators&#8217; or tenants&#8217; property or business. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the Healthcare Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well. 

&#32; 

&#8226; 

The CMS is currently in the midst of transitioning Medicare from a traditional fee for service reimbursement model to capitated, value-based, and bundled payment approaches in which the government pays a set amount for each beneficiary for a defined period of time, based on that person&#8217;s underlying medical needs, rather than the actual services provided. The result is increasing use of management tools to oversee individual providers and coordinate their services. This puts downward pressure on the number and expense of services provided. Roughly eight million Medicare beneficiaries now receive care via Accountable Care Organizations, and Medicare Advantage health plans now provide care for roughly seventeen million Medicare beneficiaries. The continued trend toward capitated, value&#8209;based, and bundled payment approaches has the potential to diminish the market for certain healthcare providers. In addition, on April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (&#8220;Access to Medicare Act&#8221;) was enacted. The Access to Medicare Act implements value-based purchasing for SNFs. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, 2% of SNF payments will be withheld and approximately 50% to 70% of the amount withheld will be paid to SNFs through value-based payments. SNFs began reporting the claims-based 30-Day All-Cause Readmission Measure on October 1, 2015 and will begin reporting a resource use measure by October 1, 2016. Both measures will be publicly available by October 1, 2017. 

&#8226; 

In October 2015, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (&#8220;GAO&#8221;) released a report recommending that CMS continue to improve data and oversight of nursing home quality measures. The GAO found that although CMS collects several types of data that give some insight into the quality of nursing homes, the data could provide a clearer picture of nursing home quality if some underlying problems with the data (i.e., the use of self-reported data and non-standardized survey methodologies) are corrected. The GAO recommends, among other things, that CMS implement a clear plan for ongoing auditing of self-reported data and establish a process for monitoring oversight modifications to better assess their effects. According to the GAO, timely completion of these actions is particularly important because Medicare payments to nursing homes will be dependent on quality data, through the implementation of the value based purchasing program, starting in fiscal year 2019. HHS agreed with the GAO&#8217;s recommendations, and to the extent such recommendations are implemented, they could impact our operators and tenants. 

&#8226; 

The majority of Medicare payments continue to be made through traditional Medicare Part A and Part B fee-for-service schedules. The Medicare and CHIP ("Children's Health Insurance Program") Reauthorization Act of 2015 (&#8220;MACRA&#8221;) addresses the risk of a Sustainable Growth Rate cut in Medicare payments for physician services. However, other annual Medicare payment regulations, particularly with respect to certain hospitals, skilled nursing care, and home health services have resulted in lower net pay increases than providers of those services have often expected. In addition, MACRA establishes a multi-year transition into pay-for-quality approaches for Medicare physicians and other providers. This will include payment reductions for providers who do not meet government quality standards. The implementation of pay-for-quality models is expected to produce funding disparities that could adversely impact some provider tenants in medical buildings and other healthcare properties. 

&#8226; 

Medicare reimburses nursing centers under a fixed payment methodology named the Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System (&#8220;SNF PPS&#8221;). SNF PPS is an acuity based classification system that uses nursing and therapy indexes adjusted by geographical wage indexes to calculate per diem rates for each Medicare patient. Payment rates are updated annually and are generally increased or decreased each October when the federal fiscal year begins. On July 30, 2015, CMS released its final rule outlining the fiscal year 2016 Medicare payments for skilled nursing facilities, which began October 1, 2015. The 2016 final rule provides for an approximate 1.2% rate update. This estimated increase consists of a 2.3% market basket increase, reduced by a 0.6% forecast error adjustment and further reduced 0.5% for a multifactor productivity adjustment required by the Healthcare Reform Law. CMS estimates the update will increase overall payments to skilled nursing facilities in fiscal year 2016 by $430 million compared to fiscal year 2015 levels. The effect of the 2016 PPS rate update on our tenants&#8217; revenues will be dependent upon their census and the mix of patients at the various PPS pay rates. In addition, we cannot predict how future changes may impact reimbursement rates under the SNF PPS system. 

&#8226; 

In January 2016, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission finalized its recommendations, among other things advising Congress to eliminate market basket updates for SNFs for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and directing the Secretary of HHS to revise the SNF prospective payment system. To the extent that these recommendations are implemented, they could impact our tenants. 

&#8226; 

The OIG has increased focus in recent years on billing practices by SNFs. In September 2015, OIG issued a report calling for reevaluation of the Medicare payment system for skilled nursing facilities. In particular, OIG found that Medicare payments for therapy greatly exceeded SNFs&#8217; costs for therapy, and that, under the current payment system, SNFs increasingly billed for the highest level of therapy even though key beneficiary characteristics remained largely the same. OIG determined that its findings demonstrated the need for CMS to reevaluate the Medicare SNF payment system, concluding that payment reform could save Medicare billions of dollars and encourage SNFs to provide services that are better aligned with beneficiaries&#8217; care needs. Most recently, OIG issued (1) its findings regarding the fiscal year 2015 Top Management and Performance Challenges Facing HHS and (2) the FY 2016 OIG Work Plan. Both cited SNF billing as an area that creates incentives for providers to bill more expensive care instead of the appropriate levels of care, requiring ongoing government monitoring and auditing for compliance. The OIG formulates a formal work plan each year for nursing centers. The OIG&#8217;s most recent work plan indicates that quality of care, assessment and monitoring, poorly performing nursing facilities, hospitalizations, criminal background checks, Medicare Part B services, accuracy of nursing facilities Minimum Data, transparency of ownership, and civil monetary penalty funds will be the investigative focus in 2016. If followed, these reports and recommendations may impact our tenants. We cannot predict the likelihood, scope or outcome of any such investigations on our tenants. 

We are neither an ongoing participant in, nor a direct recipient of, any reimbursement under these programs with respect to our facilities. 

Environmental Regulation 

As an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety matters. 

These laws and regulations address, among other things, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls, fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, radioactive materials, medical wastes, and hazardous wastes, and, in certain cases, the costs of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. Although we do not currently operate or manage our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and clean-up of our current and former properties from which there is or has been an actual or threatened release of a regulated material and any other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. Such costs typically are not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property&#8217;s value. In addition, we may be liable for certain other costs, such as governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources, as a result of any such actual or threatened release. For a discussion 

of risks related to environmental liabilities, see &#8220;Risk Factors-Risks Related to Us as a Property Healthcare Holding and Leasing Company&#8221; included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors , of this Annual Report. 

Under the terms of our leases, we generally have a right to indemnification by the tenants of our properties for any contamination caused by them. However, we cannot be assured that our tenants will have the financial capability or willingness to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations to us, and any failure, inability or unwillingness to do so may require us to satisfy the underlying environmental claims. In general, we have also agreed to indemnify our tenants against any environmental claims (including penalties and clean-up costs) resulting from any condition arising in, on or under, or relating to, our properties at any time before the applicable lease commencement date. 

We did not make any material capital expenditures in connection with environmental, health, and safety laws, ordinances and regulations in 2015 and do not expect that we will be required to make any such capital expenditures during 2016. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had 31 &#32;employees of which 24 &#32;were full-time employees (excluding employees related to the Company's management services agreement for three facilities in Ohio).
