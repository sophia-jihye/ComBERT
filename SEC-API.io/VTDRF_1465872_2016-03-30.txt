Business. 

Our Company 

Vantage Drilling International (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;VDI&#8221;), a Cayman Islands exempted company, is an international offshore drilling company focused on operating a fleet of modern, high specification drilling units. Our principal business is to contract drilling units, related equipment and work crews, primarily on a dayrate basis to drill oil and natural gas wells for our customers. We also provide construction supervision services for drilling units owned by others. Through our fleet of drilling units, we are a provider of offshore contract drilling services to major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies, focused primarily on international markets. 

The Company was previously known as Offshore Group Investment Limited and changed its corporate name to Vantage Drilling International effective February 11, 2016.

Restructuring Agreement and Bankruptcy Proceedings under Chapter 11

On December 1, 2015, we and Vantage Drilling Company (&#8220;VDC&#8221;), entered into a restructuring support agreement (the &#8220;Restructuring Agreement&#8221;) with a majority of our secured creditors. Pursuant to the terms of the Restructuring Agreement, the Company agreed to pursue a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the &#8220;Reorganization Plan&#8221;) under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code and VDC would commence official liquidation proceedings under the laws of the Cayman Islands. On December 2, 2015, pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement, the Company acquired two subsidiaries responsible for the management of the Company from VDC in exchange for a $61.5 million promissory note (the &#8220;VDC Note&#8221;).

On December 3, 2015, the Company and 24 debtor subsidiaries, including five debtor subsidiaries of VDC who were guarantors of the Company&#8217;s pre-bankruptcy secured debt, filed the Reorganization Plan in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (In re Vantage Drilling International (F/K/A Offshore Group Investment Limited), et al., Case No. 15-12422). On January 15, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed the Company&#8217;s Reorganization Plan and the Company emerged from bankruptcy effective February 10, 2016. The significant elements of the Reorganization Plan included:

Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the &#8220;Credit Agreement&#8221;) providing for (i) a $32.0 million revolving letter of credit facility to replace the Company&#8217;s existing $32.0 million revolving letter of credit commitment under its pre-petition credit facility and (ii) $143.0 million of term loans into which the claims of the lenders under the Company&#8217;s pre-petition credit facility were converted. The lenders under the Company&#8217;s pre-petition credit facility also received $7.0 million in cash under the Reorganization Plan. 

10% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes. The Company engaged in a rights offering for $75.0 million of new 10% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2020 (the &#8220;10% Second Lien Notes&#8221;) for certain holders of its secured debt claims. In connection with this rights offering, certain creditors entered into a &#8220;backstop&#8221; agreement to purchase 10% Second Lien Notes if the offer was not fully subscribed. The premium paid to such creditors under the backstop agreement was approximately $2.2 million, paid $1.1 million in cash and $1.1 million in additional 10% Second Lien Notes, resulting in a total issued amount of $76.1 million of 10% Second Lien Notes, and raising $73.9 million, after deducting the cash portion of the backstop premium. 

&#160;

1%/12% Step-Up Senior Secured Third Lien Convertible Notes. The Company issued 4,344,959 new ordinary shares of the Company (the &#8220;New Shares&#8221;) and $750.0 million of 1%/12% Step-Up Senior Secured Third Lien Convertible Notes due 2030 (the &#8220;Convertible Notes&#8221;) to certain creditors holding approximately $2.5 billion of pre-petition secured debt claims. The New Shares issued to these creditors and the Convertible Notes may only be traded together and not separately. The Convertible Notes are convertible into New Shares in certain circumstances, at a conversion price (subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the Third Lien Indenture) which was $95.60 as of the issue date. The Third Lien Indenture includes customary covenants that restrict the granting of liens and customary events of default, including, among other things, failure to issue securities upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. 

&#160;

VDC Note. Effective with the Company&#8217;s emergence from bankruptcy, VDC&#8217;s former equity interest in the Company was cancelled. Immediately following that event, the VDC Note was converted into 655,094 New Shares in accordance with the terms thereof, in satisfaction of the obligation thereunder, which, including accrued interest, totaled approximately $62.0 million as of such date. 

&#160;

The Reorganization Plan allowed the Company to maintain all operating assets and agreements. All trade payables, credits, wages and other r elated obligations were unimpaired by the Reorganization Plan. 

Drilling 

Jackups 

A jackup rig is a mobile, self-elevating drilling platform equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established for support, at which point the hull is raised out of the water into position to conduct drilling and workover operations. All of our jackup rigs were built at PPL Shipyard in Singapore. The design of our jackup rigs is the Baker Marine Pacific Class 375. These units are ultra-premium jackup rigs with independent legs capable of drilling in up to 375 feet of water, a cantilever drilling floor and a total drilling depth capacity of approximately 30,000 feet. 

Drillships 

Drillships are self-propelled and suited for drilling in remote locations because of their mobility and large load carrying capacity. All of our drillships are dynamically positioned and designed for drilling in water depths of up to 12,000 feet, with a total vertical drilling depth capacity of up to 40,000 feet. The drillships&#8217; hull design has a variable deck load of approximately 20,000 tons and measures approximately 781 feet long by 137 feet wide. All of our drillships were built at Daewoo Shipbuilding &#38; Marine Engineering shipyard in South Korea.

Strengths 

We believe our primary competitive strengths include the following: 

Premium fleet. Our fleet is currently comprised of seven ultra-premium high specification drilling units: four jackup rigs and three drillships. We believe the Emerald Driller , Sapphire Driller , Aquamarine Driller and Topaz Driller are ultra-premium jackup rigs due to their ability to drill in deeper depths, as well as their enhanced operational efficiency and technical capabilities when compared to a majority of the current global jackup rig fleet, which is primarily comprised of older, smaller, less capable rigs using less modern technology. The Platinum Explorer, Titanium Explorer and Tungsten Explorer are ultra-deepwater drillships that are designed to drill in up to 12,000 feet of water. Our drillships are currently equipped to drill in water depths of up to 10,000 feet. We believe 10,000 feet to be the upper-limit water depth currently being developed by leading offshore exploration and production companies, though we also believe that they are evaluating future deepwater development projects in water depths in excess of 10,000 feet. 

Proven track record . We have a proven track record of successfully managing, constructing, marketing and operating offshore drilling units. Our in-house team of engineers and construction personnel has overseen complex rig construction projects. As a result, our rigs have generally been delivered within budget and either on time or ahead of schedule. 

Experienced management and operational team . We benefit from our management team, which has extensive experience in the drilling industry, including international and domestic public company experience involving numerous acquisitions and debt and equity financings. 

&#160;

Strategy 

Our strategy includes: 

Maintain significant liquidity. In response to the significant downturn in the drilling industry, we are strategically preserving our liquidity. Completing the Reorganization Plan significantly reduced our debt service obligations and we have no significant maturities until December 2019. We are working to optimize our workforce for our current level of operations, deferring maintenance and capital expenditures and working to extend our contract backlog. 

Capitalize on customer demand for modern, high specification units . We own and manage high specification drilling units, which are well suited to meet the requirements of customers for efficiently drilling through deep and complex geological formations, and drilling horizontally. Additionally, high specification drilling units generally provide faster drilling and moving times. A majority of the bid invitations for jackups that we receive require high specification units. Aside from their drilling capabilities, we believe that customers generally prefer new drilling units because of improved safety features and less frequent downtime for maintenance. New, modern drilling units are also generally preferred by crews, which makes it easier to hire and retain high quality operating personnel. 

Focus on international markets . We have been able to successfully deploy and operate our drilling units in some of the most active international oil and natural gas producing regions. We believe that exposure to certain international markets with major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies will increase the predictability of our cash flows because those markets have exhibited less historical cyclicality. We also believe that our internationally diverse platform reduces our exposure to a single market. Capitalize on our infrastructure to better serve our customers. 

Expand key industry relationships . We are focused on expanding relationships with major, national and independent oil and natural gas companies, focused primarily on international markets, which we believe will allow us to obtain longer-term contracts to build our backlog of business when dayrates and operating margins justify entering into such contracts. We believe that our existing relationships with these companies have contributed to our historically strong contract backlog. Longer-term contracts increase revenue visibility and mitigate some of the volatility in cash flows caused by cyclical market downturns. 

Maintain our deepwater exposure . We believe our customers will continue an emphasis on exploration in deeper waters due, in part, to technological developments that have made such exploration more feasible and cost-effective. We believe that the water-depth capability of our ultra-deepwater drilling units is attractive to our customers and allows us to compete effectively in obtaining long-term deepwater drilling contracts. We may seek to manage or acquire additional deepwater drilling units to service this market. 

Our Industry 

The offshore contract drilling industry provides drilling, workover and well construction services to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies through the use of mobile offshore drilling units. Historically, the offshore drilling industry has been very cyclical with periods of high demand, limited rig supply and high dayrates alternating with periods of low demand, excess rig supply and low dayrates. Periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify the competition in the industry and often result in some rigs becoming idle for long periods of time. As is common throughout the oilfield services industry, offshore drilling is largely driven by actual or anticipated changes in oil and natural gas prices and capital spending by companies exploring for and producing oil and natural gas. Sustained high commodity prices historically have led to increases in expenditures for offshore drilling activities and, as a result, greater demand for our services. Due to a recent decline in the price of oil and gas there has been a reduced demand for offshore drilling rigs by our customers. The reduced demand is occurring at the same time that a significant number of drilling rigs are scheduled for delivery resulting in an oversupply of equipment. We expect that these adverse market conditions are likely to continue for the duration of 2016 and 2017. 

Offshore drilling rigs are generally marketed on a worldwide basis as rigs can be moved from one region to another. The cost of moving a rig and the availability of rig-moving vessels may cause the supply and demand balance to vary between regions. However, significant variations between regions do not tend to exist long-term because of rig mobility. 

The offshore drilling market generally consists of shallow water (&#60;400 ft.), midwater (&#62;400 ft.), deepwater (&#62;4,000 ft.) and ultra-deepwater (&#62;7,500 ft.). The global shallow water market is serviced primarily by jackups. 

Our jackup fleet is focused on the &#8220;long-legged&#8221; (350+ ft.) high specification market. The drillships that we operate are focused on the ultra-deepwater segment, but can operate in the midwater and deepwater markets as well. 

&#160;

Customer s 

Our customers are primarily large multinational oil and natural gas companies, government owned oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas producers.

Drilling Contracts 

Our drilling contracts are the result of negotiation with our customers, and most contracts are awarded through competitive bidding against other contractors. Drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a dayrate basis, with higher rates while the drilling unit is operating and lower rates for periods of mobilization or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse environmental conditions or other conditions beyond our control. Currently all of our drilling contracts are on a dayrate basis. A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or group of wells or covering a stated term. Certain of our contracts with customers may be cancelable at the option of the customer upon payment of an early termination fee. Such payments may not, however, fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. Contracts also customarily provide for either automatic termination or termination at the option of the customer typically without the payment of any termination fee, under various circumstances such as non-performance, in the event of extensive downtime or impaired performance caused by equipment or operational issues, or sustained periods of downtime due to force majeure events. Many of these events are beyond our control. The contract term in some instances may be extended by the client exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional term. Our contracts also typically include a provision that allows the client to extend the contract to finish drilling a well-in-progress. During periods of depressed market conditions, our clients may seek to renegotiate drilling contracts to reduce their obligations or may seek to repudiate their contracts. Suspension of drilling contracts will result in the reduction in or loss of dayrate for the period of the suspension. If our customers cancel some of our contracts and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and on substantially similar terms, if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time or if a number of our contracts are renegotiated, it could adversely affect our consolidated statements of financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Contract Backlog 

As of December 31, 2015, our owned fleet had total contract backlog of approximately $339.0 million. We expect that approximately $149.8 million of our total contract backlog will be performed during 2016, with the remainder performed in subsequent years.

Competition 

The contract drilling industry is highly competitive. Demand for contract drilling and related services is influenced by a number of factors, including the current and expected prices of oil and natural gas and the expenditures of oil and natural gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas. In addition, demand for drilling services remains dependent on a variety of political and economic factors beyond our control, including worldwide demand for oil and natural gas, the ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, to set and maintain production levels and pricing, the level of production of non-OPEC countries and the policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves. 

Drilling contracts are generally awarded on a competitive bid or negotiated basis. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Rig availability, capabilities, age and each contractor&#8217;s safety performance record and reputation for quality also can be key factors in the determination. Operators also may consider crew experience, rig location and efficiency. We believe that the market for drilling contracts will continue to be highly competitive for the foreseeable future. Certain competitors may have greater financial resources than we do, which may better enable them to withstand periods of low utilization, compete more effectively in a low price environment, build new rigs or acquire existing rigs. 

Our competition ranges from large international companies offering a wide range of drilling and other oilfield services to smaller, locally owned companies. Competition for rigs is usually on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, at a cost that is sometimes substantial, from one region to another in response to demand. 

Operating Hazards 

Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the offshore drilling business, including, but not limited to: blowouts, craterings, fires, explosions, equipment failures, loss of well control, loss of hole, damaged or lost equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. 

These hazards could cause personal injury or death, serious damage to or destruction of property and equipment, suspension of drilling operations, or damage to the environment, including damage to producing formations and surrounding areas. Generally, we seek to obtain contractual indemnification from our customers for some of these risks. To the extent not transferred to customers by contract, we seek protection against some of these risks through insurance, including property casualty insurance on our rigs and drilling equipment, protection and indemnity, commercial general liability, which has coverage extension for underground resources and equipment coverage, commercial contract indemnity and commercial umbrella insurance. 

There are risks that are outside of our control. Nonetheless, we believe that we are adequately insured for liability and property damage to others with respect to our operations. However, such insurance may not be sufficient to protect us against liability for all consequences of well disasters, extensive fire damage or damage to the environment. For more, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Our business involves numerous operating hazards, and our insurance and contractual indemnity rights may not be adequate to cover our losses.&#8221; 

Insurance 

We maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage, third party liability, employer&#8217;s liability, loss of hire, war risk, general liability, vessel pollution and other coverage. However, our insurance is subject to exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages. 

Our primary marine package provides for hull and machinery coverage for our drilling units up to a scheduled value for each asset, which we believe approximates replacement cost. The maximum coverage for our seven drilling units is $2.5 billion. The policies are subject to certain exclusions, limitations, deductibles and other conditions. Deductibles for physical damage to our jackup rigs and our drillships are $2.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively, per occurrence. Our protection and indemnity policy provides liability coverage limits of $500 million per rig. In addition to these policies, we have separate policies providing coverage for onshore general liability, employer&#8217;s liability, auto liability and non-owned aircraft liability, with customary coverage, limits and deductibles. 

&#160;

Foreign Regulation 

Our operations are conducted primarily in foreign jurisdictions and are subject to, and affected in varying degrees by, governmental laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the importation of and operation of drilling units, currency conversions and repatriation, oil and natural gas exploration and development, environmental protection, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel, the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of drilling units and other equipment. Governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions and companies holding concessions, the exploration for oil and natural gas and other aspects of the oil and natural gas industries in their countries. In some areas of the world, this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and natural gas companies and may continue to do so. Furthermore, these regulations have limited the opportunities for international drilling contracts to participate in tenders for contracts or to perform services in certain countries as the governments have strongly favored local service providers. Operations in less developed countries may be subject to legal systems that are not as predictable as those in more developed countries, which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings. 

Environmental Regulation 

For a discussion of the effects of environmental regulation on our current operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Our business is subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those that may impose significant costs and liability on us for environmental and natural resource damages.&#8221; We anticipate that we will continue to make expenditures to comply with environmental requirements. To date, we have not expended material amounts beyond those amounts spent on our basic rig designs in order to comply and we do not believe that our compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or competitive position or materially increase our capital expenditures. 

Heightened environmental concerns in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico have led to greater and more stringent environmental regulation, higher drilling costs, and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process. In the United States, requirements applicable to our operations include regulations that require us to obtain and maintain specified permits or governmental approvals, control the discharge of materials into the environment, require removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment, or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become more stringent and may in some cases impose strict liability, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person. Some of these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others or for acts which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed. The application of these requirements or the adoption of new or more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

The U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act, prohibits the discharge of pollutants, including petroleum, into the navigable waters of the United States without a permit. The regulations implementing the Clean Water Act require permits to be obtained by an operator before discharge from specified exploration activities occurs. Certain facilities that store or otherwise handle oil are required to prepare and implement Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure Plans and Facility Response Plans relating to the possible discharge of oil to surface waters. Violations of monitoring, reporting, permitting and other requirements can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties. 

The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (&#8220;OPA&#8221;) and related regulations impose a variety of requirements on &#8220;responsible parties&#8221; related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. A &#8220;responsible party&#8221; includes the owners or operator of a facility or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. OPA establishes a liability limit for offshore facilities of all removal costs plus $75.0 million, and a lesser limit for some vessels depending on their size. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, and the liability could be substantial. Failure to comply with ongoing requirements or inadequate cooperation in the event of a spill could subject a responsible party to administrative, civil or criminal enforcement actions. Congress has been urged to consider changes to OPA that would increase or eliminate the limits on liability and companion bills that would eliminate the $75.0 million liability limit have been referred to various committees of Congress. OPA requires owners and operators of certain vessels to establish and maintain with the U.S. Coast Guard evidence of financial responsibility. Vessel owners and operators may evidence their financial responsibility by showing proof of insurance, surety bond, self-insurance or financial guaranty. 

Laws governing air emissions and solid and hazardous waste also apply to our operations. The U.S. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act authorizes regulations relating to safety and environmental protection applicable to lessees and permittees operating on the outer continental shelf. Included among these are regulations that require the preparation of spill contingency plans and establishment 

&#160;

of air quality standards for certain pollutants, including particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides. Specific design and operational standards may apply to outer continental shelf vessels, rigs, platforms, vehicles and structures. Violations of lease conditions or reg ulations related to the environment issued pursuant to the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act can result in substantial civil and criminal penalties, as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and canceling leases. Such enforcement li abilities can result from either governmental or citizen prosecution. 

In recent years, a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security were adopted to address terrorism risks, including the U.S. Coast Guard regulations implementing the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002. These regulations require, among other things, the development of vessel security plans and on-board installation of automatic information systems, or AIS, to enhance vessel-to-vessel and vessel-to-shore communications. 

The United States is one of approximately 165 member countries to the International Maritime Organization (&#8220;IMO&#8221;), a specialized agency of the United Nations that is responsible for developing measures to improve the safety and security of international shipping and to prevent marine pollution from ships. Among the various international conventions negotiated by the IMO is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (&#8220;MARPOL&#8221;). MARPOL imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry relating to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling and disposal of noxious liquids, harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage and air emissions. 

Annex VI to MARPOL sets limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances. Annex VI also imposes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for specialized areas to be established internationally with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions. For vessels 400 gross tons and greater, platforms and drilling units, Annex VI imposes various survey and certification requirements. For this purpose, gross tonnage is based on the International Tonnage Certificate for the vessel. The United States has ratified Annex VI. In addition, any drilling units we operate internationally are subject to the requirements of Annex VI in those countries that have implemented its provisions. We believe the drilling units we currently offer for international projects comply with Annex VI, but changes to our equipment and ratifying countries&#8217; regulatory interpretations of the Annex VI requirements could impose additional costs on us, which could be significant. 

Although significant capital expenditures may be required to comply with these governmental laws and regulations, such compliance has not materially adversely affected our earnings or competitive position. We believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with the environmental regulations to which we are subject. 

Employees 

At January 31, 2016, we managed a workforce of approximately 843 people, of which 530 were our direct employees.
