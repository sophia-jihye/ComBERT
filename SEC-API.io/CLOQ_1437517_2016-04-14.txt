Since becoming incorporated, Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. has not made any significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has it been involved in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. is not a blank check registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933, since it has a specific business plan or purpose and is currently operational. Since our inception, we have been engaged in business activities, including researching the industry, developing our advertising platforms, performing due diligence regarding potential customers most suitable for our Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. services and identifying future business platforms.

Currently, Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. has two officers and directors who have assumed responsibility for all planning, development and operational duties. Other than the officers and directors, there are no employees at the present time. We do anticipate hiring employees when the need arises.

Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. has no intention to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company nor does management intend to use the Company, once reporting as a vehicle for a private Company to become a reporting company. We may pursue strategic acquisitions that compliment our current business model within the advertising industry which may allow us to expand our activities and capabilities

&#160;

Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc.&#8217;s fiscal year end is December 31.

Business of Issuer

Our services are in the U.S. under the brand name Advanced Credit Technologies, Inc. We have implemented the Phase 1 build out of our business by providing consumers a simplified way of managing their credit. Although we are a development stage Company, we currently generate minimal revenues from operations. Our services, while not technically difficult to provide, must be continually developed to provide our clients the most current platforms. By using our proprietary software system, a client can perform affordable credit management with an automated process and clearly understand the credit scoring (FICO) system currently used the country.

&#160;

In addition, we are offering affiliate websites that will give affiliates a custom home page for them to use as a portal for their customers. This is an excellent profit center and gives us high retention for those affiliates.

Our technology will focus initially on two channels:

&#160; Retail. End users who would traditionally have to buy a kit or hire a credit management specialist to do this for them. The drawback to most self-help methods is that it usually doesn&#8217;t work, and in some cases makes the situation worse. Our software, along with video tutorials, makes it easy for a client to succeed. The process is the same for everyone, why would you pay hundreds or thousands if you could do it yourself for minimal expense.

&#160; Wholesale. Those who wish to offer as a complimentary service to existing and potential clients to close more sales in their particular business -- from real estate, automotive, loan originators, boat and RV facilities, to insurance professionals. All in an effort to build a client network of profitable sales.

In addition to the two initial channels, we are also planning to launch a prepaid card branded as the TurnScor Card. The TurnScor Card will allow active users of the card to take advantage of ACT's credit repair services. Through offering credit repair as part of a "suite" of products that are included with the Card, we believe that the TurnScor Card will separate itself from other GPR cards in the space, and will allow ACT to go to a large segment of the unbanked and underbanked population of the country that may not otherwise have had access to the TurnScor technology. 

Industry Background

&#160;

The number of Americans with bad credit has risen sharply since 2007, with more than 45 million now affected by a negative credit history( scores below 599 ), according to a July 2010 study by FICO (htpp://www.creditscoring.com/twoandtwo/fall//). The increase reflects a spike in delinquencies on home loans and credit cards by middle-class Americans. The company did not create the aforementioned website, however, we deem the information reliable and accurate in regards to the current credit scoring tables of Americans today.

&#160;

The credit management business consists of thousands of smaller firms, organizations and individual consultants for everyone of the few dozen well-known companies. There are currently thousands of companies in the U.S. offering credit management and debt elimination services. Credit management participants range from major consultants to thousands of individuals.

&#160;

Due to widespread abuses, the Federal Trade Commission approved a rule (July 29, 2010, taking effect in October 2010) which will make it very hard for companies to pitch their business by advertising dubious claims related to their success rates. Among others, it will prevent them from charging upfront fees. This will thin the ranks of the credit management business sector and will surely put a great number of unprofessional companies out of business.

&#160;

We would like to emphasize here that we are not in the business of settling debts on behalf of clients, nor collects upfront fees as a partial payment for service rendered or to be rendered in the future. We merely sell a product that involves a process to challenge information on credit reports, which may be wrong. The client is the one using the software to assist themselves.

Our Services

We offer a proprietary software platform which will allow customers to monitor and manage their credit from the privacy of their own homes. They can sign up from their home or office via the Internet and manage their credit. The technology is unique in the industry and offers a reminder service and prompts the customer through the entire process.

&#160;

Our web-based platform has been put through numerous tests by Contata, our software partner. Contata ran thousands of trials using real people as mock clients going through the whole process. These thorough and comprehensive tests resulted in our current glitch-free platform, which can operate with thousands of clients at the same time and it can be scaled to any dimension if required. Our services include the following:

&#160; The customer is provided with everything they need, that can be provided over the Internet, to manage their credit. This service is offered at a price that cannot be matched by anyone operating a traditional credit management firm because of the need for employees.

&#160; Our new phase II software, TurnScor / TurnScor Pro creates your own personalized home page and organizes your credit profile which is updated in real time and is accessible 24/7. The three major credit bureaus are hoping you get distracted, dejected, or simply give up and settle for a sub-par credit score. This means that credit card companies, banks and mortgage lenders can charge you a higher rate of interest, costing you thousands of dollars in wealth building capabilities

&#160; The wholesale division (ACT) also offers the processing of credit management to other firms that wish to offer this service or for those that do offer this service. ACT will increase their profit and reduce overhead.

&#160; We also offer private label websites allowing customers to use their store front to offer our services. In addition, we offer consulting services.

The Market

TurnScor / TurnScor Pro will be focusing initially on the general consumer market and on any company that bases the majority of its sales through their customer&#8217;s credit such as mortgage companies, real estate companies and auto and marine dealers.

&#160;

&#160;

We will also market heavily to large organizations who can offer ACT as a service to their members such as unions, non-profits, churches, etc. Part of our marketing will be to the general consumer as it is our largest market it is also the most difficult and expensive to reach.

Improving FICO scores by using our software will necessarily take some time, which will pass anyway. There are millions of individuals who currently have no credit buying power but who will once the economy improves. By buying our service now, they will save time, and as soon as their buying power is restored, they will be able to buy on credit.

&#160;

We have created an ebook as well as video tutorials which explain the credit management process and also help to sell the online software component. This ebook will give the consumer added value to their purchase and give us an additional opportunity to up sell them for added services in the process.

Because exposure, response and overall efficiency of Internet media are easier to track than traditional off-line media &#8211; through the use of web analytics for instance &#8211; Internet credit management can offer a greater sense of accountability for clients. 

&#160;

Marketers and their clients are becoming aware of the need to measure the collaborative effects of marketing (i.e., how the Internet affects in-store sales) rather than siloing each advertising medium. The effects of multi-channel marketing can be difficult to determine, but are an important part of ascertaining the value of media campaigns.

&#160;

Marketing Strategy

&#160;

Our core marketing strategy will consist of business to business communications. From small to large business all across the country, we have started to generate revenue in all of our vertical markets. The automotive industry is going to be our first large scale opportunity, followed by real estate, insurance, and mortgage. Large corporations looking for employee benefits could also take advantage of our software in an effort to improve efficiencies and employee morale.

&#160;

Networking through social media is the future. A product needs a media to spread the word. This can be achieved very efficiently using social media by communicating with an ever expanding number of potential clients, answering their questions, promoting new features, getting feedback, criticism and kudos as well as suggestions. Some of those hundreds of millions of individuals active in social media may become our best, unpaid marketing agents

ACT together with our technology partner, Contata, will be expanding revenue streams through social networking. We firmly believe that this is where the next technology revolution resides.

&#160;

Through additional research and looking at current marketing strategies we have determined it would not be a wise use of funds to do an infomercial or high production video as it is cost prohibitive.

Search Engine Optimization and branding our product with blogging, video blogging and article submission will be used in conjunction with our Facebook advertising efforts driving people to either a contact up opt-in or weekly Facebook marketing list.

Direct selling will also be used to warm up markets and referrals to realtors, lenders and auto dealers.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

Competition in the credit management industry is growing however, we believe we separate ourselves from other credit management companies in that we provide our platform on a wholesale basis and our methodology and process is free to the end users under our business model. Some of the largest credit repair companies include Lexington Law, Sky Blue Credit, DSI Solutions, MSI Credit Solutions and Credit Assistance Network. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do. Accordingly, we must rely on our innovative, proprietary software platform to gain market share in the industry.

Government Regulation

Current governmental regulations in place are geared toward protecting consumers&#8217; rights and privacy. As a result, we have put into place safeguards for online marketing campaigns pertaining to: Trademarks, Copyrights and Privacy. In addition, online marketing via email requires compliance with the federal CAN SPAM act. The CAN SPAM Act regulates the way email campaigns are conducted. The Company&#8217;s operations are not directly affected by this Act because a third party company will be contracted to implement such a campaign. Individuals have the ability to opt in or opt out in connection with the receipt of such promotional material. Other than regulations incidental to all business, the Company is not subject to any particular government regulation that would or could materially impact the Company&#8217;s business. The costs associated with these requirements add to our cost of services provided.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Employees

Other than our officers and directors, there are no employees of the Company. Our officers and directors intend to do whatever work is necessary to increase revenues from operating. Human resource planning will be part of an ongoing process that will include constant evaluation of operations and revenue realization.

Board Committees

ACT has not yet implemented any board committees as of the date of this Prospectus.

Directors

There is no maximum number of directors ACT is authorized to have. However, in no event may ACT have less than one director. Although the Company anticipates appointing additional directors, it has not identified any such person(s).
