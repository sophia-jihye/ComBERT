 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

General 

&#160;

We are a Minnesota corporation incorporated on May 27, 1994. We operate as a Real Estate Investment Trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;) and are engaged in the business of making mortgage loans to churches and other non-profit religious organizations throughout the United States. The principal amount of loans we offer ranges from $100,000 to $2,000,000. We may also invest up to 30% of our Average Invested Assets in mortgage secured debt securities (bonds) issued by churches and other non-profit religious organizations. Between the date upon which we began active business operations (April 15, 1996) and March 31, 2015, we have made 186 loans to 158 churches approximating $96,842,253, with the average principal amount of such loans being $521,000. Of the 186 loans we have made, 101 loans totaling $55,655,862 have been repaid early by the borrowing churches. We also own, as of December 31, 2015, $10,714,000 principal amount of Church Bonds (hereinafter defined). At no time have we paid a premium for any of the bonds in our portfolio. Subject to the supervision of our Board of Directors, our day to day business operations are managed by Church Loan Advisors, Inc. (the &#8220;Advisor&#8221;), which provides investment advisory and administrative services to us. The principals of the Advisor include principals of American Investors Group, Inc., (&#8220;American&#8221;) a FINRA member broker-dealer, which has served as underwriter of the public offerings of our common stock, as well as our public offerings of secured investor certificates.

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Business Activities 

&#160;

Our business is managed by the Advisor. We have no employees but we do have two executive officers. The Advisor's affiliate, American has been engaged since 1987 in the business of underwriting first mortgage bonds for churches throughout the United States. In underwriting church bonds, American reviews financing proposals, analyzes prospective borrowers&#8217; financial capability, and structures, markets and sells, mortgage-backed securities which are debt obligations (bonds) of such borrowers to the investing general public. Since its inception, American has underwritten approximately 283 church bond financings, in which approximately $534,239,000 in first mortgage bonds have been sold to public investors. The average size of single church bond financings underwritten by American since its inception is approximately $1,887,000.

&#160;

In the course of its business, American identified a demand from potential borrowers for smaller loans of $100,000 to $2,000,000. Because of the regulatory, administrative expenses and complexity normally associated with the bond financing business, American determined that the economic feasibility of bond financing diminished for financings under $1,000,000. As a result, we believe that many churches are forced to either forego the project for which their financing request was made, fund their project from cash flow over a period of time and at greater expense, or seek bank financing at terms that are not always favorable or available to them, due to the historic reluctance of banks to lend to churches for other than economic reasons. Our objective is to provide a lending source to this segment of the industry by capitalizing on the human resources

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

and experience available at American and the Advisor, and taking advantage of the marketing, advertising and general goodwill of American.

&#160; 

Financing Business 

&#160;

Our primary business is to make first mortgage loans in amounts ranging from $100,000 to $2,000,000, to churches and other non-profit religious organizations, and selecting and investing in mortgage-secured debt instruments (&#34;Church Bonds&#34;) issued by churches and other non-profit religious organizations throughout the United States. All of our loans belong to one portfolio segment. We attempt to apply our working capital (after adequate reserves determined by the Advisor) toward making mortgage loans and investing in Church Bonds. We seek to enhance returns on investments on such loans by:

&#160;

&#183; offering terms of up to 30 years, generating the highest yields possible under current market conditions; &#160;

&#160;

&#183; seeking origination fees (i.e. &#34;points&#34;) from the borrower at the outset of a loan and upon any renewal of a loan; &#160;

&#183; making a limited amount of higher-interest rate second mortgage loans to qualified borrowers; and &#160;

&#183; purchasing mortgage-secured debt securities having various maturities issued by churches and other non-profit religious organizations. &#160;

Our policies limit the amount of second mortgage loans to 20% of the Company's Average Invested Assets (hereinafter defined) on the date any second mortgage loan is closed and limit the amount of mortgage-secured debt securities to 30% of Average Invested Assets on the date of their purchase.

&#160;

&#8220;Average Invested Assets&#8221; for any period is defined as the average of the aggregated book value of the assets of the corporation invested, directly or indirectly, in loans (or interests in loans) secured by real estate, and first mortgage bonds, before reserves for depreciation or bad debts or other similar non-cash reserves computed by taking the average of such values at the end of each calendar month during such period.

&#160;

All other mortgage loans made by us (or Church Bonds purchased for investment) will be secured by a first mortgage (or deed of trust) lien in favor of us. Although we attempt to make mortgage loans for various terms typically ranging from one to thirty years, we may determine to emphasize longer-term fixed-rate loans in our discretion, in order to reduce the risk to us of downward interest rate fluctuations.

&#160;

Our lending and investing operations, including determination of a prospective borrower's or church bond issuer's financial credit worthiness, are made on our behalf by the Advisor. Employees and agents of the Advisor conduct all aspects of our business, including (i) marketing and advertising; (ii) communication with prospective borrowers; (iii) processing loan applications; (iv) closing the loans; (v) servicing the loans; (vi) enforcing the terms of our loans; (vii) shareholder relations and (viii) administering our day-to-day business. For its services, the Advisor is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 1.25% annually of the Company's Average Invested Assets, plus one-half of any origination fee charged to borrowers on mortgage loans we make. The management fee is reduced to 1% on assets from $35 million to $50 million and to .75% on assets over $50 million. The Advisor&#8217;s management fees are computed and payable monthly.

&#160;

Current First Mortgage Loan Terms 

&#160;

We offer prospective borrowers a selection of loan types, which include a choice of fixed or variable rates of interest indexed to the prime rate, the U.S. Treasury 10-Year Notes, or another generally recognized reference index, and having various terms to maturity, origination fees and other terms and conditions. The terms of loans we offer may be changed by our Advisor as a result of such factors as (i) the credit quality and experience of the borrowers; (ii) the terms of loans in our portfolio; (iii) competition from other lenders; (iv) anticipated need to increase the overall yield on our mortgage loan portfolio; (v) local and national economic factors; and (vi) actual experience in borrowers&#8217; demand for the loans. We currently offer the loan types described in the table below. This table describes certain material terms of loans available from us. The table does not purport to identify all possible terms, rates, and fees we may offer. We may modify the terms identified below or offer loan terms different than those identified below at any time. Many loans are individually negotiated and differ from the terms described below.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Loan Type Interest Rate (1) Origination Fee (2) 25/30 Year Term (3) Fixed @ 8.75%/8.95% respectively 3.5% 20 Year Term (3) Variable Annually @ Prime + 2.50% 3.5% 3 Year Renewable Term (4) Fixed @ 8.25% 3.0% Construction 1 Year Term Fixed @ 9.00% 2.0% &#160;

(1) &#8220;Prime&#8221; means the prime rate of interest charged to preferred customers, as published by a federally chartered bank chosen by us. We may also tie our offered interest rates to other indices. (2) These are &#8220;target&#8221; fees and negotiation of these fees with borrowers can occur. Origination fees are generally based on the original principal amount of the loan and are collected from the borrower at the origination and renewal of loans, one-half of which is payable directly to our Advisor. (3) Fully amortized repayment term. Amortization terms may vary, as may other loan terms, depending on individual loan negotiations and competitive forces. (4) Renewable term loans are repaid based on a 25-year amortization schedule, and are renewable at the conclusion of their initial term for additional like terms up to an aggregated maximum of 25 years. We charge a fee of 1% upon the date of each renewal. If renewed by the borrower, the interest rate is adjusted upon renewal to Prime plus a specified percentage &#8220;spread.&#8221; &#160; 

Mortgage Loan Processing and Underwriting 

&#160;

Mortgage loan applications are prepared and verified by our Advisor's personnel in our Loan Origination and Underwriting Department. Verification procedures are designed to assure a borrower's qualification under our Financing Policies which are specifically identified herein and include, among other things, obtaining:

&#160;

&#183; applications containing key information concerning the prospective borrowers; &#160;

&#183; project description; &#160;

&#183; financial statements in accordance with our Financing Policies; &#160;

&#183; corporate records and other organizational documents of the borrower; &#160;

&#183; preliminary title report or commitment for mortgagee title insurance; and &#160;

&#183; a real estate appraisal in accordance with the Financing Policies. &#160;

All appraisals are prepared by independent third-party professionals who we approve based on their experience, reputation and education. All financial statements are prepared by independent third-party professionals or a qualified accountant that we hire that is independent of the borrower. Completed loan applications, together with a written summary are then presented to our Underwriting Committee. Our loan Underwriting Committee is comprised of the Advisor's President and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and certain members of its staff. Our Advisor may arrange for the provision of mortgage title insurance and for the services of professional independent third-party accountants and appraisers on behalf of borrowers in order to achieve pricing efficiencies on their behalf and to assure the efficient delivery of title commitments, preliminary title reports and title policies, and financial statements and appraisals that meet our underwriting criteria. Our Advisor may arrange for the direct payment for such professional services and for the direct reimbursement to it of such expenditures by borrowers and prospective borrowers. Upon closing and funding of mortgage loans, an origination fee based on the original principal amount of each loan may be charged, of which one-half is payable by the borrower to our Advisor, and the other one-half to us.

&#160;

Loan Commitments 

&#160; 

Subsequent to approval by our Underwriting Committee, and prior to funding a loan, we may issue a loan commitment to qualified applicants. A loan commitment deposit may be required from the borrowing church to commence the loan preparation procedure. These deposits are directly applied by the Advisor to engage accountants and appraisers to prepare their respective reports on the church. Commitments may indicate, among other things, the loan amount, origination fees, closing

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

costs, underwriting expenses (if any), funding conditions, approval expiration dates and interest rate and other terms. Commitments generally set forth a &#34;prevailing&#34; interest rate that is subject to change in accordance with market interest rate fluctuations until the final loan closing documents are prepared, at which time we commit to a stated interest rate. In certain cases we may establish (&#34;lock in&#34;) interest rate commitments up to sixty (60) days from the commitment to closing; however, interest rate commitments beyond sixty days will not normally be issued unless we receive an appropriate fee premium based upon our assessment of the risk associated with a longer period.

&#160;

Loan Portfolio Management 

&#160;

Our portfolio of mortgage loans and Church Bonds is managed and serviced by our Advisor in accordance with the Advisory Agreement. The Advisor is responsible for all aspects of our mortgage loan business, including closing and recording of mortgage loans; collecting payments of principal and interest regularly and upon the maturity of a loan; enforcing loan payments and other lender's requirements; periodic review of each mortgage loan file and determination of its reserve classification; and exercising our remedies in connection with any defaulted or non-performing loans. Fees and costs of attorneys, insurance, bonds and other direct expenses incurred in connection with the exercise of such remedies are our responsibility. We may, however, recoup these expenses from the borrower in the process of pursuing our remedies. The Advisor will not receive any additional compensation for services rendered in connection with loan portfolio management or exercising remedies on our behalf in the event of a loan default.

&#160;

Loan Funding and Bank Borrowing 

&#160;

Our mortgage loans (and our purchases of Church Bonds) are funded with available cash.

&#160;

Currently, we have no borrowings with a commercial lender or bank. However, we may borrow up to 300% of our stockholders&#8217; equity (in the absence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level of borrowing is appropriate; any excess in borrowing over such 300% level must be approved by a majority of the Independent Directors and disclosed to shareholders in the next quarterly report along with justification for such excess) to make loans regardless of our capacity to (i) sell our securities on a continuing basis, or to (ii) reposition assets from the maturity or early repayment of mortgage loans in our secured investor certificates, minus reserves for operating expenses, and bad-debt reserves, as determined by the Advisor. Cash resources available to us for lending purposes include, in addition to the net proceeds from any future sales of our common stock, secured investor certificates (if any) or other debt securities, (i) principal repayments from borrowers on loans made by us and (ii) funds borrowed under any line of credit arrangement.

&#160;

Public Offerings - Secured Investor Certificates 

&#160;

In July 2014, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to offer $10,000,000 worth of Series D secured investor certificates (File No. 333-154831). The offering was declared effective by the SEC on August 12, 2014. The Series D certificates are offered in multiples of $1,000 with interest rates ranging from 4.00% to 7.00%, subject to changing market rates, and maturities from 4 and 7 to 15 years. At December 31, 2015, approximately 5,329 Series D certificates had been issued for $5,329,000.

&#160;

Previously, we offered Series A, Series B and Series C secured investor certificates, at various maturities and interest rates. The weighted average interest rate on all outstanding certificates was 6.57% at December 31, 2015 and 6.58% at December 31, 2014. Holders of the secured investor certificates may renew certificates at the current rates and terms upon maturity at the Company&#8217;s discretion. Renewals upon maturity are considered neither proceeds from nor issuance of secured investor certificates. Renewals of secured investor certificates totaled approximately $958,000 and $989,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. There were no Series A secured investor certificates outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. There were $16,012,000 and $16,763,000 representing 16,012 and 16,763 in outstanding Series B secured investor certificates as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively and there were $6,905,000 and $7,536,000 representing 6,905 and 7,536 in outstanding Series C secured investor certificates at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. All secured investor certificates are collateralized by certain mortgage loans receivable or secured church bonds of approximately the same stated value as the certificates. In addition, the secured investor certificates have certain financial and non-financial covenants, as set forth in each Series&#8217; respective trust indenture.

&#160; 

The Advisory Agreement 

&#160;

We have entered into a contract with the Advisor (the &#8220;Advisory Agreement&#8221;) under which the Advisor furnishes advice and recommendations concerning our business affairs, provides administrative services to us and manages our day-to-day

&#160;

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

operations. We have no employees but we do have two executive officers. All of our personnel needs are met through the personnel and expertise of the Advisor and its affiliates. Among other things, the Advisor:

&#160;

serves as our mortgage loan underwriter and advisor in connection with our primary business of making loans to churches; &#160;

&#183; advises and selects Church Bonds to be purchased and held for investment by us; &#160;

&#183; services all mortgage loans we make; &#160;

&#183; provides marketing and advertising and generates loan leads directly and through its affiliates; &#160;

&#183; deals with regulatory agencies, borrowers, lenders, banks, consultants, accountants, brokers, attorneys, appraisers, insurers and others; &#160;

&#183; supervises the preparation, filing and distribution of tax returns and reports to governmental agencies and to shareholders and acts on our behalf in connection with shareholder relations; &#160;

&#183; provides office space and personnel as required for the performance of the foregoing services; and &#160;

&#183; as requested by us, makes reports to us of its performance of the foregoing services and furnishes advice and recommendations with respect to other aspects of our business. &#160;

In performing its services under the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor may use facilities, personnel and support services of its affiliates. Expenses such as legal and accounting fees, stock transfer agent, registrar and paying agent fees and proxy solicitation expenses are direct expenses of ours and are not provided for by the Advisor as part of its services.

&#160;

The Advisory Agreement is renewable annually by us for one-year periods, subject to our determination, including a majority of the Independent Directors, that the Advisor's performance has been satisfactory and that the compensation paid the Advisor has been reasonable. The Advisory Agreement was last approved by the Board of Directors (including a majority of the Independent Directors) as of April 16, 2015. We may terminate the Advisory Agreement with or without cause upon 60 days written notice to the Advisor. Upon termination of the Advisory Agreement by either party, the Advisor may require us to change our name to a name that does not contain the word &#34;American,&#34; &#34;America&#34; or the name of the Advisor or any approximation or abbreviation thereof, and that is sufficiently dissimilar to the word &#34;America&#34; or &#34;American&#34; or the name of the Advisor as to be unlikely to cause confusion or identification with either the Advisor or any person or entity using the word &#34;American&#34; or &#34;America&#34; in its name. Our Board of Directors shall determine that any successor Advisor possesses sufficient qualifications to perform the advisory function for us and justify the compensation provided for in its contract with us.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor is required to pay all of the expenses it incurs in providing services to us, including, but not limited to, personnel expenses, rental and other office expenses, expenses of officers and employees of the Advisor, including travel and all of its overhead and miscellaneous administrative expenses relating to performance of its functions under the Advisory Agreement. We are required to pay all other expenses we incur in the daily operations of our business&#8211;such as the costs and expenses of reporting to various governmental agencies and shareholders; the general conduct of our operations as a mortgage lender; fees and expenses of appraisers, directors, auditors, outside legal counsel and transfer agents; directors and officers liability insurance premiums; unreimbursed costs directly relating to closing of loan transactions; and costs relating to the enforcement of loan agreements and/or foreclosure proceedings.

&#160;

In the event that our Total Operating Expenses exceed in any calendar year the greater of (a) 2% of our Average Invested Assets or (b) 25% of our net income, the Advisor is obligated to reimburse us, to the extent of its fees for such calendar year, for the amount by which the aggregate annual operating expenses paid or incurred by us exceed the limitation. Total operating expenses as defined in the Advisory Agreement exclude expenses of raising capital, interest payments, taxes, non-cash expenditures (including, but not limited to, depreciation, amortization and bad debt reserves), incentive fees and property operation and disposition costs. The Independent Directors may, upon a finding of unusual and non-recurring factors which they deem sufficient, determine that a higher level of expenses is justified in any given year.

&#160;

Our bylaws provide that the Independent Directors are to determine at least annually the reasonableness of the compensation we pay to our Advisor. The Advisory Agreement was renewed for a one-year period as of April 16, 2015, and the reasonableness of our Advisor&#8217;s compensation was reviewed as of this date as well. Factors to be considered in reviewing

&#160;

&#160; 8 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

the Advisory Fee include the size of the fees of the Advisor in relation to the size, composition and profitability of our loan portfolio, the rates charged by other advisors performing comparable services, the success of the Advisor in generating opportunities that meet our investment objectives, the amount of additional revenues realized by the Advisor for other services performed for us, the quality and extent of service and advice furnished by the Advisor, the quality of our investments in relation to investments generated by the Advisor for its own account, if any, and the performance of our investments.

&#160;

The Advisory Agreement provides for indemnification by us of the Advisor and each of its directors, officers and employees against expense or liability arising out of such person's activities in rendering services to us, provided that the conduct against which the claim is made was determined by such person, in good faith, to be in our best interests and was not the result of negligence or misconduct.

&#160;

Financing Policies 

&#160;

Our business of mortgage lending to churches and other non-profit religious organizations is managed in accordance with and subject to the policies, guidelines, restrictions and limitations identified herein (collectively, the &#34;Financing Policy&#34;). The intent of the Financing Policy is to identify for our shareholders not only the general business in which we are involved, but the parameters of our lending business. These policies may not be changed (except in certain immaterial respects by majority approval of the Board of Directors) without the approval of a majority of the Independent Directors, and the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares at a duly held meeting for that purpose:

&#160;

(i) Loans made by us will be limited to churches and other non-profit religious organizations, and will be secured by mortgages. The total principal amount of all second mortgage loans that we fund is limited to 20% of Average Invested Assets. All other loans will be first mortgage loans. &#160;

(ii) The total principal amount of mortgage-secured debt securities we purchase from churches and other non-profit religious organizations is limited to 30% of our Average Invested Assets. &#160;

(iii) The loan amount cannot exceed 75% of the value of the real estate and improvements securing each loan, such value being determined based on a written appraisal prepared by an appraiser acceptable to the Advisor. On all loans, we will require a written appraisal certified by a member of the Appraisal Institute (&#34;MAI&#34;), or a state-certified appraiser. &#160;

(iv) An ALTA (American Land Title Association) or equivalent Mortgage Title Policy must be furnished to us by the borrower insuring our mortgage interest. &#160;

(v) The borrower's long-term debt (including the proposed loan) cannot exceed four times their gross income for the previous twelve (12) months. &#160;

(vi) The borrower must furnish us with financial statements (balance sheet and income and expense statement) for its last three (3) complete fiscal years and current financial statements for the period within ninety (90) days of the loan closing date. A borrower must have the last complete fiscal year financial statements reviewed by a certified public accountant (CPA) engaged by the borrower and who is independent of the borrower. On loans in excess of $500,000 our advisor may require the last complete fiscal year be audited by a CPA engaged by the borrower and who is independent of the borrower. In lieu of the above requirement, we or our Advisor may employ a qualified accountant. The qualified accountant we employ would be required to be independent of the borrower. Our employed qualified accountant would not be independent of us. Compiled financial statements of the borrower are acceptable from our employed qualified accountant. Along with the compiled financial statements of the borrower, our employed qualified accountant would perform partial and targeted review examination procedures for borrowers. On loans in excess of $500,000, the Advisor may require partial and targeted audit examination procedures for borrowers. &#160;

(vii) Borrowers in existence for less than three (3) fiscal years must provide financial statements since their inception. No loan will be extended to a borrower in operation less than two (2) calendar years absent express approval by our Board of Directors . &#160;

(viii) The Advisor typically requires the borrower to arrange for automatic electronic payment or drafting of monthly payments. &#160;

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

(ix) The Advisor may require (i) key-man life insurance on the life of the senior pastor of a church; (ii) personal guarantees of church members and/or affiliates; and (iii) other security enhancements for our benefit. &#160;

(x) The borrower must agree to provide to us annual reports (including financial statements) within 120 days of each fiscal year end beginning with the fiscal year end next following the funding of the loan. &#160;

(xi) The Advisor may require the borrower to grant to us a security interest in all personal property located and to be located upon the mortgaged premises (excluding property leased by the borrower). &#160;

(xii) We require borrowers to maintain a general perils and liability coverage insurance policy naming us as the loss-payee in connection with damage or destruction to the property of the borrower which typically includes weather-related damage, fire, vandalism and theft. Our Advisor may require the borrower to provide flood, earthquake and/or other special coverage. &#160;

These Financing Policies are in addition to the prohibited investments and activities identified below and which are set forth in our Bylaws.

&#160;

Prohibited Investments and Activities 

&#160;

Our Bylaws impose certain prohibitions and restrictions on our investment practices and lending activities, including prohibitions against:

&#160;

(i) Investing more than 10% of our total assets in unimproved real property or mortgage loans on unimproved real property; &#160;

(ii) Investing in commodities or commodity futures contracts other than &#34;interest rate futures&#34; contracts intended only for hedging purposes; &#160;

(iii) Investing in mortgage loans (including construction loans) on any one property which in the aggregate with all other mortgage loans on the property would exceed 75% of the appraised value of the property unless substantial justification exists because of the presence of other underwriting criteria; &#160;

(iv) Investing in mortgage loans that are subordinate to any mortgage or equity interest of the Advisor or the Directors or any of their affiliates; &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

(vii) Issuing redeemable equity securities;

&#160;

(viii) Engaging in underwriting or the agency distribution of securities issued by others;

&#160;

(ix) Issuing options or warrants to purchase our shares at an exercise price less than the fair market value of the shares on the date of the issuance or if the issuance thereof would exceed 10% in the aggregate of our outstanding shares; &#160;

(x) The aggregate borrowings of the corporation, secured and unsecured, must be reasonable in relation to the Stockholders&#8217; Equity of the corporation and must be reviewed by the Independent Directors at least quarterly. The maximum amount of such borrowings cannot exceed 300% of shareholder&#8217;s equity in the absence of a satisfactory showing that a higher level of borrowing is appropriate. Any excess in borrowing over such 300% level must be approved by a majority of Independent Directors and disclosed to shareholders in the next quarterly report along with justification for such excess; &#160;

(xi) Investing in real estate contracts of sale unless such contracts are in recordable form and are appropriately recorded in the chain of title; &#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

(xii) Selling or leasing to the Advisor, a Director or any affiliate thereof unless approved by a majority of our Directors (including a majority of our Independent Directors), who are not otherwise interested in such transaction, as being fair and reasonable to us; &#160;

(xiii) Acquiring property from any Advisor or Director, or any affiliate thereof, unless a majority of our Directors (including a majority of our Independent Directors) who are not otherwise interested in such transaction approve the transaction as being fair and reasonable and at a price to us which is no greater than the cost of the asset to such Advisor, Director or any affiliate thereof, or if the price to us is in excess of such cost, that substantial justification for such excess exists and such excess is reasonable. In no event shall the cost of such asset exceed its current appraised value; &#160;

(xiv) Investing or making mortgage loans unless a mortgagee's or owner's title insurance policy or commitment as to the priority of the mortgage or condition of title is obtained; or &#160;

(xv) Issuing shares on a deferred payment basis or other similar arrangement. &#160;

We do not invest in the securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control, to engage in the purchase and sale of investments other than as described in this Report, to offer securities in exchange for property unless deemed prudent by a majority of the Directors, or to make loans to other persons except in the ordinary course of our business as described herein.

&#160;

We will not make loans to or borrow from, or enter into any contract, joint venture or transaction with, any of our Directors or officers, the Advisor or any affiliate of any of the foregoing unless a majority of our Directors, including a majority of our Independent Directors, approves the transaction as fair and reasonable to us and the transaction is on terms and conditions no less favorable to us than those available from unaffiliated third parties. Any investment by us in any property, mortgage or other real estate interest pursuant to a transaction with the Advisor or any Directors or officers thereof will be based upon an appraisal of the underlying property from an independent qualified appraiser selected by the Independent Directors and will not be made at a price greater than fair market value as determined by such appraisal.

&#160;

Under Performing and Non-Performing Loans 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had eighteen first mortgage loans totaling approximately $5,502,740 that are three or more monthly payments in arrears. We may incur a loss if these borrowers are unable to bring their payments current and we are compelled to foreclose on their properties. We may be unable to dispose of the foreclosed properties on terms that enable us to recoup our expenses and outstanding balances. We have initiated foreclosure proceedings on three of these loans and expect to take possession of these three churches and list their property for sale. In addition, we have foreclosed and have taken possession of four properties, and one property via deed in lieu of foreclosure, with loan balances outstanding totaling approximately $1,497,000 and have listed the properties for sale through local realtors. The fair value of the properties, which represents the carrying value, was $697,000 at December 31, 2015 after an impairment reserve of approximately $800,000.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The business of making loans to churches and other non-profit religious organizations is highly competitive. We compete with a wide variety of investors and other lenders, including banks, insurance companies, pension funds and fraternal organizations which may have investment objectives similar to our own. A number of these competitors have greater financial resources, larger staffs and longer operating histories than we do. We compete principally by limiting our business &#34;niche&#34; to lending to churches and other non-profit religious organizations, offering loans with competitive and flexible terms, and emphasizing our expertise in the specialized industry segment of lending to churches and other religious organizations. Our competitive &#8220;specialty&#8221; is in offering fixed-rate, long-term loans, which few of our competitors make available to churches.

Employees 

&#160;

We have no employees but we have two executive officers: Philip J. Myers, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Scott J. Marquis, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Our daily operations and other material aspects of our business are managed by Church Loan Advisors, Inc. (the &#8220;Advisor&#8221;) on a &#8220;turn-key&#8221; basis using employees of the Advisor and/or its Affiliates. At present, certain officers and directors of the Advisor are providing services to us at no charge and which will not be reimbursed to them. These services include, among others, legal and analytic services relating to the execution of our business plan, development and preparation of reports to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act, and utilization of proprietary forms and documents utilized by the Advisor in connection with our business operations.

&#160;

Subject to the supervision of the Board of Directors, our business is managed by the Advisor, which provides us investment advisory and administrative services. Philip J. Myers, our Chief Executive Officer, President and a Director, is President of the Advisor and President of American Investors Group, Inc., the underwriter of our past public offerings. The Company utilizes two employees of the Advisor on a full-time basis and one member of its staff on a part-time or other basis. The Company does not presently expect to directly employ anyone in the foreseeable future, since all of our administrative functions and operations are contracted through the Advisor. However, legal, accounting and certain other services are provided to us by outside professionals and paid by us directly.

&#160;

Operations 

&#160;

Our operations currently are located in the 8,200 square foot offices of the Advisor&#8217;s affiliate, American Investors Group, Inc., 10237 Yellow Circle Drive, Minnetonka, Minnesota 55343. These facilities are owned by Yellow Circle Partners, L.L.P., a partnership owned by Philip J. Myers, our Chief Executive Officer, President and a Director. We are not separately charged any rent for our use of these facilities, or for our use of computers, copying services, telephones, facsimile machines, postage service, office supplies or employee services, since these costs are covered by the advisory fee paid to the Advisor. However, we do pay postage service for costs associated with the distribution of dividends and proxy materials to our shareholders.
