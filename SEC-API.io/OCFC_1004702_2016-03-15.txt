 Item 1. Business General 

OceanFirst Financial Corp. (the &#147;Company&#148;) is incorporated under Delaware law and serves as the holding company for OceanFirst Bank (the &#147;Bank&#148;). At December 31, 2015, the Company had consolidated total assets of $2.6 billion and total stockholders&#146; equity of $238.4 million. The Company is a savings and loan holding company subject to regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &#147;FRB&#148;) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). The Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (&#147;OCC&#148;) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#147;FDIC&#148;). Currently, the Company does not transact any material business other than through its subsidiary, the Bank. 

The Company has been the holding company for the Bank since it acquired the stock of the Bank upon the Bank&#146;s conversion from a Federally-chartered mutual savings bank to a Federally-chartered capital stock savings bank in 1996 (the &#147;Conversion&#148;). The Bank&#146;s principal business has been and continues to be attracting retail and business deposits in the communities surrounding its branch offices and investing those deposits primarily in loans, consisting of commercial real estate and other commercial loans which have become a key focus of the Bank and single-family, owner-occupied residential mortgage loans. The Bank also invests in other types of loans, including residential construction and consumer loans. In addition, the Bank invests in mortgage-backed securities (&#147;MBS&#148;), securities issued by the U.S. Government and agencies thereof, corporate securities and other investments permitted by applicable law and regulations. The Bank&#146;s revenues are derived principally from interest on its loans, and to a lesser extent, interest on its investment and mortgage-backed securities. The Bank also receives income from fees and service charges on loan and deposit products, wealth management services, Bankcard services and the sale of alternative investment products, e.g., mutual funds, annuities and life insurance. The Bank&#146;s primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans, investments and mortgage-backed securities, investment maturities, proceeds from the sale of loans, Federal Home Loan Bank (&#147;FHLB&#148;) advances and other borrowings.

&#160; 

Market Area and Competition 

The Bank is a community-oriented financial institution, offering a wide variety of financial services to meet the needs of the communities it serves. The Bank conducts its business through an administrative/branch office located in Toms River, New Jersey, and twenty-six additional branch offices. Nineteen of the offices are located in Ocean County, New Jersey, seven offices are in Monmouth County including a Financial Solutions Center in Red Bank also offering lending and wealth management services and one in Middlesex County. The Bank also operates a wealth management office in Manchester, New Jersey and two deposit production offices, one in Freehold, New Jersey and one that opened in the fourth quarter of 2015 in Lakewood, New Jersey. A commercial loan production office was opened in Mercer County in the first quarter of 2015 to better serve the broader central New Jersey market area. The Bank&#146;s deposit gathering and lending activities are concentrated in the markets surrounding its branch office network. 

The Bank is the largest and oldest community-based financial institution headquartered in Ocean County, New Jersey, which is located along the central New Jersey shore. The economy in the Bank&#146;s primary market area, which represents the broader central New Jersey market, is based upon a mixture of service and retail trade. Other employment is provided by a variety of wholesale trade, manufacturing, Federal, state and local government, hospitals and utilities. The area is also home to commuters working in areas in and around New York City and Philadelphia. 

The Bank&#146;s future growth opportunities will be partly influenced by the growth and stability of the local economy and the competitive environment. The Bank faces significant competition both in making loans and in attracting deposits. The state of New Jersey is an attractive market to many financial institutions. Many of the Bank&#146;s competitors are branches of significantly larger institutions headquartered out-of-market which have greater financial resources than the Bank. The Bank&#146;s competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banking companies, internet-based providers and insurance companies. Its most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations and credit unions although the Bank also faces competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, other corporate and government securities funds, internet-only providers and from other financial service institutions such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. The Bank distinguishes itself from large banking competitors through its local presence and ability to deliver personalized service. 

Community Involvement 

The Bank proudly promotes a higher quality of life in the communities it serves through employee volunteer efforts and the OceanFirst Foundation (the &#147;Foundation&#148;). Employees are continually encouraged to become leaders in their communities and use the Bank&#146;s support to help others. Through the Foundation, established in 1996, OceanFirst Bank has donated $27.2 million to enrich the lives of local citizens by supporting initiatives in health and human services, education, affordable housing, youth development and the arts. 

Acquisitions 

On July 31, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Colonial American Bank (&#147;Colonial&#148;), which added $142.4 million to assets, $121.5 million to loans, and $123.3 million to deposits. The all stock consideration was valued at $11.9 million on the acquisition date. The in-market acquisition was an attractive complement to the Red Bank Financial Solutions Center and strengthened the Bank&#146;s position in the attractive Monmouth County, New Jersey marketplace by adding offices in Middletown and Shrewsbury, New Jersey. 

On July 31, 2015, the Bank executed an agreement to purchase an existing retail branch with total deposits of $24.6 million and core deposits (all deposits except time deposits) of $20.2 million located in the Toms River market. The purchase closed and the branch was successfully integrated into the Bank on March 11 -12, 2016. 

&#160; 

On January 5, 2016, the Company announced an agreement to acquire Cape Bancorp (&#147;Cape&#148;), headquartered in Cape May Court House, New Jersey, in a transaction valued at approximately $208.1 million. Under the terms of the agreement, Cape stockholders will be entitled to receive $2.25 in cash and 0.6375 shares of OceanFirst common stock for each share of Cape common stock. The transaction is expected to close in the summer of 2016, subject to certain conditions, including the approval by stockholders of each company, receipt of all required regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. 

Cape is a New Jersey chartered savings bank originally founded in 1923. Cape operates twenty-two full-service banking offices and five loan offices. Three of the loan offices are located in New Jersey servicing Burlington, Cape May and Atlantic counties. Two of the loan offices are in Pennsylvania servicing the five county Philadelphia market, located in Radnor, Delaware County and in Philadelphia (opened in Center City in January 2015). Cape has total assets of $1.6 billion, including $1.1 billion in total loans and $1.3 billion in total deposits of as of December 31, 2015. At closing, the combined institution is expected to have approximately $4.3 billion in assets, $3.2 billion in total loans and $3.4 billion in total deposits, with 49 full service banking offices serving the central and southern New Jersey market. 

Lending Activities 

Loan Portfolio Composition . At December 31, 2015, the Bank had total loans outstanding of $2.001 billion, of which $793.9 million, or 39.7% of total loans were one-to-four family, residential mortgage loans. The remainder of the portfolio consisted of $818.4 million of commercial real estate, multi-family and land loans, or 40.9% of total loans; $50.8 million of residential construction loans, or 2.5% of total loans; $193.2 million of consumer loans, primarily home equity loans and lines of credit, or 9.7% of total loans; and, $144.8 million of commercial loans, or 7.2% of total loans. Included in total loans are $2.7 million in loans held-for-sale at December 31, 2015. At that same date, 38.2% of the Bank&#146;s total loans had adjustable interest rates. The Bank has generally sold much of its 30-year, fixed-rate, one-to-four family loans into the secondary market primarily to manage interest rate risk. 

The types of loans that the Bank may originate are subject to Federal and state law and regulations. Interest rates charged by the Bank on loans are affected by the demand for such loans and the supply of money available for lending purposes and the rates offered by competitors. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other things, economic conditions, monetary policies of the Federal government, including the FRB, and legislative tax policies. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; One-to-Four Family Mortgage Lending . The Bank offers both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage (&#147;ARM&#148;) loans secured by one-to-four family residences with maturities up to 30 years. The majority of such loans are secured by property located in the Bank&#146;s primary market area. Loan originations are typically generated by commissioned loan representatives in the exclusive employment of the Bank and their contacts within the local real estate industry, members of the local communities and the Bank&#146;s existing or past customers. On occasion the Bank purchases loans originated by other banks. 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#146;s total loans outstanding were $2.0 billion, of which $793.9 million, or 39.7%, were one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, primarily single family and owner occupied. To a lesser extent and included in this activity are residential mortgage loans secured by seasonal second homes and non-owner occupied investment properties. The average size of the Bank&#146;s one-to-four family mortgage loans was approximately $202,000 at December 31, 2015. 

The Bank currently offers a number of ARM loan programs with interest rates which adjust every three, five or ten years. The Bank&#146;s ARM loans generally provide for periodic caps of 2% or 3% and an overall cap of 6% on the increase or decrease in the interest rate at any adjustment date and over the life of the loan. The interest rate on these loans is indexed to the applicable three-, five- or ten-year U.S. Treasury constant maturity yield, with a repricing margin which ranges generally from 2.75% to 3.50% above the index. The Bank also offers three-, five-, seven- and ten-year ARM loans which operate as fixed-rate loans for the first three, five, seven or ten years and then convert to one-year ARM loans for the remainder of the term. The ARM loans are then indexed to a margin of generally 2.75% to 3.50% above the one-year U.S. Treasury constant maturity yield. 

Generally, ARM loans pose credit risks different than risks inherent in fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the payments of the borrower rise, thereby increasing the potential for delinquency and default. 

&#160; 

At the same time, the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. In order to minimize risks, borrowers of ARM loans with an initial fixed period of five years or less must qualify based on the greater of the note rate plus 2% or the fully-indexed rate. Seven- to ten-year ARMs must qualify based on the note rate. The Bank does not originate ARM loans which provide for negative amortization. The Bank previously offered interest-only ARM loans on a limited basis, in which the borrower made only interest payments for the first five, seven or ten years of the mortgage loan term and then converted to a fully-amortizing loan until maturity. The interest-only feature resulted in future increases in the borrower&#146;s loan payment when the contractually required payments increased due to the required amortization of the principal amount. These payment increases may affect the borrower&#146;s ability to repay the loan, and as such, the borrowers were qualified at the fully-amortized payment. The amount of interest-only, one-to-four family mortgage loans at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $15.5 million and $17.6 million, respectively, or 2.0% and 2.3%, respectively, of total one-to-four family mortgages. 

The Bank&#146;s fixed-rate mortgage loans are currently made for terms from 10 to 30 years. The Bank periodically sells some of the fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that it originates in order to manage interest rate risk. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, the Bank generally retained the servicing on loans sold. Currently, servicing rights are generally sold as part of the loan sale. The Bank generally holds for its portfolio shorter-term, fixed-rate loans and certain longer-term, fixed-rate loans, generally consisting of loans with balances exceeding the conforming loan limits of the government agencies (&#147;Jumbo&#148; loans) and loans to officers, directors or employees of the Bank. The Bank may retain a portion of its longer-term, fixed-rate loans after considering volume and yield and after evaluating interest rate risk and capital management considerations. The retention of fixed-rate mortgage loans may increase the level of interest rate risk exposure of the Bank, as the rates on these loans will not adjust during periods of rising interest rates and the loans can be subject to substantial increases in prepayments during periods of falling interest rates. During the past several years, the Bank has generally sold much of its 30-year, fixed-rate, one-to-four family loans into the secondary market primarily to manage interest rate risk. 

The Bank&#146;s policy is to originate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans in amounts up to 80% of the lower of the appraised value or the selling price of the property securing the loan and up to 95% of the appraised value or selling price if private mortgage insurance is obtained. Appraisals are obtained for loans secured by real estate properties. The weighted average loan-to-value ratio of the Bank&#146;s one-to-four family mortgage loans was 55.1% at December 31, 2015 based on appraisal values at the time of origination. Title insurance is typically required for first mortgage loans. Mortgage loans originated by the Bank include due-on-sale clauses which provide the Bank with the contractual right to declare the loan immediately due and payable in the event the borrower transfers ownership of the property without the Bank&#146;s consent. Due-on-sale clauses are an important means of adjusting the rates on the Bank&#146;s fixed-rate mortgage loan portfolio and the Bank has generally exercised its rights under these clauses. 

The Bank currently brokers reverse mortgage loans for a third-party originator. Prior to 2013, the Bank closed these loans in its name; however, they were all sold into the secondary market. The loans qualify under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program of the Federal Housing Administration and are insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bank recognized fee income on reverse mortgage loans of $233,000, as compared to $493,000 for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

The Bank has made, and may continue to make, residential mortgage loans that will not qualify as Qualified Mortgage Loans under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#147;CFPB&#148;) regulations effective January 10, 2014. See &#147; Risk Factors &#150; The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans, such as the Bank &#148;. 

Commercial Real Estate, Multi-Family and Land Lending . The Bank originates commercial real estate loans that are secured by properties, or properties under construction, generally used for business purposes such as office, industrial or retail facilities. A substantial majority of the Bank&#146;s commercial real estate loans are located in its primary market area. The Bank&#146;s underwriting procedures provide that commercial real estate loans may be 

&#160; 

made in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the property. The Bank currently originates commercial real estate loans with terms of up to ten years and amortization schedules up to thirty years with fixed or adjustable rates. The loans typically contain prepayment penalties over the initial term. In reaching its decision on whether to make a commercial real estate loan, the Bank considers the net operating income of the property and the borrower&#146;s expertise, credit history and profitability among other factors. The Bank has generally required that the properties securing commercial real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios of at least 130%. The Bank generally requires the personal guarantee of the principal borrowers for commercial real estate loans. 

The Bank&#146;s commercial real estate loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 was $818.4 million, or 40.9% of total loans, as compared to $650.0 million, or 37.7% of total loans, at December 31, 2014. The Bank continues to grow this market segment primarily through the addition of experienced commercial lenders. The Bank added a new lending team in late 2014 which is located in Mercer County, New Jersey. Of the total commercial real estate portfolio, 39.8% is considered owner-occupied, whereby the underlying business owner occupies a majority of the property. The largest commercial real estate loan in the Bank&#146;s portfolio at December 31, 2015 was $23.8 million, of which the Bank sold participations for $7.0 million, leaving a net balance of $16.8 million owned by the Bank. The loan is secured by a first mortgage on a multi-purpose medical office facility. The average size of the Bank&#146;s commercial real estate loans at December 31, 2015 was approximately $891,000. 

The commercial real estate portfolio includes loans for the construction of commercial properties. Typically, these loans are underwritten based upon commercial leases in place prior to funding. In many cases, commercial construction loans are extended to owners that intend to occupy the property for business operations, in which case the loan is based upon the financial capacity of the related business and the owner of the business. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had an outstanding balance in commercial construction loans of $29.2 million, as compared to $46.4 million at December 31, 2014. 

The Bank also originates multi-family mortgage loans and land loans on a limited basis. The Bank&#146;s multi-family loans and land loans at December 31, 2015 totaled $28.4 million and $8.0 million, respectively, as compared to $24.4 million and $8.6 million, respectively, at December 31, 2014. 

Residential Construction Lending . At December 31, 2015, residential construction loans totaled $50.8 million, or 2.5%, of the Bank&#146;s total loans outstanding, an increase from $47.6 million, or 2.8% of the Bank&#146;s total loans outstanding at December 31, 2014. The increase continues to be related to the additional loan demand from borrowers rebuilding after superstorm Sandy. 

The Bank originates residential construction loans primarily on a construction/permanent basis with such loans converting to an amortizing loan following the completion of the construction phase. Most of the Bank&#146;s residential construction loans are made to individuals building a residence. 

Construction lending, by its nature, entails additional risks compared to one-to-four family mortgage lending, attributable primarily to the fact that funds are advanced based upon a security interest in a project which is not yet complete. The Bank addresses these risks through its underwriting policies and procedures and its experienced staff. 

Consumer Loans . At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#146;s consumer loans totaled $193.2 million, or 9.7% of the Bank&#146;s total loan portfolio. Of the total consumer loan portfolio, home equity loans comprised $105.9 million, or 54.8%; home equity lines of credit comprised $86.6 million, or 44.8%; overdraft line of credit loans totaled $452,000 or 0.2%; and loans on savings accounts totaled $340,000, or 0.2%. 

The Bank originates home equity loans typically as fixed-rate loans with terms ranging from 5 to 20 years. The Bank also offers variable-rate home equity lines of credit. Home equity loans and lines of credit are based on the applicant&#146;s income and their ability to repay and are secured by a mortgage on the underlying real estate, 

&#160; 

typically owner-occupied, one-to-four family residences. Generally, the loan when combined with the balance of any applicable first mortgage lien, may not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property at the time of the loan commitment. The Bank charges an early termination fee should a home equity loan or line of credit be closed within two or three years of origination. A borrower is required to make monthly payments of principal and interest, at a minimum of $50, based upon a 10-, 15- or 20-year amortization period. Certain home equity lines of credit require the payment of interest-only during the first five years with fully-amortizing payments thereafter. At December 31, 2015, these loans totaled $15.7 million, as compared to $18.2 million at December 31, 2014. 

Generally, the adjustable rate of interest charged is based upon the prime rate of interest (as published in the Wall Street Journal ), although the range of interest rates charged may vary from 1.0% below prime to 1.5% over prime. The loans have an 18% lifetime cap on interest rate adjustments. 

Commercial and Industrial Lending . At December 31, 2015, commercial and industrial (&#147;C&#38;I&#148;) loans totaled $144.8 million, or 7.2% of the Bank&#146;s total loans outstanding. The Bank originates commercial and industrial loans and lines of credit (including for working capital; fixed asset purchases; and acquisition, receivable and inventory financing) primarily in the Bank&#146;s market area. In underwriting commercial and industrial loans and credit lines, the Bank reviews and analyzes financial history and capacity, collateral value, strength and character of the principals, and general payment history of the principal borrowers in coming to a credit decision. The Bank generally originates C&#38;I loans secured by the assets of the business including accounts receivable, inventory, fixtures, etc. The Bank generally requires the personal guarantee of the principal borrowers for all commercial and industrial loans. 

Commercial and industrial business lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than real estate lending. Risk of loss on a commercial and industrial business loan is dependent largely on the borrower&#146;s ability to remain financially able to repay the loan from ongoing operations. The Bank&#146;s largest commercial and industrial loan at December 31, 2015 was a loan to a publicly-traded company of manufactured housing communities of $10.0 million secured by pledges and assignments of notes receivables. The average size of the Bank&#146;s commercial and industrial loans at December 31, 2015 was approximately $336,000. 

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority . The Board establishes the loan approval policies of the Bank based on total exposure to the individual borrower. The Board has authorized the approval of loans by various officers of the Bank or a Management Credit Committee, on a scale which requires approval by personnel with progressively higher levels of responsibility as the loan amount increases. Pursuant to applicable regulations, loans to one borrower generally cannot exceed 15% of the Bank&#146;s unimpaired capital. At December 31, 2015 this limit amounted to $34.4 million. At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#146;s maximum loan exposure to a single borrower was a $22.9 million relationship to a publicly-traded company of manufactured housing communities secured by pledges and assignments of notes receivables and various real estate collateral. 

In addition to internal credit reviews, the Bank has engaged an independent firm specializing in commercial loan reviews to examine a selection of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans, and provide management with objective analysis regarding the quality of these loans throughout the year. The independent firm reviewed more than 70% of the Company&#146;s commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans during 2015. Their conclusion was that the Bank&#146;s internal credit reviews are consistent with both Bank policy and general industry practice. 

Loan Servicing . Loan servicing includes collecting and remitting loan payments, accounting for principal and interest, making inspections as required of mortgaged premises, contacting delinquent borrowers, supervising foreclosures and property dispositions in the event of unremedied defaults, making certain insurance and tax payments on behalf of the borrowers and generally administering the loans. The Bank also services mortgage loans for others. On October 31, 2014, the Bank sold most of the servicing rights on residential mortgage loans serviced for Federal agencies, recognizing a net gain of $408,000. Smaller sales in 2015 resulted in a net gain of 

&#160; 

$111,000. All of the remaining loans currently being serviced for others are loans which were originated by the Bank. At December 31, 2015, the Bank was servicing $158.2 million of loans for others. At December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, the balance of the Bank&#146;s Mortgage Servicing Rights (&#147;MSR&#148;) totaled $589,000, $701,000, and $4.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, loan servicing income totaled $268,000, $816,000, and $748,000, respectively. The Bank evaluates the MSR for impairment on a quarterly basis. No impairment was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. The valuation of MSR is determined through a discounted analysis of future cash flows, incorporating numerous assumptions which are subject to significant change in the near term. Generally, a decline in market interest rates will cause expected prepayment speeds to increase resulting in a lower valuation for mortgage servicing rights and ultimately lower future servicing fee income. 

Delinquencies and Classified Assets . The steps taken by the Bank with respect to delinquencies vary depending on the nature of the loan and period of delinquency. When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan, the Bank takes a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status. The Bank sends the borrower a written notice of non-payment after the loan is first past due. In the event payment is not then received, additional letters and phone calls generally are made. The Bank may offer to modify the terms or take other forbearance actions which afford the borrower an opportunity to satisfy the loan terms. If the loan is still not brought current and it becomes necessary for the Bank to take legal action, which typically occurs after a loan is delinquent at least 120 days or more, the Bank will commence litigation to realize on the collateral, including foreclosure proceedings against any real property that secures the loan. If a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or an acceptable workout accommodation is not agreed upon before the foreclosure sale, the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure. Foreclosure timelines in New Jersey are among the longest in the nation and have remained protracted over the past several years. The Bank offers various modification programs to assist borrowers with financial hardships. 

The Bank&#146;s internal Asset Classification Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer, reviews and classifies the Bank&#146;s assets quarterly and reports the results of its review to the Board. As part of this process, the Chief Risk Officer compiles a quarterly list of all criticized and classified loans, and a narrative report of classified commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, multi-family, land and construction loans. The Bank classifies assets in accordance with certain regulatory guidelines and definitions. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $33.3 million of assets, including all other real estate owned (&#147;OREO&#148;), classified as &#147;Substandard&#148;, no assets classified as &#147;Doubtful&#148; and no assets classified as &#147;Loss&#148;. At December 31, 2014, the Bank had $34.9 million of assets classified as &#147;Substandard&#148;, no assets classified as &#147;Doubtful&#148; and no assets classified as &#147;Loss&#148;. Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses, such as past delinquencies, are designated &#147;Special Mention&#148;. Special Mention assets totaled $23.1 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $19.0 million at December 31, 2014. 

The largest Substandard loan relationship is comprised of several credit facilities to a marina with an aggregate balance of $5.5 million. The loans are well collateralized by commercial and residential real estate, all business assets and also carry a personal guarantee. The largest Special Mention loan is a $4.3 million commercial real estate loan to a developer of a professional medical office property. 

&#160; 

Non-Accrual Loans and OREO. The following table sets forth information regarding non-accrual loans and OREO, excluding Purchase Credit Impaired (&#147;PCI&#148;) loans. The Bank has only obtained PCI loans as part of its acquisition of Colonial. PCI loans are accounted for at fair value, based upon the present value of expected future cash flows with no related allowance for loan losses. PCI loans totaled $461,000 at December 31, 2015. It is the policy of the Bank to cease accruing interest on loans 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, the amount of interest income that would have been recognized on non-accrual loans if such loans had continued to perform in accordance with their contractual terms was $848,000, $1,630,000, and $2,513,000, respectively.

(1) Total loans includes loans receivable and mortgage loans held-for-sale. 

(2) Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans and OREO. Non-performing loans consist of all loans 90 days or more past due and other loans in the process of foreclosure. 

Non-performing loans totaled $18.3 million at December 31, 2015, unchanged compared to December 31, 2014. Non-performing loans do not include $461,000 of PCI loans acquired from Colonial. The Company&#146;s other real estate owned totaled $8.8 million at December 31, 2015, a $4.2 million increase from December 31, 2014. The amount at December 31, 2015 includes $7.0 million relating to a hotel, golf and banquet facility located in New Jersey which the Company acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

Allowance for Loan Losses . The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on management&#146;s evaluation of the Company&#146;s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower&#146;s ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and current economic conditions. Additions to the allowance arise from charges to operations through the provision for loan losses or from the recovery of amounts previously charged-off. The allowance is reduced by loan charge-offs. A description of the methodology used in establishing the allowance for loan losses is set forth in the section &#147; Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Policies, Allowance for Loan Losses &#148;. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bank&#146;s allowance for loan losses was 0.84% and 0.95% respectively, of total loans. The decline in the loan coverage ratio from the prior year was primarily a result of Colonial loans acquired at fair value, with no corresponding allowance. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total non-performing loans was 91.51% at December 31, 2015, an increase from 89.13% in the prior year. The Bank had non-accrual loans of $18.3 million at December 31, 2015, unchanged from December 31, 2014. The Bank will continue to monitor its allowance for loan losses as conditions dictate. 

The following table sets forth activity in the Bank&#146;s allowance for loan losses for the periods set forth in the table.

&#160;

&#160; The decrease in charge-offs in 2015 was due to the 2014 bulk sale of non-performing residential and consumer loans which resulted in a charge-off of $5.0 million on these loans. Excluding the bulk sale, the 2014 ratio was 0.14%. 

In 2011, the Company modified its charge-off policy on problem loans secured by real estate. Historically, the Company established specific valuation reserves for estimated losses for problem real estate related loans when the loans were deemed uncollectible. The specific valuation reserves were based upon the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell. The actual loan charge-off was not recorded until the foreclosure process was complete. Under the modified policy, losses on loans secured by real estate are charged-off in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed uncollectible, generally after the loan becomes 120 days delinquent and a recent appraisal is received which reflects a collateral shortfall. The modification to the charge-off policy resulted in additional charge-offs in the fourth quarter 2011 of $5.7 million. All of these charge-offs were timely identified in previous periods in the Company&#146;s allowance for loan losses process as a specific valuation reserve and were included in the Company&#146;s loss experience as part of the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses. Accordingly, the additional charge-offs did not affect the Company&#146;s provision for loan losses or net income for 2011 or previous periods.

Throughout 2014 and 2015, the Bank has refined and enhanced its assessment of the adequacy of the allowance by reviewing the look-back periods, updating the loss emergence periods, and enhancing the analysis of qualitative factors. These refinements have increased the level of precision in the allowance and the unallocated portion has declined substantially. Additionally, the reduction in the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses in 2014 was also due to the improved risk profile of the loan portfolio and related credit metrics, and the lower level of uncertainty relating to future loan losses. As a result of the bulk sale of most non-performing residential loans in the fourth quarter of 2014, the total amount of non-performing loans decreased, non-performing loans as percent of total loans decreased, and the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total non-performing loans increased, as compared to the prior year, December 31, 2013. 

Reserve for Repurchased Loans and Loss Sharing Obligations . The reserve for repurchased loans and loss sharing obligations was established to provide for expected losses related to repurchase requests which may be received on residential mortgage loans previously sold to investors. The reserve also includes an estimate of the Bank&#146;s obligation under a loss sharing arrangement with the FHLB relating to loans sold into their Mortgage Partnership Finance (&#147;MPF&#148;) program. The Company prepares a comprehensive analysis of the adequacy of the reserve for repurchased loans and loss sharing obligations at each quarter-end. 

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company maintained a reserve for repurchased loans and loss sharing obligations of $1.0 million for both periods. Provisions for losses are charged to gain on sale of loans and credited to the reserve while actual losses are charged to the reserve. Losses were $56,000, $436,000, and $915,000, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Included in the losses on loans repurchased are cash settlements in lieu of repurchases. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no outstanding loan repurchase requests. For the year ended December 31, 2015, one new repurchase request was received and subsequently resolved at a cost of $56,000 to the Bank. 

Management believes that the Bank has established and maintained the reserve for repurchased loans and loss sharing obligations at adequate levels, however, future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary due to economic, operating or other conditions beyond the Bank&#146;s control. 

Investment Activities 

The investment policy of the Bank as established by the Board attempts to provide and maintain liquidity, generate a favorable return on investments without incurring undue interest rate and credit risk, and complement the Bank&#146;s lending activities. Specifically, the Bank&#146;s policies generally limit investments to government and Federal agency-backed securities, municipal securities and corporate debt obligations. The Bank&#146;s policies provide that all investment purchases must be evaluated internally for creditworthiness and be approved by two officers (any two of the Senior Vice President/Treasurer, the Executive Vice President/Chief Financial Officer, and the President/Chief Executive Officer) and must be ratified by the Board. The Company&#146;s investment policy mirrors that of the Bank except that it allows for the purchase of equity securities in limited amounts. 

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase. If the Bank has the intent and the ability at the time of purchase to hold securities until maturity, they may be classified as held-to-maturity. Investment and mortgage-backed securities identified as held-to-maturity are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, which are recognized as adjustments to interest income. Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time, but not necessarily to maturity are classified as available-for-sale. Securities available-for-sale include securities that management intends to use as part of its asset/liability management strategy. Such securities are carried at estimated fair value and unrealized gains and losses, net of related tax effect, are excluded from earnings, but are included as a separate component of stockholders&#146; equity. See &#147;Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements &#148;. 

Mortgage-backed Securities . Mortgage-backed securities represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or multi-family mortgages, the principal and interest payments on which, in general, are passed from the 

&#160; 

mortgage originators, through intermediaries that pool and repackage the participation interests in the form of securities, to investors such as the Bank. Such intermediaries may be private issuers, or agencies including the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Company (&#147;FHLMC&#148;), the Federal National Mortgage Association (&#147;FNMA&#148;) and the Government National Mortgage Association (&#147;GNMA&#148;) that guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities typically are issued with stated principal amounts, and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that are within a certain range and with varying maturities. The underlying pool of mortgages can be composed of either fixed-rate or ARM loans. 

The actual maturity of a mortgage-backed security varies, depending on when the mortgagors repay or prepay the underlying mortgages. Prepayments of the underlying mortgages may shorten the life of the security, thereby affecting its yield to maturity and the related fair value of the mortgage-backed security. The prepayments of the underlying mortgages depend on many factors, including the type of mortgages, the coupon rates, the age of mortgages, the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages, the general levels of market interest rates, and general economic conditions. GNMA mortgage-backed securities that are backed by assumable Federal Housing Administration (&#147;FHA&#148;) or Department of Veterans Affairs (&#147;VA&#148;) loans generally have a longer life than conventional non-assumable loans underlying FHLMC and FNMA mortgage-backed securities. During periods of falling mortgage interest rates, prepayments generally increase, as opposed to periods of increasing interest rates when prepayments generally decrease. If the interest rate of underlying mortgages significantly exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans, refinancing generally increases and accelerates the prepayment of the underlying mortgages. Prepayment experience is more difficult to estimate for adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities. Prepayment rates were faster in the beginning of 2015 due to relatively low mortgage rates. With the increase in interest rates mid-year, prepayments slowed and continued to decline through year-end. 

The Bank has investments in mortgage-backed securities and has utilized such investments to complement its lending activities. The Bank invests in a large variety of mortgage-backed securities, including ARM, balloon and fixed-rate securities and all were directly insured or guaranteed by either FHLMC, FNMA or GNMA.

&#160; Investment Securities . At December 31, 2015, the amortized cost of the Company&#146;s investment securities totaled $154.4 million, and consisted of $85.1 million of U.S. agency obligations, $13.3 million of state and municipal obligations, and $56.0 million of corporate debt securities. Each of the U.S. agency obligations are rated AA+ by Standard and Poor&#146;s and Aaa by Moody&#146;s. The state and municipal obligations are issued by government entities in the State of New Jersey with current credit ratings that are considered investment grade ranging from a high of AAA to a low of A+. The corporate debt securities include a $1.0 million issue of a local community bank purchased in late 2015 which is not rated by any of the credit rating services. Excluding this item, the remaining corporate debt securities are issued by national and regional financial institutions and consist of eleven issues with an amortized cost of $55.0 million spread between nine issuers. Credit ratings range from a high of A3 to a low of Ba1 as rated by one of the internationally-recognized credit rating services. See &#147; Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements &#148;.

Sources of Funds 

General . Deposits, repayments and prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed securities, proceeds from sales of loans, investment maturities, cash flows generated from operations and FHLB advances and other borrowings are the primary sources of the Bank&#146;s funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes. 

Deposits . The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms to retail, government and business customers. The Bank&#146;s deposits consist of money market accounts, savings accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, non-interest-bearing accounts and time deposits. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market rates, prevailing interest rates and competition. The Bank&#146;s deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas in which its branch offices are located. The Bank relies on its community-banking focus, stressing customer service and long-standing relationships with its retail and business customers to attract and retain these deposits; however, market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions could significantly affect the Bank&#146;s ability to attract and retain deposits. 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $119.6 million in time deposits in amounts of $100,000 or more maturing as follows:

&#160;

&#160; Borrowings . The Bank has obtained advances from the FHLB for cash management and interest rate risk management purposes or as an alternative to deposit funds and may do so in the future as part of its operating strategy. FHLB term advances are also used to acquire certain other assets as may be deemed appropriate for investment purposes. Advances are collateralized primarily by certain of the Bank&#146;s mortgage loans and investment and mortgage-backed securities and secondarily by the Bank&#146;s investment in capital stock of the FHLB. The maximum amount that the FHLB will advance to member institutions, including the Bank, fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had $324.4 million in outstanding advances from the FHLB. The Bank also has outstanding municipal letters of credit issued by the FHLB used to secure government deposits. At December 31, 2015, these letters of credit totaled $90.0 million. 

The Bank also borrows funds using securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Under this form of borrowing specific U.S. Government agency and/or mortgage-backed securities are pledged as collateral to secure the borrowing. These pledged securities are held by a third-party custodian. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had borrowed $75.9 million through securities sold under agreements to repurchase. 

The Bank can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia (&#147;Reserve Bank&#148;) under the primary credit program. Primary credit is available on a short-term basis, typically overnight, at a rate above the Federal Open Market Committee&#146;s Federal funds target rate. All extensions of credit by the Reserve Bank must be secured. At December 31, 2015, the Bank had no borrowings outstanding with the Reserve Bank. 

Subsidiary Activities 

At December 31, 2015, the Bank owned four subsidiaries &#150; OceanFirst Services, LLC, OceanFirst REIT Holdings, Inc., 975 Holdings, LLC and Hooper Holdings, LLC. 

&#160; 

OceanFirst Services, LLC was originally organized in 1982. In 1998, the Bank began to sell non-deposit investment products (annuities, mutual funds and insurance) under an agreement with a third-party marketing firm to Bank customers through this subsidiary, recognizing fee income from such sales. Beginning January 1, 2014, the agreement with the third-party marketing firm is now directly with the Bank. OFB Reinsurance, Ltd. was established in 2002 as a subsidiary of OceanFirst Services, LLC to reinsure a percentage of the private mortgage insurance (&#147;PMI&#148;) risks on one-to-four family residential mortgages originated by the Bank. 

OceanFirst REIT Holdings, Inc. was established in 2007 and acts as the holding company for OceanFirst Realty Corp. OceanFirst Realty Corp. was established in 1997 and invests in qualifying mortgage loans and is intended to qualify as a real estate investment trust, which may, among other things, be utilized by the Company to raise capital in the future. 

975 Holdings, LLC and Hooper Holdings, LLC were established in 2010 and 2015, respectively, as wholly-owned service corporations of the Bank for the purpose of taking legal possession of certain repossessed collateral for resale to third parties. 

Personnel 

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank had 336 full-time employees and 57 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and the Bank considers its relationship with its employees to be good. From time to time the Bank may operate subsidiaries which may include employees not directly employed in banking activities. As of December 31, 2015, subsidiaries of the Bank had 90 full-time and 30 part-time employees to manage a repossessed commercial property. 

&#160; 

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 

General 

As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is required by Federal law to file reports with, and comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB. As a Federally-chartered savings bank, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary Federal regulator, and the FDIC, as the deposit insurer. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and, with respect to deposit insurance, of the Deposit Insurance Fund managed by the FDIC. The Bank must file reports with the OCC and the FDIC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to consummating certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other insured depository institutions. The OCC conducts periodic examinations to test the Bank&#146;s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors and to ensure the safe and sound operation of the Bank. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. The description of statutory provisions and regulations applicable to savings institutions and their holding companies set forth in this Form 10-K does not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Bank and the Company, is subject to change and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations involved. 

The Dodd-Frank Act . The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affects the lending, deposit, investment, compliance and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various Federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The Federal agencies are given significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations, and consequently, many of the details and the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act are not yet known. 

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (&#147;CFPB&#148;) with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit &#147;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#148; acts and practices. The CFPB has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Savings institutions such as the Bank with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with the consumer laws by their primary bank regulators (the OCC in the case of the Bank), although the CFPB will have back-up authority over such institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the Federal preemption rules that have been applicable for national banks and Federal savings associations, and gives state attorney generals the ability to enforce Federal consumer protection laws. 

Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act includes a series of provisions covering mortgage loan origination standards affecting, among other things, originator compensation, minimum repayment standards and prepayments. The Dodd-Frank Act requires originators to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on documented information that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay a particular mortgage loan over the long term. If the originator cannot meet this standard, the burden is on the lender to demonstrate the appropriateness of its policies and the strength of its controls. The Dodd-Frank Act contains an exception from this Ability-To-Repay rule for &#147;Qualified Mortgages&#148;. A rule issued by the CFPB in January 2013, and effective January 10, 2014, sets forth specific underwriting criteria for a loan to qualify as a Qualified Mortgage. The criteria generally exclude loans that (1) are interest-only, (2) have excessive upfront points or fees, or (3) have negative amortization features, balloon payments, or terms in excess of 30 years. To be defined as an Ability-To-Repay Qualified Mortgage, the underwriting criteria also impose a maximum debt to income ratio of 43%, based upon documented and verifiable information. If a loan meets these criteria and is not a &#147;higher priced loan&#148; as defined in FRB regulations, the CFPB rule establishes a safe harbor preventing a consumer from asserting the failure of the 

&#160; 

originator to establish the consumer&#146;s Ability-To-Repay. Additionally, conforming fixed-rate loans with a debt-to-income ratio greater than 43% would also qualify as an Ability-To-Repay Qualified Mortgage based upon an automated loan approval from one of the government sponsored mortgage entities. However, a consumer may assert the lender&#146;s failure to comply with the Ability-To-Repay rule for all residential mortgage loans other than Qualified Mortgages. See &#147;Risk Factors &#150; The Dodd-Frank Act imposes new obligations on originators of residential mortgage loans, such as the Bank&#148; . 

The Dodd-Frank Act also directed the FRB to issue rules to limit debit card interchange fees (the fees that issuing banks charge merchants each time a consumer uses a debit card) collected by banks with assets of $10 billion or more. On June 29, 2011, the FRB issued a final rule which would cap an issuer&#146;s debit card interchange base fee at twenty-one cents ($0.21) per transaction and allow an additional 5 basis point charge per transaction to cover fraud losses. The FRB also issued an interim final rule that allows a fraud-prevention adjustment of one cent ($0.01) per transaction conditioned upon an issuer adopting effective fraud prevention policies and procedures. The rules were effective October 1, 2011. The Bank&#146;s average interchange fee per transaction is 41 cents ($0.41). The Dodd-Frank Act exempts from the FRB&#146;s rule banks with assets less than $10 billion, such as the Bank. Although exempt from the rule, market forces in future periods may result in reduced fees charged by all issuers, regardless of asset size, which may result in reduced revenues for the Bank. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Bank&#146;s revenues from interchange fees was $3.1 million, an increase of $113,000 from 2014. 

The Dodd-Frank Act requires publicly-traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called &#147;golden parachute&#148; payments, and allow greater access by stockholders to the company&#146;s proxy material by authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow stockholders to nominate their own candidates using a company&#146;s proxy materials. The legislation also directs the Federal banking agencies to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded. The rules prohibit incentive-based compensation that would encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation or that would expose the bank to inappropriate risks by providing compensation that could lead to a material financial loss. 

It is still uncertain how full implementation of and promulgation of rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, will affect the Bank. 

Holding Company Regulation 

The Company is a nondiversified unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of Federal law. Generally, a unitary savings and loan holding company, such as the Company, is not restricted as to the types of business activities in which it may engage, provided that the Bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender (&#147;QTL&#148;). See &#147; Federal Savings Institution Regulation&#151;QTL Test &#148;. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 provides that no company may acquire control of a savings association after May 4, 1999 unless it engages only in the financial activities permitted for financial holding companies or for multiple savings and loan holding companies as described below. Further, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act specifies that existing savings and loan holding companies may only engage in such activities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, however, grandfathered the unrestricted authority for activities with respect to unitary savings and loan holding companies existing prior to May 4, 1999, such as the Company, so long as the Bank continues to comply with the QTL test. The Company qualifies for the grandfather provision. Upon any non-supervisory acquisition by the Company of another savings institution or savings bank that meets the QTL test and is deemed to be a savings institution, the Company would become a multiple savings and loan holding company (if the acquired institution is held as a separate subsidiary) and would generally be limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act. 

A savings and loan holding company is prohibited from, directly or indirectly, acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company without prior written approval of the FRB and from acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the FDIC. In 

&#160; 

evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the FRB considers the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the deposit insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 

Holding Company Capital Requirements . Until recently, savings and loan holding companies were not subject to specific regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act, however, required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to depository institutions themselves. The Dodd-Frank Act final rule applied consolidated regulatory capital requirements to savings and loan holding companies as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with depository institutions themselves, a capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 2016 and 2019. The Dodd-Frank Act also extended the &#147;source of strength&#148; doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all bank and savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 

Dividends . The FRB has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization&#146;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory review of capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company&#146;s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company&#146;s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company&#146;s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a holding company should inform the FRB supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of the quarter, in the amount of such instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 

Acquisition of the Company . Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act (&#147;CBCA&#148;) and applicable regulations, a notice must be submitted to the FRB if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire 10% or more of the Company&#146;s outstanding voting stock, unless the FRB has found that the acquisition will not result in a change of control of the Company. Under CBCA, the FRB has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti-trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that so acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company. 

Federal Savings Institution Regulation 

Business Activities . The activities of Federal savings institutions are governed by Federal law and regulations. These laws and regulations delineate the nature and extent of the activities in which Federal savings banks may engage. In particular, many types of lending authority for Federal savings banks, e.g . , commercial, non-residential real property loans and consumer loans, are limited to a specified percentage of the institution&#146;s capital or assets. 

Capital Requirements . FDIC regulations require banks to maintain minimum levels of capital including: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. These capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 

&#160; 

As noted, the risk-based capital standards for banks require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders&#146; equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets. Unrealized gains and losses on certain &#147;available-for-sale&#148; securities are included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. The Bank has exercised the opt-out. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution&#146;s capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual banks where necessary. 

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a &#147;capital conservation buffer&#148; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in over four years beginning January 1, 2016. 

The Federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have also adopted regulations to require an assessment of an institution&#146;s exposure to declines in the economic value of a bank&#146;s capital due to changes in interest rates when assessing the bank&#146;s capital adequacy. Under such a risk assessment, examiners evaluate a bank&#146;s capital for interest rate risk on a case-by-case basis, with consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Institutions with significant interest rate risk may be required to hold additional capital. According to the Federal banking agencies, applicable considerations include: quality of the bank&#146;s interest rate risk management process; the overall financial condition of the bank; and the level of other risks at the bank for which capital is needed. 

The following table presents the Bank&#146;s capital position at December 31, 2015. The Bank exceeded all of its capital requirements at that date.

Prompt Corrective Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that the Federal bank regulatory authorities take &#147;prompt corrective action&#148; with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIC&#146;s regulations define the five categories as follows: 

An institution is classified as &#147;well capitalized&#148; if: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 5%, and it is not subject to any order or directive by the FDIC to meet a specific capital level; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 6.5%; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio to Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 8%; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 10%. 

An institution is classified as &#147;adequately capitalized&#148; if: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets is at least 4%; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 4.5%; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio to Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 6%; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 8%. 

An institution is classified as &#147;undercapitalized&#148; if: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its leverage ratio is less than 4%; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is less than 4.5%; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio to Tier 1 risk based capital is at less than 6%; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets is at least 8%. 

An institution is classified as &#147;significantly undercapitalized&#148; if: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its leverage ratio is less than 3%; or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets is less than 3.0%; or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its ratio to Tier 1 risk based capital is at less than 4%; or 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; its total risk-based capital is less than 6%. 

An institution that has a tangible capital to total assets ratio equal to or less than 2% is deemed to be &#147;critically undercapitalized.&#148; 

The FDIC is required, with some exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured bank if that bank is &#147;critically undercapitalized.&#148; The FDIC may also appoint a conservator or receiver for a state bank on the basis of the institution&#146;s financial condition or upon the occurrence of certain events, including: 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; insolvency, or when the assets of the bank are less than its liabilities to depositors and others; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; likelihood that the bank will be unable to meet the demands of its depositors or to pay its obligations in the normal course of business; and 

&#160;

&#160; &#149; &#160; insufficient capital, or the incurring or likely incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution&#146;s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment of capital without Federal assistance. 

Based on the regulatory guidelines, the Bank meets the requirements to be classified as &#147;well-capitalized&#148;. 

&#160; 

Insurance of Deposit Accounts . Deposit accounts at the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;DIF&#148;) of the FDIC. The Bank is therefore subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments which are determined using a risk-based system. 

In 2011 the FDIC approved a final rule, required by Dodd-Frank, that changed the assessment base from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity, adopted a new large-bank pricing assessment scheme, and set a target size for the DIF. The rule finalized a target size for the DIF at 2% of insured deposits. It also implemented a lower assessment rate schedule when the fund reaches 1.15% (so that the average rate over time should be about 8.5 basis points) and, in lieu of dividends, provided for a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 2% and 2.5%. The rule lowered overall assessment rates in order to generate the same approximate amount of revenue under the new larger base as was raised under the old base. The assessment rates in total are between 2.5 and 9 basis points on the broader base for banks in the lowest risk category, and 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. Deposit accounts are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor. 

The FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institution&#146;s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The management of the Bank does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 

In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation, formed in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, is authorized to impose and collect, through the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation. The bonds issued by the Financing Corporation are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. 

The total expense incurred in 2015 and 2014 for the deposit insurance assessment and the Financing Corporation payments was $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. 

Loans to One Borrower . Federal law provides that savings institutions are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks. Subject to certain exceptions, a savings institution may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily-marketable collateral. At December 31, 2015, the Bank&#146;s limit on loans to one borrower was $34.4 million and the largest loan exposure to a single borrower was $25.4 million. 

Qualified Thrift Lender Test . The Home Owners Loan Act requires savings institutions to meet a qualified thrift lender test. Under the test, a savings institution is required to either qualify as a &#147;domestic building and loan association&#148; under the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65% of its &#147;portfolio assets&#148; (total assets less: (1) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (2) intangibles, including goodwill; and (3) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain &#147;qualified thrift investments&#148; (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months out of each 12 month period. Additionally, education loans, credit card loans and small business loans may be considered &#147;qualified thrift investments&#148;. 

A savings institution that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a bank charter. As of December 31, 2015, the Bank met the qualified thrift lender test with a ratio of qualified thrift investments to portfolio assets of 71.5%. See &#147; Risk Factors. The Bank is required to maintain a significant percentage of total assets in residential mortgage loans and investments secured by residential mortgage loans, which restricts the ability to diversify the loan portfolio &#148;. 

Limitation on Capital Distributions . Applicable regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by a savings institution, including cash dividends, payments to repurchase its shares and payments to stockholders of 

&#160; 

another institution in a cash-out merger. Under the regulations, an application to and the approval of the OCC, is required prior to any capital distribution if the institution does not meet the criteria for &#147;expedited treatment&#148; of applications under the regulations ( i.e. , generally, examination ratings in the two top categories), the total capital distributions for the calendar year exceed net income for that year plus the amount of retained net income for the preceding two years, the institution would be undercapitalized following the distribution or the distribution would otherwise be contrary to a statute, regulation or agreement with the OCC. If an application is not required, the institution must still provide prior notice to the FRB of the capital distribution if, like the Bank, it is a subsidiary of a holding company. In the event the Bank&#146;s capital fell below its regulatory requirements or the FRB or OCC notified it that it was in need of more than normal supervision, the Bank&#146;s ability to make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the FRB or OCC could prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution, which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the FRB or OCC determine that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. If the FRB or OCC objects to the Bank&#146;s notice to pay a dividend to the Company, the Company may not have the liquidity necessary to pay a dividend in the future, pay a dividend at the same rate as historically paid, be able to repurchase stock, or to meet current debt obligations. In addition, capital requirements made applicable to the Company as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III may limit the Company&#146;s ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock in the future. 

Assessments . Savings institutions are required to pay assessments to fund regulatory operations. The assessments, paid on a semi-annual basis, are based upon the institution&#146;s total assets, including consolidated subsidiaries as reported in the Bank&#146;s latest quarterly regulatory report, as well as the institution&#146;s regulatory rating and complexity component. The assessments paid by the Bank for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $477,000 and $456,000, respectively. 

Transactions with Related Parties . The Bank&#146;s authority to engage in transactions with &#147;affiliates&#148; ( e.g ., any company that controls or is under common control with an institution, including the Company and its non-savings institution subsidiaries) is limited by Federal law. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings institution. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings institution&#146;s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type described in Federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. The transactions with affiliates must be on terms and under circumstances, that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated companies. In addition, savings institutions are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings institution may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional FHLBs. Each FHLB provides member institutions with a central credit facility. The Bank, as a member of the FHLB-NY is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB in an amount at least equal to 0.20% of mortgage-related assets and 4.5% of the specified value of certain transactions with the FHLB. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB-NY stock at December 31, 2015 of $20.0 million. 

Federal Reserve System 

The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily interest-bearing checking and regular checking accounts). The regulations generally provide that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $103.6 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $103.6 million. The first $14.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the FRB) are exempt from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually. The Bank complies with the foregoing requirements. For 2016, the FRB has set the 3% reserve limit at $110.2 million and the exemption at $15.2 million. 

&#160; 

FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION 

Federal Taxation 

General . The Company and the Bank report their income on a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting, and are subject to Federal income taxation in the same manner as other corporations with some exceptions, including particularly the Bank&#146;s reserve for bad debts. The following discussion of tax matters is intended only as a summary and does not purport to be a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Bank or the Company. The Bank has not been audited by the IRS in over 10 years. For its 2015 taxable year, the Bank is subject to a maximum Federal income tax rate of 35%. 

Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax . The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;) imposes a tax on alternative minimum taxable income (&#147;AMTI&#148;) at a rate of 20%. Only 90% of AMTI can be offset by net operating loss carryovers. AMTI is increased by an amount equal to 75% of the amount by which the Bank&#146;s adjusted current earnings exceeds its AMTI (determined without regard to this preference and prior to reduction for net operating losses). The Bank does not expect to be subject to the AMTI. 

Dividends Received Deduction and Other Matters . The Company may exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction is generally 70% in the case of dividends received from unaffiliated corporations with which the Company and the Bank will not file a consolidated tax return, except that if the Company or the Bank own more than 20% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend then 80% of any dividends received may be deducted. 

State and Local Taxation 

New Jersey Taxation . The Bank files New Jersey income tax returns. For New Jersey income tax purposes, the Bank is subject to a tax rate of 9% of taxable income. For this purpose, &#147;taxable income&#148; generally means Federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments (including addition of interest income on state and municipal obligations). 

The Company is required to file a New Jersey income tax return because it does business in New Jersey. For New Jersey tax purposes, regular corporations are presently taxed at a rate equal to 9% of taxable income. However, if the Company meets certain requirements, it may be eligible to elect to be taxed as a New Jersey Investment Company at a tax rate presently equal to 3.60% (40% of 9%) of taxable income. 

OceanFirst REIT Holdings, Inc. files a New Jersey income tax return which includes income earned by OceanFirst REIT Holdings, Inc. and by OceanFirst Realty Corp. OceanFirst REIT Holdings, Inc. qualifies as a New Jersey Investment Company and is taxed at a rate presently equal to 3.60% of taxable income. 

Delaware Taxation . As a Delaware holding company not earning income in Delaware, the Company is exempted from Delaware corporate income tax but is required to file an annual report with and pay an annual franchise tax to the State of Delaware.
