 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Central Pacific Financial Corp., a Hawaii corporation and bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the &#8220;BHC Act&#8221;), was organized on February 1, 1982. Our principal business is to serve as a holding company for our bank subsidiary, Central Pacific Bank, which was incorporated in its present form in the state of Hawaii on March 16, 1982 in connection with the holding company reorganization. Its predecessor entity was incorporated in the state of Hawaii on January 15, 1954. As of December 31, 2015 , we had total assets of $5.13 billion , total loans of $3.21 billion , total deposits of $4.43 billion &#32;and shareholders&#8217; equity of $494.6 million . 

&#160; 

When we refer to &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our,&#8221; we mean Central Pacific Financial Corp. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. When we refer to &#8220;Central Pacific Financial Corp.,&#8221; &#8220;CPF&#8221; or to the holding company, we are referring to the parent company on a standalone basis. We refer to Central Pacific Bank herein as &#8220;our bank&#8221; or &#8220;the bank.&#8221; 

Through our bank and its subsidiaries, we offer full-service commercial banking with 36 &#32;bank branches and 103 &#32;ATMs located throughout the state of Hawaii. Our administrative and main offices are located in Honolulu and we have 28 &#32;branches on the island of Oahu. We operate four branches on the island of Maui, two branches on the island of Hawaii and two branches on the island of Kauai. Our bank&#8217;s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) up to applicable limits. The bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. 

&#160; 

Central Pacific Bank is a full-service commercial bank offering a broad range of banking products and services, including accepting time and demand deposits and originating loans. Our loans include commercial loans, construction loans, commercial and residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. 

&#160; 

We derive our income primarily from interest and fees on loans, interest on investment securities and fees received in connection with deposit and other services. Our major operating expenses are the interest paid by our bank on deposits and borrowings, salaries and employee benefits and general operating expenses. Our bank relies substantially on a foundation of locally generated deposits. For financial reporting purposes, we have the following three reportable segments: (1) Banking Operations, (2) Treasury and (3) All Others. For further information about our reporting segments, including information about the assets and operating results of each, see &#8220;Note 24 &#8212; Segment Information&#8221; in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Our operations, like those of other financial institutions that operate in our market, are significantly influenced by economic conditions in Hawaii, including the strength of the real estate market, as well as the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal 

and state government and the regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions. See &#8220;&#8212;Supervision and Regulation&#8221; below for other information about the regulation of our holding company and bank. 

Our Services 

&#160; 

We offer a full range of banking services and products to businesses, professionals and individuals. We provide our customers with an array of loan products, including residential mortgage loans, commercial and consumer loans and lines of credit, commercial real estate loans and construction loans. 

&#160; 

Through our bank, we concentrate our lending activities in five principal areas: 

&#160; 

(1) 

Residential Mortgage Lending. &#32;Residential mortgage loans include fixed- and adjustable-rate loans primarily secured by single-family, owner-occupied residences in Hawaii and home equity lines of credit and loans. We typically require loan-to-value ratios of not more than 80%, although higher levels are permitted with accompanying mortgage insurance. First mortgage loans secured by residential properties have an average loan size of approximately $0.4 million and marketable collateral. Changes in interest rates, the economic recession and other market factors have impacted, and future changes will likely continue to impact, the marketability and value of collateral and the financial condition of our borrowers and thus the level of credit risk inherent in the portfolio. The majority of our first residential mortgage loan originations are sold in the secondary market. 

(2) 

Commercial Lending and Leasing. &#160; Loans in this category consist primarily of term loans, lines of credit and equipment leases to small and middle-market businesses and professionals in the state of Hawaii. The borrower&#8217;s business is typically regarded as the principal source of repayment, although our underwriting policies and practices generally require additional sources of collateral, including real estate and other business assets, as well as personal guarantees where possible to mitigate risk and help to reduce credit losses. 

(3) 

Commercial Mortgage Lending. &#160; Loans in this category consist of loans secured by commercial real estate, including but not limited to, structures and facilities to support activities designated as multi-family residential properties, industrial, warehouse, general office, retail, health care and religious dwellings. Our underwriting policies and practices generally requires net cash flow from the property to cover the debt service while maintaining an appropriate amount of reserves and permits consideration of liquidation of the collateral as a secondary source of repayment. 

(4) 

Construction Lending. &#160; Construction lending encompasses the financing of residential and commercial construction projects. 

(5) 

Consumer Lending. &#160; Loans in this category are generally either unsecured or secured by personal assets, such as automobiles, and the average loan size is generally small. 

&#160; 

Beyond the lending function described above, we also offer a full range of deposit products and services including checking, savings and time deposits, cash management and electronic banking services, trust services and retail brokerage services. 

&#160; 

Our Market Area and Competition 

&#160; 

Based on deposit market share among FDIC-insured financial institutions in Hawaii, Central Pacific Bank was the fourth-largest depository institution in the state at December 31, 2015 . 

&#160; 

The banking and financial services industry in the state of Hawaii generally, and particularly in our target market areas, is highly competitive. We compete for loans, deposits and customers with other commercial banks, savings banks, securities and brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, credit unions and other nonbank financial service providers, including mortgage providers and brokers, operating via the internet and other technology platforms. Some of these competitors are much larger by total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets and have achieved better results than we have during the last economic downturn. 

In order to compete with the other financial services providers in the state of Hawaii, we principally rely upon local promotional activities, personal relationships between customers and our officers, directors and employees, and specialized services tailored to meet the needs of our customers and the communities we serve. We remain competitive by offering flexibility and superior service levels, coupled with competitive interest rates and pricing. 

&#160; 

For further discussion of factors affecting our operations see, &#8220;Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Business Concentrations 

&#160; 

No individual or single group of related accounts is considered material in relation to the assets or deposits of our bank, or in relation to the overall business of the Company. However, approximately 71% &#32;of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 &#32;consisted of real estate-related loans, including construction loans, residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans. See &#8220;Part II, Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8212;Financial Condition&#8212;Loan Portfolio.&#8221; 

Our business activities are focused primarily in Hawaii. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition are impacted by the general economic trends in Hawaii, particularly in the commercial and residential real estate markets. During periods of economic strength, the real estate market and the real estate industry typically perform well; during periods of economic weakness, they typically are adversely affected. 

&#160; 

Our Subsidiaries 

&#160; 

Central Pacific Bank is the wholly-owned principal subsidiary of Central Pacific Financial Corp. Other wholly-owned subsidiaries include: CPB Capital Trust II; CPB Statutory Trust III; CPB Capital Trust IV; and CPB Statutory Trust V. 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015 , Central Pacific Bank does not have any wholly-owned subsidiaries. Central Pacific Bank owns 50% of Pacific Access Mortgage, LLC, Gentry HomeLoans, LLC, Haseko HomeLoans, LLC, Island Pacific HomeLoans, LLC, and One Hawaii HomeLoans, LLC. 

&#160; 

Supervision and Regulation 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

The Company and the bank are subject to significant regulation and restrictions by federal and state laws and regulatory agencies for the protection of depositors and the FDIC deposit insurance fund, borrowers, and the stability of the U.S. banking system. The following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations. This discussion is also qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion. We cannot predict whether or when new legislative initiatives may be proposed or enacted or new regulations or guidance may be promulgated nor the effect new laws, regulations and supervisory policies and practices may have on community banks generally or on our financial condition and results of operations. Such developments could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Agencies 

&#160; 

Central Pacific Financial Corp. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. As a bank holding company for Central Pacific Bank, Central Pacific Financial Corp. is regulated under the BHC Act and is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the FRB. It is also subject to Hawaii&#8217;s Code of Financial Institutions and is subject to inspection, examination and supervision by the Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions ("DFI".) 

&#160; 

The Company is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;), as administered by the SEC. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (&#8220;NYSE&#8221;) under the trading symbol &#8220;CPF,&#8221; and we are subject to the rules of the NYSE for companies listed there. In addition to the powers of the bank regulatory agencies we are subject to, the SEC and the NYSE have the ability to take enforcement actions against us. 

&#160; 

The Company is also subject to the accounting oversight and corporate governance requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including, among other things, required executive certification of financial presentations, requirements for board audit committees and their members, and disclosure of controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. 

Central Pacific Bank, as a Hawaii state-chartered bank, is subject to primary supervision, periodic examination and regulation by the DFI and FDIC and is also subject to certain regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), and FRB. In periodic examinations, the DFI, FDIC, and FRB assesses our 

financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, market sensitivity and other aspects of our operations. These bodies also determine whether our management is effectively managing the bank and the holding company and whether we are in compliance with all applicable laws or regulations. 

&#160; 

Legislative and Regulatory Developments 

&#160; 

The federal banking agencies continue to implement the remaining requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as promulgating other regulations and guidelines intended to assure the financial strength and safety and soundness of banks and the stability of the U.S. banking system. Following on the implementation in 2014 and effectiveness in 2015 of new capital rules ("New Capital Rules") and the so called Volcker Rule restrictions on certain proprietary trading and investment activities, developments in 2015 included: 

(i) the extension of the Volcker Rule conformance period until July 21, 2016 and a possible additional extension until 2017 for banking institutions to conform existing investments and relationships, with certain exceptions, with &#8220;covered funds&#8221;, including hedge funds, private equity funds and certain other private funds. The Company and the bank held no investment positions at December 31, 2015 which were subject to the final rule. - See &#8220;Volcker Rule&#8221;. 

(ii) the shift in the stress testing cycle and reporting dates required by the banking agencies for institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion to $50 billion to assess the potential impact of different scenarios on earnings, losses, liquidity and capital. Although the bank conducts stress testing, we are not subject to these requirements. 

(iii) the implementation of an additional &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; of 0.625% in 2016 for minimum risk-weighted asset ratios under the New Capital Rules. - See &#8220;Capital Adequacy&#8221; and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources. 

(iv) the effectiveness in October, 2015 of the final TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure ("TRID") rules issued by the CFPB as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, which require new mortgage disclosures and training of staff for most mortgage loan applications. The bank has fully implemented the TRID requirements. - See CFPB. 

(v) the release by the Interagency Federal Financial Institutions Examinations Council ("FFIEC") of a cybersecurity assessment tool for voluntary use by banks which provides guidelines to measure a bank&#8217;s individual risk profile&#8221; and &#8220;Cybersecurity maturity&#8221;. 

(vi) the adoption of the Fixing America&#8217;s Surface Transportation Act (the &#8220;FAST Act&#8221;), highway legislation which contains financial services provisions, including (a) expanding the extended 18 months examination cycle for banks with up to $1 billion in assets; (b) deleting the annual privacy notice for banks which have not changed their policy or practices of sharing of information with third parties and (c) limiting the percentage payment of dividends on reserve bank stock held by banks with more than $10 billion in assets. As a nonmember state-bank, the bank holds no reserve bank stock. 

In the exercise of their supervisory and examination authority, the regulatory agencies have emphasized corporate governance, capital planning and stress testing, enterprise risk management and other board responsibilities; anti-money laundering compliance; information technology adequacy; cybersecurity preparedness; vendor management; and fair lending and other consumer compliance obligations. 

&#160; 

Capital Adequacy Requirements 

&#160; 

Bank holding companies and banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. The New Capital Rules became fully effective on January 1, 2015, but many elements are being phased in over multiple future years. The risk-based capital guidelines for bank holding companies and banks require capital ratios that vary based on the perceived degree of risk associated with a banking organization&#8217;s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets, such as loans, and those recorded as off-balance sheet items, such as commitments, letters of credit and recourse arrangements. The risk-based capital ratio is determined by classifying assets and certain off-balance sheet financial instruments into weighted categories, with higher levels of capital being required for those categories perceived as representing greater risks and dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk-adjusted assets and off-balance sheet items. Bank holding companies and banks engaged in significant trading activity may also be subject to the market risk capital guidelines and be required to incorporate additional market and interest rate risk components into their risk-based capital standards. To the extent that the new rules are not fully phased in, the prior capital rules continue to apply. 

The New Capital Rules revised the previous risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations to meet requirements of the Dodd&#8212;Frank Act and to implement the Basel III international agreements reached by the Basel Committee. Although many of the rules contained in these final regulations are applicable only to large, internationally active banks, some of them apply on a phased-in basis to all banking organizations, including the Company and the bank. Management believes that, as of December 31, 2015, the Company and the bank would meet all applicable capital requirements under the New Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently in effect. 

Under the risk-based capital guidelines in place prior to the effectiveness of the new capital Rules, there were three fundamental capital ratios: a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 leverage ratio. To be deemed &#8220;well capitalized,&#8221; a bank must have a total risk-based capital ratio, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least ten percent, six percent and five percent, respectively. 

&#160; 

The following are among the new capital rules that were phased-in beginning January 1, 2015: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

an increase in the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio from 4.00% to 6.00% of risk-weighted assets; 

&#8226; 

a new category and a required 4.50% of risk-weighted assets ratio is established for common equity Tier 1 ("CET1&#8221;) as a subset of Tier 1 capital limited to common equity; 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

a minimum non-risk-based leverage ratio is set at 4.00%; 

&#8226; 

changes in the permitted composition of Tier 1 capital to exclude trust preferred securities subject to certain grandfathering exceptions for organizations like the Company which were under $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009, mortgage servicing rights and certain deferred tax assets and include unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities unless the organization opts out of including such unrealized gains and losses, which the Company elected to do in 2015; 

&#8226; 

the risk-weights of certain assets for purposes of calculating the risk-based capital ratios are changed for high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans, certain past due non-residential mortgage loans and certain mortgage-backed and other securities exposures; and 

&#8226; 

an additional &#8220;countercyclical capital buffer&#8221; is required for larger and more complex institutions. 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk weighted assets above the regulatory minimum capital ratios established under the new final capital rule which will be phased in until 2019 beginning at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016 and must be met to avoid limitations on the ability of the bank to pay dividends, repurchase shares or pay discretionary bonuses. 

Including the capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, the new final capital rule would result in the following minimum ratios to be considered well capitalized: (i) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, (ii) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. At December 31, 2015, the respective capital ratios of the Company and the bank exceeded the minimum percentage requirements to be deemed &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; for regulatory purposes. - See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources.&#8221; 

While the New Capital Rules set higher regulatory capital standards for the Company and the bank, bank regulators may also continue their past policies of expecting banks to maintain additional capital beyond the new minimum requirements. The final Liquidity Coverage Ratio rule issued in October 2014 by the federal banking agencies, which requires the largest banking organizations with more than $250 billion in assets to maintain sufficient high-quality liquid assets does not apply to community banks with less than $10 billion in assets. However, the implementation of the New Capital Rules or more stringent requirements to maintain higher levels of capital or to maintain higher levels of liquid assets could adversely impact the Company&#8217;s net income and return on equity, restrict the ability to pay dividends or executive bonuses and require the raising of additional capital. 

Prompt Corrective Action Provisions 

&#160; 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards, including requiring the prompt submission of an acceptable capital restoration plan. Depending on the bank&#8217;s capital ratios, the agencies&#8217; regulations define five categories in which an insured depository institution will be placed: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, 

undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. At each successive lower capital category, an insured bank is subject to more restrictions, including restrictions on the bank&#8217;s activities, operational practices or the ability to pay dividends or executive bonuses. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. 

The prompt corrective action standards were also changed as the New Capital Rules ratios became effective. Under the new standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, the bank will be required to meet the new common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5%, an increased Tier 1 ratio of 8% (increased from 6%), a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged) and a leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged). 

The federal banking agencies also may require banks and bank holding companies subject to enforcement actions to maintain capital ratios in excess of the minimum ratios otherwise required to be deemed well capitalized, in which case institutions may no longer be deemed to be well capitalized and may therefore be subject to certain restrictions such as taking brokered deposits. 

Volcker Rule 

&#160; 

In December 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies adopted final rules that implement a part of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly referred to as the &#8220;Volcker Rule.&#8221; Under these rules and subject to certain exceptions, banking entities are restricted from engaging in activities that are considered proprietary trading and from sponsoring or investing in certain entities, including hedge or private equity funds that are considered &#8220;covered funds.&#8221; These rules became effective on April 1, 2014, although certain provisions are subject to delayed effectiveness under rules promulgated by the FRB. The Company and the bank held no investment positions at December 31, 2015 &#32;which were subject to the final rule. Therefore, while these new rules may require us to conduct certain internal analysis and reporting, they did not require any material changes in our operations or business. 

&#160; 

Bank Holding Company Regulation 

&#160; 

As contained in both federal and state banking laws and regulations, a wide range of requirements and restrictions apply to bank holding companies and their subsidiaries which: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

require regular periodic reports and such additional reports of information as the Federal Reserve may require; 

&#8226; 

require bank holding companies to meet or exceed minimum capital requirements - See &#8220;Capital Adequacy&#8221; above and &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources.); 

&#8226; 

require that bank holding companies serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to subsidiary banks and commit resources as necessary to support each subsidiary bank. The source-of-strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies where a bank holding company&#8217;s subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels. In such a situation, the subsidiary bank will be required by the bank&#8217;s federal regulator to take &#8220;prompt corrective action&#8221; (see &#8220; Prompt Corrective Action Provisions &#8221;); 

&#8226; 

limit dividends payable to shareholders and restrict the ability of bank holding companies to obtain dividends or other distributions from their subsidiary banks; 

&#8226; 

require a bank holding company to terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest certain subsidiaries, affiliates or investments if the Federal Reserve believes the activity or the control of the subsidiary or affiliate constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary; 

&#8226; 

require the prior approval for changes in senior executive officers or directors and prohibit golden parachute payments, including change in control agreements, or new employment agreements with such payment terms, which are contingent upon termination when a bank holding company is deemed to be in troubled condition; 

&#8226; 

regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt, including the authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt and require prior approval to purchase or redeem securities in certain situations; 

&#8226; 

require prior approval for the acquisition of 5% or more of the voting stock of a bank or bank holding company by bank holding companies or other acquisitions and mergers with other banks or bank holding companies and consider certain competitive, management, financial, and anti-money laundering compliance impact on the U.S.; and 

&#8226; 

require prior notice and/or prior approval of the acquisition of control of a bank or a bank holding company by a shareholder or individuals acting in concert with ownership or control of 10% of the voting stock being a presumption of control. 

&#160; 

Other Restrictions on the Company&#8217;s Activities 

&#160; 

Subject to prior notice or Federal Reserve approval, bank holding companies may generally engage in, or acquire shares of companies engaged in, activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Bank holding companies that elect and retain &#8220;financial holding company&#8221; status pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (&#8220;GLBA&#8221;) may engage in these nonbanking activities and broader securities, insurance, merchant banking and other activities that are determined to be &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; or are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature without prior Federal Reserve approval. Pursuant to the GLBA and the Dodd-Frank Act, in order to elect and retain financial holding company status, a bank holding company and all depository institution subsidiaries of that bank holding company must be well capitalized and well managed, and, except in limited circumstances, depository subsidiaries must be in satisfactory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (&#8220;CRA&#8221;), which requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate. Failure to sustain compliance with these requirements or correct any non-compliance within a fixed time period could lead to the required divestiture of subsidiary banks or the termination of all activities that do not conform to those permissible for a bank holding company. The Company has not elected financial holding company status and neither Company nor the bank has engaged in any activities determined by the Federal Reserve to be financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. 

&#160; 

Dividends 

&#160; 

It is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of income available over the past year, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization&#8217;s expected future needs and financial condition. It is also the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy that bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that undermine their ability to be a source of strength to their banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve has also discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. 

The bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company. CPF is dependent on the performance of the bank for funds which may be received as dividends from the bank for use in the operation of CPF and the ability of CPF to pay dividends to shareholders. Subject to regulatory and statutory restrictions, future cash dividends by the bank will depend upon management&#8217;s assessment of future capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 

Regulation of the Bank 

&#160; 

As a Hawaii state-chartered bank whose deposits are insured by the FDIC, the bank is subject to regulation, supervision, and regular examination by the DFI and by the FDIC as a state nonmember bank, as the bank&#8217;s primary Federal regulator. Specific federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate, among other things, the scope of their business, their investments, their reserves against deposits, the timing of the availability of deposited funds, their activities relating to dividends, investments, loans, the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans, servicing and foreclosing on loans, transactions with affiliates, officers, directors and other insiders, borrowings, capital requirements, certain check-clearing activities, branching, and mergers and acquisitions. 

&#160; 

FDIC and DFI Enforcement Authority 

&#160; 

The federal and Hawaii regulatory structure gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. The regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before an institution&#8217;s capital becomes impaired. The guidelines establish operational and managerial standards generally relating to: (1) internal controls, information systems, and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest-rate exposure; (5) asset growth and asset quality; and (6) compensation, fees, and benefits. Further, the regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the 

maintenance of adequate capital and reserves. If, as a result of an examination, the DFI or the FDIC should determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity, market sensitivity, or other aspects of the bank&#8217;s operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation, the DFI and the FDIC , &#32;and separately the FDIC as insurer of the bank&#8217;s deposits, have residual authority to: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice; 

&#8226; 

direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of higher specific minimum capital ratios, which may preclude the bank from being deemed well capitalized and restrict its ability to accept certain brokered deposits; 

&#8226; 

restrict the bank&#8217;s growth geographically, by products and services, or by mergers and acquisitions, including bidding in FDIC receiverships for failed banks; 

&#8226; 

enter into or issue informal or formal enforcement actions, including required Board resolutions, memoranda of understanding, written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders or prompt corrective action orders to take corrective action and cease unsafe and unsound practices; 

&#8226; 

require prior approval of senior executive officer or director changes; remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties; and 

&#8226; 

terminate FDIC insurance, revoke the charter and/or take possession of and close and liquidate the bank or appoint the FDIC as receiver, which for a Hawaii state-chartered bank would result in a revocation of its charter. 

CPF and the bank are not subject to any regulatory agreements with our regulators. Nevertheless, we could in the future become subject to other agreements with our regulators or enforcement action which restrict our activities or may also impose increased capital ratios or other requirements on our business. 

&#160; 

Deposit Insurance 

&#160; 

The FDIC is an independent federal agency that insures deposits through the Deposit Insurance Fund (the &#8220;DIF&#8221;) up to prescribed statutory limits of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries. The Dodd-Frank Act revised the FDIC's DIF management authority by setting requirements for the Designated Reserve Ratio (the "DRR", calculated as the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits) and redefining the assessment base which is used to calculate banks' quarterly assessments. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution is based on its asset size and its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance and the FDIC has proposed a rule to impose an additional surcharge on the quarterly assessments of depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures or if the FDIC otherwise determines, we may be required to pay higher FDIC premiums. Any future increases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material and adverse effect on our earnings and could have a material adverse effect on the value of, or market for, our common stock.

Operations and Consumer Compliance Laws 

&#160; 

The bank must comply with numerous federal and state anti-money laundering and consumer protection and privacy statutes and implementing regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001, GLBA, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the CRA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act, and various federal and state privacy protection laws, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the CAN-SPAM Act. Noncompliance with these laws could subject the bank to lawsuits and could also result in administrative penalties, including, fines and reimbursements. CPF and the bank are also subject to federal and state laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices, untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition. 

&#160; 

These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure and reporting requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, servicing, collecting, and foreclosure of loans, and providing other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the bank to various penalties, including but not limited to enforcement actions, injunctions, fines or criminal penalties, punitive damages to consumers, and the loss of certain contractual rights. 

&#160; 

The bank received an &#8220;Outstanding&#8221; rating in the FDIC&#8217;s 2014 Community Reinvestment Act performance evaluation that measures how financial institutions support their communities in the areas of lending, investment and service. 

&#160; 

CFPB 

&#160; 

The Dodd-Frank Act provided for the creation of the CFPB as an independent Federal agency with broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans, credit cards, and other consumer loans. The CFPB&#8217;s functions include investigating consumer complaints, conducting market research, rulemaking, supervising and examining bank consumer transactions, and enforcing rules related to consumer financial products and services. CFPB regulations and guidance apply to all financial institutions, including the bank. Financial institutions with $10 billion or more in assets and are subject to examination by the CFPB. Financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, including the bank, will continue to be examined for compliance by their primary federal banking agency. If we were to grow beyond $10 billion in assets, we would be subject to enhanced CFPB examination as well as be required to perform more comprehensive stress-testing on our business and operations. 

In 2013, the CFPB adopted revisions to Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (&#8220;TILA&#8221;), and Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (&#8220;RESPA&#8221;), pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act (TRID Rule). The TRID Rule applies to most closed-end consumer mortgage loans. The TRID Rule does not apply to home equity lines of credit, reverse mortgages, or mortgages secured by a mobile home or dwelling that is not attached to real property. Effective October 3, 2015, the TRID Rule combined certain disclosures that consumers previously received in connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan under TILA and RESPA. The bank has fully implemented the TRID requirements.

Employees 

&#160; 

At December 31, 2015 , we employed 876 &#32;persons, 789 &#32;on a full-time basis and 87 &#32;on a part-time basis. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.

Protection of Net Operating Losses 

&#160; 

We have generated considerable tax benefits, including net operating loss carry-forwards and federal and state tax credits. Our use of the tax benefits would have been limited if we had experienced an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In general, an &#8220;ownership change&#8221; would have occurred if there was a cumulative increase in the Company&#8217;s ownership by &#8220;5-percent shareholders&#8221; (as defined under U.S. income tax laws) that exceeded 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. 

&#160; 

In order to protect these benefits, on November 23, 2010, our board declared a dividend of preferred share purchase rights (&#8220;Rights&#8221;) in respect of our common stock which were issued pursuant to a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, dated as of November 23, 2010 (the &#8220;Tax Benefits Preservation Plan&#8221;), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as rights agent. Each Right represented the right to purchase, upon the terms and subject to the conditions in the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan, 1/10,000th of a share of our Junior Participating Preferred Stock, Series C, no par value, for $6.00, subject to adjustment. The Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that the Company will experience an ownership change by discouraging any person from becoming a beneficial owner of 4.99% or more of our common stock (a &#8220;Threshold Holder&#8221;). Adoption of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan was required by our agreements with the two lead investors in our 2011 capital raise. On January 29, 2014, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan to extend it for up to an additional two years (until February 18, 2016). Our Board of Directors determined in January 2016 that it was no longer necessary to continue the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan because we have utilized a significant portion of our tax benefits and we expect to be able to utilize the remaining benefits even if an ownership change occurs. As a result, our Tax Benefits Preservation Plan expired in accordance with its terms on February 18, 2016. 

&#160; 

To further protect our tax benefits, on January 26, 2011, our board approved a proposed amendment to our restated articles of incorporation to restrict transfers of our stock if the effect of an attempted transfer would cause the transferee to become a Threshold Holder or to cause the beneficial ownership of a Threshold Holder to increase (the &#8220;Protective Charter Amendment&#8221;). At our annual meeting of shareholders on April 27, 2011, our shareholders approved the Protective Charter Amendment. In 2014, our Board of Directors and shareholders approved an amendment to the Protective Charter Amendment to extend it for up to an additional two years (until May 2, 2016). Our Board of Directors has determined not to seek an amendment to further extend the Protective Charter Amendment because we have utilized a significant portion of our tax benefits and we expect to be able to utilize the remaining benefits even if an ownership change occurs. Accordingly, the Board intends to allow the Protective Charter Amendment to also naturally expire in accordance with its terms on May 2, 2016.
