Overview 

iStar Inc. (the "Company") finances, invests in and develops real estate and real estate related projects as part of its fully-integrated investment platform. The Company has invested more than $35 billion &#32;over the past two decades and is structured as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") with a diversified portfolio focused on larger assets located in major metropolitan markets. The Company's primary business segments are real estate finance, net lease, operating properties and land and development. 

The real estate finance portfolio is comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that may be either fixed-rate or variable-rate and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of borrowers. The Company's portfolio also includes preferred equity investments and senior and subordinated loans to business entities, particularly entities engaged in real estate or real estate related businesses, and may be either secured or unsecured. The Company's loan portfolio includes whole loans and loan participations. 

The net lease portfolio is primarily comprised of properties owned by the Company and leased to single creditworthy tenants where the properties are subject to long-term leases. Most of the leases provide for expenses at the facilities to be paid by the tenants on a triple net lease basis. The properties in this portfolio are diversified by property type and geographic location. In addition to net lease properties owned by the Company, the Company partnered with a sovereign wealth fund in 2014 to form a venture to acquire and develop net lease assets (the "Net Lease Venture"). 

The land and development portfolio is primarily comprised of land entitled for master planned communities as well as waterfront and urban infill land parcels located throughout the U.S. Master planned communities represent large-scale residential projects that the Company will entitle, plan and/or develop and may sell through retail channels to home builders or in bulk. Waterfront parcels are generally entitled for residential projects and urban infill parcels are generally entitled for mixed-use projects. The Company may develop these properties itself, or in partnership with commercial real estate developers, or may sell the properties. 

The operating properties portfolio is comprised of commercial and residential properties which represent a diverse pool of assets across a broad range of geographies and property types. The Company generally seeks to reposition or redevelop these assets with the objective of maximizing their value through the infusion of capital and/or intensive asset management efforts. The commercial properties within this portfolio include office, retail, hotel and other property types. The residential properties within this portfolio are generally luxury condominium projects located in major U.S. cities where the Company's strategy is to sell individual condominium units through retail distribution channels. 

The Company's primary sources of revenues are operating lease income, which is the rent and reimbursements that tenants pay to lease the Company's properties, and interest income, which is the interest that borrowers pay on loans. The Company primarily generates income through a &#8220;spread&#8221; or &#8220;margin,&#8221; which is the difference between the revenues generated from leases 

and loans and interest expense and the cost of real estate operations. In addition, the Company generates income from commercial operating property revenue, sales of real estate and land development assets and equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures. 

Company History and Recent Developments 

The Company began its business in 1993 through the management of private investment funds and became publicly traded in 1998. Since that time, the Company has grown through the origination of new lending and leasing transactions, as well as through corporate acquisitions. During the economic downturn, the composition of the Company's portfolio changed as loans were repaid and the Company acquired title to assets of defaulting borrowers. The composition of the Company's real estate portfolio expanded to include operating properties and land and development assets. The Company has been originating new lending and net lease investments, repositioning or redeveloping its operating properties and progressing on the entitlement, development and sales of its land and development assets. We intend to continue these efforts, with the objective of having these assets contribute positively to earnings in the future. The Company's business segments are discussed further in "Industry Segments." 

Financing Strategy 

The Company has continued to strengthen its balance sheet through its financing activities. The Company has used proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes in the capital markets over the past two years to repay secured and unsecured debt, which extended the Company's debt maturity profile, lowered its cost of capital and unencumbered a significant portion of the Company's assets allowing it to become primarily an unsecured borrower. In March 2015, the Company entered into a secured revolving credit facility with a maximum capacity of $250.0 million. Going forward, the Company will seek to raise capital through a variety of means, which may include unsecured and secured debt financing, debt refinancings, asset sales, issuances of equity, joint ventures and other third party capital arrangements. A more detailed discussion of the Company's current liquidity and capital resources is provided in Item 7&#8212;"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 

Investment Strategy 

During 2015 , the Company committed to new investments totaling $756.9 million . The Company funded $662.5 million &#32;associated with new investments, prior financing commitments as well as ongoing development. The fundings included $479.6 million &#32;in lending and other investments, $95.3 million &#32;to develop its land and development assets and $87.6 million &#32;of capital to reposition or redevelop its operating properties and invest in net lease assets. 

In originating new investments, the Company's strategy is to focus on the following: 

&#8226; 

Targeting the origination of custom-tailored mortgage, corporate and lease financings where customers require flexible financial solutions and "one-call" responsiveness; 

&#8226; 

Avoiding commodity businesses where there is significant direct competition from other providers of capital; 

&#8226; 

Developing direct relationships with borrowers and corporate customers in addition to sourcing transactions through intermediaries; 

&#8226; 

Adding value beyond simply providing capital by offering borrowers and corporate customers specific lending expertise, flexibility, certainty of closing and continuing relationships beyond the closing of a particular financing transaction; 

&#8226; 

Taking advantage of market anomalies in the real estate financing markets when, in the Company's view, credit is mispriced by other providers of capital; and 

&#8226; 

Evaluating relative risk adjusted returns across multiple investment markets. 

Underwriting Process 

The Company reviews investment opportunities with its investment professionals, as well as representatives from its legal, credit, risk management and capital markets areas. The Company has developed a process for screening potential investments called the Six Point Methodology sm . Through this process, the Company evaluates an investment opportunity prior to beginning its formal due diligence process by: (1) evaluating the source of the opportunity; (2) evaluating the quality of the collateral, corporate credit or lessee, as well as the market and industry dynamics; (3) evaluating the borrower equity, corporate sponsorship and/or guarantors; (4) determining the optimal legal and financial structure for the transaction given its risk profile; (5) performing an alternative investment test; and (6) evaluating the liquidity of the investment. Participation is encouraged from professionals in all disciplines throughout the entire origination process, from the initial consideration of the opportunity, through the Six Point Methodology, sm &#32;the preparation and distribution of an approval memorandum for the Company's internal investment committee and/or Board of Directors and into the documentation and closing process. 

Any commitment to make an investment of $25 million or less in any transaction or series of related transactions requires the approval of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer. Any commitment in excess of $25 million but less than 

or equal to $60 million requires the further approval of the Company's internal investment committee, consisting of senior management representatives from all of the Company's key disciplines. Any commitment in excess of $60 million, and any strategic investment such as a corporate merger, acquisition or material transaction involving the Company's entry into a new line of business, requires the approval of the Board of Directors. 

Hedging Strategy 

The Company finances its business with a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt and its asset base consists of fixed-rate and variable-rate investments. Its variable-rate assets and liabilities create a natural hedge against changes in variable interest rates. This means that as interest rates increase, the Company earns more on its variable-rate lending assets and pays more on its variable-rate debt obligations and, conversely, as interest rates decrease, the Company earns less on its variable-rate lending assets and pays less on its variable-rate debt obligations. When the Company's variable-rate debt obligations differ significantly from its variable-rate lending assets, the Company may utilize derivative instruments to limit the impact of changing interest rates on its net income. The Company also uses derivative instruments to limit its exposure to changes in currency rates in respect of certain investments denominated in foreign currencies. The derivative instruments the Company uses are typically in the form of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and foreign exchange contracts.

Net Lease 

The net lease portfolio is primarily comprised of properties owned by the Company and leased to single creditworthy tenants where the properties are subject to long-term leases. Leases typically provide for expenses at the facility to be paid by the tenant on a triple net lease basis. The Company generally intends to hold its net lease assets for long-term investment. However, the Company may dispose of assets if it deems the disposition to be in the Company's best interests. 

During 2014, the Company partnered with a sovereign wealth fund to form a venture in which the partners plan to contribute up to an aggregate $500 million of equity to acquire and develop up to $1.25 billion of net lease assets. The Company owns a 51.9% noncontrolling interest in the Net Lease Venture and does not consolidate the Net Lease Venture due to shared control of the entity with its partner. 

Under a typical net lease agreement, the tenant agrees to pay a base monthly operating lease payment and most or all of the facility operating expenses (including taxes, utilities, maintenance and insurance). The Company generally targets corporate customers with facilities that are critical to their ongoing businesses. 

The Company's net lease portfolio included the following ($ in thousands):

For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized revenue and cost of sales of $100.2 million &#32;and $67.4 million , respectively, from its land and development portfolio.

In December 2015, the Company sold land parcels for land development revenue of $62.8 million resulting in a gross margin of $24.2 million.

In addition, the Company sold 28 fully entitled and improved townhome lots to a national homebuilder in 2015 for the development of the South Grand project. Collectively, these projects represent the first new residential developments on the Asbury Park waterfront since 2007. 

During 2015, the Company announced the next three projects to be developed in the waterfront. The first of these projects is The Asbury, a 110-key boutique hotel, currently under construction and scheduled to open in the summer of 2016. The Asbury will be the first new hotel in Asbury Park in more than 50 years. The Company's newest residential community is Monroe, a 34-unit condominium project which is expected to be completed during 2016. Construction has also started on 1101 Ocean, a landmark 16-story mixed-use tower, which includes a 56-key luxury boutique hotel, 128 residential condominiums and nearly 22,000 square feet of street-front retail space. 

Asbury Park Waterfront sold 28 lots for $3.4 million of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 14 completed townhomes for $6.7 million of revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014. 

Marina Palms 

Marina Palms is a waterfront development in Miami, FL consisting of 468 residential condominium units within two towers and a 110-slip full-service marina. It is the first luxury condominium and yacht club project in Miami in two decades. Situated on 14 acres and over 750 feet of waterfront, Marina Palms offers views over the Intracoastal Waterway, and beyond to the Atlantic &#32; Ocean. The Company has partnered with local developers for the development of Marina Palms and contributed its land in return for a 47.5% interest in the venture. 

At December 31, 2015, the first tower was 99% pre-sold and the second tower was 78% pre-sold. The first tower is nearing completion and the venture has begun closing units while the second tower has commenced vertical construction. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized $23.6 million of earnings from equity method investments at the project as compared to $14.7 million of earnings from equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2014. 

Spring Mountain Ranch - Phase 1 

Spring Mountain Ranch is a 785-acre master planned community located four miles from Riverside, CA. Spring Mountain Ranch offers convenient freeway access and proximity to local job centers, and has quickly become one of the top performing residential communities in the Inland Empire, nestled between the Blue Mountains to the north and Box Spring Mountain to the south. The community plan includes a total of 1,400 homes across several neighborhoods, designed with an emphasis on outdoor recreation. In late 2013, the Company contributed a portion of its land and entered into a joint venture with a national homebuilder to jointly develop residential lots in the first phase of the project, which comprise 435 homes. Homes are marketed towards first time, move up and empty nester purchasers. The Company owns a 75.6% interest in the first phase of Spring Mountain Ranch. The remaining phases of Spring Mountain Ranch are wholly owned by the Company. 

The first phase of Spring Mountain Ranch sold 140 lots during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 60 lots during the year ended December 31, 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recognized a $4.2 million loss from equity method investments at the project as compared to $0.2 million of earnings from equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company recorded $4.3 million of impairments in 2015 based on additional costs at the project associated with newly-imposed water regulations implemented by the State of California. 

Operating Properties

The commercial properties within this portfolio include office, retail, hotel and other property types. The residential properties within this portfolio are generally luxury condominium projects located in major U.S. cities where the Company's strategy is to sell individual condominium units through retail distribution channels.

Commercial Properties 

Summary of Portfolio Characteristics&#8212; As of December 31, 2015 , commercial properties within the operating properties portfolio included 20 &#32;facilities, encompassing 4.5 million &#32;square feet located in 9 &#32;states. Commercial properties include office, industrial and retail buildings along with hotels and marinas. The Company&#8217;s commercial properties were primarily acquired through either foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure in connection with the resolution of loans. 

The Company classifies commercial properties as either stabilized or transitional. In determining whether a commercial property is stabilized or transitional, the Company analyzes certain performance metrics, primarily occupancy and yield. Stabilized 

commercial properties generally have occupancy levels above 80% and/or generate yields resulting in a sufficient return based upon the properties&#8217; risk profiles. Transitional commercial properties are generally those properties that do not meet these criteria. As of December 31, 2015 , stabilized commercial properties had a total carrying value of $123.8 million , or 22% &#32;of the portfolio, generated an unleveraged weighted average effective yield of 8.8% &#32;on gross carrying value for the year and were 89% &#32;leased. As of December 31, 2015, transitional commercial properties had a total carrying value of $448.0 million , or 78% &#32;of the portfolio, generated an unleveraged weighted average effective yield of 2.8% &#32;on gross carrying value for the year and were 65% &#32;leased. 

Portfolio Activity &#8212;During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company sold a leasehold interest in a commercial operating property for net proceeds of $93.5 million and simultaneously entered into a ground lease with an initial term of 99 years and annual rent starting at $2.5 million with escalations. In connection with this transaction, the Company deferred a gain of $5.3 million. The Company also sold a commercial operating property for $68.5 million &#32;to a newly formed unconsolidated entity in which the Company owns a 50.0% equity interest. The Company recognized a gain on sale of $13.6 million , reflecting the Company's share of the interest sold (see Item 8 &#8212;"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data&#8212;Note 4" for further details). In addition, the Company sold three &#32;properties with an aggregate carrying value of $5.3 million &#32;which resulted in a net loss of $0.3 million . The Company also funded $32.9 million &#32;of capital expenditures on existing commercial operating properties. 

As of December 31, 2015 , lease expirations on commercial properties, excluding hotels, marinas and other investments, within the operating properties portfolio were as follows ($ in thousands):

Residential Properties 

Summary of Portfolio Characteristics &#8212;As of December 31, 2015 , residential properties within the operating properties portfolio included 9 &#32;residential projects, representing 210 &#32;units located within luxury condominium projects in major cities throughout the United States. 

Portfolio Activity &#8212;During the year ended December 31, 2015 , the Company sold 167 &#32;residential condominiums for net proceeds of $127.9 million , resulting in gains on sales of $40.1 million . The Company also incurred $14.2 million &#32;of net carrying costs that were reflected in "Real estate expenses" in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. The Company acquired, via deed-in-lieu, title to a residential property, which had a total fair value of $13.4 million &#32;and previously served as collateral for loans receivable held by the Company. No gain or loss was recorded in connection with this transaction. During the same period, the Company funded $51.3 million &#32;of capital expenditures related to these projects. 

Policies with Respect to Other Activities 

The Company's investment, financing and corporate governance policies (including conflicts of interests policies) are managed under the ultimate supervision of the Company's Board of Directors. The Company can amend, revise or eliminate these policies at any time without a vote of its shareholders. The Company intends to originate and manage investments in a manner 

consistent with the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") for the Company to qualify as a REIT. 

Investment Restrictions or Limitations 

The Company does not have any prescribed allocation among investments or product lines. Instead, the Company focuses on corporate and real estate credit underwriting to develop an analysis of the risk/reward trade-offs in determining the pricing and advisability of each particular transaction. 

The Company believes that it is not, and intends to conduct its operations so as not to become, regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The Investment Company Act generally exempts entities that are "primarily engaged in purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate" (collectively, "Qualifying Interests"). The Company intends to rely on current interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission in an effort to qualify for this exemption. Based on these interpretations, the Company, among other things, must maintain at least 55% of its assets in Qualifying Interests and at least 25% of its assets in real estate-related assets (subject to reduction to the extent the Company invests more than 55% of its assets in Qualifying Interests). The Company's senior mortgages, real estate assets and certain of its subordinated mortgages generally constitute Qualifying Interests. Subject to the limitations on ownership of certain types of assets and the gross income tests imposed by the Code, the Company also may invest in the securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. 

Competition 

The Company operates in a competitive market. See Item 1a&#8212;Risk factors&#8212;"We compete with a variety of financing and leasing sources for our customers," for a discussion of how we may be affected by competition. 

Regulation 

The operations of the Company are subject, in certain instances, to supervision and regulation by state and federal governmental authorities and may be subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, which, among other things: (1) regulate credit granting activities; (2) establish maximum interest rates, finance charges and other charges; (3) require disclosures to customers; (4) govern secured transactions; (5) set collection, foreclosure, repossession and claims-handling procedures and other trade practices; (6) govern privacy of customer information; and (7) regulate anti-terror and anti-money laundering activities. Although most states do not regulate commercial finance, certain states impose limitations on interest rates and other charges and on certain collection practices and creditor remedies, and require licensing of lenders and financiers and adequate disclosure of certain contract terms. The Company is also required to comply with certain provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act that are applicable to commercial loans. 

In the judgment of management, existing statutes and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on the business conducted by the Company. It is not possible at this time to forecast the exact nature of any future legislation, regulations, judicial decisions, orders or interpretations, nor their impact upon the future business, financial condition or results of operations or prospects of the Company. 

The Company has elected and expects to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT under Section 856 through 860 of the Code. As a REIT, the Company must generally distribute at least 90% of its net taxable income, excluding capital gains, to its shareholders each year. In addition, the Company must distribute 100% of its net taxable income each year to avoid paying federal income taxes. REITs are also subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements in order to elect and maintain REIT qualification. These requirements include specific share ownership tests and asset and gross income tests. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, the Company will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on its net taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to state and local taxes and to federal income tax and excise tax on its undistributed income. 

On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, an omnibus spending bill, with a division referred to as the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes Act of 2015 (the "PATH Act"). The PATH Act changes certain of the rules affecting REIT qualification and taxation of REITs and REIT shareholders, including the following: 

&#8226; 

The rate of withholding tax applicable under Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act ("FIRPTA") to certain sales and other dispositions of U.S. real property interests ("USRPIs") by non-U.S. persons, and certain distributions from corporations whose stock may constitute a USRPI, is increased from 10% to 15% for dispositions and distributions occurring after February 16, 2016. 

&#8226; 

For dispositions and distributions on or after December 18, 2015, the stock ownership thresholds for exemption from FIRPTA taxation on sale of stock of a publicly traded REIT and for recharacterizing capital gain dividends received from a publicly traded REIT as ordinary dividends is increased from not more than 5% to not more than 10%. 

We expect that the changes will not materially impact our operations and will continue to monitor any potential impact as regulatory guidance is issued. 

Code of Conduct 

The Company has adopted a code of conduct that sets forth the principles of conduct and ethics to be followed by our directors, officers and employees (the "Code of Conduct"). The purpose of the Code of Conduct is to promote honest and ethical conduct, compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations, full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in periodic reports, prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Conduct and a culture of honesty and accountability. A copy of the Code of Conduct has been provided to each of our directors, officers and employees, who are required to acknowledge that they have received and will comply with the Code of Conduct. A copy of the Company's Code of Conduct has been previously filed with the SEC and is incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Exhibit 14.0. The Code of Conduct is also available on the Company's website at www.istar.com . The Company will disclose to shareholders material changes to its Code of Conduct, or any waivers for directors or executive officers, if any, within four business days of any such event. As of December 31, 2015 , there have been no amendments to the Code of Conduct and the Company has not granted any waivers from any provision of the Code of Conduct to any directors or executive officers. 

Employees 

As of February 19, 2016, the Company had 188 &#32;employees and believes it has good relationships with its employees. The Company's employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements.
