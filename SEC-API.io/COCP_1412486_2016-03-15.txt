&#160; 

&#160; Overview 

&#160; 

Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. (&#8220;the Company&#8221;) was formerly incorporated in Nevada under the name Biozone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On January 2, 2014, Biozone Pharmaceuticals, Inc. sold substantially all of its assets to MusclePharm Corporation (&#8220;MusclePharm&#8221;), and, on the same day, merged with Cocrystal Discovery, Inc. in a transaction accounted for as a reverse merger. Following the merger, the Company assumed Cocrystal Discovery, Inc.&#8217;s business plan and operations. On March 18, 2014, the Company reincorporated in Delaware under the name Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. 

Effective November 25, 2014, Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. and affiliated entities completed a series of merger transactions as a result of which Cocrystal Pharma, Inc. merged with RFS Pharma, LLC, a Georgia limited liability company (&#8220;RFS Pharma&#8221;). We refer to the surviving entity of this merger as &#8220;Cocrystal&#8221; or the &#8220;Company.&#8221; 

Our primary business going forward is to develop novel medicines for use in the treatment of human viral diseases. Cocrystal has been developing novel technologies and approaches to create first-in-class and best-in-class antiviral drug candidates since its initial funding in 2008. Our focus is to pursue the development and commercialization of broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidates that will transform the treatment and prophylaxis of viral diseases in humans. By concentrating our research and development efforts on viral replication inhibitors, we plan to leverage our infrastructure and expertise in these areas. 

&#160; 

The Company operates in only one segment. Management uses cash flow as the primary measure to manage its business and does not segment its business for internal reporting or decision-making. 

&#160; 

Cocrystal Technology 

&#160; 

We are developing antiviral therapeutics that inhibit the essential replication function of a virus, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme, the helicase enzyme and the NS5A protein of HCV, and the polymerase enzymes of influenza virus and norovirus. The polymerase inhibitors include both nucleosides (Nucs) and non-nucleosides. To discover and design these inhibitors, we use proprietary antiviral nucleoside chemistry, and a proprietary platform comprising computation, medicinal chemistry, click chemistry, and X-ray crystallography. We determine the structures of cocrystals containing the inhibitors bound to the enzyme or protein to guide our design. We also use advanced computational methods to screen and design product candidates using proprietary cocrystal structural information. In designing the candidates, we seek to anticipate and avert potential viral mutations leading to resistance. By designing and selecting drug candidates that interrupt the viral replication process and also have specific binding characteristics, we seek to develop drugs that are not only effective against both the virus and possible mutants of the virus, but which also have reduced off-target interactions that cause undesirable clinical side effects. While this approach is easy to describe, it is much more difficult to carry out. In particular, an extensive knowledge of viruses and drug targets is required. In addition, knowledge and experience in the fields of structural biology, enzymology, and nucleoside chemistry is required. 

&#160; 

We developed our proprietary structure-based drug design and antiviral nucleoside chemistry under the guidance of Dr. Roger Kornberg, our Chief Scientist and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2006, and Dr. Raymond Schinazi, our Chairman and a world leader in the area of nucleoside chemistry and the founder of several biotechnology companies focusing on antiviral drug discovery and development. Our drug discovery process focuses on those parts of the enzymes to which drugs bind and on drug-enzyme interactions at the atomic level. Additionally, we have developed proprietary targeted in-house chemical libraries of nucleosides, non-nucleoside inhibitors, metal-binding inhibitors, and fragments. Our drug discovery process is different from traditional, empirical, medicinal chemistry approaches that often require iterative high-throughput compound screening and lengthy hit-to-lead processes. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Cocrystal&#8217;s proprietary technology integrates several powerful and specialized techniques: 

&#160; 

&#160; (1) 

Selection of viral drug targets amenable to broad spectrum antiviral drug development and essential for viral genome replication; 

&#160; (2) 

Proprietary nucleoside chemistry; 

&#160; (3) 

Atomic resolution 3-D structure determination of drug binding pockets; 

&#160; 

&#160; (4) 

In-depth computational analysis of conservation of drug-binding pockets and critical molecular interactions between antiviral inhibitors and amino acid residues of the target molecule&#8217;s drug-binding pocket; 

&#160; 

&#160; (5) 

Cocrystal structure determinations to inform hit identification, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization processes; 

&#160; 

&#160; (6) 

Molecular modeling and computer-guided lead discovery to support rational chemical modifications based on structure-activity relationships, or SAR, of candidate inhibitor compounds; 

&#160; 

&#160; (7) 

Knowledge of enzymatic mechanisms to guide the design of drugs with exceptional affinity, specificity, and broad spectrum activity; and 

&#160; 

&#160; (8) 

Platforms for rapid identification of antiviral enzyme inhibitors showing broad spectrum antiviral capability. 

&#160; 

We have applied these techniques to develop antiviral inhibitors of three important viruses: hepatitis C, influenza, and norovirus. 

Market-Driven Product Profiles 

&#160; 

In all of our programs our goal is to develop best-in-class, oral, broad-spectrum, high-barrier-to-resistance drugs. An ideal product for an antiviral therapy would have at least the following characteristics: 

&#160; 

&#160; (1) 

Good safety and tolerability profile; 

&#160; 

&#160; (2) 

Effective against all viral subtypes that cause disease; 

&#160; 

&#160; (3) 

High barrier to viral resistance; and 

&#160; 

&#160; (4) 

Ease of administration, for example, a pill. 

&#160; 

Even at the discovery stage of drug development, we select compounds with these factors in mind. Furthermore, our technology is capable of delivering therapies that satisfy all of these key factors, as detailed below. 

&#160; 

Safety and tolerability : All drugs have side effects, also referred to as adverse effects. These usually result from a drug&#8217;s ability to bind to human biological molecules (usually proteins). When this interaction is intentional (i.e., part of the drug&#8217;s mechanism of action), the adverse effects are classified as on-target effects. When this interaction is unintentional (i.e., resulting from the drug&#8217;s interaction with an unintended human molecule), the effects are called off-target effects. Our inhibitors target viral replication enzymes and a viral replication protein, which are unique to viruses. Because the targets are viral, not human, minimal adverse effects are possible. During the discovery phase, we screen all candidate compounds for potential cross-reactivity with human replication enzymes and eliminate those that are cross-reactive. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Broadly effective against all viral subtypes: For any given viral disease, there are different subtypes of viruses that cause the disease. For example, there are six different subtypes of the virus known to cause hepatitis C. These subtypes are termed &#8220;genotypes.&#8221; Each hepatitis C virus genotype is common in some parts of the world and rare in others. 

&#160; 

Most antiviral drugs available today are only effective against certain subtypes of viruses and less effective or not effective at all against other subtypes. To address this problem, we are developing drug candidates that specifically target viral proteins involved in replication. Despite the various subtypes of virus that may exist, these enzymes are essentially identical (highly conserved) among all subtypes of a given virus. By targeting these conserved replication enzymes, our antiviral compounds are designed and tested to be effective against all virus subtypes. &#160; Replication enzymes are conserved not only among subtypes of a given virus but among many different viruses, creating an opportunity for the development of broad spectrum antiviral drugs. 

&#160; 

High Barrier to Viral Resistance: Viral resistance is a major obstacle to developing effective antiviral therapies. Viruses can reproduce rapidly and in enormous quantities. During reproduction, random variations in viral molecules, called mutations, spontaneously develop. If such a mutation occurs in a viral molecule that is targeted by a given antiviral therapy, that therapy may no longer be effective against the mutated virus. These mutated or &#8220;resistant&#8221; viruses can freely infect and multiply even in individuals who have received drug treatment. In some cases, resistant virus strains may even predominate. For example, in the 2009 swine influenza pandemic, the predominant strain was resistant to the best available therapies. 

Cocrystal&#8217;s focus on viral replication proteins can overcome the obstacle of viral resistance. We identify and target critical components of viral replication proteins that are essential for function and, therefore, sensitive to change. Any mutation in these critical components is likely to inactivate the protein and, in turn, render the virus incapable of replicating. Because such mutations cannot propagate, the virus cannot effectively develop resistance to the enzyme inhibitors we employ. We test the effectiveness of our compounds against potential viral mutations and select compounds with the highest barrier to resistance. 

&#160; 

Ease of administration: &#160; We select compounds for development that can be administered orally, preferably once daily, and in pill-form. 

&#160; 

Therapeutic Targets 

&#160; 

Hepatitis C: A large and increasing market with considerable unmet medical need 

&#160; 

Hepatitis C is a viral infection of the liver that according to The World Health Organization in 2013 affects over 150 million people worldwide. The annual number of deaths due to Hepatitis C is estimated at 350,000 globally or nearly 1,000 per day. Most patients develop chronic infections, which can lead to fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. The worldwide market for hepatitis C antiviral drugs was $13 billion in 2014 (PRNewswire September 2015) and is expected to grow to $15.5 billion by 2022 (Datamonitor Healthcare August 2013). 

Today the hepatitis C market belongs to direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that have activity (are effective against all or multiple hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes); have a high barrier to resistance; and are orally available. 

&#160; 

Hepatitis C is a highly competitive and changing market. Currently, the standard treatment varies with the genotype of the hepatitis C virus infection. Prior to late 2013, treatment included peginterferon alpha and ribavirin, along with a protease inhibitor (either telaprevir, boceprevir, or simeprevir). In late 2013, sofosbuvir, a drug belonging to a new class of drugs called &#8220;nucleoside analogs&#8221; or &#8220;Nucs,&#8221; was approved to treat hepatitis C. In patients infected with HCV genotype 1 (the most common HCV genotype in the US), sofosbuvir was administered in combination with peginterferon alpha and ribavirin. In patients with HCV genotypes 2 and 3, however, sofosbuvir could be effectively administered in combination with ribavirin, without the need for peginterferon alpha. In late 2014, new combinations of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), Harvoni(TM) (sofosbuvir/ledipasvir) and Viekira Pak(TM) (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir), were approved to treat HCV genotype 1. In addition to these drugs, several compounds are currently in development by companies such as Janssen, Merck, and Bristol-Myers Squibb. 

We were originally pursuing drug candidates that target two distinct HCV replication enzymes &#8211; the NS5B polymerase and the NS3 helicase -- that are essential to viral replication and are highly conserved across all HCV genotypes. As a result of the merger with RFS Pharma LLC, we now have two additional drug classes in our HCV portfolio &#8211; nucleoside/nucleotide polymerase inhibitors and NS5A inhibitors. We have a preclinical pipeline of pan-genotypic NNI, pan-genotypic Nuc, and pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitors in preclinical development, which represent the potential for significant commercial opportunities. The drug development candidates in our pipeline show excellent pan-genotypic activity against all major HCV genotypes and high barrier to drug resistance. In addition to these properties, our drug development candidates show favorable preclinical safety/tolerability. Manufacturing and IND-enabling studies of these preclinical leads are in progress. We believe there is significant market potential for our unique pan-genotypic combination regimen (Nuc + NNI + NS5A). 

&#160; 

We are also developing pan-genotypic antiviral compounds that inhibit HCV helicase, also known as the NS3 helicase, another enzyme that is essential for hepatitis C viral replication. These compounds specifically inhibit an essential step of HCV replication prior to the synthesis of new RNA strands by NS5B polymerase. We believe that we are a leader in developing hepatitis C treatments that target this enzyme. Therefore, our HCV helicase inhibitor could be the first in a new class of treatments for hepatitis C. 

&#160; 

We anticipate a significant global HCV market opportunity that will persist through at least 2030, given the large prevalence of HCV infection worldwide (170 million HCV-infected individuals and the majority remain undiagnosed). We have four classes of HCV direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in development, targeting the HCV NS5B polymerase (NNI and Nuc), NS5A, and NS3 helicase, which could be developed as an all-oral, pan-genotypic combination regimen with significant upside. Such a combination treatment with different classes of DAAs has the potential to change the paradigm of treatment for HCV with its efficacy, higher barrier to viral resistance, and shorter duration of treatment. These strategies could allow us to expand and broaden our portfolio in the HCV antiviral therapeutic area, and could also lead to high and fast cure rate, and to a better suppression of the emergence of drug resistance. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Norovirus: A worldwide public health problem responsible for close to 90% of epidemic, non-bacterial outbreaks of gastroenteritis around the world . 

&#160; 

Norovirus is a very common and highly contagious virus that causes symptoms of acute gastroenteritis including nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and diarrhea. Other symptoms include fatigue, fever and dehydration. Noroviruses are a major cause of gastrointestinal illness in closed and crowded environments, having become notorious for their common occurrence in hospitals, nursing homes, child care facilities, and cruise ships. In the United States alone, noroviruses are the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis, and are estimated to cause 21 million illnesses each year and contribute to 70,000 hospitalizations and 800 deaths. Noroviruses are responsible for up to 1.1 million hospitalizations and 218,000 deaths annually in children in the developing world. In immunosuppressed patients, chronic norovirus infection can lead to a debilitating illness with extended periods of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. There is currently no effective treatment or effective vaccine for norovirus, and the ability to curtail outbreaks is limited. Few, companies are developing antiviral treatments for this disease. However, three candidate vaccines are currently in early stages of clinical testing by GlaxoSmithKline, Ligocyte and Takeda Pharmaceuticals. 

&#160; 

By targeting viral replication enzymes, we believe it is possible to develop an effective treatment for all genogroups of norovirus. Also, because of the significant unmet medical need and the possibility of chronic norovirus infection in immunocompromised individuals, new antiviral therapeutic approaches may warrant an accelerated path to market. Cocrystal is developing inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of norovirus. Similar to the hepatitis C virus polymerases, this enzyme is essential to viral replication and is highly conserved between all noroviral geno-groups. Therefore, an inhibitor of this enzyme might be an effective treatment or short-term prophylactic agent (when administered during a cruise or nursing home stay, for example). We have developed a preclinical Nuc which exhibits broad spectrum anti-norovirus activity. In addition, we have developed X-ray quality norovirus polymerase crystals. We are implementing the platform and approaches that have proven successful in our other antiviral programs. 

Influenza: A worldwide public health problem, including the potential for pandemic disease. 

&#160; 

Influenza is a severe respiratory illness, caused by either influenza A or B virus, that results in yearly outbreaks of disease during the winter months. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that influenza is linked to 49,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations each year in the United States. The worldwide market for antiviral drugs to treat influenza was $3.8 billion dollars in 2012 and is expected to grow to $6 billion dollars by 2018 (bccResearch). 

&#160; 

Currently, approved antiviral treatments for influenza are effective, but burdened with significant viral resistance. Strains of influenza virus that are resistant to the approved treatments osteltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu(R)) and zanamavir (Relenza(R)) have appeared, and in some cases predominate. For example, the predominant strain of the 2009 swine influenza pandemic was resistant to Tamiflu. These drugs target viral neuraminadase enzymes, which are not highly conserved between viral strains. In fact, different influenza virus strains such as H1N1 and H5N1 are named according to their respective differences in hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The ability of the influenza virus to produce viable variants of these two proteins is the key to its ability to develop resistance to these drugs. 

&#160; 

We are developing drug candidates that are specifically designed to be effective against all strains of the influenza A virus and to have a high barrier to resistance. Our drug candidates target a replication enzyme complex essential to viral replication, and should be effective against all forms of influenza A, including avian influenza, an emerging public health concern in Asia. The influenza replication complex consists of three different proteins: PA, PB1, and PB2. We have developed X-ray quality influenza crystals, and structure-based leads with an excellent broad spectrum activity against major serotypes. A small number of antiviral product candidates that are competitors for Cocrystal&#8217;s influenza program are one Nuc (Favipiravir), developed by Toyoma Chemical, and VX-787, developed by Janssen. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our core technology. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. 

As of December 31, 2015, our patent portfolio consisted of patents and pending applications in the areas primarily related to the treatment of HCV, HIV, Norovirus and Ebola. 

With respect to treatment of HCV, our portfolio is divided into three groups, related to our NS5B, NS3 and NS5A programs. The NS5B program includes both nucleoside (Nuc) and non-nucleoside (NNI) compounds. In our NS5B Nuc program, we had two patents, one U.S. non-provisional application, three U.S. provisional applications, two international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) at the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), and fifteen foreign counterpart applications, over five patent families. The counterpart foreign applications were filed in a number of countries and regions depending on the particular patent family, including Brazil, Canada, Japan, Europe, India, Korea, Mexico and Russia. In our NS5B NNI program, our patent portfolio consisted of two related families, including one granted U.S. patent and two pending U.S. patent applications, with one counterpart application pending in the European Patent Office. 

In our NS3 protease program, we had two issued patent families, including two issued U.S. patents, one issued foreign counterpart and twelve foreign counterparts pending, depending on the particular patent family, in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan and Mexico. 

In our NS5A program, we have two issued U.S. patents, one pending divisional patent application, one international patent application and foreign counterpart applications pending in Brazil, Canada, Europe and India. 

In our Ebola program, our patent portfolio consisted of one pending U.S. provisional patent application. In our Norovirus program, our patent portfolio consisted of one issued U.S. patent and three pending foreign counterpart applications. IN our HIV program, our patent portfolio consisted of one issued U.S. patent. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest claimed filing data. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may be up to 21 years if the earliest claimed filing date is that of a provisional application. Other legal provisions may, however, shorten or lengthen a patent&#8217;s term. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for undue administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent. Alternatively, a patents&#8217; term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or patent naming a common investor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Restoration Act of 1984, or Hatch-Waxman Act, permits and patent term restoration of up to five years beyond the expiration of at U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Similar patent extensions are available in some other countries (Where they may be termed supplementary protection certificates or SPC&#8217;s). 

Collaborations 

Emory University: Cocrystal Pharma has an exclusive license from Emory University for use of certain inventions and technology related to inhibitors of HCV that were jointly developed by Emory and Cocrystal Pharma employees. The License Agreement is dated March 7, 2013 wherein Emory agrees to add to the Licensed Patents and Licensed Technology Emory&#8217;s rights to any patent, patent application, invention, or technology application that is based on technology disclosed within three (3) years of March 7, 2013. The agreement includes payments due to Emory ranging from $40,000 to $500,000 based on successful achievement of certain drug development milestones. Additionally, Cocrystal may have royalty payments at 3.5% of net sales due to Emory with a minimum in year one of $25,000 and increase to $400,000 in year five upon product commercialization . One of Cocrystal&#8217;s Directors, Dr. Raymond Schinazi, is also a faculty member at Emory University. 

&#160;

NIH: Cocrystal Pharma has two Public Health Biological Materials License Agreements with the NIH. The original License Agreements were dated August 31, 2010 and it was amended on November 6, 2013. The materials licensed are being used in Norovirus assays to screen potential antiviral agents in our library. 

&#160;

University of Pittsburgh and Emory University: Cocrystal Pharma assigned its patent rights to the patent titled &#8220;3'-AZIDO PURINENUCLEOTIDE PRODRUGS FOR TREATMENT OF VIRAL INFECTIONS&#8221; to University of Pittsburgh on November 21, 2014. This patent is jointly owned by Cocrystal Pharma, the University of Pittsburgh and Emory University. One of Cocrystal&#8217;s Directors, Dr. Raymond Schinazi, is also a faculty member at Emory University. 

&#160;

Duke University and Emory University: Cocrystal Pharma has entered an agreement to license various patents and know-how to use CRISPR/Cas9 technologies for developing a possible cure for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human papilloma virus (HPV). This license allows Cocrystal Pharma to develop and potentially commercialize a cure for HBV and HPV utilizing the underlying patents and technologies developed by the universities. This agreement includes a non-refundable $100,000 license fee payable to Duke upon a determination of rights letter from the U.S. Veterans Administration with respect to patents and know-how that disclaims any ownership interest. Future royalties may be payable to Duke, ranging from 2-5% of net sales depending on achieving certain sales milestones, if commercial products are developed using this know-how. One of Cocrystal&#8217;s Directors, Dr. Raymond Schinazi, is also a faculty member at Emory University. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to intense and rapidly changing competition as companies seek to develop new technologies and proprietary products. We know of several companies that have marketed or are developing products for the treatment of hepatitis C and influenza, including Gilead Sciences, Inc., Merck &#38; Co., Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb, Toyoma Chemical Co. and Abbvie, Inc. These and other companies developing products for the other viral diseases that are of interest to us have substantially greater financial resources, expertise and capabilities than we do. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Government authorities extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of drug products. Any product candidates we develop must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the U.S., and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in other countries. The clinical testing of product candidates to establish their safety and efficacy in humans is subject to substantial statutory and regulatory requirements with which we must comply. 

Research and Development Expenses 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We do not own or operate, and have no plans to establish any manufacturing facilities. Our chemistry laboratory can produce research scale (milligram-gram) quantities of our lead drug candidates. As such, our progress is often dependent on successful project execution by third party vendors. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We employ 23 full-time employees. Of these full-time employees, 18 are engaged in research and development activities. 

&#160; 

Legacy Business 

&#160; 

Our Legacy Business 

Prior to the merger with Cocrystal Discovery on January 2, 2014, we were primarily engaged in the business of developing and manufacturing over-the-counter drug products (OTC) and cosmetic and beauty products for third parties. In addition, Cocrystal marketed two lines of proprietary skin care products. All of these assets were sold to MusclePharm as part of the January 2, 2014 Asset Purchase Agreement in exchange for 1,200,000 shares of MusclePharm common stock which had a market value as of January 2, 2014 of $9,840,000. In addition, MusclePharm licensed back to us the patents we sold it for six months in exchange for our paying it a 5% royalty on gross sales. We did not sell minority interests in three companies, one of which is publicly traded. In addition, we did not sell to MusclePharm a license which the publicly traded company had previously issued to us. 

&#160; 

We also owned a 45% interest in BetaZone Laboratories, LLC (&#8220;BetaZone&#8221;), which was engaged in the sale and license of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products in Latin America.
