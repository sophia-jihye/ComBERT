Overview 

Versartis, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; &#8220;We&#8221; &#8220;Our&#8221;) is an endocrine-focused biopharmaceutical company initially developing a novel long-acting form of recombinant human growth hormone, somavaratan (VRS-317), for growth hormone deficiency, or GHD, an orphan disease. A key limitation to current recombinant human growth hormone, or rhGH, products is that they impose the burden of daily injections over multiple years, often resulting in poor compliance, which in turn can lead to suboptimal treatment outcomes in GHD patients. Despite this limitation, global annual sales from currently marketed rhGH products have grown to more than $3 billion in 2014. Based on market research, we believe that the market for daily rhGH products can continue to grow up to $4 billion following the launch of long-acting rhGH therapies. Somavaratan is intended to reduce the burden of daily treatment by requiring significantly fewer dosing events and injections, potentially improving adherence and, therefore, treatment outcomes. Accordingly, we believe somavaratan may take significant market share. Our first indication for somavaratan is pediatric GHD, which represents an approximately $1.5 billion existing market opportunity. We have completed the Phase 2a stage of our pediatric GHD clinical trial, have analyzed two year safety data and top-line efficacy data from our ongoing Extension Study and have received feedback from various authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, providing guidance on the design of our Phase 3 clinical trial. In early 2015, we initiated a pediatric GHD Phase 3 registration trial, which we refer to as the VELOCITY trial. We have been enrolling participants into the VELOCITY trial at U.S., Canadian and European sites and we continue to administer somavaratan to patients enrolled in our ongoing Extension Study. We received feedback from the Japanese regulatory agency, Pharmaceuticals Medicines and Devices Agency, or the PMDA, on our pediatric GHD Phase 2/3 registration trial in Japan. We submitted to the PMDA the agreed upon protocol for the pediatric GHD Phase 2/3 trial, received a completed Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN, and initiated the Phase 2/3 trial in April 2015. In the first half of 2015, we received feedback from the FDA and the EMA on our development plan in adult GHD and as a result we are conducting a Phase 2 trial prior to a potential Phase 3 for this population. We initiated the Phase 2 trial, which we refer to as the VITAL trial, in September 2015. We may develop somavaratan for additional growth disorders, such as idiopathic short stature, or ISS, small for gestational age, or SGA, and Turner Syndrome, which together accounted for approximately 20% of the global rhGH market in 2014. We have global rights to somavaratan and, if somavaratan is approved, given the highly concentrated prescriber base, we intend to commercialize it with our own specialty sales force in the United States and Canada, and potentially other geographies. 

GHD is a chronic disease with multiple causes that affects two distinct patient groups, pediatric patients and adult patients, although rhGH treatment options for the two groups are the same. Children with GHD typically have pathologic degrees of short stature, a tendency toward obesity, delayed and deficient mineralization of the skeleton, impaired growth of skeletal muscle and development of a high risk lipid profile. GHD during adulthood manifests as alterations in body composition, such as decreased lean and increased fat mass with skeletal demineralization, and causes adverse changes in cardiovascular outcome markers. Patients with untreated GHD also face increased mortality. 

The current standard of care for GHD is daily subcutaneous injections of rhGH. Patients treated with rhGH to offset their lack of adequate endogenous growth hormone receive thousands of injections over the course of many years. In therapy-compliant GHD children, rhGH therapy initially promotes &#8220;catch-up growth,&#8221; enabling patients to approach or achieve heights on a standard growth curve, and thereafter permits them to maintain normal growth throughout the course of treatment. GHD children who are fully compliant with their daily treatments may attain an adult height comparable to that of their family members and national norms. In therapy-compliant GHD adults, daily subcutaneous injections of rhGH have resulted in improvements in body composition parameters, bone density, cardiovascular outcomes and quality of life. 

Despite the demonstrated benefits of rhGH therapy, published studies have shown that a majority of patients on a daily rhGH regimen, which requires up to 365 dosing events per year, are not fully compliant and fail to achieve the optimal treatment outcomes. Lack of compliance may be due to the burden of these frequent dosing events, each of which typically involves a series of twenty or more steps to prepare and inject rhGH. It often requires up to one hour per dosing event. Significant reductions in the degree of growth in pediatric GHD patients have been observed as a result of missing as few as two injections per week. As a result, pediatric endocrinologists have consistently sought a long-acting rhGH therapy to reduce the treatment burden on patients and their caregivers without compromising safety or efficacy. Importantly, other rhGH manufacturers have attempted to develop a long-acting product using microsphere, PEGylation, fusion and alternative delivery technologies. None of these approaches have been successful due to regulatory, safety, efficacy or manufacturing issues, or a combination thereof. 

&#160;

We believe somavaratan will fulfill this significant unmet need for a long-acting rhGH product. In our Phase 1a clinical trial in adults, somavaratan has demonstrated a half-life a t least thirty times longer than daily rhGH and to date has shown a safety and tolerability profile consistent with that of marketed daily rhGH products. Somavaratan, which is a new molecular entity, combines the same rhGH amino acid sequence utilized in c urrently approved rhGH products with a proprietary in-licensed half-life extension technology, XTEN, to enable less frequent administration. The XTEN technology is comprised of novel sequences of hydrophilic amino acids added at the genetic level as part o f the manufacturing process. The resulting properties of somavaratan enable us to produce it using common recombinant protein manufacturing techniques at a per-dose equivalent cost that we believe may be less than that of marketed rhGH products. 

There are currently seven daily rhGH products marketed in the United States for the treatment of GHD. We are pursuing the same regulatory pathway for somavaratan followed by most of these products for pediatric GHD patients: a dose-finding study and a Phase 3 registration trial with a primary endpoint of mean Year 1 height velocity. Mean height velocity refers to the mean height change of the individuals in a treatment group over a specified time period. In June 2014, we completed the Phase 2a stage of our Phase 1b/2a pediatric GHD clinical trial, in which we evaluated weekly, twice-monthly and monthly dosing of somavaratan. In the completed Phase 1b stage of this clinical trial, we selected insulin-like growth factor-I, or IGF-I, which is a commonly used marker, as the primary pharmacodynamic marker to measure the effect of somavaratan treatment. All subjects had relative IGF-I deficiency at baseline, and the increase from baseline in the 30 day average IGF-I standard deviation score, or IGF-I SDS, was proportional to dose, enabling the development of a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic, or PK/PD, model. Based on this PK/PD model, in the Phase 2a stage of our clinical trial, a total monthly dose of 5.0 mg/kg of somavaratan was administered to pediatric GHD patients either weekly, twice-monthly or monthly. Over the six months of treatment with somavaratan in the Phase 2a stage of the study, somavaratan was found to be safe and well tolerated in these pre-pubertal GHD children. In all three dose groups, somavaratan maintained mean IGF-I increases over baseline and within the lower part of the therapeutic range (which we define as the portion of the therapeutic range with an IGF-I SDS from -1.0 to 0.0) without IGF-I overexposure, confirming the PK/PD model developed from the Phase 1b stage of the study. In addition, we demonstrated that six months of dosing of somavaratan, when given at weekly, twice-monthly and monthly intervals, achieves annualized six month height velocity (which was the study&#8217;s primary endpoint) comparable to the annual height velocity for similar GHD children given a dose of daily rhGH that is the highest approved dose on the labels of Genotropin &#174; and Norditropin &#174; . 

Upon completion of the Phase 2a stage of the trial, we offered patients the opportunity to participate in the Extension Study and to continue with somavaratan treatment. Approximately 95% of the patients completing the Phase 2a stage elected to participate in the Extension Study. Based on the data from the Phase 1b/2a trial, we were able to successfully develop and confirm the PK/PD model that enabled us to increase the dose of somavaratan to 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly. All patients received the 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose in the second year of treatment . 

We now have data on two years of somavaratan administration in pediatric GHD patients. The two-year data as of December 2015 demonstrate that somavaratan was well tolerated with no safety signals over two years. The study discontinuation rate was in line with expectations after two years of ongoing treatment. Adherence to the dosing schedule was nearly 100% through 18-months of at-home treatment, which supports twice-monthly dosing. The mean Year 2 height velocity for somavaratan is comparable to U.S. daily dosing data from the National Cooperative Group Study database, or NCGS database. There was no decline in somavaratan&#8217;s mean Year 2 height velocity with the 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose adjustment. Typically, with daily dosing of rhGH, declines are often seen in the second year of therapy. The results of the Extension Study to date have demonstrated a dose response in both IGF-I levels and height velocity supporting the selection of the 3.5 mg/kg somavaratan twice-monthly as the Phase 3 dose. To date, the 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose of somavaratan has been found to be safe and well tolerated with only a few mild transient adverse events in a minority of the patients.

&#160;

In early 2015 we initiated a pediatric GHD Phase 3 registration trial, which we refer to as the VELOCITY trial. Following initiation of the trial, the FDA requested additional bioanalytical data and placed our Phase 3 clinical trial on partial clinical hold (PCH). We provided the requested information to the agency and the PCH was lifted in June 2015. Since the PCH was lifted, we have been enrolling participants into the VELOCITY trial at U.S., Canadian and European sites and we continue to administer somavaratan to patients enrolled in our ongoing Extension Study. We expect to enroll up to 136 patients in a 3:1 randomization comparing 3.5 mg/kg of somavaratan twice-monthly to 34 &#181;g/kg/day of rhGH, which is the highest approved dose on the labels of Genotropin &#174; and Norditropin &#174; . Somavaratan will be administered utilizing a 30 gauge needle, which is comparable to the needle sizes typically used for daily rhGH products. The primary endpoint for the study is non-inferiority between the two treatment groups based upon mean Year 1 height velocity results. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial by mid-2016 with top-line data availability in mid-2017 to enable filing for marketing authorization in the United States, Europe and Canada assuming a successful trial.

We met with the PMDA in Japan regarding a registration trial of somavaratan for pediatric GHD patients. We submitted to the PMDA the agreed upon protocol for the pediatric GHD Phase 2/3 trial, received a completed Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN, and initiated the Phase 2/3 trial in April 2015. In addition, we will be conducting an Extension Study in Japan to obtain additional information on switching GHD children currently on daily rhGH therapy to somavaratan therapy and on the long-term safety of somavaratan. We have initiated clinical sites in Japan and are currently enrolling pre-pubertal na&#239;ve to treatment GHD children. 

&#160;

In the first half of 2015, we received input from the FDA and the EMA on our development plan in adult GHD and as a result we are conducting a Phase 2 trial in GHD adults prior to a potential Phase 3 for this population. We initiated the Phase 2 trial, wh ich we refer to as the VITAL trial, in September 2015. This study is being conducted and we are currently enrolling patients in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. We believe that monthly somavaratan dosing in GHD adults would offer a significant adva ntage in convenience and adherence over the weekly rhGH products in clinical development by other companies. 

As part of our product life cycle management strategy following the planned BLA submission for somavaratan, we have been working on a higher concentration formulation of somavaratan as a follow-on to our current 100 mg/mL formulation. This formulation has the potential to offer a significant portion of pediatric patients an option for monthly dosing and positions us to pursue clinical trials in indications like ISS, SGA and Turner Syndrome that require higher doses than the labeled doses for rhGH in pediatric GHD patients. 

We have worldwide development and commercialization rights to somavaratan. If somavaratan is approved, we believe it has the potential to capture a significant share of the existing rhGH market. We intend to market somavaratan in the United States and Canada through a specialty sales force of approximately 50 people, targeting high prescribing pediatric endocrinologists. In Europe we may pursue a similar commercialization strategy or seek collaboration, distribution and/or marketing arrangements with third parties. In Japan, we may develop and commercialize somavaratan ourselves, or may collaborate with third parties. 

We are led by a team of experienced biotechnology industry executives and recognized experts in the treatment of GHD who bring significant capabilities in the development and commercialization of a novel long-acting rhGH therapy. Our management team is led by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jay P. Shepard, who has more than 33 years of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and drug delivery expertise most recently as an Executive Partner at Sofinnova Ventures, a healthcare focused venture capital firm, where he leveraged his industry expertise in support of the firm's portfolio companies and served as Executive Chairman of the Versartis Board of Directors since early 2014. Previously, he was President and CEO of NextWave Pharmaceuticals, a pediatric focused company acquired by Pfizer; President and CEO of Ilypsa, a nephrology company acquired by Amgen; and interim President and CEO of Relypsa. Our financial team is led by our Chief Financial Officer, Joshua T. Brumm, who has previously led finance teams for both emerging growth biotechnology and medical device companies, including Pharmacyclics, Inc. and ZELTIQ Aesthetics, Inc. Mr. Brumm has extensive commercial and operating experience in addition to having completed a number of financial and strategic transactions. Our clinical team is led by Bert Bakker, M.D., Ph.D., Senior Vice President of Medical Affairs, and Eric Humphriss, M.B.A., Vice President of Clinical Operations. Dr. Bakker, a pediatric endocrinologist, has been treating children with GHD for more than 30 years and managed the registry for Genentech&#8217;s rhGH products, and he has also led the clinical development of a long acting rhGH candidate. Mr. Humphriss managed Genentech&#8217;s pediatric GHD registry. Our regulatory team is led by Michael Burdick, who has more than 30 years of experience in regulatory affairs and drug development in pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. He has led multiple successful regulatory submissions in the U.S., Europe and other countries, but most recently he led the regulatory development activities for SMT-101, an investigational drug-device combination product for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension at SteadyMed Therapeutics and the NDA submission and approval activities for Quillivant XR at NextWave Pharmaceuticals. Our manufacturing team is led by Patrick Murphy, who headed the team that manufactured the first rhGH product, Protropin &#174; , while at Genentech. Our device team is led by Greg Yedinak, who has developed and led manufacturing of ZP Patch Technology &#174; and was also involved in production of Protropin &#174; , Nutropin &#174; and Nutropin AQ &#174; , while at Genentech. Leading our commercialization efforts is Keith Lui, who led the launch of Imbruvica &#174; and ZELBORAF &#174; and worked on the marketing teams for Avastin &#174; and Rituxan &#174; . 

Our strategy 

Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics. The key elements of our strategy are to: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Complete the clinical development of and seek regulatory approval for twice-monthly dosing of somavaratan for the treatment of GHD in children in the United States, Europe, Canada and Japan . We are currently focused on independently completing the clinical development of somavaratan in pre-pubertal na&#239;ve to treatment children with GHD. In early 2015, we initiated a Phase 3 registration trial in the United States, Europe and Canada. The Phase 3 trial is designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of somavaratan compared to the current standard of care, daily rhGH at the highest approved dose on the labels of Genotropin &#174; and Norditropin &#174; (34 &#181;g/kg/day), with mean Year 1 height velocity as the primary efficacy endpoint. We expect to report top-line mean Year 1 height velocity results in mid-2017. In Japan, we initiated a Phase 2/3 registration trial in early 2015. Extension studies will be conducted for patients who complete the Phase 2 or Phase 3 portion of the trial to gather long-term safety data as well as data on switching patients from daily rhGH therapy to somavaratan treatment. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Complete the clinical development of and seek regulatory approval for monthly dosing of somavaratan for the treatment of GHD in adults in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia and other countries. In our Phase 1a clinical trial in adult GHD patie nts, we demonstrated the potential for monthly dosing. We believe that over half of the adults diagnosed with GHD either refuse therapy or stop therapy due to the burden of daily injections. Reducing the dosing frequency from daily to monthly may increase adherence and maintain more patients on long-term therapy. In the first half of 2015, we met with the FDA and sought scientific advice from the EMA regarding our planned registration strategy in GHD adults. In September 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 open l abel dose-finding trial and are currently enrolling patients. We will propose a Phase 3, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate changes in body composition, such as total fat mass or truncal fat mass, with monthly dosing of somavar atan. Our study design will be comparable to that used for approval of daily rhGH products for use in GHD adults. We anticipate initiating the Phase 3 registration trial in 2017 in the United States, Europe, Canada and Australia. An adult Extension Study was initiated in January 2016 to allow ongoing treatment of patients who complete the Phase 2 or Phase 3 trials . &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Commercialize somavaratan independently in the United States and Canada with a specialty sales force, and identify a commercialization strategy in Europe and other countries to maximize our returns. We believe that a long-acting product candidate like somavaratan, if approved for pediatric GHD, could take significant market share from currently marketed products, all of which require daily injections. Of the over $3 billion and growing global rhGH market, we believe that sales of rhGH products for pediatric GHD currently represent approximately $1.5 billion. We believe the United States and European markets for rhGH for pediatric GHD are currently approximately $500 million and $550 million, respectively, and that the global market for rhGH for adult GHD is currently approximately $400 million. If somavaratan receives marketing approval, we plan to commercialize it in the United States and Canada ourselves with a specialty sales force of approximately 50 people targeting high prescribing pediatric endocrinologists. In Europe and other countries, we may pursue a similar commercialization strategy or seek collaboration, distribution and/or marketing arrangements with third parties. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Evaluate registration and commercialization, either independently or in collaboration with third parties, in Japan. The market for daily rhGH products in Japanese GHD children was approximately $500 million in 2014. The dose of rhGH used in Japan (25 &#181;g/kg/day) is lower than that used in the United States (43 &#181;g/kg/day) leading to lower efficacy in Japanese GHD children compared to U.S. GHD children. Somavaratan, if approved in Japan at the same dose as in the United States, may offer Japanese GHD children an opportunity to achieve similar height velocity to GHD children in the United States. We aim to demonstrate in the Phase 2/3 registration trial in Japanese GHD children that the mean Year 1 height velocity achieved with somavaratan will be better than that observed historically for daily rhGH therapy. The potential for improved adherence and better treatment outcomes with somavaratan in Japan may provide significant differentiation from the currently marketed rhGH products. Once we have clinical trial results from the global pediatric GHD Phase 3 trial and the pediatric GHD Phase 2/3 registration trial in Japan, we will evaluate the optimal registration and commercialization strategy in Japan, which may include seeking a collaboration, distribution and/or marketing arrangements with third parties. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Explore the use of somavaratan in ISS, SGA and Turner Syndrome. In addition to pursuing approval for somavaratan in the approximately $1.5 billion pediatric GHD market, we may develop the product candidate for one or more additional indications in the overall $3 billion rhGH market. In particular, we may explore ISS, SGA, and Turner Syndrome indications, for which the burden of daily rhGH therapy significantly impacts adherence. We may consider initiating one or more trials in these additional indications to potentially expand the market for somavaratan. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Evaluate the opportunity to in-license or acquire complementary products, product candidates or technologies . We plan to expand our product pipeline through opportunistically in-licensing or acquiring the rights to complementary products, product candidates and technologies. We may seek additional licenses to develop the XTEN half-life extension technology for use with drugs that affect other endocrine disease targets. 

Growth hormone deficiency 

GHD is a chronic disease with multiple causes that can affect two distinct patient groups, pediatric patients and adult patients. The disease leads to significant health problems in both pediatric and adult patients, and untreated patients face increased mortality. There are currently seven marketed daily rhGH products in the United States for the treatment of GHD. However, a key limitation of these products is the burden of daily injections, which can limit compliance and lead to suboptimal treatment outcomes. As such, we believe that there is a significant unmet need for an improved therapeutic option for both pediatric and adult GHD patients. 

&#160;

Pediatric GHD 

GHD in children is characterized by reduced growth performance and a loss of height as compared to a patient&#8217;s age-matched peers. We estimate that approximately 80% of childhood cases are idiopathic, or of unknown cause. GHD may also result from congenital defects in the anatomy of the hypothalamus and pituitary, often associated with mutations in genes responsible for the differentiation and development of the cells in the pituitary that produce human growth hormone, or hGH, or the receptor for hGH releasing hormone. Other causes of GHD in children include traumatic brain injuries, neoplastic lesions of the central nervous system and/or the required surgical and/or radiation therapies, or side effects of some chemotherapy procedures. 

In all cases, pediatric GHD is diagnosed based on several clinical parameters, including heights substantially below a normal growth curve range, a demonstration that hGH is deficient by two or more hGH stimulation tests or by frequent hGH sampling protocols, the ruling out of other potential causes of growth failure and, where required, genetic testing and/or magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, of the brain, hypothalamus and pituitary. 

Idiopathic GHD in children does not typically persist into adult life, while patients with organic causes of pediatric GHD often do experience adult GHD. Guidelines recommend that pediatric patients be treated until adult height is reached. In adulthood, pediatric GHD patients require additional screening to establish whether there is a need to undergo retreatment with rhGH. Research indicates that, depending upon the test group and screening methodology, up to 87.5% of adults with childhood onset GHD were no longer diagnosed as suffering from GHD upon retesting. As such, the prevalence for children and adults is separately estimated from literature studies and the total prevalence taken as the sum of childhood onset and adult onset cases. 

The available data from the United States and European Union consistently estimate the prevalence of GHD in children as just below 3 per 10,000. One of the most comprehensive studies of the prevalence of GHD is the Utah Growth Study conducted in the early 1990s. This study estimated a prevalence of GHD in Utah school children of 1 in 3,480, which is equal to 2.87 per 10,000. 

Adult GHD 

Most cases of adult-onset GHD, a well-recognized clinical disorder, are related to the occurrence and treatment of pituitary adenomas or as a result of traumatic brain injuries. The diagnosis of adult GHD requires a demonstration of insufficient levels of hGH by hGH stimulation testing or frequent hGH sampling techniques, but GHD may be diagnosed in some adults by the finding of three other pituitary hormone deficiencies in combination with a low IGF-I level. 

The available data from the United States and European Union consistently estimate the prevalence of GHD in adults as approximately 1 per 10,000. The British Society of Endocrinology estimates the prevalence of adult-onset GHD as 1 in 10,000 in the United Kingdom, and we believe there is a similar prevalence in the United States. 

Combining the GHD prevalence estimates in adults (1 in 10,000) and children (3 in 10,000) yields a combined GHD prevalence estimate of 4 in 10,000 in the United States and Europe. 

Treatment goals and currently available therapies for GHD 

In GHD children, early treatment goals are the establishment of &#8220;catch-up&#8221; growth to decrease differences in height between the patient and similarly aged peers and preventing the additional deficits from leaving GHD untreated. Long-term treatment goals extend to the attainment of heights comparable to family members and national norms and require approximately seven years for these goals to be achieved. Growth prediction models, based on treatment outcomes in large registries of GHD children, may be used to individualize treatment goals and rhGH dosing. In adults, the desired treatment outcomes are improvements in body composition parameters, skeletal mineralization to prevent osteopenia, metabolic and inflammatory markers to reduce cardio- and cerebrovascular disease, and quality of life. 

Daily subcutaneous administration of rhGH is used as a replacement therapy for the endogenous production of hGH to obtain these treatment goals. Administration of rhGH stimulates the production of IGF-I, which is important for the regulation of normal physiology. Daily rhGH therapy does not mimic the typical endogenous pulsatile release of hGH in normal healthy individuals, but daily injections of rhGH have been demonstrated for over 30 years to be a safe and effective therapy for treatment of GHD. In addition, clinical studies of continuous infusion of rhGH with a pump demonstrate comparable mean height velocity, IGF-I levels and safety to those observed with daily rhGH injections for six months. No other treatment modalities are known to be effective, and there are no known preventative therapies for GHD. 

&#160;

All currently marketed rhGH products in the United States&#8212;Norditropin &#174; (Novo Nordisk), Humatrope &#174; (Eli Lilly) , Nutropin-AQ &#174; (Roche/Genentech), Genotropin &#174; (Pfizer), Saizen &#174; (Merck Serono), Tev-tropin &#174; (Teva Pharmaceuticals) and Omnitrope (Sandoz GmbH)&#8212;are administered by daily subcutaneous injections, and no major pharmacological differences are known to exist be tween these products with respect to safety or efficacy. The daily rhGH dose for these marketed products for the treatment of pediatric GHD ranges from a low dose of 25 rhGH/kg/day, as approved in Japan to the highest dose used in children of 43 &#181;g rhGH/kg /day, commonly used in the US. The highest FDA labeled dose is 34 &#181;g rhGH/kg/day, which is the dose commonly used in Europe. Despite approvals as early as 2006, biosimilars represented less than 15% of the market in 2014, even with initial price discounts of 20% to 30% relative to branded products. One biosimilar manufacturer has since abandoned its initial discounting strategy in favor of pricing and marketing strategies similar to those used by manufacturers of branded products. Manufacturers of the bra nded products continue to emphasize novel delivery methods and devices along with complementary services in order to differentiate themselves from each other as well as to minimize the impact of any future biosimilars. Existing rhGH products are available as a lyophilized powder with diluents, or rhGH for injection using vial and syringe, auto-injectors or pen devices. 

Limitations of currently available therapies 

In order to achieve the benefits associated with the currently marketed daily subcutaneous injections of rhGH, patients must maintain strict dosing compliance. Full dosing compliance requires patients to endure painful, daily injections and for parents or caregivers to undergo the many preparation steps required for rhGH administration on a daily basis. Studies from diverse geographic areas demonstrate that full compliance with daily rhGH dosing presents challenges for patients and caregivers and, as a result, doses are frequently missed. Because there is no immediately noticeable effect of treatment, as with insulin, for example, patients and caregivers may not perceive a detriment to skipping doses. Patients may also become noncompliant from dissatisfaction with near term treatment outcomes. In a study of children with GHD, 46% of patients missed two injections per week and 26% missed three or more injections per week. As shown in the figure below, for patients missing two or more injections per week there was a statistically significant reduction in their change in height velocity standard deviation score, or HVSDS, compared to high-compliance patients. A greater HVSDS indicates more rapid growth. 

&#160;

In additional studies, 33% to 77% of children had levels of noncompliance that can be estimated to have reduced efficacy as measured by first year height velocity. Although a similar study in GHD adults has not been reported, we believe there would be a comparable outcome of diminished therapeutic benefit. Continued treatment without substantial therapeutic benefit is not generally considered an acceptable approach, especially in the treatment of children with repeated subcutaneous injections. Accordingly, methods to increase treatment compliance, such as a significant reduction in frequency of injections, may have the therapeutic benefit of maintaining the efficacy observed for daily rhGH therapy in highly compliant GHD children and adults and improve treatment outcomes for those with poor compliance with daily injections. For example, enhanced clinical responsiveness has been demonstrated for long-acting forms of gonadotropin releasing hormone in fertility studies. Similarly, the relevant medical literature indicates that frequency of administration significantly affects patients&#8217; adherence to chronic treatments for a number of disorders. We believe that adherence to treatment can be improved with decreased frequency of administration. 

&#160;

Our approach to increased compliance and better therapeutic outcomes is to reduce the frequency of subcutaneous injections. In children in particular, we and others who h ave studied long-acting rhGH anticipate that reducing injection frequency may lead to increased treatment compliance, and in turn, better outcomes. 

Attempts to develop long-acting rhGH products 

We believe that for a long-acting rhGH product to be successful, there should be minimal trade-offs compared to the current daily rhGH products when assessing safety, efficacy and manufacturing. 

Previous attempts by others to develop a long-acting rhGH have not succeeded due to regulatory, safety, efficacy or manufacturing issues, or a combination of those factors. The only FDA-approved long-acting rhGH, Nutropin Depot, was developed by Genentech and approved in 1999. Nutropin Depot was dosed semi-monthly or monthly with a large gauge needle and caused significant pain on injection with nodule formation and lipoatrophy at the injection sites. Lipoatrophy is a localized loss of fat tissue that is stimulated by a sustained exposure of subcutaneous tissue to rhGH and can cause undesirable skin deformations. The efficacy of Nutropin Depot was less than the approved daily rhGH products because the duration of the rhGH release from the formulation was less than the dose interval. Nutropin Depot was ultimately removed from the market due to the significant resources required to continue manufacturing and commercializing the product. Additional attempts at sustained release formulations have not yet led to marketed products in the United States, Europe or Japan, due to regulatory, safety, efficacy and/or manufacturing issues. Three published attempts have been made at PEGylation of rhGH, which is a process to chemically attach polyethylene glycol to rhGH in order to extend its residence time in the bloodstream after administration. This residence time is commonly measured by half-life, which is the amount of time it takes for a quantity to decline to one-half its starting value. Pfizer first attempted PEGylation of rhGH to achieve a weekly dosed product. However, the PEGylated rhGH was not readily absorbed at the injection site and caused severe lipoatrophy in GHD children, resulting in a discontinuation of development. Another attempt to PEGylate rhGH by Novo Nordisk also failed in GHD children because a weekly profile was not achieved. Merck Serono in collaboration with Ambrx evaluated an alternative method of PEGylation, but the rights to the product candidate were returned to Ambrx after completion of a clinical trial in adults. The past attempts at long-acting rhGH have all had significant trade-offs that diminished their commercial potential. 

Attributes of somavaratan 

Somavaratan was engineered using XTEN technology to extend the residence time in the bloodstream by reducing the clearance of rhGH from the body by the two primary mechanisms, kidney filtration and receptor mediated clearance. XTEN technology was developed by Amunix Operating, Inc., or Amunix, and involves the use of novel sequences of natural hydrophilic amino acids that can be genetically fused to a desired protein, such as rhGH in the case of somavaratan. These novel sequences have been shown to be non-immunogenic and to enable the tuning of therapeutic protein properties to obtain the desired pharmacological properties in vivo. In somavaratan, a long N-terminal XTEN sequence, XTEN 1 , is added to rhGH as a fusion protein, increasing the hydrodynamic size of the rhGH and thereby reducing glomerular filtration. A C-terminal XTEN sequence, XTEN 2 , is also added to potentially reduce receptor mediated clearance by decreasing receptor binding. Somavaratan (119 kDa) has a molecular weight 5.4 times greater than rhGH (22 kDa). The difference in molecular weight is the result of the additional XTEN polypeptide chains, and no changes have been made to the rhGH sequence. In published preclinical studies, somavaratan has been demonstrated to have the same dose dependent biological effects on IGF-I secretion and bone growth as rhGH. 

&#160;

Somavaratan is expressed as a soluble protein in the periplasm of the E. coli bacteria that are commonly used in the manufacture of biological molecules, or biologics. After isolation from the cells, somavaratan is purified by a series of column chromatography steps, buffer exchanged and then concentrated to achieve the final bulk drug substance. Somavaratan is a clear aqueous solution manufactured for subcutaneous injection.

&#160;

We believe somavaratan has the following advantages that support its rapid development: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Somavaratan has a longer half-life than daily rhGH products and may offer a significantly more convenient dosing solution for GHD patients. Somavaratan has been shown in our clinical trials to have the advantage of a longer half-life and potentially require less frequent dosing than daily rhGH. In our Phase 1a clinical trial in adults with GHD, somavaratan had a mean elimination half-life of 131 hours at the highest dose tested, representing at least a thirty-fold increase in half-life as compared to the two to four hour half-lives reported for subcutaneously administered rhGH. The prolonged half-life of somavaratan provided sustained pharmacodynamic responses that lasted over the duration of each dosing interval tested in the Phase 2a stage of our pediatric GHD Phase 1b/2a clinical trial: weekly, twice-monthly and monthly. In the Phase 2a stage, somavaratan dosed weekly, twice-monthly or monthly was demonstrated to have comparable safety and efficacy to daily rhGH at highest approved dose on the labels of Genotropin &#174; and Norditropin &#174; . After the first month and during six months of somavaratan treatment, there were no meaningful differences in successive IGF-I SDS peaks or troughs, indicating no accumulation of somavaratan and IGF-I and no decrease in IGF-I responses with repeat dosing at these intervals. Based on this data from the Phase 1b/2a trial, we were able to successfully develop and confirm a PK/PD model. This model enabled us to increase the dose of somavaratan to 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly in the second year of the Extension Study. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Somavaratan has demonstrated an attractive safety and tolerability profile in GHD children. In our clinical program to date, somavaratan has been found to be well tolerated with no serious or unexpected adverse events. In particular, lipoatrophy, a localized loss of fat tissue that can be stimulated by a sustained exposure of adipocytes to rhGH in the subcutaneous injection site, has not been seen after repeated doses with over two years of exposure in the Phase 2a stage of our Phase 1b/2a clinical trial or in the ongoing Extension Study. Additionally, there have been no reports in our clinical trials of somavaratan of common problems that were observed in prior studies of long-acting formulations, such as nodule formation at the injection site. In the Phase 1b/2a and ongoing Extension Study, somavaratan was found to be safe and well tolerated over two years of treatment exposure. The number of adverse events continued to decrease over the two years of therapy. Patients on the 2.5 mg/kg twice-monthly and 5.0 mg/kg monthly arms stayed on the same dose for Year 1 and in Year 2, all subjects were transitioned to receive 3.5 mg/kg somavaratan twice-monthly. All subjects in the weekly dosing cohort were transitioned to the higher dose at different points during the first six months of the Extension Study. All patients received the 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose in the second year of treatment, and there were no new adverse events or increases in adverse events. There has been no indication of accumulation of somavaratan and IGF-I and no decrease in IGF-I responses with repeat dosing at the 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose. In our Phase 3 clinical trial, somavaratan will be administered using a 30 gauge needle, which is comparable to the needle sizes typically used for daily rhGH products. At the pediatric Phase 3 dose of 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly, a majority of the patients will receive a single injection. The attractive safety and tolerability profile of somavaratan in GHD children is especially important in the context of rhGH as a chronic therapy. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Somavaratan has the potential to provide comparable efficacy to the highest approved dose on the labels of Genotropin &#174; and Norditropin &#174; . In the completed Phase 2a stage of our Phase 1b/2a clinical trial, we demonstrated that weekly, twice-monthly and monthly somavaratan dosing maintained mean IGF-I increases over baseline and within the lower part of the therapeutic range without IGF-I overexposure, confirming the PK/PD model developed from the Phase 1b stage of the study. We also demonstrated that six months of dosing of somavaratan, when given at weekly, twice-monthly and monthly intervals, achieves a mean annualized six month height velocity (which was the study&#8217;s primary endpoint) comparable to the annual height velocity for similar GHD children given at 34 &#181;g rhGH/kg/day, which is the dose commonly used in Europe and is the highest FDA approved dose on the labels of Genotropin &#174; and Norditropin &#174; . In the Extension Study to date, data are available for 57 pediatric GHD patients who have two years of continuous somavaratan dosing. During the Extension Study two dose groups of pediatric GHD patients were maintained on the 2.5 mg/kg twice-monthly or 5.0 mg/kg monthly dose from the Phase 2a stage until they had received 12 months of continuous treatment. Mean Year 1 height velocity in these patients was not significantly different from the mean annualized height velocity at earlier time points, and the anticipated decline in mean Year 2 height velocity was not observed with the increased 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly somavaratan dose. The results of the Extension Study to date have demonstrated a dose response in both IGF-I levels and height velocity supporting the selection of 3.5 mg/kg somavaratan twice-monthly as the pediatric Phase 3 dose. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Somavaratan has the potential to achieve greater height velocities compared to daily rhGH approved for use in Japanese GHD children. In Japan, children with GHD treated with daily rhGH receive the lowest dose of any developed country (the only approved dose in Japan is 25 &#181;g/kg/day). As a result, GHD children treated with rhGH in Japan have a lower rate of first-year growth than GHD children treated with rhGH at 43 &#181;g/kg/day in the United States. Despite the lower approved dose in Japan, the Japanese government pays a higher price per unit of rhGH and a similar price per patient as compared to pricing in the United States. We intend to select a dose of somavaratan for use in Japan that would provide first-year growth comparable to GHD children in the United States. As such, somavaratan may offer the opportunity to provide Japanese GHD children with height velocities comparable to GHD children in the United States, which would be superior efficacy to the current Japanese daily rhGH dose. We initiated a Phase 2/3 trial in Japan for children with GHD in April 2015. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Somavaratan has the potential to be dosed as a single monthly injection in GHD adults. The successful demonstration of monthly dosing in the pediatric Phase 1b/2a trial combined with the results of our completed Phase 1a trial in GHD adult s support the development of a monthly somavaratan dosing regimen in GHD adults. Currently, GHD adults receive daily rhGH injections and titrate their dose of rhGH in order to achieve IGF-I responses in the normal range. From our current knowledge of the P K/PD profile of somavaratan in GHD adults, we are able to develop dosing algorithms to improve our ability to titrate GHD adults to the appropriate monthly somavaratan dose to achieve IGF-I levels in the normal range leading to beneficial changes in body c omposition. Because GHD adults require significantly lower doses of rhGH or somavaratan than GHD children, we are able to dose GHD adults with the current somavaratan formulation once per month with a single injection using a 30 gauge needle. We initiated the Phase 2 trial, which we refer to as the VITAL trial, in September 2015. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Somavaratan has a manufacturing process that is less complex than the traditional rhGH manufacturing processes and may ultimately offer a cost-of-goods advantage versus current rhGH products. Somavaratan is expressed in E. coli as a soluble protein. The XTEN amino acid sequences fused to rhGH to form somavaratan confer improved pharmaceutical properties compared to rhGH alone, including greater solubility, a lower isoelectric point and a higher net negative charge. These improved properties enable a straightforward purification process without the need for complex steps that can reduce manufacturing yields, such as protein folding. The steps used in the process for manufacturing somavaratan drug substance all involve a common biotechnology manufacturing process. Somavaratan&#8217;s improved properties simplify the purification process compared to traditional rhGH products, and we believe that when produced on a commercial scale, it may offer a cost-of-goods advantage over current rhGH products. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Optimize somavaratan formulation and market opportunity. Based on the results of our phase 1b/2a clinical trial, the mean Year 2 height velocity and safety data reported from our ongoing Extension Study, and market research with physicians we believe our current 100 mg/mL formulation dosed twice-monthly at 3.5 mg/kg is very well positioned as our first long-acting entrant to the market. We continue to evaluate our product life cycle management strategy post our initial launch of somavaratan and have been working on a higher concentration formulation of somavaratan as a follow-on to our current 100 mg/mL formulation. A higher concentration formulation has the potential to offer a significant portion of pediatric patients an option for monthly dosing, possibly following a confirmatory trial. More importantly, a higher concentration formulation would facilitate clinical trials that could enable label expansion and reimbursement for additional indications that require higher doses than the labeled doses for pediatric GHD. The market opportunity in ISS, SGA and Turner Syndrome may be greater than the potential incremental market share gained in pediatric GHD with a monthly product. We will continue to evaluate and prioritize our product strategy and optimize this formulation so we can move forward with clinical trials following our planned BLA submission for somavaratan twice-monthly therapy in pediatric GHD. 

Clinical development for somavaratan 

The clinical development of somavaratan was initiated in December 2010 with an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application submitted by Versartis in the United States and a parallel submission of a Clinical Trial Application in the United Kingdom. Additional submissions were provided to the Swedish and Serbian regulatory authorities. The first in-human study, our Phase 1a clinical trial, was conducted in GHD adults in the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Serbia. The Phase 1a clinical trial enrolled patients on a stable dose of daily rhGH therapy who were withdrawn from therapy until their IGF-I levels were below a pre-specified level and then randomized into either placebo or somavaratan treatment. This double blind placebo controlled Phase 1a clinical trial enabled the objective assessment of the safety of somavaratan treatment compared to placebo. The Phase 1a clinical trial was completed in early 2012. 

Upon the successful completion of the Phase 1a clinical trial, we initiated a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in GHD children in the United States by filing an amendment to our existing IND. The Phase 1b stage of the clinical trial included 48 na&#239;ve to treatment pre-pubertal GHD children receiving a single dose of somavaratan in an ascending dose design. The starting dose used in the study was the highest dose tested in adults (0.80 mg/kg somavaratan) and escalation was stopped at a dose of 6.0 mg/kg somavaratan after the desired IGF-I response was achieved. No stopping criteria were met at any of the dose levels tested. Patients completing the Phase 1b stage of the study were allowed to enroll in the Phase 2a stage. The Phase 2a stage was fully enrolled with 64 patients, and patients previously treated in the Phase 1b stage were balanced for characteristics (age and previous somavaratan exposure) with the potential to affect the primary endpoint (mean height velocity) across each of the three dosing arms. 

&#160;

Completed Phase 1a clinical trial in GHD adults 

In adult GHD patients, somavaratan concentrations and IGF-I responses were proportional to dose in the completed Phase 1a single ascending dose study. In adults with GHD, somavaratan has a mean elimination half-life of 131 hours at the highest dose tested. The extended half-life of somavaratan represents at least a thirty-fold increase in half-life as compared to the two to four hour half-lives reported for subcutaneously administered rhGH. Somavaratan concentrations at the end of the month in this study were proportional to total dose, further supporting the potential for up to monthly dosing. 

&#160;

After a single subcutaneous dose of 0.80 mg/kg of somavaratan, GHD adults achieved a normalization of their IGF-I levels (IGF-I standard deviation score (SDS) between -1.5 and +1.5) for an average of three weeks. IGF-I SDS is a measure of the difference in IGF-I concentration between a single GHD patient and the mean for normal adults of the same sex and comparable age. These results suggested that a lower total rhGH dose in the form of somavaratan may provide comparable safety and efficacy over the course of treatment. 

&#160;

&#160;

All subjects completed the study. The highest dose assessed in the Phase 1a study of GHD adults (0.80 mg/kg somavaratan) was reported to be well tolerated, with no significant safety issues observed. A minority of patients reported drug-related adverse events, or AEs. The reported AEs were generally mild, transient and of the type generally expected when rhGH is administered to an adult with GHD. There were no serious or unexpected AEs. There were no laboratory safety signals observed. In addition, somavaratan at 0.80 mg/kg in GHD adults increased mean IGF-I into the customary therapeutic range (IGF-I SDS &#62; - 1.5) for approximately three weeks. GHD adults are typically titrated with daily rhGH to achieve an IGF-I SDS in the normal range. In addition, the dose of rhGH required to achieve normalization of IGF-I is dependent upon the patient&#8217;s age and sex. Unlike the above single ascending dose study, the Phase 2/3 registration trial of somavaratan in GHD adults will include stratification for age and sex. PK/PD modeling was performed using the Phase 1a results, and this model enables the development of dosing algorithms for patients based upon their age and sex. The Phase 2/3 trial is designed to demonstrate a safe and effective once monthly dose of somavaratan as a single injection with a 30 gauge needle in GHD adults. 

&#160;

Completed Phase 1b stage of the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in GHD children 

GHD children require a much higher dose of daily administered rhGH (25 - 43 &#181;g/kg/day) than GHD adults (2 - 12 &#181;g/kg). The dosing recommendation for rhGH in GHD children is dependent upon the local regulatory agency granting the drug approval. It was therefore likely that a higher dose of somavaratan would be required in GHD children compared to GHD adults. 

A Phase1b/2a study was conducted in pre-pubertal GHD children in the United States to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, and IGF-I responses to somavaratan in the Phase 1b stage. We enrolled pre-pubertal na&#239;ve to treatment patients who were representative of a typical moderate GHD patient population treated with growth hormone therapy in the United States and parts of Europe where GHD is diagnosed and routinely treated. The mean age was seven to eight years old, with a mean height standard deviation score of minus 2.5, a mean bone age delay of one to one and a half years and a mean growth hormone stimulation test result of 5 ng/mL. Age, height standard deviation score and growth hormone stimulation test result have the greatest impact on response to rhGH therapy. When starting rhGH therapy, younger children grow faster than older children and more severe GHD patients, e.g. those with lower height standard deviation scores and/or lower growth hormone stimulation test results, grow faster than moderate GHD patients. Comparisons across pediatric GHD studies can only be done if these key attributes are similar. 

In the Phase 1b stage, 48 pre-pubertal, na&#239;ve to treatment children received a single subcutaneous dose of somavaratan. GHD was diagnosed by medical history, several clinical parameters and paired growth hormone stimulation tests. In ascending order, subjects received somavaratan doses of 0.80, 1.20, 1.80, 2.70, 4.00 or 6.00 mg/kg. Blood samples for PK/PD determinations were obtained at six time points over 30 days. Safety monitoring was carried out for 60 days post-dose. Stopping rules were specified by protocol. The membership and activities of the Safety Review Committee, or SRC, were specified in the SRC Charter, which was developed prior to study onset. SRC meetings were successfully concluded prior to each dose escalation; no stopping criteria were met at any time point. 

In GHD children, single dose somavaratan over the specified dose range was reported to be well tolerated, with no significant safety issues observed. All subjects completed the study. A minority of subjects reported drug-related AEs. Reported AEs were mild, transient and of the type generally observed when starting rhGH in children. No serious or unexpected AEs were reported. There were no laboratory safety signals observed. Subcutaneous nodule formation and lipoatrophy were not reported. 

After subcutaneous administration to GHD children, somavaratan is rapidly absorbed achieving a maximum concentration (C max ) in three to four days after dosing, similar to that noted in GHD adults. The total exposure and C max were dose proportional and not dependent upon gender in this patient population. Because sparse blood sampling is used in small children, the number of time points did not allow for an accurate determination of the terminal elimination half-life. However, as noted in GHD adults, significant concentrations of somavaratan remained 30 days after injection. 

Somavaratan Plasma Concentration (ng/ml) 

&#160;

&#160;

IGF-I was selected as the primary pharmacodynamic marker to measure the effect of somavaratan treatment. The therapeutic range for IGF-I in children varies greatly with age, with mean values more than doubling during childhood. IGF-I SDS is determined based on comparison to children of the same age. All subjects had relative IGF-I deficiency at baseline (IGF-I SDS &#60; -1.0) and the increase from baselin e in the 30 day average IGF-I SDS was proportional to dose. In Phase 1b, only two subjects had an IGF-I level above the therapeutic range (IGF-I SDS &#62; 2.0) and no subjects had an IGF-I SDS &#179; 3.0. The two subjects with IGF-I SDS &#62; 2.0 had IGF-I SDS values in the therapeutic range by the next sampling time point. No reported safety issues arose in connection with these transient elevations. Sustained IGF-I SDS changes did not come at the expense of initial elevated exposure to IGF-I. These PK/PD data from th e Phase 1b stage were used to develop a model correlating the somavaratan exposure to the average increase in IGF-I. The PK/PD model allowed for the selection of doses and regimens for the Phase 2a stage with the objective of increasing the average IGF-I l evels into the therapeutic range. 

&#160;

&#160;

Completed Phase 2a stage of the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial 

The Phase 2a stage of the Phase 1b/2a study has been completed and enrolled 64 na&#239;ve to treatment pre-pubertal GHD children into three dosing arms based upon the PK/PD model from the Phase 1b stage: 5 mg/kg somavaratan once per month, 2.5 mg/kg somavaratan twice-monthly and 1.15 mg/kg somavaratan weekly. Per protocol, upon completion of three months of treatment in 75% of the subjects in the Phase 2a stage of the trial, the SRC met and reviewed the safety of repeat dosing of somavaratan in GHD children in this study. The SRC agreed that it was safe to continue the study and no stopping criteria were met. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2a stage was mean six month height velocity. 

&#160;

Over the six months of treatment with somavaratan in the Phase 2a stage of the study, somavaratan was found to be safe and well tolerated in these pre-pubertal GHD children. There were no related serious adverse events or unexpect ed adverse events. Other related adverse events were primarily mild and transient and of the type expected when rhGH is initiated in children na&#239;ve to rhGH treatment. With more than 1,300 injections administered in the Phase 2a stage, discomfort at injecti on sites was reported in the minority of patients and was mild and transient. Nodule formation or lipoatrophy was not observed at injection sites. 

In all three dose groups, somavaratan maintained mean IGF-I increases over baseline and within the lower part of the therapeutic range without IGF-I overexposure when given at weekly, twice-monthly and monthly intervals, confirming the PK/PD model developed from the Phase 1b stage of the study. Only five subjects had transient IGF-I SDS values greater than 2.0, all in the 5.0 mg/kg monthly dose groups and there were no IGF-I SDS values above 3.0. 

In addition, we demonstrated that six months of dosing of somavaratan, when given at weekly, twice-monthly and monthly intervals, achieved mean annualized six month height velocities (which was the study&#8217;s primary endpoint) comparable to the mean annual height velocity for similar GHD children given a dose of daily rhGH that is the highest approved dose on the labels of Genotropin &#174; and Norditropin &#174; . More specifically, the mean annualized height velocity results were compared to age-matched, historical controls of mean Year 1 height velocity from the Pfizer (Kabi) International Growth Study database, or KIGS database as published by Ranke and Lindberg. Using this analysis for the 64 patients enrolled in the Phase 2a stage, the weekly arm had a mean annualized height velocity of 7.6 cm/yr compared to 8.4 cm/yr in a historical control, the twice-monthly arm had a mean annualized height velocity of 8.6 cm/yr compared to 8.3 cm/yr in historical controls and the monthly arm had a mean annualized height velocity of 7.9 cm/yr compared to 8.3 cm/yr in historical controls. There was not a statistically significant difference in height velocity between any of the three dosing frequencies tested. 

The results from the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial were published online in the Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism in December of 2015. 

Correlation of three, six and twelve month mean height velocity 

For daily rhGH treatment, height velocity changes as a function of time spent on therapy. In a published study of Omnitrope &#174; and Genotropin &#174; , patients were dosed with rhGH over a seven-year period. Patients on Genotropin &#174; were switched to Omnitrope &#174; after nine months of treatment (Geno/Omnitrope Group B). As shown in the chart below, initially, GHD children experience rapid catch-up growth in the first one to three years of treatment and then the rate of growth slows down approaching normal growth rates observed in children that do not have GHD. 

&#160;

The correlations between cumulative intervals of mean height velocity measurements have been noted in a variety of studies of daily rhGH therapy and one long-acting rhGH therapy, Nutropin Depot. For example, the mean height velocity in a treatment group over three months is well correlated to the mean height velocity in the same group over six months. Daily rhGH therapy studies have been conducted in pediatric GHD patients, measuring the mean height velocity at three, six and twelve months. These studies indicate an average decrease in the mean height velocity of 0.3 cm/yr from three months to six months and an additional decrease of 0.6 cm/yr from six months to twelve months. 

&#160;

The mean height velocity obtained in a controlled clinical trial is h ighly dependent on the demographics of the pediatric GHD patients enrolled in the clinical trial. The most significant factor determining a mean height velocity in na&#239;ve to treatment pre-pubertal GHD patients is the patient&#8217;s age at start of treatment. Oth er factors that may influence the extent of response to daily rhGH therapy include the degree of height deficit for age and the peak hGH level achieved in the hGH stimulation test, both of which assess the severity of GHD. In historical published studies c onducted in countries where rhGH therapy is unavailable or unaffordable, pre-pubertal GHD patients were more severely GHD than age matched peers in the United States, and therefore, greater mean height velocities were observed in these patients compared to their age-matched counterparts in the United States. 

In published registries of daily rhGH therapy from patients in the United States and European countries where daily rhGH therapy is used, the mean height velocity is a reliable surrogate for expected outcomes in a controlled clinical trial using a comparable daily rhGH dose as used in these registries. As a result, an age-matched historical control analysis using published registry data on first year mean height velocities for daily rhGH therapy in pre-pubertal GHD children is a well-established procedure for assessment of new rhGH therapies. In fact, the FDA allowed the Nutropin Depot Phase 3 trial to be conducted using age-matched historical controls. Genentech conducted a number of controlled clinical studies of daily rhGH in the 1980s and 1990s. These studies demonstrated a clear dose-response relationship between the daily rhGH dose and the first year height velocity in pre-pubertal na&#239;ve to treatment moderate GHD patients in the United States. Using this dose response relationship, we note that somavaratan dosed at 2.5 mg/kg twice-monthly provides comparable first year growth rate to the highest approved dose on the labels of Genotropin &#174; and Norditropin &#174; , 34 &#181;g/kg/day. 

Ongoing Extension Study in pediatric GHD patients 

Upon completion of the Phase 2a stage of the trial, we offered patients the opportunity to participate in the Extension Study and to continue with somavaratan treatment. Approximately 95% of the patients completing the Phase 2a stage elected to participate in the Extension Study. As of December 2015 data were available for 57 patients during their second year of treatment. 

Based on our PK/PD model and growth and IGF-I results in our Phase 2a study, we increased the dose to 3.5 mg/kg initially in the patients receiving 1.15 mg/kg weekly between months 6-12 of exposure and in the monthly and twice-monthly arms at the Year 1 time point. In the Phase 2a stage and continuing in the Extension Study, pediatric GHD patients who initially received the 2.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose of somavaratan experienced an IGF-I response in the lower part of the therapeutic range similar to that typically achieved from standard European dose of 34 &#181;g/kg/day dose of rhGH. 

Two dose groups of pediatric GHD patients, 2.5 mg/kg twice-monthly and 5.0 mg/kg monthly, from the Phase 2a stage were maintained on the same somavaratan dose and regimen until they had received 12 months of continuous treatment and then received the increased 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose in months 12-24. As shown in the chart below, mean Year 1 and Year 2 height velocities in these patients were not significantly different from the mean annualized height velocity at earlier time points. Typically, based on observations from existing approved daily rhGH therapies, a decrease in mean height velocity in the second year of treatment would be expected with daily rhGH therapy.

For patients initially on 5.0 mg/kg monthly in Year 1 and subsequently switched to 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly in Year 2, mean height velocity was 7.96 and 8.27 cm/year in Year 1 and Year 2, respectively. For patients initially on 2.5 mg/kg twice-monthly in Year 1 and subsequently switched to 3.5 mg/kg twice monthly in Year 2, mean height velocity was 8.49 and 8.22 cm/year in Year 1 and Year 2, respectively. For all 57 subjects with growth measurements in Year 2, height velocity was maintained with minimal change (8.08 vs. 7.83 cm/year in Year 1 vs. Year 2, respectively). 

&#160;

Comparing these data to referen ce points in two of the large registry databases of daily GHD patients, the NCGS and KIGS databases. the mean height velocities for daily rhGH therapy in an approximately 8-year old moderate GHD child range from about 6.9 cm in the second year on the 34 ug /kg/day European dose (and highest U.S. Labeled dose for Norditropin and Genotropin) to approximately 7.9 cm in the second year when dosed at the higher 43 ug/kg/day, which is in line with the dose typically used in the United States . 

&#160;

&#160;

The percentage of subjects experiencing related AEs in Year 2 continued to decline, and events in general were mild and transient. No new types of related AEs appeared during Year 2. 

Through two years of somavaratan treatment, twice-monthly somavaratan treatment maintained IGF-I in the normal range without overexposure and provided continuing catch-up growth. No new types of related AEs and no long-term safety events were observed in Year 2. An increase in somavaratan dose to 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly has maintained height velocity in Year 2 to a level similar to that reported from the NCGS database for similar aged patients in their second year of therapy with a daily regimen at the standard U.S. dose. 

&#160;

Studies have demonstrated that full adherence with dai ly growth hormone therapy presents challenges for patients and caregivers, with up-to two-thirds being non-adherent with their dosing schedule. In additional studies, one third to three quarters of children had levels of nonadherence that can be estimated to have reduced efficacy as measured by height velocity. We believe a longer-acting form of growth hormone with reduced injection frequency may lead to increased treatment adherence, and in turn, to better outcomes. Throughout the Extension Study, somavara tan dosing was conducted in a real-world setting with all dosing events completed at home using a vial and syringe. Injections were delivered by either the subjects themselves or their caregiver, the child&#8217;s parents in most cases. When comparing the number of expected somavaratan injections to those completed during the Extension Study Period, adherence to the dosing schedule was nearly 100%. 

The two-year data of somavaratan in pediatric growth hormone deficiency demonstrates that somavaratan was well tolerated with no safety signals over two years. The study discontinuation rate was in line with expectations after two years of ongoing treatment. Adherence to the dosing schedule was nearly 100% through 18-months of at-home treatment, which supports twice-monthly dosing. The mean Year 2 height velocity for somavaratan is comparable to U.S. daily dosing data from the NCGS database. There was no decline in somavaratan&#8217;s mean Year 2 height velocity with the increased 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose. Declines in height velocity are often seen in the second year of daily dosing. The results of the Extension Study to date have demonstrated a dose response in both IGF-I levels and height velocity supporting the selection of the 3.5 mg/kg somavaratan twice-monthly as the Phase 3 dose. To date, the 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose of somavaratan has been found to be safe and well tolerated with only a few mild transient adverse events in a minority of the patients.

All patients completing the Phase 3 clinical trial, including those receiving daily rhGH therapy, will be offered the opportunity for treatment with the 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose of somavaratan in the Extension Study until market approval. These patients could potentially provide data to support the safety of switching patients from daily rhGH to somavaratan therapy. The Extension Study may enroll up to 250 GHD children, and we anticipate that it will continue until any potential product launch of somavaratan, with patients receiving up to three or four years of somavaratan therapy. This study could potentially provide long term safety and efficacy data in support of any application for global market registration. 

Pediatric GHD Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States, Europe and Canada 

In early 2015, we initiated a multicenter, randomized, open-label non-inferiority Phase 3 trial, which we refer to as the VELOCITY study, comparing the safety and efficacy of somavaratan to daily rhGH in children with growth failure due to GHD. We have met with the FDA and corresponded with the EMA to develop our Phase 3 registration study for pediatric GHD. The study will take place in approximately 70 pediatric endocrinology centers in the United States, Europe and Canada using nearly identical inclusion and exclusion criteria to the Phase 2a stage of our Phase 1b/2a study and is expected to enroll comparable pre-pubertal na&#239;ve to treatment pediatric GHD patients. We expect to enroll up to 136 patients in a 3:1 randomization comparing 3.5 mg/kg twice-monthly dose of somavaratan to 34 &#181;g/kg/day of rhGH, which is the highest approved dose on the labels of Genotropin &#174; and Norditropin &#174; . Somavaratan will be administered utilizing a 30 gauge needle, which is comparable to the needle sizes typically used for daily rhGH products. A majority of patients will receive a single injection per dose. The primary endpoint for the study is non-inferiority between the two treatment groups based upon mean Year 1 height velocity results. We anticipate completing enrollment in mid-2016 and top-line data availability in mid-2017 to enable filing for marketing authorization in the United States, Europe and Canada. Assuming positive results from this Phase 3 study, we intend to file a BLA with the FDA, a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, with the EMA, and a New Drug Submission, or NDS with Health Canada. 

Pediatric GHD Phase 2/3 clinical trial in Japan 

We submitted to the PMDA the agreed upon protocol for the pediatric GHD Phase 2/3 trial, received a completed Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN, and initiated the Phase 2/3 trial in April 2015. In the Phase 2 stage of this study, up to 24 pre-pubertal na&#239;ve to treatment GHD children will be enrolled and administered a single dose of somavaratan using a 30 gauge needle at one of three dose levels used in the completed Phase 1b stage of the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial conducted in U.S. GHD children. The PK/PD data from these Japanese GHD children will be compared to the PK/PD data from the U.S. GHD children administered the same dose of somavaratan. Once the PK/PD results are confirmed to be comparable between Japanese and U.S. GHD children, the Phase 3 stage of the study will begin and will be a single arm study evaluating 3.5 mg/kg somavaratan twice-monthly in 48 GHD children. Somavaratan will be administered utilizing a 30 gauge needle, and a majority of patients will receive only a single injection per dose. Patients enrolled in the Phase 2 stage will be eligible to continue in the Phase 3 stage. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2/3 study is mean Year 1 height velocity compared to historical controls. In addition, an Extension Study will be conducted in Japan to allow Phase 2/3 patients the option to continue treatment with somavaratan for long-term safety and to obtain additional information on switching current daily rhGH treated GHD children to somavaratan therapy. We have initiated clinical sites in Japan and are currently enrolling pre-pubertal na&#239;ve to treatment GHD children. The results of the Phase 2/3 study and the Extension Study in Japan will be combined with the pediatric GHD Phase 3 trial and Extension Study in the United States, Europe and Canada to support the submission of a Japan New Drug Application, or JNDA. 

&#160;

Adult GHD Phase 2 clinical trial 

Adult GHD patients receive daily rhGH therapy at doses that are titrated to enable them to reach the normal range of IGF-I levels for their age and sex. The daily rhGH dose used in adult GHD patients ranges from 2 to 12 &#181;g/kg/day. In our completed Phase 1a clinical trial in adult GHD patients, we demonstrated the potential for monthly dosing. We believe that over half of the adults diagnosed with GHD either refuse therapy or stop therapy due to the burden of daily injections. Reducing the dosing frequency from daily to monthly may increase adherence and maintain more patients on long-term therapy. Previous approvals of rhGH therapy for adult GHD patients required a primary endpoint of change in body composition (e.g., reduction in fat mass or truncal fat) compared to placebo. 

In September of 2015 we initiated a Phase 2 trial, known as the VITAL trial, of somavaratan in adults with GHD. The adult Phase 2 VITAL trial is a dose-finding, safety study to evaluate a monthly somavaratan dosing regimen in adults with GHD. This trial is an open-label, international, multicenter study with somavaratan treatment for five months. This treatment period includes monthly dose titrations until a subject's mean IGF-I SDS value is within a target range for two consecutive months. Subjects are stratified into three cohorts based on age, gender and the use of oral estrogens. This study is being conducted in the United States, Western Europe, Canada and Australia, and we are currently enrolling patients. We believe that monthly somavaratan dosing in GHD adults would offer a significant advantage in convenience and adherence over the weekly rhGH products in clinical development by other companies. Somavaratan will be dosed once a month as a single injection using a 30 gauge needle in this Phase 2 study of GHD adults. Following results from this Phase 2 trial, we will initiate a Phase 3 registration trial. An adult extension study was initiated in January 2016 to allow ongoing treatment of patients in the Phase 2 or Phase 3 trials. 

rhGH market opportunity 

The global rhGH market has largely been confined to the developed parts of the world, more particularly the United States, Europe and Japan. In 2014 the global rhGH market was estimated to be over $3 billion in annual sales, with the United States, Europe, Japan and Rest-of-World representing approximately 40%, 35%, 20% and 5% of the market, respectively. Global annual rhGH sales have historically grown each year, and based on market research, we believe that the market for daily rhGH products may continue to grow up to $4 billion following the launch of long-acting rhGH therapies. 

As shown on the chart below, due to the lack of product differentiation among existing rhGH treatments, the global rhGH market is quite fragmented, with no brand achieving greater than 33% market share in 2014. 

&#160;

&#160;

Importantly, rhGH manufacturers have attempted to develop a long-acting product using microsphere, PEGylation, fusion and alternative delivery technologies. Each of these approaches has been unsuccessful due to regulatory, safety, efficacy or manufacturing issues, or a combination thereof. Nonetheless, primary and secondary market research continues to indicate a strong desire by patients, caregivers, physicians and payers to use an rhGH product that is safe and effective and requires less frequent dosing t han daily subcutaneous injections. 

Pediatric GHD market 

Historically pediatric GHD use has dominated the rhGH market, accounting for approximately 50% of total annual sales. Of the over $3 billion global rhGH market, we believe that sales of rhGH products for pediatric GHD represent approximately $1.5 billion. We believe the United States and European markets for rhGH for pediatric GHD are approximately $500 million and $550 million, respectively. We believe that the Japanese market for rhGH for pediatric GHD is approximately $500 million, representing approximately one third of the global market of rhGH products for treatment of pediatric GHD. 

Based on market research, we believe that the market for daily rhGH products can continue to grow up to $4 billion following the launch of long-acting rhGH therapies. Based on this research and assuming that the pediatric GHD market continues to constitute 50% of the total market, we believe that the pediatric GHD market could represent approximately $2 billion by 2018. 

Adult GHD market 

Treatment of GHD in adults was a natural expansion to the products already indicated for treating the same condition in children. Several studies were conducted in this area during the 1990s and many companies publicized their findings with respect to the effect of hormonal deficiency in adults on their quality of life during this period. Many adult patients face significant problems such as minimized social, mental and physical energy, reduced muscle and excess adipose tissues, reduced libido, elevated levels of cholesterol, higher cardiovascular disease rates, reduced quality of life and lower bone density. 

We believe the adult GHD market is currently underpenetrated, yet it reached approximately $400 million in sales globally in 2014. Despite its current size, the adult GHD market remains largely untreated, making this population of patients with significant unmet needs an attractive additional indication for somavaratan. We believe that a therapy with more convenient dosing will expand the adult GHD market by encouraging patients not currently receiving rhGH therapy to seek treatment, as well as enhancing adherence among patients currently receiving daily therapy. 

Future market expansion opportunities for somavaratan 

Daily rhGH therapy is also currently approved for numerous other indications beyond GHD. More specifically, other indications currently approved in the United States for daily rhGH therapy include ISS, Turner Syndrome, Prader-Willi Syndrome, SGA, Noonan Syndrome and chronic renal insufficiency in children. ISS, SGA and Turner Syndrome comprise significant segments of the rhGH market and are likely potential indications for future somavaratan clinical development. ISS is non-GHD short stature, defined by height that is more than two standard deviations below normal and growth rates that would not allow for attainment of adult height in the normal range, which has recognized benefits from rhGH therapy. In the United States only, ISS is an indication that is approved for rhGH therapy at 1.5 to 2 times higher doses than pediatric GHD. SGA is defined by newborns with birthweights below the 10th percentile for infants of the same gestational age. SGA is an approved indication for rhGH products at approximately twice the dose of pediatric GHD. Turner Syndrome is the second most common genetic disorder, affecting 1 in 2,000 females. Short stature associated with Turner Syndrome is an approved indication for rhGH products. The rhGH dose required to treat short stature in Turner Syndrome patients is greater than the dose required for pediatric GHD patients. We may explore somavaratan, or a higher concentration formulation of somavaratan in further clinical trials to assess the appropriate dose of somavaratan to achieve similar treatment outcomes to current daily rhGH therapy for ISS, SGA and Turner Syndrome. 

Commercialization strategy 

Industry research published in 2008 indicated that less than 36% of patients on treatment with rhGH therapy are compliant, resulting in some level of noncompliance in the majority of patients. In separately published research released in 2011, a lack of compliance to daily rhGH therapy results in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Market research indicates that frequency of administration ranks highest amongst the factors that affect adherence to this daily rhGH treatment. Our own market research indicates that the potential for somavaratan to reduce the treatment burden of daily injections and thereby address the lack of compliance with their rhGH therapy will be of significant interest to pediatric endocrinologists. Based on a third-party market research report commissioned by us, a survey of 68 U.S. pediatric endocrinologists indicated a high level of interest in the profile of somavaratan and a willingness to prescribe it to a majority of their patients if it is approved. 

&#160;

In light of our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We generally expect to retain commercial rights for our prod ucts in territories where we believe it is possible to access the market through a focused, specialty sales force. If somavaratan receives marketing approval, we plan to commercialize in the United States and Canada with our own focused, specialty sales fo rce. We believe that the pediatric endocrinologists in the United States, who provide treatment for hGH deficiency in children, are sufficiently concentrated that we will be able to effectively promote somavaratan to these specialists with a sales force of approximately 50 people. According to data published by the Journal of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Endocrine Society, there are approximately 800 pediatric endocrinologists in the United States. Similarly sized sales forces are effectively being utilized to address these pediatric endocrinologists and focus on the currently high-prescribing physicians, according to primary market research conducted by a third-party market research organization commissioned by us. 

Manufacturing 

We do not own or operate facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing nor do we expect to in the future. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on Boehringer Ingelheim, or BI, for the manufacture of our drug substance and drug product for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidate receives marketing approval. Additional contract manufacturers are used to label, package and distribute investigational drug product. We have experienced personnel to manage the third-party manufacturers. 

We have an agreement with BI for the production of somavaratan drug substance and drug product for our clinical trials. Under the agreement, we transferred our initial manufacturing process for somavaratan, including the expressing cell line, to BI for further development, and BI will manufacture and supply somavaratan to us for use in clinical trials, all in accordance with the project plan attached to the agreement. The agreement contains customary terms, such as delivery, inspection, acceptance and rejection, for the supply of the product. We have the right to cancel any manufacturing campaign for somavaratan subject to the payment of a cancellation fee, which is a percentage of the total payment for the cancelled manufacturing campaign based on the time of cancellation. We have no exclusive relationship with BI for supply of our clinical materials. The agreement does not give BI any rights for commercial supply of somavaratan. 

As of December 31, 2015, BI manufactures multiple approved therapeutic proteins that are expressed in E. coli . Somavaratan is expressed in E. coli as a soluble protein. The XTEN sequences in somavaratan confer improved pharmaceutical properties compared to rhGH alone. These properties include increased solubility and high net negative charge (low isoelectric point) at physiological pH enabling a straightforward purification process without the need for complex steps such as protein folding. The process for manufacturing somavaratan drug substance consists of E. coli fermentation, initial purification to remove the majority of the E. coli components, secondary purification using three column chromatography steps and a final buffer exchange and concentration step. Because somavaratan consists of rhGH genetically fused to XTEN, no additional steps to chemically modify the protein are required after the drug substance is produced. The somavaratan drug substance is filtered and then somavaratan drug product filling, labeling, packaging and testing is performed. Each of these steps involves a relatively common biotechnology process. The manufacturing process for somavaratan is less complex than traditional rhGH manufacturing processes. The process is robust and reproducible, does not require specialized equipment, uses common and readily available materials and is readily transferable. The pharmaceutical properties of somavaratan enable increased solubility compared to rhGH and increased stability due to the ability to reduce or eliminate the major degradation pathways typically observed in rhGH products. Somavaratan drug product is a stable liquid formulation stored refrigerated with short term stability at room temperature. We have contracted with Catalent, Inc. for the labeling, packaging and distribution of somavaratan drug product for our clinical trials. 

Under our agreement with BI, we obtain supplies and services on a purchase order basis from BI. The agreement may be terminated by either party for convenience upon 18 months&#8217; notice or earlier for certain scientific or technical reasons, material breach, bankruptcy, change of control or other business reasons. The somavaratan used in our clinical trials was and is currently manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, conditions. Sufficient material produced using the commercial process to complete the Phase 3 trial and Extension Study has already been produced, and preparations are underway to produce quantities required for our anticipated subsequent clinical trials. We expect that cost-of-goods-sold of somavaratan will generally be less than that of other rhGH products. Changes in our requirements may require revalidation of the manufacturing process at a different scale and potentially at a different contractor depending on the necessary scale, infrastructure and technical capabilities. To ensure continuity in our supply chain, we plan to establish supply arrangements with alternative suppliers for certain portions of our supply chain, as appropriate. 

The agreement assigns to us the ownership of all inventions and intellectual properties generated by BI that relate directly to somavaratan and does not cover BI&#8217;s background intellectual properties or improvements. In addition, upon expiration of the agreement or termination of the agreement by either party for convenience, or by us for business reasons or for BI&#8217;s material breach, the agreement grants us a non-exclusive and royalty free license to use BI&#8217;s background intellectual properties to the extent necessary for us to manufacture, use and exploit somavaratan. Upon termination of the agreement (other than for our breach or bankruptcy or technical reasons), BI will transfer to us the then-current manufacturing process for somavaratan, with the cost borne by us. 

&#160;

Research and development 

We are evaluating the use of the XTEN technology on another therapeutic protein. We have initiated testing of this additional product candidate in animals. We plan to demonstrate proof of concept in the appropriate animal models and assess the potentially differentiated product attributes that could provide us with a superior product candidate to the current therapeutic protein. We will explore whether to proceed, and the optimal development path and product profile, upon obtaining the validating preclinical data. 

Competition 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 

The key competitive factors affecting the success of somavaratan, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, tolerability, frequency and route of administration, convenience and price, and the level of generic competition and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. The method of administration of somavaratan, subcutaneous injection, is commonly used to administer rhGH therapy for the treatment of GHD and related indications. While daily rhGH therapy with subcutaneous injections is required for replacement therapy, a therapy that offers a less invasive method of administration might have a competitive advantage over one administered by subcutaneous injection, depending on the relative efficacy, safety and tolerability of the other method of administration. 

In the United States, there are a variety of currently marketed rhGH therapies administered by daily subcutaneous injection and used for the treatment of GHD, principally Norditropin&#174; (Novo Nordisk), Humatrope&#174; (Eli Lilly), Nutropin-AQ&#174; (Roche/Genentech), Genotropin&#174; (Pfizer), Saizen&#174; (Merck Serono), ZomactonTM (Ferring Pharmaceuticals), Omnitrope&#174; (Sandoz GmbH) and Valtropin&#174; (LG Life Science). These rhGH drugs, with the exception of Valtropin&#174;, are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients, caregivers, third-party payors and pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, as the standard of care for the treatment of GHD. Physicians, patients, third-party payors and PBMs may not accept the addition of somavaratan to their current treatment regimens for a variety of potential reasons, including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

if they do not wish to incur any potential additional costs related to somavaratan; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

if they perceive the use of somavaratan to be of limited additional benefit to patients. 

In addition to the currently approved and marketed daily rhGH therapies, there are a variety of experimental therapies that are in various stages of clinical development by companies both already participating in the rhGH market as well as potential new entrants, principally Althea, Ambrx, Ascendis, Bioton S.A., Critical Pharmaceuticals, Dong-A, GeneScience, Hanmi, LG Life Science, OPKO Health, Inc. (via Prolor acquisition) and all of the existing global and regional rhGH franchises. However, based on publicly available data, these products have limitations. For example, an alternative PEGylation approach of reversible chemical linkage of rhGH to a large circulating PEG, which has not completed studies in GHD children, has reported adult data suggesting that the rhGH exposure and IGF-I response is less than one week. We believe all of the PEGylation and circulating PEG approaches will be more expensive to manufacture than current daily rhGH because they require additional manufacturing steps after the purified rhGH is produced. It is also unclear whether or not chronic administration of PEG will be safe because it was recently reported by one company that their PEGylated rhGH product candidate caused vacuoles to form in the brains of monkeys and published reports have indicated vacuole formation in the kidneys of rats upon chronic dosing of PEGylated proteins. A fusion protein approach is also under investigation using a glycosylated peptide hormone genetically fused to rhGH. Because of the glycosylation, this protein must be produced in mammalian cells, and a six step purification process has been reported. In addition, this fusion protein has been reported to have an rhGH exposure and IGF-I response of less than one week. This fusion protein is currently being studied in adult GHD Phase 3 clinical trial with weekly administration and in a Phase 2 clinical trial in children with weekly administration. Limited safety data is publicly available on this fusion protein. 

Intellectual property 

Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our core technology. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights. 

&#160;

In December 2008 we entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement with Amunix, which was amended and resta ted in December 2010 and subsequently amended in January 2013 and February 2014. The patents in-licensed under this agreement constitute the core of our intellectual property. The terms of this license are summarized below. 

As of February 29, 2016, the in-licensed global patent portfolio consists of eight granted U.S. patents, one patent granted by the European Patent Office, one patent granted by the Eurasian Patent Office, one granted patent in Japan, three granted patents in New Zealand, three granted patents in Australia, two granted patents in South Africa, one granted patent in China, one granted patent in Hong Kong, one granted patent in South Korea, and two granted patents in Mexico. In addition, the portfolio includes approximately 75 pending patent applications, six of which are in the United States. 

The in-licensed patent portfolio includes five main patent families, which we believe, if issued in their current form, would provide broad coverage for the XTEN (unstructured recombinant polypeptide, URP) technology, including methods for producing XTEN products, and various levels of more specific coverage for somavaratan. The portfolio includes composition of matter, method of treatment and use claims. 

The U.S. patents that have issued as of February 29, 2016 are U.S. Patent Nos. 7,846,445, 7,855,279, 8,492,530, 8,673,860, 8,680,050, 8,703,717, 8,933,197 and 9,168,312. U.S. Patent Nos. 7,855,279 and 8,492,530 cover XTEN (URP) fusion proteins with increased half-life, including dependent claims directed to hGH-XTEN fusions. U.S. Patent No. 7,846,445 covers methods for extending the serum secretion half-life of a protein by producing XTEN fusions, including that of hGH. We estimate that these issued U.S. patents will expire between 2026 and 2027. In addition, U.S. Patent Nos. 8,673,860, 8,703,717, 8,680,050, 8,933,197 and 9,168,312 were granted in 2014 and 2015 covering XTEN fusions of biologically active proteins, including hGH, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising such fusions, as well as methods for treating growth hormone-related conditions, such as GHD and ISS. We estimate that these issued U.S. Patents will expire between 2027 and 2032. The granted European patent is currently being opposed by Novo Nordisk A/S. See &#8220;Risk factors&#8212;Risks related to intellectual property&#8212;We may become involved in legal proceedings to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.&#8221; 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. In the United States, a patent&#8217;s term may, in certain cases, be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over a commonly owned patent or a patent naming a common inventor and having an earlier expiration date. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration date of a U.S. patent as partial compensation for the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. 

Acquisitions and license agreements 

Amunix 

In December 2008 we entered into a worldwide, exclusive license agreement with Amunix, Inc., which was amended and restated in December 2010 and subsequently amended in February 2011, January 2013 and February 2014. In March 2013, Amunix, Inc. was merged into Amunix Operating, Inc., or Amunix, which assumed all of the rights and obligations of Amunix, Inc. under the agreement. Under this agreement, Amunix granted us an exclusive (even as to Amunix) license under its patents and know-how related to the XTEN technology to develop and commercialize up to four licensed products for human use anywhere in the world, with each licensed product to consist of a selected target attached to an XTEN polypeptide. The license gives us rights with respect to two targets, namely hGH and another specified human protein. Certain of the licensed intellectual property was developed using government funding, and the exclusivity of our license is therefore subject to certain retained rights of the U.S. federal government. During the term of the agreement, which extends on a country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of all licensed patents or ten years from the first commercial sale in such country, Amunix has exclusivity obligations to us. These obligations prohibit Amunix from using itself, or granting a license under, the patents and know-how related to the XTEN technology to exploit licensed products and selected targets that are, are derived from, have the same biological activity as, or are otherwise based on the licensed products and selected targets included in our exclusive license. 

We are responsible for the development and commercialization of the licensed products under the agreement. Amunix has the right to terminate the agreement on a selected target-by-selected target basis if we do not use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products directed at such selected target, which requires that we use those efforts and resources used by a biotechnology company that is similarly situated for a product of similar market potential at a similar stage of its development or life. In addition to its right to terminate the agreement for our diligence failure, Amunix also has the right to terminate if we challenge any of the Amunix licensed patents. 

&#160;

If during any consecutive 18-month period our funding of resear ch, development and commercialization activities with respect to licensed products directed at one of our selected targets is not at least $250,000, Amunix has the right to terminate the agreement unless we pay an additional $150,000 to Amunix to extend th e 18-month period for an additional 24 months. Once we start commercializing a licensed product, we will owe to Amunix a royalty on net sales of the licensed products until the later of the expiration of all licensed patents or ten years from the first com mercial sale in the relevant country. The royalty payable is one percent of net sales for the first two marketed products, but higher single-digit royalties are payable if we market additional products, or if we substitute one marketed product for another. If we elect to substitute one marketed product for another, in addition to royalties, we would also be required to make milestone and other payments totaling up to $40 million per marketed product. Amunix may terminate this agreement if we fail to comply with our payment obligations. We have the right to terminate this agreement without cause at any time upon prior notice to Amunix. 

Amunix prosecutes and maintains the licensed patents, at our expense with respect to those licensed patents that are primarily applicable to our licensed products, and at our partial expense with respect to those licensed patents of broader applicability; provided, that if Amunix decides to abandon a licensed patent, we may elect to continue prosecution and maintenance. We have the first right to prosecute and control any action for infringement related to any product that does, or may, compete with one of our marketed licensed products and any claim within a licensed patent that covers or relates to such marketed licensed product. 

In addition to the license agreement described above, we also entered into a Services Agreement with Amunix in March 2013, which was amended in June 2014. Under the services agreement, we retained Amunix to perform certain research, development and other services related to the licensed products, on a project-by-project basis pursuant to statement of works that the parties may negotiate and execute from time to time. We will pay for Amunix&#8217;s services on a full-time equivalent, or FTE, basis plus additional fees as may be agreed by the parties in the statement of work. New inventions arising out of the services performed by Amunix, and all associated intellectual property rights, are generally owned by Amunix. This services agreement or any statement of work may be terminated by either party for the other party&#8217;s uncured material breach. We also have the right to terminate this services agreement or any statement of work without cause at any time upon prior notice to Amunix. If not terminated, this services agreement will continue until the expiration or termination of the license agreement. Termination of the services agreement does not result in termination of the license agreement. 

Government regulation 

Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, in the European Union and in other countries and jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 

U.S. drug approval process 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA&#8217;s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current good laboratory practice, or cGLP, regulations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#160;

&#183; 

approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 

&#160;

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, or cGCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for each indication; 

&#160;

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an NDA; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA in spection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; and &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

Preclinical studies 

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess its potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 

Clinical trials 

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent (assent, if applicable) in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. 

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. 

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

Marketing approval 

Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the new Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of the FDA&#8217;s acceptance for filing of a standard non-priority BLA to review and act on the submission. 

&#160;

The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitiga tion strategy, or REMS, plan to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, pat ient registries or other risk minimization tools. 

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product&#8217;s continued safety, quality and purity. The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 

Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, which is not under the control of the product sponsor. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with cGCP. 

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. 

If the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the BLA and inspection of the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the BLA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 

Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug&#8217;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 

Post-approval requirements 

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 

The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of a BLA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product&#8217;s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 

&#160;

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by t he FDA and these state agencies to determine compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correc tion of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend significant time, money and effor t in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 

&#160;

&#183; 

restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; 

&#160;

&#183; 

fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; 

&#160;

&#183; 

refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 

&#160;

&#183; 

product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or 

&#160;

&#183; 

injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although doctors may prescribe drugs for off-label purposes. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. 

Hatch-Waxman exclusivity 

Market and data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications for competing products. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that references the previously approved drug. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA or 505(b)(2) NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, strengths or dosage forms of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and, as a general matter, does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

&#160;

Orphan drug designation and exclusivity 

Somavaratan has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of GHD in the European Union at any dosing regimen less frequent than daily, as well as in the United States at once-a-month dosing. 

In the United States, the Orphan Drug Act provides incentives for the development of products intended to treat rare diseases or conditions. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. If a sponsor demonstrates that a drug is intended to treat rare diseases or conditions, the FDA will grant orphan designation for that product for the orphan disease indication. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation, however, does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 

Orphan drug designation provides manufacturers with research grants, tax credits, and eligibility for orphan drug exclusivity. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval of the active moiety for that disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another product with the same active ingredient for the same indication, except in limited circumstances. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan indication for which it received the designation, it will not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same active ingredient for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. Further, the FDA may approve more than one product for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products contain different active ingredients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. 

In the European Union, the EMA&#8217;s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union community. Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug. 

In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following drug approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 

Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 

New legislation and regulations 

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

Foreign regulation 

In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. The cost of establishing a regulatory compliance system for numerous varying jurisdictions can be very significant. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the 

&#160;

United States apply similarly in the context of the European Union and Japan, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product te sting and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 

Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, we must obtain approval from both the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, and a favorable opinion from the competent ethics committee. Our clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents. 

To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, we may submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional. Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the EMA is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP also is responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is requested by the CHMP but has not yet been provided. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 

The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not previously received marketing approval in any European Union member state. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state&#8217;s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. 

If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. 

In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator&#8217;s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator&#8217;s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical test, preclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product. 

&#160;

Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement 

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug product typically is separate from the process for setting the price of a drug product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that a payor will pay for the drug product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. 

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Whether or not we conduct such studies, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A third-party payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drug products and medical services and questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Adoption of such controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as our drug product candidates and could adversely affect our net revenue and results. 

Pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. 

The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which we collectively refer to as the Affordable Care Act or ACA, contains provisions that have the potential to substantially change healthcare financing, including impacting the profitability of drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations and subjected manufacturers to new annual fees and taxes for certain branded prescription drugs. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 

&#160;

Healthcare law and regulation 

Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescribing of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, market, sell and distribute our products that obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties law impose penalties and provide for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or making a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 

&#160;

&#183; 

HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without written authorization; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act will require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and certain physician ownership and investment interests; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, that may apply to our business operations, including our sales or marketing arrangements, and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by governmental third-party payors, and in some instances, also such claims reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers. 

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 

Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. 

&#160;

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 

Employees 

As of February 29, 2016, we had 44 full-time employees, including 21 employees engaged in research and development. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

Facilities 

Our principal facilities consist of office space in Menlo Park, California. We occupy approximately 12,900 square feet of office space under a lease that expires in August, 2017. In December 2015, we executed a sublease agreement in Menlo Park for additional headquarters office space for approximately 10,100 square feet. The rental term for the sublease commenced on January 1, 2016 and expires on December 31, 2017. 

Legal proceedings 

We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings.
