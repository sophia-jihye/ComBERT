We expect to receive the TCO for the remaining 7% in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we leased 84 of the 312 units. We expect to reach stabilized occupancy in 2017;

&#160;

Significant Tenants Bloomberg accounted for $94,468,000, $91,109,000 and $88,164,000, or approximately 45% of our total revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No other tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. If we were to lose Bloomberg as a tenant, or if Bloomberg were to be unable to fulfill its obligations under its lease, it would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In order to assist us in our continuing assessment of Bloomberg&#8217;s creditworthiness, we receive certain confidential financial information and metrics from Bloomberg. In addition, we access and evaluate financial information regarding Bloomberg from other private sources, as well as publicly available data. 

&#160;

In October 2014, Bloomberg exercised its option to extend leases that were scheduled to expire in December 2015 for a term of five years, covering 192,000 square feet of office space at our 731 Lexington Avenue property. In January 2016, we entered into a lease amendment with Bloomberg which extends the lease term related to this space to be coterminous with the other 697,000 square feet of office space leased by Bloomberg through February 2029, with a ten-year extension option. In connection with the lease amendment, Bloomberg provided a $200,000,000 letter of credit, which amount may be reduced in certain circumstances. We may draw on this letter of credit subject to certain terms of the lease amendment, including an event of default by Bloomberg. 

&#160;

Competition We operate in a highly competitive environment. All of our properties are located in the greater New York City metropolitan area. We compete with a large number of property owners and developers. Principal factors of competition are the amount of rent charged, attractiveness of location and quality and breadth of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, the availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends, zoning laws, and our ability to lease, sublease or sell our properties, at profitable levels. Our success is also subject to our ability to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms as it comes due. 

&#160;

Employees We currently have 73 employees. 

&#160;

Executive Office Our executive office is located at 210 Route 4 East, Paramus, New Jersey, 07652 and our telephone number is (201) 587-8541. 

&#160;

&#160;

On April 11, 2000, Vornado and Interstate filed with the SEC, the 26 th amendment to a Form 13D indicating that they, as a group, own in excess of 51% of our common stock. This ownership level makes us a &#8220;controlled&#8221; company for the purposes of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc.&#8217;s Corporate Governance Standards (the &#8220;NYSE Rules&#8221;). This means that we are not required to, among other things, have a majority of the members of our Board of Directors be independent under the NYSE Rules, have all of the members of our Compensation Committee be independent under the NYSE Rules or to have a Nominating Committee. While we have voluntarily complied with a majority of the independence requirements of the NYSE Rules, we are under no obligation to do so and this situation may change at any time.
