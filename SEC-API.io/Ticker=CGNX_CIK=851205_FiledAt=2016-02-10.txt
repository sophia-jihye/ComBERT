 ITEM 1: BUSINESS 

Corporate Profile 

Cognex Corporation was incorporated in Massachusetts in 1981. Our corporate headquarters are located at One Vision Drive, Natick, Massachusetts 01760 and our telephone number is (508) 650-3000. 

Cognex is a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products that capture and analyze visual information in order to automate tasks, primarily in manufacturing processes, where vision is required. Machine vision products are used to automate the manufacture and tracking of discrete items, such as mobile phones, aspirin bottles, and automobile tires, by locating, identifying, inspecting, and measuring them during the manufacturing or distribution process. Machine vision is important for applications in which human vision is inadequate to meet requirements for size, accuracy, or speed, or in instances where substantial cost savings are obtained through the reduction of labor or improved product quality. Today, many types of manufacturing equipment require machine vision because of the increasing demands for speed and accuracy in manufacturing processes, as well as the decreasing size of items being manufactured. 

What is Machine Vision? 

Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, human vision has played an indispensable role in the process of manufacturing products. Human eyes did what no machines could do themselves: locating and positioning work, tracking the flow of parts, and inspecting output for quality and consistency. Today, however, the requirements of many manufacturing processes have surpassed the limits of human eyesight. Manufactured items often are produced too quickly or with tolerances too small to be analyzed by the human eye. In response to manufacturers&#8217; needs, &#8220;machine vision&#8221; technology emerged, providing manufacturing equipment with the gift of sight. Machine vision systems were first widely embraced by manufacturers of electronic components who needed this technology to produce computer chips with decreasing geometries. However, advances in technology and ease-of-use, combined with the decreasing cost of implementing vision applications, have made machine vision available to a broader range of users. 

Machine vision products combine cameras with intelligent software to collect images and then answer questions about these images, such as:

Machine Vision Market 

Cognex machine vision is primarily used in the manufacturing sector, where the technology is widely recognized as an important component of automated production and quality assurance. In this sector, the Company&#8217;s customers are primarily in the factory automation market. Factory automation customers purchase Cognex vision products and incorporate them into their manufacturing processes. Virtually every manufacturer can achieve better quality and manufacturing efficiency by using machine vision, and therefore, this market includes a broad base of customers across a variety of industries, including consumer electronics, automotive, consumer products, food and beverage, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals. Factory automation customers also purchase Cognex products for use outside of the assembly process, such as using ID products in logistics automation for package sorting and distribution. Sales to factory automation customers represented 95% of total revenue in 2015 compared to 94% of total revenue in 2014. 

A small percentage of our customers are in the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment market. These customers purchase Cognex vision products and integrate them into the automation equipment that they manufacture and then sell to their customers to either make semiconductor chips or assemble printed circuit boards. Demand from these customers has been relatively flat on an annual basis for the past several years. Sales to semiconductor and electronics capital equipment manufacturers represented only 5% of total revenue in 2015 compared to 6% of total revenue in 2014. 

In 2015 and 2014, direct and indirect revenue from Apple Inc. accounted for 18% and 16% of total revenue, respectively. In 2013, no customer accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue. 

Business Strategy 

Our goal is to expand our position as a leading worldwide provider of machine vision products. Sales to customers in the factory automation market represent the largest percentage of our total revenue, and we believe that this market provides the greatest potential for long-term revenue growth. 

In order to grow the factory automation market, we have invested in developing new products and functionality that make vision easier to use and more affordable, and therefore, available to a broader base of customers. This investment includes selective expansion into new industrial vision applications through internal development, as well as the acquisition of businesses and technologies. We have also invested in building a worldwide sales and support infrastructure in order to access more of the potential market for machine vision. This investment includes opening sales offices in emerging markets, such as China, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe, where we believe many manufacturers can benefit from incorporating machine vision into their production processes, and developing strategic alliances with other leading providers of factory automation products. 

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

Our business strategy includes selective expansion into new machine vision applications and markets through the acquisition of businesses and technologies. We plan to continue to seek opportunities to expand our product line, customer base, distribution network, and technical talent through acquisitions in the machine vision industry. 

On July 6, 2015, we completed the sale of our Surface Inspection Systems Division (SISD) to AMETEK, Inc. for $156 million in cash. The after-tax gain associated with this sale was $78 million. SISD specializes in machine vision products that inspect the surfaces of materials processed in a continuous fashion. SISD did not meet our long-term objectives and its divestiture was a strategic decision for us. With this sale, we intend to focus our efforts on discrete manufacturing where we see the greatest growth potential. The financial results of SISD are reported as a discontinued operation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and all prior period comparative financial data have been reported excluding SISD. 

We had previously reported SISD as one of our two segments. Given the disposition of the SISD segment, management reviewed its segment reporting and concluded that the Company now operates in one segment, machine vision technology. We offer a variety of machine vision products that have similar economic characteristics, have the same productions processes, and are distributed by the same sales channels to the same types of customers. Information about segments may be found in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, appearing in Part II - Item 8 of this Annual report on Form 10-K. 

On August 21, 2015, we acquired selected assets of Manatee Works, Inc., a privately-held U.S.-based developer of barcode scanning software development kits (SDKs). We plan to leverage Manatee's current developer network and business model of attracting new developers to drive leads for our ID products. As a result of this transaction, we also acquired technology for use in mobile devices. We paid $1 million in cash upon closing and may pay additional contingent cash consideration of up to $5 million over the next three years based upon certain milestone revenue levels. 

Management considers business acquisitions to be an important part of our growth strategy, and although we continue to actively seek out acquisition opportunities, we are selective in choosing businesses that we believe will enhance our long-term growth rate and profitability. 

Products 

Cognex offers a full range of vision and ID products designed to meet customer needs at different performance and price points. Our products range from low-cost vision sensors that are easily integrated, to PC-based systems for users with more experience or more complex requirements. Our products also have a variety of physical forms, depending upon the user&#8217;s need. For example, customers can purchase vision software to use with their own camera and processor, or they can purchase a standalone unit that combines camera, processor, and software into a single package. 

Vision Software 

Vision software provides users with the most flexibility by combining the full general-purpose library of Cognex vision tools with the cameras, frame grabbers, and peripheral equipment of their choice. The vision software may run on the customer&#8217;s PC, which enables easy integration with PC-based data and controls. Applications based upon Cognex vision software perform a wide range of vision tasks, including part location, identification, measurement, assembly verification, and robotic guidance. Cognex's VisionPro &#174; &#32;software offers an extensive suite of patented vision tools for advanced programming, while Cognex Designer allows customers to build complete vision applications with the simplicity of a graphical, flowchart-based programming environment. Cognex also offers a series of Displacement Sensors that are sold with vision software for use in highly demanding three-dimensional applications. 

Vision Systems 

Vision systems combine camera, processor, and vision software into a single, rugged package with a simple and flexible user interface for configuring applications. These general-purpose vision systems are designed to be easily programmed to perform a wide range of vision tasks including part location, identification, measurement, assembly verification, and robotic guidance. Cognex offers the In-Sight &#174; &#32;product line of vision systems in a wide range of models to meet various price and performance requirements. 

Vision Sensors 

Unlike general-purpose vision systems that can be programmed to perform a wide variety of vision tasks, vision sensors are designed to deliver very simple, low-cost, reliable solutions for a limited number of common vision applications such as checking the presence and size of parts. Cognex offers the Checker &#174; &#32;product line of vision sensors that performs single-purpose vision tasks. Late in 2015, Cognex introduced a new vision sensor, the In-Sight 2000 Series, which combines the power of an In-Sight vision system with the simplicity and affordability of a vision sensor. 

ID Products 

ID products quickly and reliably read codes (e.g., one-dimensional barcodes or two-dimensional data matrix codes) that have been applied to, or directly marked on, discrete items during the manufacturing process. Manufacturers of goods ranging from automotive parts, pharmaceutical items, aircraft components, and medical devices are increasingly using direct part mark (DPM) identification to ensure that the appropriate manufacturing processes are performed in 

the correct sequence and on the right parts. In addition, DPM is used to track parts from the beginning of their life to the end, and is also used in supply chain management and repair. 

Cognex also offers applications in the automatic identification market outside of the manufacturing sector, such as using ID products in logistics automation for package sorting and distribution. As shipping volumes grow, more distribution centers are choosing to upgrade their traditional laser-based scanners to image-based barcode readers, which will cost-effectively increase package sorter efficiency and throughput by improving read rates. Cognex offers the DataMan &#174; &#32;product line of ID readers that includes both hand-held and fixed-mount models. 

Research, Development, and Engineering 

Cognex engages in research, development, and engineering (RD&#38;E) to enhance our existing products and to develop new products and functionality to meet market opportunities. In addition to internal research and development efforts, we intend to continue our strategy of gaining access to new technology through strategic relationships and acquisitions where appropriate. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Cognex employed 352 professionals in RD&#38;E, many of whom are software developers. Cognex&#8217;s RD&#38;E expenses totaled $69,791,000 in 2015 , $55,831,000 in 2014 , and $44,315,000 in 2013 , or approximately 15%, 13%, and 15% of revenue, respectively. We believe that a continued commitment to RD&#38;E activities is essential in order to maintain or achieve product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings, as well as to provide engineering support for large customers. In addition, we consider our ability to accelerate time-to-market for new products to be critical to our revenue growth. Therefore, we expect to continue to make significant RD&#38;E investments in the future. At any point in time, we have numerous research and development projects underway. Although we target our RD&#38;E spending to be between 10% and 15% of total revenue, this percentage is impacted by revenue levels and investing cycles. 

Manufacturing and Order Fulfillment 

Cognex&#8217;s products are manufactured utilizing a turnkey operation whereby the majority of component procurement, system assembly, and initial testing are performed by third-party contract manufacturers. Cognex&#8217;s primary contract manufacturer is located in Indonesia. The contract manufacturers use specified components sourced from a vendor list approved by Cognex and assembly/test documentation created and controlled by Cognex. Certain components are presently sourced from a single vendor that is selected based on price and performance considerations. In the event of a supply disruption from a single-source vendor, these components may be purchased from an alternative vendor. 

After the completion of initial testing, a fully assembled product from the contract manufacturers is routed to our facility in Cork, Ireland or Natick, Massachusetts, USA, where trained Cognex personnel load the software onto the product and perform quality control procedures. Finished product for customers in the Americas is then shipped from our Natick, Massachusetts facility, while finished product for customers outside of the Americas is shipped from our Cork, Ireland facility. 

Sales Channels and Support Services 

Cognex sells its products through a worldwide direct sales force that focuses on the development of strategic accounts that generate or are expected to generate significant sales volume, as well as through a global network of integration and distribution partners. Our integration partners are experts in vision and complementary technologies that can provide turnkey solutions for complex automation projects using vision, and our distribution partners provide sales and local support to help Cognex reach the many prospects for our products in factories around the world. 

As of December 31, 2015, Cognex&#8217;s sales force consisted of 491 professionals, and our partner network consisted of approximately 488 active integrators and authorized distributors. Sales engineers call directly on targeted accounts, with the assistance of application engineers, and manage the activities of our partners within their territories in order to implement the most advantageous sales model for our products. Cognex has sales and support personnel located throughout the Americas, Europe, and Asia. In recent years, we have expanded our sales force in emerging markets, such as China, India, Brazil, and Eastern Europe, where we believe many manufacturers can benefit from incorporating machine vision into their production processes. In 2010, we established a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise (WFOE) in Shanghai, China, and we began to sell to our Chinese customers through this new entity in 2011. The WFOE is able to accept payment from Chinese customers in Yuan, also known as Renminbi, which we believe allows us to reach more of the potential market for machine vision throughout Mainland China. 

Sales to customers based outside of the United States represented approximately 73% of total revenue in 2015 compared to approximately 72% of total revenue in 2014. In 2015, approximately 44% of our total revenue came from customers based in Europe, 12% from customers based in Greater China, 6% from customers based in Japan, and 

11% from customers based in other regions outside the United States. Sales to customers based in Europe are denominated in Euros and U.S. Dollars, sales to customers based in Greater China are denominated in Yuan for sales within Mainland China and U.S. Dollars in other territories, sales to customers based in Japan are predominantly denominated in Yen, and sales to customers based in other regions are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Financial information about geographic areas may be found in &#32; Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, appearing in Part II - Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Cognex&#8217;s service offerings include maintenance and support, consulting, and training services. Maintenance and support programs include hardware support programs that entitle customers to have failed products repaired, as well as software support programs that provide customers with application support and software updates on the latest software releases. Application support is provided by technical support personnel located at Cognex regional offices, as well as by field service engineers that provide support at the customer&#8217;s production site. We provide consulting services that range from a specific area of functionality to a completely integrated vision application or installed ID application. Training services include a variety of product courses that are available at our offices worldwide, at customer facilities, and on computer-based tutorials, video, and the internet. 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on the technical expertise, creativity, and knowledge of our personnel, and therefore, we utilize patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection to maintain our competitive position and protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. While our intellectual property rights are important to our success, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property right. 

As of December 31, 2015 , Cognex had been granted, or owned by assignment, 437 patents issued worldwide and had another 358 patent applications pending worldwide. Cognex has used, registered, or applied to register a number of trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries.

Competition 

The machine vision market is fragmented and our competitors are typically other vendors of machine vision systems, controllers, and components; manufacturers of image processing systems, sensors, and components; and system integrators. In addition, in the semiconductor and electronics capital equipment market, and with respect to machine builders in the factory automation market, we compete with the internal engineering departments of current or prospective customers. In the identification and logistics market, we compete with manufacturers of automatic identification systems. Any of these competitors may have greater financial and other resources than Cognex. Although we consider Cognex to be one of the leading machine vision companies in the world, reliable estimates of the machine vision market and the number of competitors are not available. 

Cognex&#8217;s ability to compete depends upon our ability to design, manufacture, and sell high-quality products, as well as our ability to develop new products and functionality that meet evolving customer requirements. The primary competitive factors affecting the choice of a machine vision or ID system include vendor reputation, product functionality and performance, ease of use, price, and post-sales support. The importance of each of these factors varies depending upon the specific customer&#8217;s needs.
