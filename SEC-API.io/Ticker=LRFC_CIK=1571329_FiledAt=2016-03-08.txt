 ITEM 1. BUSINESS FORMATION OF OUR COMPANY We are an externally managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company incorporated in Maryland that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (&#147;BDC&#148;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;1940 Act&#148;). We commenced operations on May 24, 2013 and completed our initial public offering (&#147;IPO&#148;) on September 30, 2013. The Company is managed by the Investment Advisor, an investment adviser that is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the &#147;Advisers Act&#148;), and the Administrator provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company (&#147;RIC&#148;) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). We are an &#147;emerging growth company&#148; within the meaning of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#147;JOBS Act&#148;), and as such are subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. 

The Company was formed for the purpose of (i) acquiring, through a series of transactions, an investment portfolio from the following entities: CapitalSouth Partners Fund I Limited Partnership (&#147;Fund I&#148;); CapitalSouth Partners Fund II Limited Partnership (&#147;Fund II&#148;); CapitalSouth Partners Fund III, L.P. (&#147;Fund III Parent&#148;); CapitalSouth Partners SBIC Fund III, L.P. (&#147;Fund III&#148;) and CapitalSouth Partners Florida Sidecar Fund I, L.P. (&#147;Florida Sidecar&#148; and, collectively with Fund I, Fund II, Fund III and Fund III Parent, the &#147;Legacy Funds&#148;); (ii) raising capital in the IPO and (iii) continuing and expanding the business of the Legacy Funds by making additional debt and equity investments in smaller and lower middle-market companies. 

The Company&#146;s investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. Both directly and through our subsidiaries that are licensed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (&#147;SBA&#148;) under the Small Business Investment Company (&#147;SBIC&#148;) Act, we offer customized financing to business owners, management teams and financial sponsors for change of ownership transactions, recapitalizations, strategic acquisitions, business expansion and other growth initiatives. We invest in mezzanine and senior debt investments that are secured by subordinated liens on all or a portion of our borrower&#146;s assets and, to a lesser extent, in senior, cash flow-based &#147;unitranche&#148; securities. Many of our debt investments are coupled with equity interests, whether in the form of detachable &#147;penny&#148; warrants or equity co-investments made pari-passu with our borrower&#146;s financial sponsors. 

On September 24, 2013, the Company acquired 100% of the limited partnership interests in Fund II, Fund III and Florida Sidecar and each of their respective general partners, as well as certain assets from Fund I and Fund III Parent, in exchange for an aggregate of 8,974,420 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock (the &#147;Formation Transactions&#148;). Fund II, Fund III and Florida Sidecar became the Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiaries. Fund II and Fund III retained their SBIC licenses, and continued to hold their existing investments at the time of IPO and have continued to make new investments after the IPO. The IPO consisted of the sale of 4,000,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock at a price of $20.00 per share resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $74.25 million, after deducting underwriting fees, commissions, and other offering expenses totaling $5.75 million. 

&#160;

&#160;

OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments. We expect the companies in which we invest will generally have between $5 million and $30 million in trailing twelve month earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (&#147;EBITDA&#148;). We believe our focus on mezzanine and senior subordinated loans enables us to receive higher interest rates and more substantial equity participation. We may also invest in first-lien, senior secured positions in &#147;stretch&#148; senior secured loans, also referred to as &#147;unitranche&#148; loans, which combine characteristics of traditional first-lien senior secured loans and subordinated loans, providing us with greater influence and security in the primary collateral of a borrower and potentially mitigating loss of principal should a borrower default. In addition to debt securities, we may acquire equity or detachable equity-related interests (including warrants) from a borrower. Typically, the debt in which we invest is not initially rated by any rating agency; however, we believe that if such investments were rated, they would be rated below investment grade. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as &#147;high yield&#148; or &#147;junk,&#148; have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer&#146;s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. We intend to target investments that mature in four to six years from our investment. 

We typically will not limit our loan commitments to a percentage of a traditional borrowing base, although we attempt to protect against risk of loss on our debt investments by structuring, underwriting and pricing loans based on anticipated cash flows of our borrowers. As of December 31, 2015, our Investment Advisor underwrote investments in 114 lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies totaling more than $980 million of invested capital since 2000, and we believe that a continuation of this strategy allows us to make structured investments with more attractive pricing and greater opportunities for meaningful equity participation than traditional asset-based, senior secured loans. Further, we believe that we benefit from our Investment Advisor&#146;s long-standing relationships with many private equity fund sponsors, whose participation in portfolio companies, we believe, makes repayment from refinancing, asset sales and/or sales of the borrowers themselves more likely than a strategy whereby we consider investments only in founder-owned or non-sponsored borrowers. 

OUR INVESTMENT ADVISOR We are managed by the Investment Advisor, whose investment team members have significant and diverse experience financing, advising, operating and investing in smaller and lower middle-market companies. Moreover, our Investment Advisor&#146;s investment team has refined its investment strategy by sourcing, reviewing, acquiring and monitoring 114 portfolio companies totaling more than $980 million of invested capital from 2000 through December 31, 2015. The Investment Advisor&#146;s investment team also manages CapitalSouth Partners SBIC Fund IV, L.P. (&#147;Fund IV&#148;), a private investment limited partnership providing financing solutions to companies that generate between $5 million and $50 million in annual revenues and have between $1 million and $5 million in annual EBITDA. Fund IV had its first closing in March 2013 and obtained SBA approval for its SBIC license in April 2013. In addition to Fund IV, affiliates of the Investment Advisor manage several affiliated funds. We will not co-invest in transactions with other entities affiliated with the Investment Advisor unless we obtain an exemptive order from the SEC, for which we have applied, or do so in accordance with existing regulatory guidance. We do not expect to make co-investments, or otherwise compete for investment opportunities, with Fund IV because its focus and investment strategy differ from our own. 

Our Investment Advisor is led by Joseph B. Alala, III, our chief executive officer, president, chairman of our Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;), and the managing partner and chief investment officer of our Investment Advisor, Hunt Broyhill, a partner of our Investment Advisor, Stephen A. Arnall, our chief financial officer, and John F. McGlinn, our chief operating officer, secretary and treasurer, and a director of our Investment Advisor. Messrs. Alala, Broyhill and McGlinn serve as our Investment Advisor&#146;s investment committee. They are assisted by Christopher B. Norton, who serves as the chief risk officer and a director of our Investment Advisor, Michael S. Marr, Richard Wheelahan, Adam Richeson, and Davis Hutchens who each serve as directors of our Investment Advisor, as well as thirteen other investment professionals. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our Investment Advisor&#146;s investment committee, as well as certain key investment team members that are involved in screening and underwriting portfolio transactions, have worked together for more than ten years. These investment professionals have an average of over 20 years of experience in various finance-related fields, including operations, corporate finance, investment banking, business law and merchant banking, and have collectively developed a broad network of contacts that can offer us investment opportunities. Much of our Investment Advisor&#146;s investment team has worked together screening opportunities, underwriting new investments and managing a portfolio of investments in smaller and lower middle-market companies through two recessions, a credit crunch, the dot-com boom and bust and a historic, leverage-fueled asset valuation bubble. 

INVESTMENTS We will engage in various investment strategies from time to time in order to achieve our overall lending and investment objectives. Our strategies will generally require current cash yields and sensible leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and either a first or second-lien position (subject to limited instances in which we will not obtain security) in the collateral of the portfolio company. The strategy we select will depend upon, among other things, market opportunities, the skills and experience of our Investment Advisor&#146;s investment team, the result of our financial, operational and strategic evaluation of the opportunity, and our overall portfolio composition. Most of our existing debt investments offer, and we expect most of our future debt investments will offer, the opportunity to participate in a borrower&#146;s equity performance through warrant participation, direct equity ownership or otherwise, and many notes that we purchase will require the borrower to pay an early termination fee. Collectively, these attributes have been, and are expected to be, important contributors to the returns generated by our Investment Advisor&#146;s investment team. 

The Investment Advisor&#146;s investment team uses a disciplined investment portfolio monitoring and risk management process that emphasizes strict underwriting standards and guidelines, strong due diligence investigation, regular portfolio review, analysis and performance-guided responses, and proper investment diversification. We allocate capital among different industries, geographies and private equity sponsors on the basis of relative risk/reward profiles as a function of their associated downside risk, volatility, perceived fundamental risk and our ability to obtain favorable investment protection terms. 

Types of Investments We will target debt investments that yield meaningful current income and, in many cases, provide the opportunity for capital appreciation through equity securities. In each case, the following criteria and guidelines are applied to the review of a potential investment; however, not all criteria are met in every single investment in our portfolio, nor do we guarantee that all criteria will be met in the investments we will make in the future. 

&#149; Established Companies With Positive Cash Flow. We seek to invest in established companies with a history of generating revenues and positive cash flows. We intend to focus on companies with a history of profitability and minimum trailing twelve-month EBITDA of $5 million. We do not intend to invest in start-up companies, distressed or &#147;turn-around&#148; situations or companies with business plans that we do not understand. &#149; Experienced Management Teams with Meaningful Investment. We seek to invest in companies in which senior or key managers have significant company or industry-level experience and have significant equity ownership. It has been our experience that these management teams are more committed to the company&#146;s success and more likely to manage the company in a manner that protects our debt and equity investments. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; Significant Invested Capital. We believe that the existence of an appropriate amount of equity beneath our debt capital provides valuable support for our investment. In addition, the degree to which the particular investment is a meaningful one for the portfolio company&#146;s financial sponsor, and the financial sponsor&#146;s ability and willingness to invest additional equity capital as and to the extent necessary, are also important considerations. &#149; Appropriate Capital Structures. We seek to invest in companies that are appropriately capitalized. First, we examine the amount of equity that is being invested by the company&#146;s private equity sponsor to determine whether there is a sufficient capital cushion beneath our invested capital. We also analyze the amount of leverage and the characteristics of senior debt with lien priority over our investment. &#149; Strong Competitive Position. We intend to invest in companies that have developed strong, defensible product or service offerings within their respective market segments. These companies should be well positioned to capitalize on organic and strategic growth opportunities, and should compete in industries with strong fundamentals and meaningful barriers to entry. We further analyze prospective portfolio investments in order to identify competitive advantages within their industry, which may result in superior operating margins or industry-leading growth. &#149; Customer and Supplier Diversification. We expect to invest in companies with sufficiently diverse customer and supplier bases. We believe these companies will be better able to endure industry consolidation, economic contraction and increased competition than those that are not sufficiently diversified. However, we also recognize that from time to time, an attractive investment opportunity with some concentration among its customer base or supply chain will present itself. We believe that concentration issues can be evaluated and, in some instances (whether due to supplier or customer product or platform diversification, the existence and quality of long-term agreements with such customers or suppliers or other select factors), mitigated, thus presenting a superior risk-adjusted pricing scenario. Debt Investments The Investment Advisor&#146;s investment team tailors the terms of each debt investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction, the needs of the prospective portfolio company and, as applicable, its financial sponsor, negotiating a structure that seeks to protect our rights and manage our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan. As of December 31, 2015, 43.7% of our debt investments were secured by a first-lien on the assets of the portfolio company, 53.2% of our debt investments were secured by a second-lien on the assets of the portfolio company and 3.1% of our debt investments were unsecured. We expect our primary source of return to be the monthly cash interest we will collect on our debt investments. We also typically seek Board observation rights with each portfolio company and we offer (and have historically provided) managerial and strategic assistance to these companies. We seek to further protect invested principal by negotiating appropriate affirmative, negative and financial covenants in our debt documents that are conservative enough to represent a prudent cushion at closing or to budgeted projections, but that are flexible enough to afford our portfolio companies and their financial sponsors sufficient latitude to allow them to grow their businesses. Typical covenants include default triggers and remedies (including penalties), lien protection, leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios, change of control provisions and put rights. Most of our loans feature call protection to enhance our total return on debt investments that are repaid prior to maturity. 

Most of our debt investments are structured as senior subordinated notes. On a fair market value basis, 54.0% of our debt investments consist of senior subordinated notes as of December 31, 2015. Senior subordinated notes are subordinate to senior debt provided by financial institutions (primarily, asset-based revolving credit facilities and, in some cases, term loans) but senior to other subordinated notes, including junior subordinated notes and seller notes. Our senior subordinated notes are typically issued with five-year terms. Some senior subordinated notes have payment-in-kind (&#147;PIK&#148;) interest, which is a form of interest that is not paid currently in cash, but is accrued and added to the loan balance until paid at the end of the term. While we generally seek to minimize the percentage of our fixed return that is in the form of PIK interest, we sometimes receive PIK due to prevailing market conditions that do not support the overall blended interest 

&#160;

&#160;

yield on our debt investments being paid in all-cash interest. As of December 31, 2015, our weighted average PIK yield in our debt investments is 0.7%. In addition to yield in the form of current cash and PIK interest, some of our debt investments include an equity component, such as a warrant to purchase a common equity interest in the borrower for a nominal price. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average annualized yield on all of our outstanding debt investments was 11.5%, the weighted average annualized yield excluding PIK interest, was 10.8%. 

We also opportunistically structure certain debt investments as senior secured or unitranche notes and as of December 31, 2015, 46.0% of the fair value of our debt investments consisted of such investments. Senior secured loans will typically provide for a fixed interest rate and may contain some minimum amount of principal amortization, excess cash flow sweep feature, prepayment penalties, or any combination of the foregoing. Senior secured loans are secured by a first priority lien in existing and future assets of the borrower and may take the form of term loans or delayed draw facilities. In some cases, senior secured loans may be subordinated only to a senior secured revolving credit facility. Unitranche debt financing typically involves issuing one debt security that blends the risk and return profiles of both senior secured and subordinated debt in one debt security. We believe that unitranche debt can be attractive for many smaller and lower middle-market businesses, given the reduced structural complexity, single lender interface and elimination of intercreditor or potential agency conflicts among lenders. 

Equity Investments When we make a debt investment, we may be granted equity participation in the form of detachable warrants to purchase common equity in the company in the same class of security that the owners or equity sponsors receive upon funding. In addition, we may make non-control equity co-investments in conjunction with a loan transaction with a borrower. The Investment Advisor&#146;s investment team generally seeks to structure our equity investments, such as direct equity co-investments, to provide us with minority rights provisions and, as and to the extent available, event-driven put rights. They also seek to obtain limited registration rights in connection with these investments, which may include &#147;piggyback&#148; registration rights. In addition to warrants and equity co-investments, our debt investments in the future may contain a synthetic equity position. 

INVESTMENT PROCESS Our Investment Advisor&#146;s investment team is led by its investment committee and is responsible for all aspects of our investment process. The current members of the investment committee are Joseph B. Alala, III, our chief executive officer, president, chairman of our Board and the managing partner and chief investment officer of our Investment Advisor, Hunt Broyhill, a partner of our Investment Advisor, and John F. McGlinn, our chief operating officer, secretary and treasurer, and a director of our Investment Advisor. Christopher B. Norton serves as chief risk officer and a director of our Investment Advisor. Richard Wheelahan, our chief compliance officer, Michael S. Marr, Randall Fontes, Adam Richeson, Mario Shaffer, and Davis Hutchens, serve as directors of our Investment Advisor, and Casey Swercheck, Eric Althofer, Michael Graham and Christian MacCarron each serve as vice presidents of our Investment Advisor. While the investment strategy involves a team approach, whereby potential transactions are screened by various members of the investment team, Mr. Alala and one other member of the investment committee of the Investment Advisor must approve investments in order for them to proceed. Messrs. Alala and McGlinn meet weekly and, together with Mr. Broyhill, on an as needed basis, depending on the nature and volume of investment opportunities. The Investment Advisor&#146;s investment committee has worked together for over ten years. The stages of our investment selection process are as follows: 

Deal Generation/Origination Deal generation and origination is maximized through long-standing and extensive relationships with industry contacts, brokers, commercial and investment bankers, entrepreneurs, service providers (such as lawyers and accountants), as well as current and former clients, portfolio companies and investors. Our Investment Advisor&#146;s investment team supplements these lead generators by also utilizing broader marketing efforts, such as attendance at prospective borrower industry conventions, an active calling effort to investment banking boutiques, private equity firms and independent sponsors that are also investing in high quality 

&#160;

&#160;

smaller and lower middle-market companies, and, most importantly, based on our Investment Advisor&#146;s track record as a responsive, flexible, value-add lender and co-investor, as demonstrated by 114 investments in lower middle-market and traditional middle-market businesses and equity co-investments with reputed private equity firms. We have developed a reputation as a knowledgeable and reliable source of capital, providing value-added industry advice and financing assistance to borrowers&#146; businesses and in executing financial sponsors&#146; growth strategies. Furthermore, with offices throughout the United States, we have the ability to cover a large geographical area and to market to unique groups from each office. Specifically, our Charlotte, Raleigh, Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Washington D.C., and Los Angeles offices cover significant territory that is traditionally underserved, allowing us to source a high volume of direct deal flow. 

Screening All potential investments that are received are screened for suitability and consistency with our investment criteria (see &#147;&#151; Due Diligence and Underwriting,&#148; below). In screening potential investments, our Investment Advisor&#146;s investment team utilizes the same value-oriented investment philosophy they employed in their work with the Legacy Funds and commits resources to managing downside exposure. If a potential investment meets our basic investment criteria, a deal team is assigned to perform preliminary due diligence. In doing so, we consider some or all of the following factors: 

&#149; A comprehensive financial model that we prepare based on quantitative analysis of historical financial performance, financial projections made by management or the financial sponsor, as the case may be, and pro forma financial ratios assuming an investment consistent with possible structures. In analyzing our model, we test various investment structures, pricing options, downside scenarios and other sensitivities in order to better understand potential risks and possible financial covenant ratios. &#149; The competitive landscape and industry dynamics impacting the potential portfolio company; &#149; Strengths and weaknesses of the potential investment&#146;s business strategy and industry outlook; and &#149; Results of a broad qualitative analysis of the company&#146;s products or services, market position and outlook, customers, suppliers and quality of management. If the results of this preliminary due diligence are satisfactory, the deal team prepares an executive summary that is presented to certain members of our Investment Advisor&#146;s investment committee in a meeting that includes all members of the portfolio and investment teams. This executive summary includes the following areas: 

&#149; Company history and summary of product(s) and/or service(s); &#149; An overview of investors, anticipated capital sources and transaction timing; &#149; Investment structure and expected returns, including initial projected financial ratios; &#149; Analysis of historical financial results and key assumptions; &#149; Analysis of the company&#146;s business strategy; &#149; Analysis of the financial sponsor&#146;s relevant experience or expected strategy; &#149; Investment strengths, weaknesses and priority issues to be addressed in due diligence; and &#149; Pro forma capitalization and ownership. If our investment committee recommends moving forward, we will issue a non-binding term sheet or indication of interest to the potential portfolio company and, when applicable, its financial sponsor. If a term sheet is successfully negotiated, we will begin more formal due diligence and underwriting as we progress towards the ultimate investment approval and closing. 

&#160;

&#160;

Due Diligence and Underwriting The completion of due diligence deliverables is led by at least two investment professionals. However, all investment and portfolio team members are regularly updated with due diligence progress, especially any issues that emerge. The two investment professionals leading the due diligence efforts are typically assigned to the original deal team that worked on the executive summary. However, post-term sheet deal teams sometimes contain one or more additional investment professionals and may include other professionals from business development, portfolio or other areas if a particular skill or experience set would be especially valuable in the due diligence process. The members of the underwriting team complete due diligence and analyze the relationships among the prospective portfolio company&#146;s business plan, operations and expected financial performance. Due diligence touches upon some or all of the following: 

&#149; On-site visits with management and relevant key employees; &#149; In-depth review of historical and projected financial statements, including covenant calculation work sheets; &#149; Interviews with customers and suppliers; &#149; Management background checks; &#149; Review of reports by third-party accountants, outside counsel and other industry, operational or financial experts, whether retained by us, or the financial sponsor; &#149; Review of material contracts; and &#149; Review of financial sponsor&#146;s due diligence package and internal executive summaries. Typically, we utilize outside experts to analyze the legal affairs, accounting systems and financial results and, where appropriate, we engage specialists to investigate certain issues. During the underwriting process, significant, ongoing attention is devoted to sensitivity analyses regarding whether a company might bear a significant &#147;downside&#148; case and remain profitable and in compliance with assumed financial covenants. These &#147;downside&#148; scenarios typically involve assumptions regarding the loss of key customers and/or suppliers, an economic downturn, adverse regulatory changes and other relevant stressors that we attempt to simulate in our quantitative and qualitative analyses. Further, we continually examine the effect of these scenarios on financial ratios and other metrics. 

During the underwriting process, the executive summary that was completed for the initial investment committee presentation is updated and changes are presented at subsequent, weekly meetings of the investment committee for continued discussion and, to the extent applicable, the investment committee issues new instructions to the underwriting team from the investment committee. 

Approval, Documentation and Closing The underwriting team for the proposed investment presents the updated executive summary and key findings from due diligence to the investment committee on an ongoing, weekly basis. Prior to the commencement of documentation, approval from the investment committee is sought and, if approved, the underwriting professionals heretofore involved proceed to documentation. 

At all times during the documentation process, the underwriting professionals who conducted the due diligence remain involved; likewise, all extensively negotiated documentation decisions are made by the lead underwriting team member, in accordance with input from at least one investment committee member and guidance from outside counsel. As and to the extent necessary, key documentation challenges are brought before the investment committee for prompt discussion and resolution. Upon the completion of satisfactory documentation and the satisfaction of closing conditions, final approval is sought from the investment committee before closing and funding. 

&#160;

&#160;

ONGOING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PORTFOLIO COMPANIES Monitoring Our Investment Advisor will monitor our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It will monitor the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. We generally require our portfolio companies to provide annual audited financial statements, quarterly unaudited financial statements, in each case, with management discussion and analysis and covenant compliance certificates, and monthly unaudited financial statements. Using the monthly financial statements, we calculate and evaluate all financial covenants and additional financial coverage ratios that might not be part of our covenant package in the loan documents. For purposes of analyzing a portfolio company&#146;s financial performance, we may adjust their financial statements to reflect pro forma results in the event of a recent change of control, sale, acquisition or anticipated cost savings. 

Our Investment Advisor has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, including the following: 

&#149; Assessment of success in adhering to each portfolio company&#146;s business plan and compliance with covenants; &#149; Periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; &#149; Comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; &#149; Attendance at and participation in the board meetings; and &#149; Review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Investment Advisor also uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of return on each investment in our portfolio. 

As part of our valuation procedures, we risk rate all of our investments. In general, our investment rating system uses a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest probability of default and principal loss. Our internal rating is not an exact system, but is used internally to estimate the probability of: (i) default on our debt securities and (ii) loss of our debt principal, in the event of a default. In general, our internal rating system may also assist our valuation team in its determination of the estimated fair value of equity securities or equity-like securities. Our internal risk rating system generally encompasses both qualitative and quantitative aspects of our portfolio companies. 

&#160;

&#160;

Our internal investment rating system incorporates the following five categories: 

&#160; Investment Rating &#160; Summary Description 1 &#160; In general, the investment may be performing above our internal expectations. Full return of principal and interest is expected. Capital gain is expected. 2 &#160; In general, the investment may be performing within our internal expectations, and potential risks to the applicable investment are considered to be neutral or favorable compared to any potential risks at the time of the original investment. All new investments are initially given this rating. 3 &#160; In general, the investment may be performing below our internal expectations and therefore, investments in this category may require closer internal monitoring; however, the valuation team believes that no loss of investment return (interest and/or dividends) or principal is expected. The investment also may be out of compliance with certain senior or senior subordinated debt financial covenants. 4 &#160; In general, the investment may be performing below internal expectations and quantitative or qualitative risks may have increased substantially since the original investment. Loss of some or all principal is expected. 5 &#160; In general, the investment may be performing substantially below our internal expectations and a number of quantitative or qualitative risks may have increased substantially since the original investment. Loss of some or all principal is expected. 

Our Investment Advisor will monitor and, when appropriate, change the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, our Investment Advisor will review these investment ratings on a quarterly basis, and our Board will affirm such ratings. The investment rating of a particular investment should not, however, be deemed to be a guarantee of the investment&#146;s future performance. 

The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 investment performance rating scale at fair value as of December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):

The Investment Advisor&#146;s services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. 

Management Fee Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay the Investment Advisor a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components &#151; a base management fee and an incentive fee. 

The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% of our gross assets, which is our total assets as reflected on our consolidated statements of assets and liabilities and includes any borrowings for investment purposes. Although we do not anticipate making significant investments in derivative financial instruments, the fair value of any such investments, which will not necessarily equal their notional value, will be included in our calculation of gross assets. For services rendered under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee was initially calculated based on the value of our gross assets at the end of the first calendar quarter subsequent to consummation of our IPO, and thereafter is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. For the first twelve months following our IPO, the Investment Advisor waived the portion of the base management fee payable on cash and cash equivalents held at the Capitala Finance level, excluding cash and cash equivalents held by the Legacy Funds that was acquired by Capitala Finance in connection with the Formation Transactions. 

The incentive fee has two parts. The first part of the incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus our operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement to our administrator, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, computed net of all realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a hurdle of 2.0% per quarter (8.0% annualized). Our net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included 

&#160;

&#160;

in the amount of our gross assets used to calculate the 1.75% base management fee. We pay the Investment Advisor an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 

&#149; no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle of 2.0%; &#149; 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized). We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle but is less than 2.5%) as the &#147;catch-up.&#148; The &#147;catch-up&#148; is meant to provide our Investment Advisor with 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle did not apply if this net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and &#149; 20% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter (10.0% annualized) is payable to Capitala Investment Advisors (once the hurdle is reached and the catch-up is achieved, 20% of all pre-incentive fee investment income thereafter is allocated to Capitala Investment Advisors). As announced on January 4, 2016, the Investment Advisor has voluntarily agreed to waive all or such portion of the quarterly incentive fees earned by the Investment Advisor that would otherwise cause the Company&#146;s quarterly net investment income to be less than the distribution payments declared by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. Quarterly incentive fees are earned by the Investment Adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Incentive fees subject to the waiver cannot exceed the amount of incentive fees earned during the period, as calculated on a quarterly basis. The Investment Advisor will not be entitled to recoup any amount of incentive fees that it waives. This waiver was effective for the fourth quarter of 2015 and will continue for 2016, unless otherwise publicly disclosed by the Company. 

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the income-related portion of the incentive fee: 

Quarterly Incentive Fee Based on Net Investment Income Pre-incentive fee net investment income (expressed as a percentage of the value of net assets) 

Percentage of pre-incentive fee net investment income allocated to the Capitala Investment Advisors These calculations are appropriately pro-rated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter. You should be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments. Accordingly, an increase in interest rates would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the incentive fee hurdle rate and may result in a substantial increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to our Investment Advisor with respect to pre-incentive fee net investment income. 

The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and will equal 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive fees with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio, provided that, the incentive fee determined as of December 31, 2013 was calculated for a period of shorter than twelve calendar months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from the inception of Capitala Finance. 

&#160;

&#160;

We will defer cash payment of the portion of any incentive fee otherwise earned by our Investment Advisor that would, when taken together with all other incentive fees paid to our Investment Advisor during the most recent 12 full calendar month period ending on or prior to the date such payment is to be made, exceed 20% of the sum of (a) our pre-incentive fee net investment income during such period, (b) our net unrealized appreciation or depreciation during such period and (c) our net realized capital gains or losses during such period. Any deferred incentive fees will be carried over for payment in subsequent calculation periods to the extent such payment is payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. 

Examples of Quarterly Incentive Fee Calculation Example 1: Income Related Portion of Incentive Fee* Alternative 1: Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 1.25% Hurdle rate (1) = 2.0% Management fee (2) = 0.50% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 0.55% 

Pre-incentive net investment income does not exceed hurdle rate, therefore there is no incentive fee. 

Alternative 2: Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 2.9% Hurdle rate (1) = 2.0% Management fee (2) = 0.50% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.2% 

Incentive fee = 100% &#215; pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to the &#147;catch-up&#148; (4) 

&#160;= 100% &#215; (2.2% &#150; 2.0%) 

&#160;= 0.20%

Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, but does not fully satisfy the &#147;catch-up&#148; provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.20%. 

* The hypothetical amount of pre-incentive fee net investment income shown is based on a percentage of total net assets. (1) Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. (2) Represents 2.00% annualized management fee. (3) Excludes organizational and offering expenses. 

&#160;

&#160;

Alternative 3: Assumptions Investment income (including interest, dividends, fees, etc.) = 3.50% Hurdle rate (1) = 2.0% Management fee (2) = 0.50% Other expenses (legal, accounting, custodian, transfer agent, etc.) (3) = 0.20% Pre-incentive fee net investment income 

(investment income &#150; (management fee + other expenses)) = 2.80% 

Incentive fee = 20% &#215; pre-incentive fee net investment income, subject to &#147;catch-up&#148; (4) Incentive fee = 100%&#215;&#147;catch-up&#148; + (20%&#215;(pre-incentive fee net investment income &#150; 2.5%)) Catch-up = 2.5% &#150; 2.0% 

&#160;= 0.5% 

Incentive fee = (100% &#215; 0.5%) + (20% &#215; (2.80% &#150; 2.5%)) 

&#160;= 0.5% + (20%&#215;0.3%) 

&#160;= 0.5% + 0.06% 

&#160;= 0.56% 

Pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds the hurdle rate, and fully satisfies the &#147;catch-up&#148; provision, therefore the income related portion of the incentive fee is 0.56%. 

Example 2: Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee Alternative 1: Assumptions &#149; Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#147;Investment A&#148;), and $30 million investment made in Company B (&#147;Investment B&#148;) &#149; Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million and fair market value (&#147;FMV&#148;) of Investment B determined to be $32 million &#149; Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million &#149; Year 4: Investment B sold for $31 million The capital gains portion of the incentive fee would be: 

&#149; Year 1: None &#149; Year 2: Capital gains incentive fee of $6 million ($30 million realized capital gains on sale of Investment A multiplied by 20%) &#149; Year 3: None $5 million (20% multiplied by ($30 million cumulative capital gains less $5 million cumulative capital depreciation)) less $6 million (previous capital gains fee paid in Year 2). 

&#149; Year 4: Capital gains incentive fee of $200,000 $6.2 million ($31 million cumulative realized capital gains multiplied by 20%) less $6 million (capital gains fee taken in Year 2). 

(1) Represents 8.0% annualized hurdle rate. (2) Represents 2.00% annualized management fee. (3) Excludes organizational and offering expenses. (4) The &#147;catch-up&#148; provision is intended to provide the Adviser with an incentive fee of 20% on all of Capitala Finance&#146;s pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply when its net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter. 

&#160;

&#160;

Alternative 2: Assumptions &#149; Year 1: $20 million investment made in Company A (&#147;Investment A&#148;), $30 million investment made in Company B (&#147;Investment B&#148;) and $25 million investment made in Company C (&#147;Investment C&#148;) &#149; Year 2: Investment A sold for $50 million, FMV of Investment B determined to be $25 million and FMV of Investment C determined to be $25 million &#149; Year 3: FMV of Investment B determined to be $27 million and Investment C sold for $30 million &#149; Year 4: FMV of Investment B determined to be $24 million &#149; Year 5: Investment B sold for $20 million The capital gains incentive fee, if any, would be: 

&#149; Year 1: None &#149; Year 2: $5 million capital gains incentive fee 20% multiplied by $25 million ($30 million realized capital gains on Investment A less unrealized capital depreciation on Investment B). 

&#149; Year 3: $1.4 million capital gains incentive fee (1) $6.4 million (20% multiplied by $32 million ($35 million cumulative realized capital gains less $3 million unrealized capital depreciation)) less $5 million capital gains fee received in Year 2. 

&#149; Year 4: None &#149; Year 5: None $5 million (20% multiplied by $25 million (cumulative realized capital gains of $35 million less realized capital losses of $10 million)) less $6.4 million cumulative capital gains fee paid in Year 2 and Year 3. 

Example 3: Application of the Incentive Fee Deferral Mechanism Assumptions &#149; In each of Years 1 through 4 in this example pre-incentive fee net investment income equals $40.0 million per year, which we recognized evenly in each quarter of each year and paid quarterly. This amount exceeds the hurdle rate and the requirement of the &#147;catch-up&#148; provision in each quarter of such year. As a result, the annual income related portion of the incentive fee, before the application of the deferral mechanism in any year is $8.0 million ($40.0 million multiplied by 20%). All income-related incentive fees were paid quarterly in arrears. &#149; In each year preceding Year 1, we did not generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses, no capital gain-related incentive fee was paid and there was no deferral of incentive fees. &#149; Year 1: We did not generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses. &#149; Year 2: We realized a $30.0 million capital gain and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses. &#149; Year 3: We recognized $5.0 million of unrealized capital depreciation and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses. &#149; Year 4: We realized a $6.0 million capital gain and did not otherwise generate realized or unrealized capital gains or losses. 

(1) As illustrated in Year 3 of Alternative 1 above, if the Company were to be wound up on a date other than December 31 of any year, the Company may have paid aggregate capital gain incentive fees that are more than the amount of such fees that would be payable if the Company had been wound up on December 31 of such year.

Organization of the Investment Advisor The Investment Advisor is a Delaware limited liability company. The principal executive offices of the Investment Advisor are located at 4201 Congress Street, Suite 360, Charlotte, North Carolina 28209. 

Administration Agreement Capitala Advisors Corp., a North Carolina corporation, serves as our administrator. The principal executive offices of our administrator are located at 4201 Congress Street, Suite 360, Charlotte, North Carolina 28209. Capitala Advisors Corp., pursuant to a sub-administration agreement, has engaged 

&#160;

&#160;

U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC to act on behalf of the Administrator in its performance of certain administrative services for us. The principal office of U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC is 777 East Wisconsin Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53202. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, our administrator furnishes us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, our administrator also performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include, among other things, being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our stockholders. In addition, our administrator assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of our administrator&#146;s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of the compensation of our chief financial officer, chief compliance officer and our allocable portion of the compensation of their respective administrative support staff. Under the Administration Agreement, our administrator will also provide on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies that request such assistance. Unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms, the Administration Agreement will remain in effect if approved annually by our Board. On August 6, 2015, the Board approved the renewal of the Administration Agreement. The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days&#146; written notice to the other party. To the extent that our administrator outsources any of its functions, we will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any incremental profit to our administrator. Stockholder approval is not required to amend the Administration Agreement. 

Our administrator also provides administrative services to our Investment Advisor. As a result, the Investment Advisor will also reimburse our administrator for its allocable portion of our administrator&#146;s overhead, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions for the Investment Advisor, and its allocable portion of the compensation of any administrative support staff. 

The Administration Agreement provides that, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of its duties or by reason of the reckless disregard of its duties and obligations, our administrator and its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with it are entitled to indemnification from Capitala Finance for any damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and amounts reasonably paid in settlement) arising from the rendering of our administrator&#146;s services under the Administration Agreement or otherwise as administrator for Capitala Finance.

Alala, McGlinn and Broyhill, and a team of eighteen additional investment professionals. The Investment Advisor may hire additional investment professionals, based upon its needs, in the future. See &#147;&#151; Investment Advisory Agreement.&#148; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, we reimburse our administrator for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, the fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions, and the compensation of our chief financial officer, chief compliance officer, and their respective administrative support staff. See &#147;&#151; Administration Agreement.&#148; 

VALUATION PROCESS AND DETERMINATION OF NET ASSET VALUE We determine the net asset value of our investment portfolio each quarter by subtracting our total liabilities from the fair value of our gross assets. 

We conduct the valuation of our assets, pursuant to which our net asset value shall be determined, at all times consistent with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;) and the 1940 Act. Our valuation procedures are set forth in more detail below: 

Securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange shall be valued at such price as of the closing price on the day of valuation. We may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, we determine whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. If determined adequate, we use the quote obtained. 

Securities for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of our Investment Advisor or the Board, does not represent fair value, which we expect will represent a substantial majority of the investments in our portfolio, shall be valued as follows: (i) each portfolio company or investment is initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment; (ii) preliminary valuation conclusions are documented and discussed with our senior management; (iii) independent third-party valuation firms engaged by, or on behalf of, the Board will conduct independent appraisals, review management&#146;s preliminary valuations and prepare separate preliminary valuation conclusions on a selected basis such that each portfolio investment shall be independently reviewed at least annually (investments will not be selected for such review, however, if they (a) have a value as of the previous quarter of less than 1.0% of our gross assets as of the previous quarter, or (b) have a value as of the current quarter of less than 1.0% of our gross assets as of the previous quarter, after taking into account any repayment of principal during the current quarter); and (iv) the Board will discuss valuations and determine the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of the Investment Advisor and, where appropriate, the respective third-party valuation firms. 

The recommendation of fair value will generally be based on the following factors, as relevant: 

&#149; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; &#149; the portfolio company&#146;s ability to make payments; &#149; the portfolio company&#146;s earnings and discounted cash flow; &#149; the markets in which the issuer does business; and &#149; comparisons to publicly traded securities. Securities for which market quotations are not readily available or for which a pricing source is not sufficient may include, but are not limited to, the following: 

&#149; private placements and restricted securities that do not have an active trading market; &#149; securities whose trading has been suspended or for which market quotes are no longer available; &#149; debt securities that have recently gone into default and for which there is no current market; &#149; securities whose prices are stale; &#149; securities affected by significant events; and &#149; securities that the investment adviser believes were priced incorrectly. 

&#160;

&#160;

Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates not susceptible to substantiation by auditing procedures. Accordingly, under current auditing standards, the notes to our financial statements will refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our financial statements. In addition, the SBA has established certain valuation guidelines for SBICs to follow when valuing portfolio investments. 

In making the good faith determination of the value of these securities, we start with the cost basis of the security, which includes the amortized original issue discount and paid-in-kind interest or dividends, if any. We prepare the valuations of our investments in portfolio companies using the most recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts. We also consult updates that we receive from senior management members at portfolio companies, whether solicited for valuation purposes, or received in the ordinary course of our portfolio monitoring or due diligence process. These updates include information such as industry trends, new product development or service offerings and other operational or strategic issues. 

For debt securities that are not publicly traded or for which there is no market, we begin with our investment rating of the security as described above. Using this investment rating, we seek to determine the value of the security as if we intended to sell the security in a current sale. The factors that may be taken into account in arriving at fair value include the following, as applicable: the portfolio company&#146;s ability to service its interest and principal payment obligations, its estimated earnings and projected discounted cash flows, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the financial environment in which the portfolio company operates, comparisons to securities of similar publicly traded companies, statistical ratios compared to lending standards and to other similarly situated securities and other relevant factors. 

As part of the valuation process, the audit committee reviews the preliminary evaluations prepared by the independent valuation firm engaged by the Board, as well as management&#146;s valuation recommendations. Management and the independent valuation firm respond to the preliminary evaluation to reflect comments provided by the audit committee. The audit committee reviews the final valuation report and management&#146;s valuation recommendations and makes a recommendation to the Board based on its analysis of the methodologies employed and the various weights that should be accorded to each portion of the valuation as well as factors that the independent valuation firm and management may not have considered in their evaluation process. The Board then evaluates the audit committee recommendations and undertakes a similar analysis to determine the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith. 

Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments, and the differences could be material. Additionally, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to differ from the valuations assigned at any time. For a discussion of the risks inherent in determining the fair value of securities for which readily available market values do not exist, see &#147;Risk Factors.&#148; 

Determinations in Connection with Offerings In connection with certain future offerings of shares of our common stock, our Board or an authorized committee thereof will be required to make the determination that we are not selling shares of our common stock at a price below the then current net asset value of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made. Our Board or an authorized committee thereof will consider the following factors, among others, in making such a determination: 

&#149; the net asset value of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC; &#149; our management&#146;s assessment of whether any material change in the net asset value of our common stock has occurred (including through the realization of gains on the sale of our portfolio securities) during the period beginning on the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value of our common stock and ending as of a time within 48 hours (excluding Sundays and holidays) of the sale of our common stock; and 

&#160;

&#160;

&#149; the magnitude of the difference between (i) a value that our Board or an authorized committee thereof has determined reflects the current (as of a time within 48 hours, excluding Sundays and holidays) net asset value of our common stock, which is based upon the net asset value of our common stock disclosed in the most recent periodic report that we filed with the SEC, as adjusted to reflect our management&#146;s assessment of any material change in the net asset value of our common stock since the date of the most recently disclosed net asset value of our common stock, and (ii) the offering price of the shares of our common stock in the proposed offering. Moreover, to the extent that there is even a remote possibility that we may (i) issue shares of our common stock at a price per share below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock at the time at which the sale is made or (ii) trigger the undertaking (which we provide in certain registration statements we file with the SEC) to suspend the offering of shares of our common stock if the net asset value per share of our common stock fluctuates by certain amounts in certain circumstances until the prospectus is amended, our Board will elect, in the case of clause (i) above, either to postpone the offering until such time that there is no longer the possibility of the occurrence of such event or to undertake to determine the net asset value per share of our common stock within two days prior to any such sale to ensure that such sale will not be below our then current net asset value per share and, in the case of clause (ii) above, to comply with such undertaking or to undertake to determine the net asset value per share of our common stock to ensure that such undertaking has not been triggered. 

These processes and procedures are part of our compliance policies and procedures. Records will be made contemporaneously with all determinations described in this section and these records will be maintained with other records that we are required to maintain under the 1940 Act. 

COMPETITION We compete for investments with other BDCs and investment funds (including private equity funds, mezzanine funds and other SBICs), as well as traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and other sources of funding. Additionally, competition for investment opportunities has emerged among alternative investment vehicles, such as Collateralized Loan Obligations (&#147;CLO&#148;) and other BDCs, some of which are sponsored by other alternative asset investors, as these entities have begun to focus on making investments in smaller and lower middle-market companies. As a result of these new entrants, competition for our investment opportunities may intensify. Many of these entities have greater financial and managerial resources than we do. We believe we will be able to compete with these entities primarily on the basis of our experience and reputation, our willingness to make smaller investments than other specialty finance companies, the contacts and relationships of our Investment Advisor, our responsive and efficient investment analysis and decision-making processes, and the investment terms we offer. 

We believe that certain of our competitors may make first- and second-lien loans with interest rates and returns that will be comparable to or lower than the rates and returns that we will target. Therefore, we will not seek to compete solely on the interest rates and returns that we offer to potential portfolio companies. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risk Relating to Our Business and Structure &#151; We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses.&#148; 

ELECTION TO BE TAXED AS A RIC As a BDC, the Company has elected to be treated, and intends to comply with the requirements to continue to qualify annually, as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements (as described below). In addition, to qualify for RIC tax treatment we must distribute to our stockholders, for each taxable year, at least 90% of our &#147;investment company taxable income,&#148; which generally is our ordinary income plus the excess of our realized net short-term capital gains over our realized net long-term capital losses (the &#147;Annual Distribution Requirement&#148;). 

&#160;

&#160;

TAXATION AS A RIC For any taxable year in which we: 

&#149; qualify as a RIC; and &#149; satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our income we distribute to stockholders. We will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rates on any income or capital gains not distributed to our stockholders. 

We will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we distribute in a timely manner an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which we paid no corporate-level U.S. federal income tax (the &#147;Excise Tax Distribution Requirement&#148;). 

In order to qualify as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must, among other things: 

&#149; continue to qualify as a BDC under the 1940 Act at all times during each taxable year; &#149; derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to loans of certain securities, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, net income from certain &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships,&#148; or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in such stock or securities (the &#147;90% Income Test&#148;); and &#149; diversify our holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year: &#149; at least 50% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. Government securities, securities of other RICs, and other securities if such other securities of any one issuer do not represent more than 5% of the value of our assets or more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer; and &#149; no more than 25% of the value of our assets is invested in the securities, other than U.S. government securities or securities of other RICs, of one issuer, of two or more issuers that are controlled, as determined under applicable Code rules, by us and that are engaged in the same or similar or related trades or businesses or of certain &#147;qualified publicly traded partnerships&#148; (the &#147;Diversification Tests&#148;). Qualified earnings may exclude such income as management fees received in connection with our SBIC subsidiaries or other potential outside managed funds and certain other fees. 

In accordance with certain applicable Treasury regulations and private letter rulings issued by the IRS, a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash must receive a pro rata amount of cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20% of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these Treasury regulations or private letter rulings. 

We may be required to recognize taxable income in circumstances in which we do not receive cash. For example, if we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with PIK interest or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same 

&#160;

&#160;

taxable year. We may also have to include in income other amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as PIK interest, deferred loan origination fees that are paid after origination of the loan or are paid in non-cash compensation such as warrants or stock, or certain income with respect to equity investments in foreign corporations. Because any original issue discount or other amounts accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 

Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally will be treated as capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss generally will be long-term or short-term, depending on how long we held a particular warrant. 

Although we do not presently expect to do so, we are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while our debt obligations and other senior securities are outstanding unless certain &#147;asset coverage&#148; tests are met. Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or the Excise Tax Distribution Requirement, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. If we are prohibited from making distributions or are unable to obtain cash from other sources to make the distributions, we may fail to qualify as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. 

In addition, we will be partially dependent on our SBIC subsidiaries for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirements. Our SBIC subsidiaries may be limited by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to maintain our status as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA&#146;s restrictions for our SBIC subsidiaries to make certain distributions to maintain our RIC status. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. If our SBIC subsidiaries are unable to obtain a waiver, compliance with the SBA regulations may cause us to fail to qualify as a RIC, which would result in us becoming subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax. 

The remainder of this discussion assumes that we will qualify as a RIC and have satisfied the Annual Distribution Requirement. 

Any transactions in options, futures contracts, constructive sales, hedging, straddle, conversion or similar transactions, and forward contracts will be subject to special tax rules, the effect of which may be to accelerate income to us, defer losses, cause adjustments to the holding periods of our investments, convert long-term capital gains into short-term capital gains, convert short-term capital losses into long-term capital losses or have other tax consequences. These rules could affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to stockholders. We do not currently intend to engage in these types of transactions. 

A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its &#147;investment company taxable income&#148; (which is, generally, ordinary income plus net realized short-term capital gains in excess of net realized long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed gross taxable income (e.g., as the result of large amounts of equity-based compensation), we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may for tax purposes have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, you may receive a larger capital gain distribution than you would have received in the absence of such transactions. 

Investment income received from sources within foreign countries, or capital gains earned by investing in securities of foreign issuers, may be subject to foreign income taxes withheld at the source. In this regard, 

&#160;

&#160;

withholding tax rates in countries with which the United States does not have a tax treaty are often as high as 35% or more. The United States has entered into tax treaties with many foreign countries that may entitle us to a reduced rate of tax or exemption from tax on this related income and gains. The effective rate of foreign tax cannot be determined at this time since the amount of our assets to be invested within various countries is not now known. We do not anticipate being eligible for the special election that allows a RIC to treat foreign income taxes paid by such RIC as paid by its stockholders. 

If we acquire stock in certain foreign corporations that receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as interest, dividends, rents, royalties or capital gain) or hold at least 50% of their total assets in investments producing such passive income (&#147;passive foreign investment companies&#148;), we could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional interest charges on &#147;excess distributions&#148; received from such companies or gain from the sale of stock in such companies, even if all income or gain actually received by us is timely distributed to our stockholders. We would not be able to pass through to our stockholders any credit or deduction for such a tax. Certain elections may, if available, ameliorate these adverse tax consequences, but any such election requires us to recognize taxable income or gain without the concurrent receipt of cash. We intend to limit and/or manage our holdings in passive foreign investment companies to minimize our tax liability. 

Foreign exchange gains and losses realized by us in connection with certain transactions involving non-dollar debt securities, certain foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency option contracts, foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currencies, or payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency are subject to Code provisions that generally treat such gains and losses as ordinary income and losses and may affect the amount, timing and character of distributions to our stockholders. Any such transactions that are not directly related to our investment in securities (possibly including speculative currency positions or currency derivatives not used for hedging purposes) could, under future Treasury regulations, produce income not among the types of &#147;qualifying income&#148; from which a RIC must derive at least 90% of its annual gross income. 

ACQUISITION OF PORTFOLIO ASSETS OF THE LEGACY FUNDS We believe that our acquisition of the Legacy Funds&#146; portfolio assets in exchange for shares of our common stock generally was tax free to us and the Legacy Funds. As a result, our initial adjusted basis in the Legacy Funds&#146; portfolio assets was equal to the Legacy Funds&#146; adjusted basis in such assets immediately prior to our acquisition of such assets increased by any gain recognized by the Legacy Funds as a result of such transaction. Such adjusted basis will be used in determining the amount of our taxable gain or loss upon a sale or other disposition of such assets. To the extent that such assets had built-in gain (i.e., assets whose fair market value exceeds our tax basis at the time we acquired them) on the date of acquisition, when such gain is recognized by us upon a sale or other disposition such assets, we will be required to distribute such gain to our shareholders in order to eliminate our liability for corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such gain and possibly to maintain our qualification as a RIC under the Code. Investors will be subject to tax on the distribution even though such gain accrued prior to our acquisition of such assets and even though the distribution effectively represents a return of their investment. 

In addition, to the extent that any beneficial owner of interests in the Legacy Funds on the date of our acquisition of the Legacy Funds&#146; portfolio assets was a C corporation (a &#147;corporate partner&#148;), we will be required to pay a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on the net amount of any such built-in gains attributable to the corporate partners that we recognize during the ten-year period (or shorter applicable period) beginning on the date of acquisition. Alternatively, we may make a special election to cause the gain to be recognized at the time of the acquisition. In that event, the Legacy Funds would be required to recognize such built-in gain as if a proportionate share of such Funds&#146; assets were sold at the time of the acquisition. We do not anticipate making this election at this time. Any corporate-level built-in gain tax is payable at the time the built-in gains are recognized (which generally will be the years in which the built-in gain assets are sold in a taxable transaction). The amount of this tax will vary depending on the assets that are actually sold by us in this 10-year period (or shorter applicable period), the actual amount of net built-in gain or loss present in those assets as of the acquisition date and effective tax rates. The payment of any such 

&#160;

&#160;

corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on built-in gains will be a company expense that will be borne by all shareholders (not just any former corporate partners) and will reduce the amount available for distribution to shareholders. 

FAILURE TO QUALIFY AS A RIC If we fail to satisfy the 90% Income Test or the Diversification Tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless continue to qualify as a RIC for such year if certain relief provisions are applicable (which may, among other things, require us to pay certain corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes or to dispose of certain assets). 

If we were unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC and the foregoing relief provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates, regardless of whether we make any distributions to our stockholders. Distributions would not be required, and any distributions would be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and, subject to certain limitations, may be eligible for the 20% maximum rate for noncorporate taxpayers provided certain holding period and other requirements were met. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate distributees would be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder&#146;s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. To requalify as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year, we would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and dispose of any earnings and profits from any year in which we failed to qualify as a RIC. Subject to a limited exception applicable to RICs that qualified as such under the Code for at least one year prior to disqualification and that requalify as a RIC no later than the second year following the nonqualifying year, we could be subject to tax on any unrealized net built-in gains in the assets held by us during the period in which we failed to qualify as a RIC that are recognized within the subsequent 10 years (or shorter applicable period), unless we made a special election to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on such built-in gain at the time of our requalification as a RIC. 

REGULATION A BDC is regulated by the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by public stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately owned companies. 

We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company&#146;s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 

As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not interested persons, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we will be required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we will be prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person&#146;s office. 

As a BDC, we are generally required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our gross assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. We may also be 

&#160;

&#160;

prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not interested persons and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. 

We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure &#151; Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital and the way in which we do so.&#148; We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve our policy and practice of making such sales. In any such case, under such circumstances, the price at which our common stock to be issued and sold may not be less than a price which, in the determination of our Board, closely approximates the market value of such common stock. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. 

As a BDC, we are generally limited in our ability to invest in any portfolio company in which our Investment Advisor or any of its affiliates currently has an investment or to make any co-investments with our Investment Advisor or its affiliates without an exemptive order from the SEC, subject to certain exceptions. 

We will be periodically examined by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 

As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure.&#148; 

QUALIFYING ASSETS Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC&#146;s gross assets (the &#147;70% Test&#148;). The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our proposed business are the following: 

&#149; Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering, the issuer of which is an eligible portfolio company; &#149; Securities received in exchange for or distributed with respect to securities described in the bullet above or pursuant to the exercise of options, warrants or rights relating to such securities; and &#149; Cash, cash items, government securities or high quality debt securities (within the meaning of the 1940 Act), maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. An eligible portfolio company is generally a domestic company that is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by a BDC) and that: 

&#149; does not have a class of securities with respect to which a broker may extend margin credit at the time the acquisition is made; &#149; is controlled by the BDC and has an affiliate of the BDC on its Board; &#149; does not have any class of securities listed on a national securities exchange; &#149; is a public company that lists its securities on a national securities exchange with a market capitalization of less than $250 million; or &#149; meets such other criteria as may be established by the SEC. Control, as defined by the 1940 Act, is presumed to exist where a BDC beneficially owns more than 25% of the outstanding voting securities of the portfolio company. 

In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in eligible portfolio companies, or in other securities that are consistent with its purpose as a BDC. 

&#160;

&#160;

MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE TO PORTFOLIO COMPANIES BDCs generally must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities significant managerial assistance, except in circumstances where either (i) the business development company controls such issuer of securities or (ii) the business development company purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together and one of the other persons in the group makes available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. 

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS Pending investment in other types of &#147;qualifying assets,&#148; as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC under the Code. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. Our Investment Advisor will monitor the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 

SENIOR SECURITIES We are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. On June 10, 2014, we received an exemptive order from the SEC granting relief from the asset coverage requirements for certain indebtedness issued by Fund II and Fund III as SBICs. In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our gross assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure.&#148; 

CODE OF ETHICS We and our Investment Advisor have adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain transactions by our personnel. Our code of ethics generally does not permit investments by our employees in securities that may be purchased or held by us. You may read and copy our code of ethics at the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. You may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. You may also obtain copies of the code of ethics, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at the following email address: publicinfo@sec.gov, or by writing the SEC&#146;s Public Reference Section, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Our code of ethics is also available on our website at http://www.capitalagroup.com . 

COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES We and our Investment Advisor have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. Richard G. Wheelahan, III currently serves as our chief compliance officer. 

&#160;

&#160;

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly-held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 

&#149; pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; &#149; pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; &#149; pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management is required to prepare an annual report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. When we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to audit our internal controls over financial reporting; and &#149; pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the 1934 Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 

PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to the Investment Advisor. The proxy voting policies and procedures of the Investment Advisor are set forth below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by the Investment Advisor and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of the proxy voting policies and procedures described below, &#147;we,&#148; &#147;our&#148; and &#147;us&#148; refers to the Investment Advisor. 

Introduction An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients. 

These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our Investment Advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 

Proxy Policies We will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interest of our clients&#146; stockholders. We will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients&#146; portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 

Our proxy voting decisions will be made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients&#146; investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision making process disclose to our managing member any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 

&#160;

&#160;

Proxy Voting Records You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Capitala Investment Advisors, LLC, 4201 Congress Street, Suite 360, Charlotte, North Carolina 28209. 

PRIVACY PRINCIPLES We are committed to maintaining the privacy of our stockholders and to safeguarding their non-public personal information. The following information is provided to help you understand what personal information we collect, how we protect that information and why, in certain cases, we may share information with select other parties. 

Generally, we do not receive any non-public personal information relating to our stockholders, although certain non-public personal information of our stockholders may become available to us. We do not disclose any non-public personal information about our stockholders or former stockholders to anyone, except as permitted by law or as is necessary in order to service stockholder accounts (for example, to a transfer agent or third-party administrator). 

We restrict access to non-public personal information about our stockholders to employees of our Investment Advisor and its affiliates with a legitimate business need for the information. We will maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to protect the non-public personal information of our stockholders. 

SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANY REGULATIONS Fund II and Fund III, which are our wholly-owned subsidiaries, are licensed to act as SBICs and are regulated by the SBA. As of December 31, 2015, investments in Fund II and Fund III accounted for approximately 12.4% and 46.5%, respectively, of our total portfolio. As of December 31, 2015 Fund II and Fund III had $34.2 million and $150.0 million, respectively, of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding under the SBIC program. Fund II and Fund III are fully drawn and may not make borrowings in excess of their aggregate $184.2 million of SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding as of December 31, 2015. 

The SBIC licenses allow our SBIC subsidiaries to borrow funds by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a capital commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. The SBA regulations require, among other things, that a licensed SBIC be examined periodically and audited by an independent auditor to determine the SBIC&#146;s compliance with the relevant SBA regulations. SBA-guaranteed debentures are non-recourse, interest-only debentures with interest payable semi-annually and have a ten year maturity. The principal amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures is not required to be paid prior to maturity but may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The interest rate of SBA-guaranteed debentures is fixed at the time of issuance at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with 10-year maturities. 

SBICs are designed to stimulate the flow of private equity capital to eligible small businesses. Under current SBA regulations, a licensed SBIC may provide capital to those entities that have a tangible net worth not exceeding $19.5 million and an average annual net income after U.S. federal income taxes not exceeding $6.5 million for the two most recent fiscal years. In addition, a licensed SBIC must devote 25.0% of its investment activity to those entities that have a tangible net worth not exceeding $6.0 million and an average annual net income after U.S. federal income taxes not exceeding $2.0 million for the two most recent fiscal years. The SBA regulations also provide alternative size standard criteria to determine eligibility, which depend on the industry in which the business is engaged and are based on factors such as the number of employees and gross sales. The SBA regulations permit licensed SBICs to make long-term loans to small businesses, invest in the equity securities of such businesses and provide them with consulting and advisory services. The SBA also places certain limitations on the financing terms of investments by SBICs in portfolio companies and prohibits SBICs from providing funds for certain purposes or to businesses in a few prohibited industries. Compliance with SBA requirements may cause Fund II and Fund III to forego attractive investment opportunities that are not permitted under SBA regulations.

Further, the SBA regulations require that a licensed SBIC be periodically examined and audited by the SBA to determine its compliance with the relevant SBA regulations. The SBA prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a &#147;change of control&#148; of an SBIC or transfers that would result in any person (or a group of persons acting in concert) owning 10.0% or more of a class of capital stock of a licensed SBIC. If either Fund II or Fund III fails to comply with applicable SBA regulations, the SBA could, depending on the severity of the violation, limit or prohibit Fund II&#146;s and Fund III&#146;s use of debentures, declare outstanding debentures immediately due and payable, and/or limit Fund II and Fund III from making new investments. Such actions by the SBA would, in turn, negatively affect us because Fund II and Fund III are our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Fund II and Fund III were in compliance with the terms of the SBA&#146;s leverage as of December 31, 2015 as a result of having sufficient capital as defined under the SBA regulations. 

In December 2015, the 2016 omnibus spending bill approved by Congress and signed into law by the President increased the amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that affiliated SBIC funds can have outstanding from $225.0 million to $350.0 million, subject to SBA approval. SBA regulations currently limit the amount that an SBIC subsidiary may borrow to a maximum of $150 million when it has at least $75 million in regulatory capital. Affiliated SBICs are permitted to issue up to a combined maximum amount of $350 million when they have at least $175 million in regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2015, Fund II had $26.2 million in regulatory capital and $34.2 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding and Fund III had $75.0 million in regulatory capital and $150.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding. 

On June 10, 2014, we received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the 200% asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. This provides us with increased flexibility under the 200% asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to $184.2 million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief. 

Our SBIC subsidiaries are subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA, including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants. Receipt of SBIC licenses does not assure that our SBIC subsidiaries will receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding, which is dependent upon our SBIC subsidiaries continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies. The SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to our SBIC subsidiaries&#146; assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate our SBIC subsidiaries or the SBA exercises its remedies under the SBA-guaranteed debentures issued by our SBIC subsidiaries upon an event of default.
