 ITEM 1: BUSINESS 

Fidelity D &#38; D Bancorp, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on August 10, 1999, and is a bank holding company, whose wholly-owned state chartered commercial bank is The Fidelity Deposit and Discount Bank (the Bank) (collectively, the Company). The Company is headquartered at Blakely and Drinker Streets in Dunmore, Pennsylvania. 

The Bank has offered a full range of traditional banking services since it commenced operations in 1903. The Bank has a personal and corporate trust department and also provides alternative financial and insurance products with asset management services. A full list of services provided by the Bank is detailed in the section entitled &#8220;Products and Services&#8221; contained &#160; 

&#160;

within the 201 5 Annual Report to Shareholders, incorporated by reference. The service area is comprised of the Borough of Dunmore and the surrounding communities within Lackawanna and Luzerne counties in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The Company had 1 64 full-time equivalent employees on December 31, 201 5 , which includes exempt officers, exempt, non-exempt and part-time employees. 

The banking business is highly competitive, and the success and profitability of the Company depends principally on its ability to compete in its market area. Competition includes, among other sources: local community banks; savings banks; regional banks; national banks; credit unions; savings &#38; loans; insurance companies; money market funds; mutual funds; small loan companies and other financial services companies. The Company has been able to compete effectively with other financial institutions by emphasizing customer service enhanced by local decision making. These efforts enable the Company to establish long-term customer relationships and build customer loyalty by providing products and services designed to address their specific needs. 

The banking industry is affected by general economic conditions including the effects of inflation, recession, unemployment, real estate values, trends in national and global economies and other factors beyond the Company&#8217;s control . T he Company&#8217;s success is dependent, to a significant degree, on economic conditions in Northeastern Pennsylvania, especially within Lackawanna and Luzerne counties which the Company defines as its primary market area. An economic recession or a delayed economic recovery over a prolonged period of time in the Company&#8217;s market could cause an increase in the level of the Company&#8217;s non-performing assets and loan losses, and thereby cause operating losses, impairment of liquidity and erosion of capital. There are no concentrations of loans that, if lost, would have a material adverse effect on the continued business of the Company. There is no material concentration within a single industry or a group of related industries that is vulnerable to the risk of a near-term severe impact. 

The Company&#8217;s profitability is significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. The Company&#8217;s loan portfolio is comprised principally of residential real estate, commercial and commercial real estate loans. The properties underlying the Company&#8217;s mortgages are concentrated in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Credit risk, which represents the possibility of the Company not recovering amounts due from its borrowers, is significantly related to local economic conditions in the areas where the properties are located as well as the Company&#8217;s underwriting standards. Economic conditions affect the market value of the underlying collateral as well as the levels of adequate cash flow and revenue generation from income-producing commercial properties. 

During 201 5 , the national economy continued to improve with the unemployment rate dropping to its lowest level since the second quarter of 2008 . Similarly, the unemployment rate in the Company&#8217;s local statistical market, Scranton-Wilkes-Barre, declined to &#160; 4.6 %, down 16%, from 5.5 % at the end of 201 4 . This was a positive sign for the local economy which had lagged behind the national unemployment rate for years. Even as the region&#8217;s unemployment rate slowly rebounded in 2013 and 2014, it was often the result of discouraged workers exiting the labor force rather than job growth. Throughout 2015, that trend reversed with both a larger labor force and an increase in jobs contributing to the lower unemployment. The Company&#8217;s credit function strives to mitigate the negative impact of economic conditions by maintaining strict underwriting principles for commercial and consumer lending and ensuring that home mortgage underwriting adheres to the standards of secondary market makers. In addition, the Company strives to accelerate the property foreclosure process thereby lessening the negative financial impact of foreclosed property ownership. Refer to Item 1A, &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the Company.
