&#160; 

Business Strategy 

&#160;

MJ Holdings owns and leases real estate to licensed marijuana operators. Additionally, MJ Holdings plans to explore ancillary opportunities in the regulated marijuana industry.

&#160;

The Company does not and will not, until such time as Federal law allows, grow, harvest, distribute or sell marijuana or any substances that violate the laws of the United States of America.

&#160;

We have devised our current business strategy based on certain limitations related to the legal status of marijuana under federal law and the fact that we are a public company and make certain representations and warranties in connection with our public filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. We recognize the significant opportunities in the legalized marijuana space and believe that using our current business model, we can position ourselves to not only develop a significant business along our current path, but be able to leverage our position, relationships and assets to capitalize on additional opportunities in the future, if and when federal law reconciles with state law; resulting in the federal legalization of marijuana.

&#160; 

We Own and Lease Real Estate zoned for legalized marijuana operations. 

&#160;

We own and lease real estate, including retail and industrial space, to licensed marijuana operators. Our opportunity exists, due to the fact that certain landlords have been resistant to lease to marijuana operators due to its status under federal law, and as a result, landlords who are willing to lease to marijuana tenants may be able to lease the property at a premium to current market rents.

&#160;

Financing Real Estate Transactions 

&#160;

To date, we have financed our real estate acquisitions through the issuance of debt and equity. In the future and as needed, we may employ additional financing and ownership structures and incentives to secure our capital needs.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

We face significant competition from a diverse mix of market participants, including but not limited to, other public companies with similar business models, independent investors, hedge funds and other real estate investors, hard money lenders, as well as would be clients, marijuana operators themselves, all of whom, who may compete against us in our efforts to acquire real estate zoned for marijuana grow and retail operations. In some instances, we will be competing to acquire real estate with persons who have no interest in the marijuana business, but have identified value in a piece of real estate that we may be interested in acquiring. Our greatest competitive threat will likely come from banks, if and when they begin servicing marijuana operators, as the interest rates offered by banks are typically lower than those we can offer.

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Availability of Suitable Properties 

&#160;

We believe that the opportunity exists to acquire suitable properties of different sizes to accommodate the varying needs of prospective tenants.

&#160; 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We don't own any intellectual property, other than common law rights to our logo and trade dress. We do own various internet domain names which we may develop into internet properties and brands at some point in the future.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Federal Laws 

&#160;

The U.S. Government classifies marijuana as a schedule-I controlled substance; and as a result, in accordance to Federal law marijuana is an illegal substance. Even in those jurisdictions in which the use of medical marijuana has been legalized at the state level, its prescription is a violation of federal law. The United States Supreme Court has ruled in United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop. and Gonzales v. Raich that it is the federal government that has the right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes. Therefore, federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana pre-empts state laws that legalizes its use for medicinal purposes. Federal prosecutions of marijuana crimes, where the operators are acting in accordance with state law are rare, this is as a result of U.S. Justice department policies of the current presidential administration, to allow states to implement these laws and not prosecute anyone operating in accordance with applicable state law.

&#160;

While different presidential administrations may maintain a similar policy position towards marijuana, and while as a growing number of states vote to legalize marijuana for medical and recreational use, which may result in a reconciliation of Federal and state laws legalizing marijuana, it is possible that a future presidential administration could reverse course on the progress made towards marijuana legalization, and seek to enforce federal laws and thereby eliminating the legal marijuana industry. 

&#160;

As of the date of this annual report, the Company derives revenue from state-approved marijuana growers and dispensary facilities. While we do not grow or distribute marijuana; deriving rental income from state-approved marijuana growers and dispensary facilities could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of federal law. We intend to remain within the guidelines outlined in the Cole Memo (see the &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;), which does not alter the Department of Justice&#8217;s authority to enforce federal law, including federal laws relating to marijuana, but does recommend that U.S. Attorneys prioritize enforcement of federal law away from the marijuana industry operating as permitted under certain state laws, so long as certain conditions are met. Where the individual state framework fails to protect the public, the Justice Department has instructed federal prosecutors to enforce the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. However, we cannot provide assurance that the Company is in full compliance with the Cole Memo or any other federal laws or regulations.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s ongoing and future business plans rely in part, on our ability to successfully establish and maintain effective controls that follow the United States Treasury Department&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (&#8220;FinCEN&#8221;) Guidance, &#8220;BSA Expectations Regarding Marijuana-Related Businesses,&#8221; in vetting and monitoring potential tenants, customers and clients of the Company. On February 14, 2014, FinCEN issued guidance to clarify Bank Secrecy Act (&#8220;BSA&#8221;) expectations for financial institutions seeking to provide services to marijuana-related businesses. FinCEN issued this guidance in light of certain state initiatives to legalize certain marijuana-related enforcement priorities. The FinCEN guidance clarifies how financial institutions can provide services to marijuana-related businesses consistent with their BSA obligations, and aligns the information provided by financial institutions in BSA reports with federal and state law enforcement priorities. This FinCEN guidance is intended to enhance the availability of financial services for, and the financial transparency of, marijuana-related businesses.

&#160;

While we are not subject to the BSA or FinCEN guidelines, we expect to implement policies and procedures that mirror the stated goals of the FinCEN guidelines to comply with the federal government&#8217;s stated objectives with respect to the potential conflict of law. The Company anticipates using FinCEN Guidelines, as may be amended, as the basis for assessing its relationships with potential tenants.

&#160;

State Laws 

&#160;

As of 2014, 24 US States have passed laws permitting state licensed healthcare practitioners to recommend marijuana for medical use and permit its residents the use of marijuana for medical and or therapeutic purposes; of which four states and the District of Columbia permit recreational use and an additional 11 states have laws permitting low tetrahydrocannabinol THC, high cannabidiol (CBD) strains for limited conditions. &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Local Laws; Zoning 

&#160;

Local laws at the city, county and municipal level add an additional layer of complexity to legalized marijuana. Despite a State's having adopted legislation legalizing marijuana, cities, counties and municipalities, within the state seem to have the ability to otherwise restrict marijuana activities, including but not limited to cultivation, retail or consumption.

&#160;

The effect of local laws and changes based on legal challenges or policy changes will have a direct effect on the values of property we seek to acquire, as more properties are zoned for marijuana operations and or as cities with large populations that may have previously restricted marijuana, ease those restrictions, properties within those cities may become more attractive and real estate prices in neighboring communities, outside those populist hubs, may decline and the corresponding rents they draw. In the event that we have long term leases in place and our tenants remain in good standing, this should not affect our short term cash-flows.

&#160;

Zoning sets forth the approved use of land in any given city, county or municipality. Zoning is set by local governments and may otherwise be restricted by state laws; for example, under certain state laws a seller of liquor may not be allowed to operate within 1,000 feet of a school. There are and or will be similar restrictions imposed on marijuana operators, which will restrict how and where marijuana operations can be located and the manner and size of which they can grow and operate. Additionally, zoning is subject to change, properties can be re-zoned and a given zoning may be withdrawn. How properties are zoned will have a direct impact on our business operations, additionally we expect to require the assistance of local counsel, as needed to ensure that properties we may acquire are properly zoned. We intend to seek to purchase property that has the appropriate zoning in place for our tenants operations.
