 Item 1. Business 

Introduction 

We are one of the world&#8217;s leading manufacturers of firearms and a provider of quality accessory products for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiast. We manufacture a wide array of handguns (including revolvers and pistols), long guns (including modern sporting rifles, bolt action rifles, and single shot rifles), handcuffs, and firearm-related products and accessories for sale to a wide variety of customers, including gun enthusiasts, collectors, hunters, sportsmen, competitive shooters, individuals desiring home and personal protection, law enforcement and security agencies and officers, and military agencies in the United States and throughout the world. We are one of the largest manufacturers of handguns, modern sporting rifles, and handcuffs in the United States and an active participant in the hunting rifle market. We are also a leading provider of shooting, hunting, and outdoor accessories, including reloading, gunsmithing, gun cleaning supplies, tree saws, and vault accessories. We sell our products under the Smith &#38; Wesson, M&#38;P, Thompson/Center Arms, Caldwell Shooting Supplies, Wheeler Engineering, Tipton Gun Cleaning Supplies, Frankford Arsenal Reloading Tools, Lockdown Vault Accessories, Hooyman Premium Tree Saws, BOG-POD, and Golden Rod Moisture Control brands. 

We manufacture our firearm products at our facilities in Springfield, Massachusetts; Houlton, Maine; and Deep River, Connecticut; and we develop and market our accessories products at our facility in Columbia, Missouri. We plan to continue to capitalize on the goodwill developed through our historic 164 year old &#8220;Smith &#38; Wesson&#8221; brand as well as our other well-known brands by expanding consumer awareness of the products we produce. 

Our objective is to continue to enhance our position as one of the world&#8217;s leading firearm manufacturers and to become a leading provider of quality accessory products for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiast. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this objective are as follows: 

&#160;

&#183; 

develop, produce, and market high-quality, innovative products that meet the needs and desires of consumers and professionals; 

&#160;

&#183; 

protect and grow our core firearm business; 

&#160;

&#183; 

continue to expand our rapidly growing accessories business with the ongoing introduction of new products; 

&#160;

&#183; 

focus on profitable growth opportunities, including those in the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets; 

&#160;

&#183; 

streamline and standardize our business operations; 

&#160;

&#183; 

emphasize customer satisfaction and loyalty; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

expand our pursuit of strategic relationships and acquisitions that are synergistic with our current business, particularly through acquisitions of businesses involved in the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets. 

We estimate that the domestic non-military firearm market based on industry shipments is approximately $2.2 billion for handguns and $1.5 billion for long guns, excluding shotguns, with our market share in calendar 2015 being approximately 19% and 5%, respectively. According to 2014 reports by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, the U.S. firearm manufacturing industry has grown at a compound annual growth rate in units of 10% from 2009 through 2014. 

We estimate that the domestic firearm accessories and equipment market based on hunting-related expenditures is approximately $1.5 billion. 

Our wholly owned subsidiary, Smith &#38; Wesson Corp., was founded in 1852 by Horace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson. Mr. Wesson purchased Mr. Smith&#8217;s interest in 1873. The Wesson family sold Smith &#38; Wesson Corp. to Bangor Punta Corp. in 1965. Lear Siegler Corporation purchased Bangor Punta in 1984, thereby acquiring ownership of Smith &#38; Wesson Corp. Forstmann Little &#38; Co. purchased Lear Siegler in 1986 and sold Smith &#38; Wesson Corp. shortly thereafter to Tomkins Corporation, an affiliate of U.K.-based Tomkins PLC. We purchased Smith &#38; Wesson Corp. from Tomkins in May 2001 and changed our name to Smith &#38; Wesson Holding Corporation in February 2002. 

On January 3, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Thompson Center Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Thompson/Center Arms Company, Inc. (now Thompson/Center Arms Company, LLC), or collectively TCA, which is a brand name recognized by hunting enthusiasts and which holds a leading position in the black powder segment of the long gun market. In addition, TCA possesses expertise in long gun barrel manufacturing, which is important to our manufacture of long 

&#160;

&#160;

guns. TCA entered the bolt-action rifle market in June 2007 by launching internally developed new products with key differentiating features and benefits, such as certified ac curacy, integral sight bases, and a three position safety. 

On July 20, 2009, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Universal Safety Response, Inc. (since renamed SWSS LLC, formerly Smith &#38; Wesson Security Solutions, Inc. and referred to herein as SWSS). Based on a combination of factors occurring after the acquisition, including federal and corporate budgetary constraints, increased price competition, and a fundamental change in strategic direction, we completed the disposition of SWSS on July 26, 2012. The operating results of SWSS are classified as discontinued operations and are presented in a separate line in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented. Reference is made to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of discontinued operations. Prior to the decision to divest the business, we had reported this business as a separate division under the heading of security solutions. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts reported throughout this Form 10-K represent only our continuing operations. 

Effective as of April 30, 2014, our manufacturing agreement with Carl Walther GmbH under which we produced the Walther PPK and PPK/S pistols in the United States at our Houlton, Maine facility expired. In addition, as of April 30, 2013, we did not extend our distribution agreement to serve as the exclusive U.S. importer and distributor of Walther firearms. Walther manufactures our full size M&#38;P22 pistols and will continue to do so through the end of fiscal 2017. 

On May 5, 2014, we acquired substantially all of the net assets of Tri-Town Precision Plastics, Inc., or TTPP, a provider of custom injection molding services, rapid prototyping, and tooling, which we refer to as the DRP Acquisition. TTPP was a long-standing supplier of polymer frames and related components for a large number of our firearms, including nearly all of our popular M&#38;P models. The DRP Acquisition was designed to vertically integrate a key component of our manufacturing operations and provide us with increased flexibility within our supply chain.

On December 11, 2014, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of Battenfeld Acquisition Company Inc., including its wholly owned subsidiary, Battenfeld Technologies, Inc., or BTI, a leading provider of hunting and shooting accessories, which we refer to as the BTI Acquisition. The BTI Acquisition was designed to allow us to expand our presence in the firearm accessories and rugged outdoor markets and leverage BTI&#8217;s broad portfolio of hunting and shooting accessories brands that are popular with consumers. 

We maintain our principal executive offices at 2100 Roosevelt Avenue, Springfield, Massachusetts 01104. Our telephone number is (800) 331-0852. Our website is located at www.smith-wesson.com . Through our website, we make available free of charge our annual reports on Form 10-K, our proxy statements, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to any of them filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These documents are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. We also post on our website the charters of our Audit, Compensation, and Nominations and Corporate Governance Committees; our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Code of Conduct, and any amendments or waivers thereto; and any other corporate governance materials contemplated by the regulations of the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The documents are also available in print by contacting our corporate secretary at our executive offices. 

Strategy 

Our objective is to continue to enhance our position as one of the world&#8217;s leading firearm manufacturers and to become a leading provider of quality accessory products for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this objective are as follows:

&#160;

Develop, Produce, And Market High Quality, Innovative Products

&#160;

We are focused on developing, producing, and marketing high-quality, innovative products that meet the needs and desires of consumers and professionals. Our ongoing research and development, product engineering, and marketing activities are critical components of our ability to develop, introduce, produce, and sell successful products. 

&#160;

Protect and Grow Our Core Firearm Business 

&#160;

We plan to protect and grow our core firearm business by continuing to enhance our presence in our existing domestic and international markets by capitalizing on our brands such as Smith &#38; Wesson, M&#38;P, and Thompson/Center Arms and introducing innovative new products. We continually seek to introduce new products to increase our current market share, especially in the polymer handgun market as represented by our M&#38;P brand. In addition, the largest portion of our business historically resulted from the sale of handguns in the domestic sporting goods market. With the acquisition of Thompson/Center Arms in fiscal 2007 and the 

&#160;

&#160;

introduction of our modern sporting rifles, we expanded our business into multiple segments of the long gun market. During the last two fiscal years, we have intr oduced numerous new handgun and long gun models, including our M&#38;P22 Compact pistol; product extensions of our M&#38;P9, M&#38;P40, and M&#38;P45 pistols; M&#38;P10; non-laser M&#38;P Bodyguard .380; Model 66 Combat Magnum revolver; and the Model 69 Magnum revolver. We plan t o continue to introduce new firearm products in fiscal 2017. 

&#160;

Continue to Expand Our Rapidly Growing Accessories Business

&#160;

We plan to continue to expand our rapidly growing accessories business with the ongoing introduction of new products that support the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets. We will continue to enhance our presence in our existing domestic and international markets as well as new markets, capitalizing on our brands such as Caldwell Shooting Supplies, Wheeler Engineering, Tipton Gun Cleaning Supplies, Thompson/Center Arms, Frankford Arsenal Reloading Tools, Lockdown Vault Accessories, Hooyman Premium Tree Saws, BOG-POD, and Golden Rod Moisture Control.

Focus on Profitable Growth Opportunities 

We plan to focus on growth, but only in those areas that provide an acceptable rate of return, within the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor markets. In order to meet those profitability goals, we are primarily focused on leveraging existing products and introducing new products when appropriate. In addition, we are continuing our focus on capacity utilization, strategic pricing and marketing initiatives, flexible manufacturing, standardized process, and vertical integration for efficiency and scalability. With the acquisition of BTI in fiscal 2015, we expanded our business into the shooting accessories and rugged outdoor markets. During fiscal 2016, we introduced a variety of new shooting, hunting, and outdoor products, and we plan to continue to introduce new products in fiscal 2017.

Streamline and Standardize Our Business Operations 

We are continuing our efforts to enhance our manufacturing productivity in terms of increased daily production quantities, increased operational availability of equipment, reduced machinery down time, extended machinery useful life, reduced overtime, increased efficiency, enhanced product quality, and expanded outsourcing. We plan to continue to seek gains in manufacturing efficiency and capacity to assure that we can meet customer demand for our most popular products. We also plan to continue to streamline and standardize our business, which includes investing in an integrated and configurable technology infrastructure in areas such as enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and compliance. During fiscal 2016, we continued to improve and enhance our ERP systems as we converted our Deep River, Connecticut facility to SAP, and we intend to continue investing in improving our systems in order to enhance our efficiency, improve information reporting, and strengthen internal controls. These system improvements include implementing SAP at our additional facilities if we believe such an implementation would help us achieve these objectives. We intend to convert our Columbia, Missouri facility to SAP in fiscal 2017.

Emphasize Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty 

We plan to continue to emphasize customer satisfaction and loyalty by offering high-quality products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis and by offering customer service, training, and support. We regard our high quality, innovative products as the most important aspect of our customer satisfaction and loyalty, but we also offer customer service and support with various programs, such as toll free customer support numbers, email customer question and answer communication, broad service policies, and product warranties. 

Expand Our Pursuit of Strategic Relationships and Acquisitions that are Synergistic with Our Current Business 

We plan to expand our pursuit of strategic relationships and acquisitions that expand our manufacturing capabilities or are involved in the shooting, hunting, or rugged outdoor markets. For example, in fiscal 2015, the DRP Acquisition was designed for vertical integration and the BTI Acquisition was designed to allow us to expand our presence in the accessories and outdoors markets and to leverage BTI&#8217;s broad portfolio of hunting and shooting accessories brands. In addition, our strategic alliance with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems is primarily designed to assist us in the pursuit of the U.S. Army&#8217;s Modular Handgun System solicitation.

Firearm Products and Services 

&#160;

General

Our firearm products combine our legacy of 164 years of American manufacturing and engineering expertise with modern technological advances. We strive to leverage our tradition of innovation in materials, performance, and engineering, along with our proven history of reliability, to produce feature-rich, safe, durable, accurate, and high-performing firearms that satisfy the needs of our broad range of customers. Our introduction of new firearm products is intended to enhance our competitive position and broaden our participation in the overall firearm market. 

We have substantially enhanced the breadth and quality of our portfolio of firearm products over the years. We have always been a leader in the revolver market. The introduction of our popular M&#38;P branded pistol in January 2005 resulted in our company becoming one of the leaders in the polymer pistol market serving both law enforcement agencies and the consumer sporting goods market. The launch of our M&#38;P branded modern sporting rifle in January 2006 has enabled us to capture what we estimate is the leading share of the modern sporting rifle market. The addition of our Thompson/Center Arms brand of hunting firearms and interchangeable firearm systems into our product portfolio in January 2007 also enhanced our long gun barrel manufacturing capabilities for our modern sporting rifles. We currently participate in three categories of the long gun market: bolt action rifles, muzzleloaders, and modern sporting rifles; and both core categories of the handgun market, namely semi-automatic pistols and revolvers. 

All of our firearms are currently sold under our Smith &#38; Wesson, M&#38;P, and Thompson/Center Arms brands. Our Performance Center offers specialized and enhanced models sold under the Smith &#38; Wesson and M&#38;P brands. Depending upon the product or service, our customers include distributors; federal, state, and municipal law enforcement agencies and officers; government and military agencies; businesses; retailers; and consumers. 

Our product development strategy is to understand our customers&#8217; needs and then design and develop products to uniquely meet those needs. Throughout the process, we test multiple concepts with firearm owners and potential purchasers. We compare these test results against a growing database of prior concepts to identify those with the greatest market potential. Additional market research is completed to optimize the desired features and benefits. While this development process is ongoing, our launch timing for new products depends on market conditions to maximize sales across the entire product portfolio. In fiscal 2016, we launched several new products and product line extensions under our Smith &#38; Wesson, M&#38;P, and Thompson/Center Arms brands as well as several new products from our Performance Center. 

The demand for our concealed carry products continued to increase in fiscal 2016. We have capitalized on that demand by shipping our one millionth M&#38;P Shield during fiscal 2016, less than four years since the product&#8217;s introduction in 2012. We also introduced a variety of new products in fiscal 2016 by expanding our M&#38;P branded products to include new models with tritium night sights. In addition, we partnered with Crimson Trace to launch new M&#38;P models with Crimson Trace green Laserguards on our M&#38;P Bodyguard 380, M&#38;P Shield, as well as our compact and full size M&#38;P pistols. 

Within our M&#38;P branded products, we introduced the next generation models of our popular M&#38;P modern sporting rifle series, including our center-fire and rimfire models. Our M&#38;P &#174; 15 SPORT &#8482; II is an opening price point modern sporting rifle and comes complete with a forward bolt assist and dust cover. Our M&#38;P &#174; 15-22 SPORT &#8482; series of .22LR rifles feature an enhanced M&#38;P slim handguard with Magpul M-LOK accessory mounting capability and also includes Magpul MBUS front and rear sights as standard equipment.

In fiscal 2016, we expanded our Smith &#38; Wesson branded products with the introduction of the newest generation .22LR target pistol, the SW22 Victory. This firearm is e ngineered as a modern interpretation of the classic target pistol. The SW22 Victory is a highly versatile, accurate, and affordable .22LR target pistol suitable for multiple sporting applications. 

Our customers continue to demand premium firearms that provide a competitive edge in sport shooting and handgun hunting. Our Performance Center products are engineered and manufactured to meet this need with many custom features not found on our standard products, such as enhanced triggers for smoother trigger pull, ported barrels for better muzzle control, and specialty sights for quicker target acquisition. During fiscal 2016, we expanded our Performance Center M&#38;P pistols with the introduction of our M&#38;P Shield with factory ported slide and barrel, the M&#38;P C.O.R.E with a factory threaded barrel, and our M&#38;P full-size 9mm with a ported and threaded barrel. We also introduced our Performance Center M&#38;P 15-22 SPORT that includes a two stage trigger, match grade barrel, new slim handguard with Magpul M-LOK mounting capability and Magpul MBUS folding sights. 

We continued to focus on growing our bolt action rifle business while maintaining our leadership in muzzleloaders and interchangeable systems within our Thompson/Center Arms brand. In fiscal 2016, we introduced two new Thompson/Center Arms firearms: the Compass and the T/C Strike. The Compass is an opening price point bolt action rifle available in ten different calibers 

&#160;

&#160;

that features a free floating, threaded barrel that is available in two lengths, as well as an adjustable trigger, and a removable rotary magazine. The Compass, as with all of our Th ompson/Center Arms bolt action rifles, incorporates 5R rifling, which provides accuracy and bullet stability over multiple shots. Our T/C Strike is a muzzleloader that offers innovative features, such as a striker fire system, a breach system that allows t he consumer to utilize different powder types, and a Stealth Striker TM system that reduces the noise when the hammer is pulled back to cock the firearm. The primer adapter threads on our T/C Strike are on the outside of the barrel, thus preventing seized b reech plugs and assisting in cleaning. 

Our firearm business is seasonal with revenue generally peaking in our fourth fiscal quarter ending April 30 as a result of most industry events and distributor shows being scheduled during the early spring months. In addition, because of our operating schedule, which includes a summer and a winter shutdown of our firearm facilities, we have increased operating days during our fourth fiscal quarter, which allows our shipping and production volumes to exceed other quarters. 

Our firearm net sales for the years ended April 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $657.6 million, $531.2 million, and $626.6 million, respectively. Firearms gross profit for the years ended April 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014 totaled $261.2 million, $188.6 million, and $259.1 million, respectively. Total assets for our firearm business totaled $458.1 million and $345.3 million as of April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Reference is made to our consolidated financial statements, commencing on page F-1 of this report, for more information regarding our firearm business. 

Sales of our handguns accounted for $485.4 million in net sales, or 67.1% of our net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, $395.5 million in net sales, or 71.7% of our net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015, and $423.0 million in net sales, or 67.5% of our net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2014. Sales of long guns accounted for $127.6 million in net sales, or 17.7% of our net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, $90.2 million in net sales, or 16.3% of our net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015, and $155.3 million in net sales, or 24.8% of our net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2014. Sales of other products and services accounted for $44.6 million in net sales, or 6.2% of our net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, $45.0 million in net sales, or 8.2% of our net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015, and $42.7 million in net sales, or 6.8% of our net sales, for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2014. 

Handguns 

We currently manufacture an extensive variety of handgun models that include revolvers and pistols. A revolver is a handgun with a cylinder that holds the ammunition in a series of rotating chambers that are successively aligned with the barrel of the firearm during each firing cycle. There are two general types of revolvers: single-action and double-action. To fire a single-action revolver, the hammer is pulled back to cock the firearm and align the cylinder before the trigger is pulled. To fire a double-action revolver, a single trigger pull advances the cylinder as it cocks and releases the hammer. A pistol is a handgun in which the ammunition chamber is an integral part of the barrel and which is fed ammunition from a magazine contained in the grip. The firing cycle ejects the spent casings and loads a new round into the chamber. 

We have long been known as an innovator and a leader in the revolver market and most of our revolvers are currently marketed under the Smith &#38; Wesson brand. We sell a wide range of sizes from small-frame, concealed carry revolvers used primarily for personal protection to large-frame revolvers used primarily for recreational and competitive sport shooting. Our extra-large frame revolvers are designed primarily to address the handgun-hunting market. 

Our small-frame revolvers have been carried by law enforcement personnel and personal defense-minded citizens for 164 years. We hold a number of patents on various firearm applications, including the use of scandium, a material that possesses many of the same attributes as titanium but at a more reasonable cost. Our revolvers are available in a variety of models and calibers, with applications in virtually all professional and consumer markets. 

We offer pistols under both our Smith &#38; Wesson brand and our M&#38;P brand. Our full size and compact M&#38;P pistol products have been engineered with input from the professional users and are designed to offer performance, safety, and durability that meet the standards of global law enforcement and military personnel, as well as to contain features attractive to consumers. We believe that our M&#38;P branded pistol products are the most ergonomic, feature-rich, and innovative products on the market today. Our range of full size and compact M&#38;P pistol products are made with a polymer frame, a rigid stainless steel chassis, and a black, through-hardened corrosion resistant finished stainless steel barrel and slide for durability. Our M&#38;P pistol products feature patented and easily changed palmswell grips in three sizes, allowing the user to customize grips in a matter of seconds; a passive trigger safety to prevent the pistol from firing if dropped; an enlarged trigger guard to accommodate gloved hands; a sear lever release that eliminates the need to press the trigger in order to disassemble the firearm; an ambidextrous slide stop and reversible magazine release to accommodate right- and left-handed shooters; an optional internal locking system and magazine safety; and a universal equipment rail to allow the addition of accessories, including lights and lasers. 

&#160;

&#160;

In fiscal 2012, we launched the M&#38;P Shield pistol to address the growing personal protection and concealed carry market. The M&#38;P Shield features a slim concealable profile, 9mm and .40S&#38;W calibers, and M &#38;P ergonomics. We introduced additional M&#38;P Shield models during fiscal 2016. We consider the M&#38;P Shield pistol to be one of the most popular firearms in the market, having surpassed the one million unit shipment mark in fiscal 2016. 

Our Performance Center has been providing specialized products and services for the most demanding shooting sports enthusiasts since 1990. To meet the requirements of law enforcement professionals, competitive shooters, collectors, and discriminating sport enthusiasts who demand superior firearm products, our Performance Center personnel conceptualize, engineer, and craft firearm products from the ground up. Our craftsmen, many of whom are actively involved in competitive shooting, are highly skilled and experienced gunsmiths. Performance Center products are offered under both the Smith &#38; Wesson brand and the M&#38;P brand and are typically made in limited production quantities, although we offer a number of catalog variations in order to enhance product availability. 

Our &#8220;Classics&#8221; department makes it possible to own historic firearms that are manufactured today but modeled after original favorites, such as the Model 29, the firearm made famous by the movie character Dirty Harry. These firearms are newly crafted with designs that take advantage of some of the most famous and collectible guns that we have ever made. Our Classics department also makes commemorative firearms and employs master engravers to craft one-of-a-kind custom firearms. These custom-made applications reflect the skill and vision of the master engraver and the artistic expression of the owner. We offer a number of catalog variations of Classics and engraved Classics to our customers. 

Long Guns 

Our M&#38;P branded modern sporting rifles are specifically designed to satisfy the functionality and reliability needs of global military, law enforcement, and security personnel. These long guns are also popular as hunting and sporting target rifles and are sold to consumers through our sporting good distributors, retailers, and dealers. We offer M&#38;P modern sporting rifles in four different calibers (.22LR, 5.56mm NATO (.223), .300 Whisper, and .308 Winchester (7.62x51mm)) for multiple recreational and professional uses. We also offer upper assemblies so gun owners can easily modify their M&#38;P to suit the needs and tasks of the various forms of sport shooting and hunting. Our broad product portfolio of modern sporting rifles includes a .22 caliber model, an opening price-point sport model, a hunting caliber for longer range effectiveness, and several models designed for the exclusive use of military and law enforcement agencies throughout the world. 

We manufacture three lines of bolt-action rifles under our Thompson/Center Arms brand consisting of several models in each line. These long guns are offered in up to 15 different calibers. Bolt-action rifles operate by the cycling of a bolt handle that allows for both the loading and unloading of rounds via a magazine fed system. This design allows for multi-round capacity and a level of strength that permits larger calibers. Bolt action rifles are the most popular firearm among hunters because of their reputation for accuracy, reliability, and relatively light-weight design. 

Under our Thompson/Center Arms brand, we also offer five lines of high-quality American-made single shot &#8220;black powder,&#8221; or &#8220;muzzleloader,&#8221; firearms. Ammunition for our black powder firearms are loaded through the muzzle rather than the breech, as is the case with conventional firearms. Our black powder firearms are highly accurate, dependable rifles configured with muzzleloading barrels for hunting. Black powder firearms are purchased by hunting enthusiasts, primarily for use during exclusive black powder hunting seasons for hunting big game, such as deer and elk. 

We offer two models of interchangeable, single shot firearm systems that deliver numerous gun, barrel, caliber configurations, and finishes. These firearm systems can be purchased fully assembled or as frame assemblies that can be configured by the owner as a center-fire rifle, rim-fire rifle, shotgun, black powder firearm, or single-shot handgun for use across the entire range of big- and small-game hunting. As a result, a firearm owner can easily change barrels, stocks, and forends, resulting in &#8220;one gun for all seasons&#8221; that can be continuously modified to suit the needs and tasks of the owner for various forms of sport shooting and hunting.

As a result, we license our trademarks to third parties for use in connection with their products and services. Products of our licensees are distributed throughout the world. As of April 30, 2016, we licensed our trademarks to 10 different companies that market and sell products complementing our products, four less than in fiscal 2015. Three of these license agreements were cancelled as a result of our accessories division being able to source, produce, and market the same products.

&#160;

Marketing, Sales, and Distribution 

General 

We go to market in three primary ways in our firearm division: two-step distribution, strategic retailers, and buying groups consisting of certain large, regional retailers utilizing a direct sales force to service these customers. We also sell firearms directly to law enforcement agencies. In our accessories division, we go to market through two-step distribution, strategic retailers, and direct-to-dealer sales utilizing a combination of direct sales and sales representatives. We make our overseas sales primarily through distributors, which in turn sell to retail stores and government agencies. Our top five commercial distributors in the United States accounted for a total of 34.1% and 34.3%, respectively, of our net sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015. Those commercial distributors are not regional and have many of the same dealer customers. Therefore, we believe that the loss of one or more of the distributors would not materially impact sales, as the remaining distributors would be allocated additional sales. 

We market our products to consumers primarily through independent dealers, large retailers, in-store retail channels, and range operations utilizing consumer-focused product marketing and promotional campaigns, which include print, broadcast, and digital advertising campaigns; social and electronic media; and in-store retail merchandising systems and strategies. We are also an industry leader in vertical print media as gauged by our regular tracking of editorial coverage in numerous outdoor magazines, including such leaders as Guns &#38; Ammo , American Rifleman , Shooting Times , American Handgunner , Shooting Illustrated , Outdoor Life , American Hunter , and Field &#38; Stream . We also sponsor numerous outdoor television and radio programs that generate significant editorial exposure. 

We sponsor a significant number of firearm safety, shooting, and hunting events and organizations. We print various product catalogs that are distributed to our dealers and mailed directly, on a limited basis, to consumers. We also attend various trade shows, 

&#160;

&#160;

such as the Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show, the NRA Annual Meeting &#38; Exhibits, the Nationa l Association of Sporting Goods Wholesalers Show, the International Association of Chiefs of Police Show, the AUSA Show, the IWA Show in Europe, and various distributor, buying group, and consumer shows. 

For the fiscal years ended April 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, advertising and promotion expenses amounted to $21.8 million, $20.2 million, and $19.5 million, respectively, excluding the cost of rebates and promotions reflected in gross profit. 

We sell our products worldwide. International sales accounted for 3%, 4%, and 3% of our net sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Our firearm business had no assets located outside the United States during any of the periods presented; our accessories business owns tooling that is located at various suppliers in Asia. 

E-Marketing 

We utilize our www.smith-wesson.com , www.tcarms.com , and www.btibrands.com websites to market our products and services and to provide a wide range of information regarding our company to customers, consumers, dealers, distributors, investors, and government and law enforcement agencies worldwide. We utilize e-marketing, including social and digital marketing such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and e-blasts to our consumer and trade customers to provide additional product and service information to such customers. 

Retail 

We operate online retail stores from which we sell hunting and shooting accessories under the Smith &#38; Wesson, M&#38;P, Thompson/Center Arms, Caldwell, Wheeler, Tipton, Frankford A r s enal, Lockdown, Hooyman, BOG-POD, and Golden Rod branded products, apparel, and related hunting and shooting supplies. Firearms are not sold through the online retail stores. 

Service and Support 

Our firearm division operates a toll free customer service number from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, and offers a customer service e-mail option to answer questions and resolve issues regarding our firearm products. In addition, we offer a limited one year warranty program and a lifetime service policy under which we repair defects in material or workmanship in our firearm products without charge for as long as the original purchaser owns the firearm. We also maintain a number of authorized warranty centers throughout the world and provide both warranty and charge repair services at our facilities.

Our accessories division operates a toll free customer service number from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Central Time, Monday through Friday to answer questions and resolve issues regarding our accessories products. We offer a limited one year or a limited lifetime warranty program to the original purchaser of our accessories products, depending on the product purchased.

Manufacturing 

We have three manufacturing facilities for our firearm products: a 575,000 square-foot facility located in Springfield, Massachusetts; a 38,000 square-foot facility located in Houlton, Maine; and a 150,000 square-foot facility located in Deep River, Connecticut. We conduct our handgun and long gun manufacturing and most of our specialty service activities at our Springfield facility. We historically utilized our Houlton facility for the production of metal pistols, handcuffs, and other restraint devices, but in fiscal 2015, our Houlton facility was converted into a machining center and all its assembly, finishing, and small parts operations were transferred to our Springfield facility. We continue to produce handcuffs and other restraint devices at our Houlton facility. Our Deep River facility is utilized for custom plastic injection molding services, rapid prototyping, and tooling. We have a 145,000 square-foot warehousing and assembly facility for our accessories products located in Columbia, Missouri. All of our facilities are ISO 9001 certified. In addition, we source a significant portion of the shooting, hunting, and outdoor accessories that we sell from third-party contract manufacturers including those located in Asia.

We perform most of the machining and all of the assembly, inspection, and testing of the firearms manufactured at our facilities. Every firearm is test fired before shipment. Our major firearm components are cut by computer-assisted machines, and we employ sophisticated automated testing equipment to assist our skilled employees to ensure the proper functioning of our firearms. Our Springfield and Houlton facilities are currently operating on two shift patterns; a four shift, 168 hour per week schedule and a three shift, 120 hour per week schedule. We seek to minimize inventory costs through an integrated planning and production system. During fiscal 2014, we transitioned to a new ERP system in our Springfield and Houlton facilities to SAP, and we transitioned our Deep River facility to SAP during fiscal 2016. We intend to continue investing in improving our systems in order to enhance efficiency, improve information reporting, and strengthen internal controls. We also intend to convert our Columbia, Missouri facility to SAP in fiscal 2017.

&#160;

&#160;

Suppli ers 

Although we manufacture most of the components for our firearms, we purchase certain components and parts, including bolt carriers, rifle receivers, magazines, slides, small parts, barrels, and rifle stocks, from third parties. We also purchase ammunition for product testing. Most of our major suppliers for our firearm-division products are U.S.-based and provide materials, components, and parts, such as raw steel, polymer components, and metal-injected-molded components. The costs of these materials, components, and parts are at competitive rates. We have become increasingly dependent on a small number of key vendors that supply components and parts for our firearms as a result of our decision to enhance our manufacturing flexibility by using third parties that can supplement our internal capacity to better react to changes in market conditions. We also use numerous raw materials, such as steel, wood, lead, brass, and plastics, in producing and testing our products. We have alternative sources for these raw materials. Most of our major suppliers for our accessories-division products are based in Asia.

Research and Development; New Product Introductions 

Through our advanced products engineering departments, we enhance existing products and develop new firearm and accessories products. In fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014, our gross spending on research activities relating to the development of new products was $10.0 million, $6.9 million, and $5.6 million, respectively. As of April 30, 2016, we had 56 employees at our Springfield, Massachusetts and Columbia, Missouri facilities engaged in ongoing research and development activities for both our firearm and accessories products as part of their responsibilities. 

Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights 

We recognize the importance of innovation and the importance of protecting our intellectual property. Accordingly, we own numerous patents related to our firearm, handcuff, and accessories products. We apply for patents whenever we develop new products or processes deemed commercially viable. We do not believe that our business is materially dependent on any single patent. 

Because of the significance of our brand names, trademarks, trade dress, and copyrights also are important to our business. We have an active global program of trademark registration, monitoring, and enforcement. We believe that our SMITH &#38; WESSON and S&#38;W monogram trademarks, as well as our M&#38;P and Thompson/Center Arms brands are known and recognized by the public worldwide and are important to our business. In addition, we market our accessories products under several brand names, including Caldwell Shooting Supplies, Wheeler Engineering, Tipton Gun Cleaning Supplies, Frankford Arsenal Reloading Tools, Lockdown Vault Accessories, Hooyman Premium Tree Saws, BOG-POD, and Golden Rod Moisture Control, among others. 

We intend to vigorously pursue and challenge infringements of our patents, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, and service marks, as we believe the goodwill associated with them is a cornerstone of our branding and licensing strategy. 

Competition 

The firearm industry is dominated by a small number of well-known companies. We encounter competition from both domestic and foreign manufacturers. Some competitors manufacture a wide variety of firearms as we do, while the majority of our competitors manufacture only certain types of firearms. We are one of the largest manufacturers of handguns, modern sporting rifles, and handcuffs in the United States and an active participant in the hunting rifle market. We compete primarily based upon innovation, quality, reliability, durability, price, performance, consumer brand awareness, and customer service and support. Our customer service organization is proactive in offering timely responses to customer inquiries. We believe we can effectively compete with all our present competitors. 

Our primary competitors are Ruger and Taurus in the revolver market and Glock, Ruger, Sig Sauer, and Springfield Armory in the pistol market. We compete primarily with Colt, Sig Sauer, Ruger, Bushmaster, Daniel Defense, and DPMS in the modern sporting rifle market and Browning, Marlin, Remington, Ruger, Savage, Weatherby, CVA, Traditions, and Winchester in the hunting rifle market. 

Peerless Handcuff Company is the only major handcuff manufacturer with significant market share in the United States that directly competes with us. As a result of competitive foreign pricing, we sell nearly 90% of our handcuffs and restraints in the United States. 

Our competitors in the accessories market are not as clearly defined as the firearms market because of the broad range of brand names and products. Our primary competitor in the accessories market is Vista Outdoors. Other notable competitors to our accessories brands include Hyskore, Hornady, Laserlyte, Lyman, Birchwood Casey, and MTM Case-Gard.

&#160;

&#160;

Customers 

We sell our firearm products and services through a variety of federally licensed distribution channels. Depending upon the product or service, our firearm customers include distributors; federal, state, and municipal law enforcement agencies and officers; government and military agencies; businesses; retailers; and consumers. Our accessories customers are generally businesses, retailers, and consumers. The ultimate users of our firearm and accessories products include shooting and outdoor enthusiasts, collectors, sportsmen, competitive shooters, hunters, individuals desiring home and personal protection, law enforcement and military personnel and agencies, and other government organizations. 

During fiscal 2016, 6.5% of our firearm net sales were to state and local law enforcement agencies and the federal government, 3.1% of our firearm net sales were to international customers; and the remaining 90.4% of our firearm net sales were through federal firearm licensees to domestic consumers. Our domestic firearm net sales are primarily made to distributors that sell to licensed dealers that in turn sell to the end users. In some cases, we sell directly to large retailers and dealers.

Net sales of our accessories products during fiscal 2016 were 6.6% to international customers and 93.4% to domestic customers. 

We grant payment terms to most commercial customers ranging from 30 to 90 days. However, in some instances, we provide longer payment terms, particularly as it relates to our hunting dating programs. 

Governmental Regulations 

Our firearm business is primarily regulated by the ATF, which licenses the manufacture, sale, and import of firearms in the United States. The ATF conducts periodic audits of our firearm facilities. The U.S. Department of State currently oversees the export of firearms, and we must obtain an export permit for all international firearm shipments. 

There are also various state laws, regulations, and local ordinances relating to firearm characteristics, features, and sales, as well as firearm magazine capacities. Local firearm dealers must comply with state and local laws, regulations, and ordinances pertaining to firearms and magazine sales within their jurisdictions. We manufacture several firearm models and magazines with various capacities that comply with those laws, regulations, and ordinances for sales in those states and localities. In Massachusetts, for example, there are regulations related to the weight of the trigger pull, barrel length, material strength, and independent testing of handguns. California, Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York, as well as other states, the District of Columbia, and other localities, have similar laws, ordinances, and restrictions. In addition, California requires new pistols to contain a microstamping mechanism, which must be able to etch or imprint, in two locations, a microstamp array of characters that identify the make, model, and serial number of the pistols onto each cartridge case when the pistol is fired. No commercially produced firearm has utilized the microstamping process, which is considered by many to be unfeasible, and we have no plans to utilize any microstamping feature in our firearms. Therefore, we will not sell into the state of California any pistol that is subject to the microstamping feature requirement. 

Warnings and instructions concerning the safe operation of our firearms are contained in Safety &#38; Instruction Manuals included in all boxes in which firearms are shipped and are also available for download from our Smith &#38; Wesson and Thompson/Center Arms websites.

Our accessories business is subject to various standard business regulations that apply to all companies whose products are used by consumers.

Environmental Health and Safety 

We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws that regulate both the health and safety of our workforce as well as our environmental liability, including, but not limited to, those regulations monitored by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), the National Fire Protection Association, and the Department of Public Health. Though not exhaustive, examples of applicable regulations include confined space safety, walking and working surfaces, machine guarding, and life safety. 

We are required to comply with regulations that mitigate any release into the environment. These laws require us to make significant expenditures of both a capital and expense nature. Several of the more significant federal laws applicable to our operations include the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA; and the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA. 

We are required to remediate hazardous waste at our facilities. Currently, we own a designated site in Springfield, Massachusetts that contains two release areas, which are the focus of remediation projects as part of the Massachusetts Contingency Plan, or MCP. The MCP provides a structured environment for the voluntary remediation of regulated releases. We may be required to 

&#160;

&#160;

remove hazardous waste or remediate the alleged effects of hazardous substances on the environment associated with past disposal practices at sites not owned by us. We have received notice that we are a potentially responsible party from the Environmental Protection Agency and/or individual states under CERCLA or a state equivalent at two sites. 

In our efforts to satisfy our environmental responsibilities and to comply with environmental laws and regulations, we have established, and periodically update, policies relating to the environmental standards of performance for our operations. We have in place programs that monitor compliance with various federal, state, and local environmental regulations. However, in the normal course of our manufacturing operations, we are subject to governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to waste disposal, air emissions, and water discharges from our operations into the environment. We regularly incur substantial capital and operating costs to comply with environmental laws, including remediation of known environmental conditions at our main facility in Springfield, Massachusetts, which we fund through cash flows from operations. We spent $782,000 in fiscal 2016 on environmental compliance, consisting of $474,000 for disposal fees and containers, $224,000 for remediation, $49,000 for DEP analysis and fees, and $35,000 for air filtration maintenance. Although we have potential liability with respect to the future remediation of certain pre-existing sites, we believe that we are in compliance with applicable material environmental laws, regulations, and permits. 

In the normal course of our business, we may become involved in various proceedings relating to environmental health and safety matters, and we are currently engaged in an environmental investigation and remediation. Our manufacturing facilities are located on properties with a long history of industrial use, including the use of hazardous substances. We have identified soil and groundwater contamination at our Springfield, Massachusetts plant that we are investigating, monitoring, or remediating, as appropriate. As of April 30, 2016, we had recorded a $694,000 environmental reserve in non-current liabilities. Our estimate of these costs is based upon currently enacted laws and regulations, currently available facts, experience in remediation efforts, existing technology, and the ability of other potentially responsible parties or contractually liable parties to pay the allocated portions of any environmental obligations. 

When the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability, that estimate has been used; when the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range has been used. We may not have insurance coverage for our environmental remediation costs. We have not recognized any gains from probable recoveries or other gain contingencies. We calculated the environmental reserve using undiscounted amounts based on independent environmental remediation reports obtained. 

On May 5, 2014, we acquired substantially all of the net assets of TTPP for $22.8 million, plus a $1.0 million working capital adjustment, for a total purchase price of $23.8 million, utilizing cash on hand. Under the asset purchase agreement, the former stockholder of TTPP indemnified us for losses arising from, among other things, environmental conditions related to its manufacturing activities. Of the purchase price, $3.0 million was placed in an escrow account, of which $250,000 remains available. A portion of the remaining escrow account will be applied to environmental remediation at the manufacturing site in Deep River, Connecticut. We believe the likelihood of environmental remediation costs exceeding the amount available in escrow to be remote. 

Based on information known to us, we do not expect current environmental regulations or environmental proceedings and claims to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the impact on us of future environmental compliance requirements or of the cost of resolution of future environmental health and safety proceedings and claims, in part because the scope of the remedies that may be required is not certain, liability under federal environmental laws is joint and several in nature, and environmental laws and regulations are subject to modification and changes in interpretation. There can be no assurance that additional or changing environmental regulation will not become more burdensome in the future and that any such development would not have a material adverse effect on our company. 

Employees 

As of May 31, 2016, we had 1,853 employees, including 31 part-time employees. Of these employees, 1,462 were engaged in manufacturing, 86 in sales and marketing, 40 in finance and accounting, 57 in research and development, 34 in information services, and 174 in various executive or other administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a union in collective bargaining with us. Of our employees, 18.6% have 10 or more years of service with our company and 11.9% have greater than 25 years of service with our company. We believe that our employee relations are good and that the high quality of our employee base is instrumental to our success.

Backlog 

As of April 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a backlog of orders for our firearm business of $304.4 million and $169.4 million, respectively. Our accessories business had a backlog of orders of $6.6 million and $9.8 million as of April 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our backlog consists of orders for which purchase orders have been received and which are generally scheduled for 

&#160;

&#160;

shipment within six months and subject to capacity constraints. We allow orders received that have not yet shipped to be cancelled, with cancellations being more likely in per iods following surges in demand. Therefore, our backlog may not be indicative of future sales.
