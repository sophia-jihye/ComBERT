General 

&#160; 

Advaxis, Inc. (&#8220;Advaxis&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary Lm -LLO cancer immunotherapies. These immunotherapies are based on a platform technology that utilizes live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes (&#8220; Lm &#8221; or &#8220;Listeria&#8221;) bioengineered to secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins. These Lm -LLO strains are believed to be a significant advancement in immunotherapy as they integrate multiple functions into a single immunotherapy as they access and direct antigen presenting cells to stimulate anti-tumor T-cell immunity, stimulate and activate the immune system with the equivalent of multiple adjuvants, and simultaneously reduce tumor protection in the tumor microenvironment to enable the T-cells to eliminate tumors. 

&#160; 

Axalimogene filolisbac (ADXS-HPV) is our lead Lm -LLO immunotherapy product candidate for the treatment of Human Papilloma Virus (&#8220;HPV&#8221;) associated cancers. We completed a randomized Phase 2 study in 110 patients with recurrent cervical cancer that was shown to have a manageable safety profile, apparent improved survival and objective tumor responses. In addition, the Gynecologic Oncology Group (&#8220;GOG&#8221;), now part of NRG Oncology, is conducting a cooperative group sponsored Phase 2 open-label clinical study of axalimogene filolisbac in patients with persistent or recurrent cervical cancer with documented disease progression. The study, known as GOG-0265, has successfully completed its first stage and has met the predetermined safety and efficacy criteria required to proceed into the second stage of patient recruitment. We plan to advance axalimogene filolisbac into a registrational clinical trial for the treatment of women with high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer. 

&#160; 

Axalimogene filolisbac has received United States Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) orphan drug designation for three HPV-associated cancers: cervical, head and neck, and anal cancer, and has received European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;) orphan drug designation for anal cancer. It is being evaluated in Company-sponsored trials executed under an Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) which include the following: i) a Phase 1/2 clinical trial alone and in combination with MedImmune, LLC&#8217;s (&#8220;MedImmune&#8221;) investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab (MEDI4736), in patients with previously treated metastatic cervical cancer and HPV-associated head and neck cancer; ii) a Phase 2 multi-center, open-label study alone and in combination with Incyte Corporation&#8217;s (&#8220;Incyte&#8221;) investigational oral indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor, epacadostat (INCB24360) in patients with Stage I-IIa cervical cancer; iii) a Phase 1/2 study evaluating higher doses and repeat cycles of axalimogene filolisbac in patients with recurrent cervical cancer; iv) a single arm Phase 2 monotherapy study in patients with metastatic anal cancer; and v) a Phase 2 study in collaboration with and funded by Global BioPharma Inc. (&#8220;GBP&#8221;), under a development and commercialization license agreement applicable to Asia, HPV-associated non-small cell lung cancer. In addition to Company-sponsored trials, axalimogene filolisbac is also being evaluated in three ongoing investigator-initiated clinical trials as follows: locally advanced cervical cancer (GOG-0265), head and neck cancer (Mount Sinai), and anal cancer (Brown University). 

&#160; 

ADXS-PSA is our Lm -LLO immunotherapy product candidate designed to target the Prostate Specific Antigen (&#8220;PSA&#8221;) associated with prostate cancer. This Phase 1/2 clinical trial in combination with KEYTRUDA&#174; (pembrolizumab), Merck &#38; Co.&#8217;s (&#8220;Merck&#8221;) humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1, is in patients with previously treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 

&#160; 

ADXS-HER2 is our Lm -LLO immunotherapy product candidate designed for the treatment of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (&#8220;HER2&#8221;) expressing cancers, including human and canine osteosarcoma, breast, gastric and other cancers. This Phase 1b clinical trial is in patients with metastatic HER2 expressing solid tumors. We received orphan drug designation from both the FDA and EMA for ADXS-HER2 in osteosarcoma. Clinical research with ADXS-HER2 in canine osteosarcoma is being developed by our pet therapeutic partner, Aratana Therapeutics Inc. (&#8220;Aratana&#8221;), who holds exclusive rights to develop and commercialize ADXS-HER2 and three other Lm -LLO immunotherapies for pet health applications. Aratana has announced that a product license application for use of ADXS-HER2 in the treatment of canine osteosarcoma has been filed with the United States Department of Agriculture (&#8220;USDA&#8221;). Aratana received communication from the USDA in March 2015 stating that the previously submitted efficacy data for product licensure for AT-014 (ADXS-HER2), the cancer immunotherapy for canine osteosarcoma, was accepted and that it provides a reasonable expectation of efficacy that supports conditional licensure. While additional steps need to be completed, including in the areas of manufacturing and safety, Aratana anticipates that AT-014 could receive conditional licensure from the USDA in 2016. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In October of 2015, we received notification from the FDA that the INDs for axalimogene filolisbac were put on clinical hold in response to our submission of a safety report to the FDA. The clinical hold also included the INDs for ADXS-PSA and ADXS-HER2. Following discussions with the FDA and in accordance with their recommendations, we agreed to implement certain risk mitigation measures, including revised study protocol inclusion / exclusion criteria, post-administration antibiotic treatment and patient surveillance and monitoring measures. In December 2015, the FDA notified us that the hold has been lifted with respect to our INDs. 

&#160; 

We have focused our development efforts on understanding our platform technology and establishing a drug development pipeline that incorporates this technology into therapeutic cancer immunotherapies, with clinical trials currently targeting HPV-associated cancer (cervical cancer, head and neck cancer and anal cancer), prostate cancer, and HER2-expressing cancers. Although no immunotherapies have been commercialized to date, we continue to invest in research and development to advance the technology and make it available to patients with many different types of cancer. Pipeline development and the further exploration of the technology for advancement entails risk and expense. We anticipate that our ongoing operational costs will increase significantly as we continue conducting and expanding our clinical development program. In addition to our existing single antigen vectors that target one tumor associated antigen, we are actively engaged in the development of new constructs that will address multiple targets that are common to tumor types, as well as mutation-associated neo-epitopes that are specific to an individual patient&#8217;s tumor. Lastly, we are developing certain internal capabilities to produce supplies for our neoepitope and our other programs. 

&#160; 

Clinical Pipeline 

&#160; 

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary Lm -LLO cancer immunotherapies. These immunotherapies are based on a platform technology that utilizes live attenuated Listeria monocytogenes bioengineered to secrete antigen/adjuvant fusion proteins. These Lm -LLO strains are believed to be a significant advancement in immunotherapy as they integrate multiple functions into a single immunotherapy as they access and direct antigen presenting cells to stimulate anti-tumor T-cell immunity, stimulate and activate the immune system with the equivalent of multiple adjuvants, and simultaneously reduce tumor protection in the tumor microenvironment to enable the T-cells to eliminate tumors. 

&#160; 

Axalimogene filolisbac Franchise 

&#160; 

Axalimogene filolisbac is an Lm -LLO immunotherapy directed against HPV and designed to target cells expressing the HPV. It is currently under investigation or planned investigation in four HPV-associated cancers: cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, anal cancer, and lung cancer, either as a monotherapy or in combination. 

&#160; 

Cervical Cancer 

&#160; 

There are 527,624 new cases of cervical cancer caused by HPV worldwide every year, and 14,377 new cases in the U.S. alone, according to the WHO Human Papillomavirus and Related Cancers in the World Summary Report 2014 (&#8220;WHO&#8221;). Current preventative vaccines cannot protect the 20 million women who are already infected with HPV. Challenges with acceptance, accessibility, and compliance have resulted in approximately a third of young women being vaccinated in the United States and even less in other countries around the world. 

&#160; 

We completed a randomized Phase 2 clinical study ( Lm -LLO-E7-15), conducted exclusively in India, in 110 women with recurrent/refractory cervical cancer. The final results were presented at the 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology (&#8220;ASCO&#8221;) Annual Meeting, and showed that 32% (35/109) of patients were alive at 12 months, 22% (24/109) of patients were Long-term Survivors (&#8220;LTS&#8221;) alive greater than 18 months, and 18% (16/91) evaluable with adequate follow-up) of patients were alive for more than 24 months. Of the 109 patients treated in the study, LTS included not only patients with tumor shrinkage but also patients who had experienced stable disease or increased tumor burden. 17% (19/109) of the patients in the trial had recurrence of disease after at least two prior treatments for their cervical cancer; these patients comprised 8% (2/24) of LTS. Among the LTS, 25% (3/12) of patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 2, a patient population that is often times excluded from clinical trials. Furthermore, a 10% objective response rate (including 5 complete responses and 6 partial responses) and a disease control rate of 38% (42/109) were observed. The addition of cisplatin chemotherapy to axalimogene filolisbac in this study did not significantly improve overall survival or objective tumor response ( p =0.9981). 

&#160; 

In this study, 109 patients received 254 doses of axalimogene filolisbac. Axalimogene filolisbac was found to be well tolerated with 38% (41/109) of patients experiencing mild to moderate Grade 1 or 2 transient adverse events associated with infusion; 1 patient experienced a Grade 3 Serious Adverse Events (&#8220;SAE&#8221;). All observed treatment related adverse events either self-resolved or responded readily to symptomatic treatment. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

The GOG (now a member of NRG Oncology), under the sponsorship of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (&#8220;CTEP&#8221;) of the National Cancer Institute (&#8220;NCI&#8221;), is independently conducting GOG-0265, an open-label, single arm Phase 2 study of axalimogene filolisbac in persistent or recurrent cervical cancer (patients must have received at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of their recurrent/metastatic disease, not including that administered as a component of primary treatment) at 21 clinical sites in the U.S. The first stage of enrollment in GOG-0265 has successfully been completed with 26 patients treated and has met the predetermined safety and efficacy criteria required to proceed into the second stage of patient enrollment. Clinical data from the first stage of GOG-0265 was presented at the American Gynecological &#38; Obstetrical Society (&#8220;AGOS&#8221;) annual meeting on September 17, 2015. Overall survival at 12 months was 38.5% (10/26) (the predefined criteria for 12-month survival was &#8805;20%), and, among patients who had received the full treatment regimen of 3 doses of axalimogene filolisbac, the 12-month survival rate was 55.6% (10/18). The adverse events observed in the first stage of the study have been consistent with those reported in other clinical studies with axalimogene filolisbac. It was well-tolerated, with Grade 1-2 fatigue, chills, and fever the most commonly reported Adverse Events (&#8220;AE&#8221;); six patients experienced a treatment-related Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE, which was considered possibly-related to axalimogene filolisbac. The second stage of the study will include approximately 37 additional patients; it has been amended to permit only one prior chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of recurrent/metastatic disease and allows patients to continue to receive repeat cycles of therapy until disease progression. 

&#160; 

We have completed an End-of-Phase 2 (&#8220;EOP2&#8221;) meeting with the FDA. The purpose of the EOP2 meeting was to discuss axalimogene filolisbac preclinical data, Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (&#8220;CMC&#8221;), and clinical program, prior to moving axalimogene filolisbac forward into a registrational trial in cervical cancer. At the meeting, the FDA provided guidance on our CMC activities and clinical development plan. We have submitted our Phase 3 protocol for a Special Protocol Assessment (&#8220;SPA&#8221;) request to the FDA. The SPA request included specific questions from Advaxis to facilitate a meaningful dialogue with the FDA on the proposed study design. We have received back from FDA initial comments and considerations for incorporation into our study design. Additional rounds of review and/or a formal meeting are anticipated, both of which can extend the review period and be beneficial in reaching agreement with the FDA on design elements. Based on the FDA&#8217;s feedback, we may reach final agreement with FDA or may decide to incorporate the advice into the design of the Phase 3 clinical study without undergoing additional rounds of review. FDA&#8217;s assessment of the SPA request, and all related feedback, will be very valuable in the development of axalimogene filolisbac. Contingent upon the outcome of the forgoing, we plan to initiate, in collaboration with the GOG/NRG Foundation, Inc., an independent international non-profit organization with the purpose of promoting excellence in the quality and integrity of clinical and basic scientific research in the field of gynecologic malignancies, a registrational clinical trial in cervical cancer in 2016 to support a Biologics License Application (&#8220;BLA&#8221;) submission in the U.S. and in other territories around the world. 

&#160; 

The planned registrational clinical trial will be a Phase 3 study of adjuvant axalimogene filolisbac, following primary treatment with chemoradiation, in patients with high-risk locally advanced cervical cancer compared to placebo alone. This population has a high recurrence rate and, once the disease has recurred, there are currently no available treatments. This study will evaluate both the time it takes for the cancer to recur as well as the overall survival. Our goal is to develop a treatment to prevent or reduce the risk of recurrence of cervical cancer after primary treatment interventions. 

&#160; 

Biocon Limited (&#8220;Biocon&#8221;), our co-development and commercialization partner for axalimogene filolisbac in India and key emerging markets, filed a Marketing Authorization Application (&#8220;MAA&#8221;) for licensure of this immunotherapy in India. The Drug Controller General of India (&#8220;DCGI&#8221;) accepted this MAA for review. The filing of the MAA was driven by several factors: i) results from the Lm -LLO-E7-15 Phase 2 trial indicated that axalimogene filolisbac was well tolerated and showed significant clinical activity in recurrent/refractory cervical cancer; ii) cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Indian women (according to WHO, there are 122,844 new cases per year with 67,544 deaths reported); and iii) current treatment options for non-operable refractory/recurrent disease are limited in India. As part of the MAA review process, Biocon met with the Scientific Expert Committee (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;). The Committee indicated that proof of concept for this novel immunotherapy has been established. The Committee advised Biocon to obtain data from a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with recurrent cervical cancer who have failed prior chemo and radiation therapy. The face-to-face interaction with the Committee provided Biocon and Advaxis with valuable insight for future development and the companies are evaluating next steps. 

&#160; 

We are conducting a Phase 1/2 trial evaluating higher doses and repeat cycles of axalimogene filolisbac in patients with recurrent cervical cancer. This Phase 1/2 study is designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and immunological effect of the highest-tolerated dose of axalimogene filolisbac administered in repeat cycles to patients with cervical cancer whose disease has recurred after receiving one prior systemic dose cytotoxic treatment regimen. At present, a total of 27 cycles of therapy have been delivered at the 5 x 10 9 CFU dose level and 5 cycles at the high dose of 1 x 10 10 CFU, which will now constitute the randomized Phase 2 dose. The AEs observed at the high dose are consistent with previous clinical experience with axalimogene filolisbac. 

&#160; 

We have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca, and are conducting a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, two-part study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of our investigational Lm -LLO cancer immunotherapy, axalimogene filolisbac, in combination with MedImmune&#8217;s investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab, as a combination treatment for patients with metastatic squamous or non-squamous carcinoma of the cervix and metastatic HPV-associated Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (&#8220;SCCHN&#8221;). For the axalimogene filolisbac and durvalumab dose escalation portion of the study, Cohort 1 has been completed allowing for advancement to the next dose level. Once the dose escalation has been completed, the recommended combination doses will be advanced further into the study. 

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Incyte where we plan to conduct a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of axalimogene filolisbac as a monotherapy and in combination with Incyte&#8217;s investigational oral indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor, epacadostat (INCB24360), in patients with Stage I-IIa cervical cancer. Incyte plans to enroll patients in this Phase 2 trial in 2016. 

&#160; 

Axalimogene filolisbac has received FDA orphan drug designation for invasive Stage II-IV cervical cancer. (Axalimogene filolisbac was not granted orphan drug designation for cervical cancer in the EMA ).

&#160; 

Head and Neck Cancer 

&#160; 

SCCHN is the most frequently occurring malignant tumor of the head and neck and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. More than 90% of SCCHNs originate from the mucosal linings of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx and 60-80% of these cancers are caused by HPV. According to the American Cancer Society, head and neck cancer accounts for about 3% to 5% of all cancers in the United States with an increasing incidence of HPV-associated head and neck cancers. Approximately 12,000 new cases will be diagnosed in the United Stated in 2016 according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (&#8220;SEER&#8221;) database. 

&#160; 

The safety and immunogenicity of axalimogene filolisbac is being evaluated in a Phase 2 study under an investigator-sponsored IND at Mount Sinai, in patients with HPV-positive head and neck cancer. This clinical trial is the first study to evaluate the effects of axalimogene filolisbac in patients when they are initially diagnosed with HPV-associated head and neck cancer. 

&#160; 

As stated above, we have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with MedImmune to collaborate on a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, two part study to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in combination with axalimogene filolisbac as a combination treatment for patients with metastatic squamous or non-squamous carcinoma of the cervix and metastatic HPV-associated SCCHN. 

&#160; 

Axalimogene filolisbac has received FDA orphan drug designation for HPV-associated head and neck cancer. 

&#160; 

Anal Cancer 

&#160; 

According to the American Cancer Society, nearly all squamous cell anal cancers are linked to infection by HPV, the same virus that causes cervical cancer. According to the SEER database, approximately 7,500 new cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016. 

&#160; 

The safety and efficacy of axalimogene filolisbac is being evaluated in a Phase 2 study under an investigator-sponsored IND by Brown University in patients with high-risk locally advanced anal cancer. Preliminary data indicates all patients who have completed the treatment regimen have experienced a six-month complete response, with no disease recurrence. In consideration of these preliminary data, the investigator at Brown University is evaluating the opportunity to transition this study into a NCI-funded cooperative group trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of axalimogene filolisbac in a pivotal Phase 2/3 anal cancer trial, to be conducted by NRG Oncology. In advance of the foregoing, we have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (&#8220;RTOG&#8221;) Foundation for the conduct of such study. 

&#160; 

We plan to enroll patients in a Company sponsored Phase 2 study in patients with persistent/recurrent, loco-regional or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the anorectal canal in 2016. 

&#160; 

Axalimogene filolisbac has received FDA and EMA orphan drug designation for anal cancer. 

&#160; 

Lung Cancer 

&#160; 

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan, China, and worldwide. Histologically, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (&#8220;NSCLC&#8221;), including squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, comprises more than 80% of lung cancers. Cigarette smoking is the primary risk factor and accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases. For those who have never smoked, HPV infection is considered to be an important cause of lung cancer in Asia. In a recent international pooled analysis of data on HPV-associated lung cancers, the prevalence in Asia was found to be 5% of all lung cancers. 

&#160; 

GBP, our development and commercialization partner in Asia, is planning to conduct a randomized Phase 2, open-label, controlled study in HPV-associated NSCLC in patients following first-line induction chemotherapy. Pending Taiwanese FDA approval, the study is planned to initiate in 2016 and will enroll up to 124 patients. This trial will be fully funded exclusively by GBP.

&#160; 

ADXS-PSA Franchise 

&#160; 

Prostate Cancer 

&#160; 

According to the American Cancer Society, prostate cancer is the second most common type of cancer found in American men. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, behind only lung cancer. One man in seven will get prostate cancer during his lifetime, and one man in 36 will die of this disease. About 210,000 new cases will be diagnosed in the United States in 2016 according to the SEER database. 

&#160; 

ADXS-PSA is an Lm -LLO immunotherapy designed to target the PSA antigen commonly overexpressed in prostate cancer. 

&#160; 

We have entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Merck to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ADXS-PSA as monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA&#174; (pembrolizumab), Merck&#8217;s anti PD-1 antibody, in a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, two part study in patients with previously treated metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. For ADXS-PSA monotherapy dose escalation portion of the study, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 have been completed allowing for advancement into Cohort 3, the third and final dose level. Once the dose escalation has been completed, the recommended dose will be advanced into the combination portion of the study.

&#160; 

ADXS-HER2 Franchise 

&#160; 

HER2 Expressing Solid Tumors 

&#160; 

HER2 is overexpressed in a percentage of solid tumors such as breast, gastric, bladder, brain, pancreatic, ovarian and osteosarcoma. According to the SEER database and recent published literature, the percentage of HER2 expression varies by cancer type, with approximately 70,000 new cases of invasive HER2 positive breast cancer diagnosed each year in the US; approximately 5,000 new cases of HER2 positive gastric cancer; approximately 22,000 new cases of HER2 positive bladder cancer; approximately 20,000 new cases of HER2 positive pancreatic cancer; approximately 2,500 new cases of HER2 positive ovarian cancer; and approximately 600 new cases of HER2 positive osteosarcoma. 

&#160; 

ADXS-HER2 is an Lm -LLO immunotherapy designed to target HER2 expressing solid tumors such as human and canine osteosarcoma, breast, gastric and other cancers. The FDA has cleared our IND application and we have initiated a Phase 1b study in patients with metastatic HER2-expressing cancers. Thereafter, we intend to initiate a clinical development program with ADXS-HER2 for the treatment of pediatric osteosarcoma. 

&#160; 

Osteosarcoma 

&#160; 

Osteosarcoma affects about 400 children and teens in the U.S. every year, representing a small but significant unmet medical need that has seen little therapeutic improvement in decades. Osteosarcoma is considered a rare disease and may qualify for regulatory incentives including, but not limited to, orphan drug designation, patent term extension, market exclusivity, and development grants. Given the limited availability of new treatment options for osteosarcoma, and that it is an unmet medical need affecting a very small number of patients in the U.S. annually, we believe that, subject to regulatory approval, the potential to be on the market may be accelerated. 

&#160; 

Based on encouraging data discussed below from a veterinarian clinical study in which pet dogs with naturally occurring osteosarcoma were treated with ADXS-HER2, we intend to initiate a clinical development program with ADXS-HER2 for the treatment of human osteosarcoma. Both veterinary and human osteosarcoma specialists consider canine osteosarcoma to be the best model for human osteosarcoma. 

&#160; 

ADXS-HER2 has received FDA and EMA orphan drug designation for osteosarcoma. 

&#160; 

Canine Osteosarcoma 

&#160; 

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in dogs, accounting for roughly 85% of tumors on the canine skeleton. Approximately 10,000 dogs a year (predominately middle to older-aged dogs and larger breeds) are diagnosed with osteosarcoma in the United States. This cancer initially presents as lameness and oftentimes visible swelling on the leg. Current standard of care treatment is amputation immediately after diagnosis, followed by chemotherapy. Median survival time with standard of care is ten to twelve months. For dogs that cannot undergo amputation, palliative radiation and analgesics are frequently employed and median survival times range from three to five months. 

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Under the direction of Dr. Nicola Mason, the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine is conducting studies in companion dogs evaluating the safety and efficacy of ADXS-HER2 in the treatment of naturally occurring canine osteosarcoma. In the initial study, the primary endpoint was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ADXS-HER2. Secondary endpoints for the study were progression-free survival and overall survival. The findings of the Phase 1 clinical trial in dogs with osteosarcoma suggest that ADXS-HER2 is safe and well tolerated at doses up to 3 x 10 9 CFU with no evidence of significant cardiac, hematological, or other systemic toxicities. The study determined that ADXS-HER2 is able to delay or prevent metastatic disease and significantly prolong overall survival in dogs with osteosarcoma that had minimal residual disease following standard of care (amputation and follow-up chemotherapy). Dr. Mason presented data at the 2014 American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (&#8220;ACVIM&#8221;) Forum which showed that 80% of the dogs treated (n=15) were still alive and median survival had not yet been reached. A second study is currently being conducted by Dr. Mason and data was presented at the 2015 ACVIM Forum obtained from pet dogs (n=12) with primary osteosarcoma unsuitable for amputation. Repeat doses of ADXS-HER2 administered after palliative radiation were well tolerated with no systemic or cardiac toxicity. 

&#160; 

On March 19, 2014, we entered into a definitive Exclusive License Agreement with Aratana, where we granted Aratana an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, certain of our proprietary technology that enables Aratana to develop and commercialize animal health products that will be targeted for treatment of osteosarcoma and other cancer indications in animals. A product license request has been filed by Aratana for ADXS-HER2 (also known as AT-014 by Aratana) for the treatment of canine osteosarcoma with the USDA. Aratana received communication from the USDA in March 2015 stating that the previously submitted efficacy data for product licensure for AT-014 (ADXS-HER2), the cancer immunotherapy for canine osteosarcoma, was accepted and that it provides a reasonable expectation of efficacy that supports conditional licensure. While additional steps need to be completed, including in the areas of manufacturing and safety, Aratana anticipates that AT-014 could receive conditional licensure from the USDA in 2016. Aratana has been granted exclusive worldwide rights by us to develop and commercialize ADXS-HER2 in animals. Aratana is further responsible for the conduct of clinical research with ADXS-Survivin in canine/feline lymphoma, as well as pending investigations of two additional Advaxis constructs in animals. 

&#160; 

ADXS-NEO Franchise (preclinical) 

&#160; 

We intend to file an IND application for ADXS-NEO and to initiate Company-sponsored studies, as well as external collaborations. 

&#160; 

We have entered into a research collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (&#8220;MSK&#8221;) to advance the study of neoepitope-based, personalized cancer therapy. The goal of the collaboration, titled &#8220;MINE&#8482;&#8221; (My Immunotherapy Neo-Epitopes), is to use our Lm -LLO cancer immunotherapy technology to develop neo-epitope immunotherapies based on an individual patient&#8217;s tumor (&#8220;ADXS-NEO&#8221;). MINE&#8482; will first focus on a preclinical study of our new construct approach to evaluate the immunologic effects and anti-tumor activity of a personalized immunotherapy in a mouse tumor model. We will use learnings from the MINE&#8482; collaboration to identify and target neoepitopes using Lm -LLO technology and later develop patient specific immunotherapy constructs that incorporate the neoepitope sequences identified in the patient&#8217;s tumor cells. Clinical studies using ADXS-NEO, to be conducted at MSK, are in development. 

&#160; 

ADXS-TNBC Franchise (preclinical) 

&#160; 

We are developing a construct that targets antigens specific to Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (&#8220;TNBC&#8221;), which accounts for ~15-20% of all diagnosed breast cancer cases and has not been amenable to targeted therapies directed toward estrogen, progesterone, or HER2 receptors. A majority of TNBC patients&#8217; still exhibit poor outcomes, with only 30-45% of patients achieving a pathological complete response from conventional chemotherapeutic and radiation therapy. The heterogeneous nature of this cancer type, the presence of mutations in multiple pathways, and the development of resistance to single agents make combination therapy much more attractive and suggest the need for agents that address more than one antigen/target. 

&#160; 

Lm-LLO Combination Franchise 

&#160; 

Axalimogene filolisbac and Durvalumab 

&#160; 

As stated above, we have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with MedImmune to conduct a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter, two part study to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of our investigational Lm- LLO cancer immunotherapy, axalimogene filolisbac, in combination with MedImmune&#8217;s investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab (MEDI4736) for the treatment of patients with metastatic squamous or non-squamous carcinoma of the cervix and metastatic HPV-associated SCCHN. Preliminary patient responses have been observed in Cohort 1. For the axalimogene filolisbac and durvalumab (MEDI4736) dose escalation portion of the study, Cohort 1 has been completed allowing for advancement to the next dose level. Once the dose escalation has been completed, the recommended combination doses will be advanced further into the study.

Corporate Information 

&#160; 

We were originally incorporated in the State of Colorado on June 5, 1987 under the name Great Expectations, Inc. We were a publicly-traded &#8220;shell&#8221; company without any business until November 12, 2004 when we acquired Advaxis, Inc., a Delaware corporation, through a Share Exchange and Reorganization Agreement, dated as of August 25, 2004, which we refer to as the Share Exchange, by and among Advaxis, the stockholders of Advaxis and us. As a result of the Share Exchange, Advaxis became our wholly-owned subsidiary and our sole operating company. On December 23, 2004, we amended and restated our articles of incorporation and changed our name to Advaxis, Inc. On June 6, 2006, our stockholders approved the reincorporation of our company from Colorado to Delaware by merging the Colorado entity into our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary. Our date of inception, for financial statement purposes, is March 1, 2002. 

&#160; 

Our principal executive offices are located at 305 College Road East, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 and our telephone number is (609) 452-9813. We maintain a website at www.advaxis.com which contains descriptions of our technology, our product candidates and the trial status of each drug. We make available free of charge through our Internet website our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the SEC. We are not including the information on our website as a part of, nor incorporating it by reference into, this report. You may read and copy any materials we file at the SEC&#8217;s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549 on official business days during the hours of 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Please call the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330 for information on the Public Reference Room. Additionally, the SEC maintains a website that contains annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other information that issuers (including us) file electronically with the SEC. The SEC&#8217;s website address is http://www.sec.gov. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Protection of our intellectual property is important to our business. We have a robust and extensive patent portfolio that protects our product candidates and Lm -based immunotherapy technology. Currently, we own or have rights to 200 patents and applications, which are owned, licensed from, or co-owned with Penn, Merck, NIH, and/or Georgia Regents University. We continuously grow this portfolio by filing new applications to protect our ongoing research and development efforts. We aggressively prosecute and defend our patents and proprietary technology. Our patents are directed to the compositions of matter, use, and methods thereof, of our Lm -LLO immunotherapies for our product candidates, axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-PSA, and ADXS-HER2. 

&#160; 

Our approach to the intellectual property portfolio is to create, maintain, protect, enforce and defend our proprietary rights for the products we develop from our immunotherapy technology platform. We endeavor to maintain a coherent and aggressive strategic approach to building our patent portfolio with an emphasis in the field of cancer vaccines. 

&#160; 

&#160; 9 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We successfully defended our intellectual property concerning our Lm -based technology by contesting a challenge made by Anza Therapeutics, Inc. (now known as Aduro BioTech), to our patent position in Europe on a claim not available in the United States. The European Patent Office (&#8220;EPO&#8221;) Board of Appeals in Munich, Germany ruled in favor of the Trustees of Penn and us, Penn&#8217;s exclusive licensee, and reversed a patent ruling that revoked a technology patent that had resulted from an opposition filed by Anza. The ruling of the EPO Board of Appeals is final and cannot be appealed. The granted claims, the subject matter of which was discovered by Dr. Yvonne Paterson, are directed to the method of preparation and composition of matter of recombinant bacteria expressing tumor antigens for the treatment of patients with cancer. The successful development of our immunotherapies will include our ability to create and maintain intellectual property related to our product candidates. 

&#160; 

Issued patents which are directed to our product candidates axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-PSA, and ADVX-HER2 in the United States, will expire between 2017 and 2032. Issued patents directed to our product candidates axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-PSA, and ADXS-HER2 outside of the United States, will expire in 2028. Issued patents directed to our Lm -based immunotherapy platform in the United States, will expire between 2016 and 2030. Issued patents directed to our Lm -based immunotherapy platform outside of the United States, will expire between 2021 and 2030. 

&#160; 

We have issued patents directed to methods of using our product candidates axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-PSA and ADXS-HER2 in the United States, which will expire between 2017 and 2032. Issued patents directed to use of our product candidates: axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-PSA and ADXS-HER2 for indications outside of the United States, will expire between 2018 and 2028. 

&#160; 

We have pending patent applications directed to our product candidates axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-PSA, ADXS-HER2 that, if issued would expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States between 2020 and 2037. We have pending patent applications directed to methods of using of our product candidates axalimogene filolisbac, ADXS-PSA, ADXS-HER2 directed to the following indications: a her2/neu-expressing cancer, a prostate cancer, cervical dysplasia, and cervical cancer that, if issued would expire in the United States and in countries outside of the United States between 2020 and 2037, depending on the specific indications. 

&#160; 

We will be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent it is covered by valid and enforceable patents or is effectively maintained as trade secrets. Patents and other proprietary rights are an essential element of our business. 

&#160; 

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. 

&#160; 

Any patent applications which we have filed or will file or to which we have or will have license rights may not issue, and patents that do issue may not contain commercially valuable claims. In addition, any patents issued to us or our licensors may not afford meaningful protection for our products or technology, or may be subsequently circumvented, invalidated, narrowed, or found unenforceable. Our processes and potential products may also conflict with patents which have been or may be granted to competitors, academic institutions or others. As the pharmaceutical industry expands and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our processes and potential products may give rise to interferences filed by others in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or to claims of patent infringement by other companies, institutions or individuals. These entities or persons could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing of the related product or process. In recent years, several companies have been extremely aggressive in challenging patents covering pharmaceutical products, and the challenges have often been successful. If any of these actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to cease the infringing activity or obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the relevant product or process. We may not prevail in any such action and any license required under any such patent may not be made available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to successfully defend a patent challenge or to obtain a license to any technology that we may require to commercialize our technologies or potential products could have a materially adverse effect on our business. In addition, changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries may materially diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. 

&#160; 

We also rely upon unpatented proprietary technology, and in the future may determine in some cases that our interests would be better served by reliance on trade secrets or confidentiality agreements rather than patents or licenses. We may not be able to protect our rights to such unpatented proprietary technology and others may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies. If we are unable to obtain strong proprietary rights to our processes or products after obtaining regulatory clearance, competitors may be able to market competing processes and products. 

&#160; 

Others may obtain patents having claims which cover aspects of our products or processes which are necessary for, or useful to, the development, use or manufacture of our services or products. Should any other group obtain patent protection with respect to our discoveries, our commercialization of potential therapeutic products and methods could be limited or prohibited.

&#160; 

The Drug Development Process 

&#160; 

The product candidates in our pipeline are at various stages of preclinical and clinical development. The path to regulatory approval includes multiple phases of clinical trials in which we collect data to support an application to regulatory authorities to allow us to market a product for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of a specified disease. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in research and development of new products, resulting in a high rate of failure. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to regulatory approval, and ultimately to market, takes many years and significant costs. 

&#160; 

Clinical testing, known as clinical trials or clinical studies, is either conducted internally by a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company or is conducted on behalf of these companies by Clinical Research Organizations (&#8220;CRO&#8221;). The process of conducting clinical studies is highly regulated by the FDA, as well as by other governmental and professional bodies. In a clinical trial, participants receive specific interventions according to the research plan or protocol created by the investigators. Clinical trials may compare a new medical approach to a standard one that is already available or to a placebo that contains no active ingredients or to no intervention. Some clinical trials compare interventions that are already available to each other. When a new product or approach is being studied, it is not usually known whether it will be helpful, harmful, or no different than available alternatives. The investigators try to determine the safety and efficacy of the intervention by measuring certain outcomes in the participants. 

&#160; 

Phase 1 . Phase 1 clinical trials begin when regulatory agencies allow initiation of clinical investigation of a new drug or product candidate. They typically involve testing an investigational new drug on a limited number of patients. Phase 1 studies determine a drug&#8217;s basic safety, maximum tolerated dose and how the drug is absorbed by, and eliminated from, the body. Typically, cancer therapies are initially tested on late stage cancer patients. 

&#160; 

Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials involve larger numbers of patients that have been diagnosed with the targeted disease or condition. Phase 2 clinical trials gather preliminary data on effectiveness (where the drug works in people who have a certain disease or condition) and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. If Phase 2 clinical trials show that an investigational new drug has an acceptable range of safety risks and probable effectiveness, a company will continue to evaluate the investigational new drug in Phase 3 studies. 

&#160; 

Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are typically controlled multi-center trials that involve a larger number of patients to ensure the study results are statistically significant. The purpose is to confirm effectiveness and safety on a large scale and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. These trials are generally global in nature and are designed to generate clinical data necessary to submit an application for marketing approval to regulatory agencies. 

&#160; 

Biologic License Application (BLA) . The results of the clinical trials using biologics are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA. Following the completion of Phase 3 studies, if the Sponsor of a potential product in the United States believes it has sufficient information to support the safety and effectiveness of the investigational new drug, the Sponsor submits a BLA to the FDA requesting that the investigational new drug be approved for sale. The application is a comprehensive, multi-volume filing that includes the results of all preclinical and clinical studies, information about the drug&#8217;s composition, and the Sponsor&#8217;s plans for manufacturing, packaging, labeling and testing the investigational new drug. The FDA&#8217;s review of an application is designated either as a standard review with a target review time of 10 months or a priority review with a target of 6 months. Depending upon the completeness of the application and the number and complexity of follow-up requests and responses between the FDA and the Sponsor, the review time can take months to many years. Once approved through this process, a drug may be marketed in the United States, subject to any conditions imposed by the FDA. 

&#160; 

&#160; 11 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

The current state of development of our candidates in various areas are outlined in the following table: 

&#160; 

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Government authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of biologic products. In the United States, the FDA subjects pharmaceutical and biologic products to rigorous review under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations. 

&#160; 

Orphan Drug Designation 

&#160; 

Under the Orphan Drug Act (&#8220;ODA&#8221;), the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation (&#8220;ODD&#8221;) to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which means a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States will be recovered from domestic sales of the product. 

&#160; 

The benefits of ODD can be substantial, including research and development tax credits and exemption from user fees, enhanced access to advice from the FDA while the drug is being developed, and market exclusivity once the product reaches approval and begins sales, provided that the new product is first to market and that this new product has not been previously approved for the same orphan disease or condition, with or without orphan drug designation. In order to qualify for these incentives, a company must apply for designation of its product as an &#8220;Orphan Drug&#8221; and obtain approval from the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. A drug that is approved for the ODD indication is granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity. During that period, the FDA generally may not approve any other application for the same product for the same indication, although there are exceptions, most notably when the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the product with exclusivity. 

&#160; 

We currently have ODD with the FDA for axalimogene filolisbac for treatment of anal cancer (granted August 2013), HPV-associated head and neck cancer (granted November 2013); and treatment of Stage II-IV invasive cervical cancer (granted May 2014). We also have ODD with the FDA for ADXS-HER2 for the treatment of osteosarcoma (granted May 2014). 

&#160; 

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In Europe, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (&#8220;COMP&#8221;) issued a positive opinion on the application for ODD of axalimogene filolisbac for the treatment of anal cancer (December 2015) and on the application for ODD of ADXS-HER2 for osteosarcoma (November 2015). 

&#160; 

Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions 

&#160; 

Four FDA programs are intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs to address unmet medical need in the treatment of serious or life-threatening conditions: fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation. We intend to avail ourselves of any and all of these programs as applicable to our products. 

&#160; 

Non-U.S. Regulation 

&#160; 

Before our products can be marketed outside the United States, they are subject to regulatory approval of the respective authorities in the country in which the product should be marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval, and in certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product. 

&#160; 

Collaborations, Partnerships and Agreements 

&#160; 

Biocon Limited 

&#160; 

On January 20, 2014, we entered into a Distribution and Supply Agreement (&#8220;Biocon Agreement&#8221;) with Biocon Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of India. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Biocon Agreement, we granted Biocon an exclusive license (with a right to sublicense) to (i) use our data from clinical development activities, regulatory filings, technical, manufacturing and other information and know-how to enable Biocon to submit regulatory filings for axalimogene filolisbac in the following territories: India, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Armenia, Egypt, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen (collectively, the &#8220;Territory&#8221;) and (ii) import, promote, market, distribute and sell pharmaceutical products containing axalimogene filolisbac . Axalimogene filolisbac is based on a novel platform technology using live, attenuated bacteria that are bio-engineered to secrete an antigen/adjuvant fusion protein(s) that is designed to redirect the powerful immune response all human beings have to the bacterium against their cancer. 

&#160; 

Under the Biocon Agreement, Biocon has agreed to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for axalimogene filolisbac in India. In the event Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials are required, we shall conduct such trials at our cost, provided that if we are unable to commence such clinical trials, Biocon may conduct such clinical trials, subject to reimbursement of costs by us. Biocon has agreed to commence commercial distribution of axalimogene filolisbac no later than 9 months following receipt of regulatory approvals in a country in the Territory. Biocon will be responsible for the costs of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals in the Territory. 

&#160; 

We will have the exclusive right to supply axalimogene filolisbac to Biocon and Biocon will be required to purchase its requirements of axalimogene filolisbac exclusively from us at the specified contract price, as such price may be adjusted from time to time. The supply price agreed upon between the parties will be correlated to the net sales of the product during the preceding contract year. In addition, we will be entitled to a six-figure milestone payment if net sales of axalimogene filolisbac for the contract year following the initiation of clinical trials in India exceed certain specified thresholds. 

&#160; 

Biocon will also have a right of first refusal relating to the licensing of any new products in the Territory that we may develop during the term of the Biocon Agreement. 

&#160; 

The term of the Biocon Agreement will be the later of twenty years or the last to expire patent or patent application. In addition, the Biocon Agreement may be terminated by either party upon thirty days&#8217; written notice (i) in the event of a material breach by the other party of its obligations under the Biocon Agreement, (ii) if the other party becomes bankrupt or insolvent or (iii) if the other party undergoes a change in control. 

&#160; 

Biocon filed a MAA for licensure of this immunotherapy in India. The DCGI accepted this MAA for review. The filing of the MAA was driven by several factors: i) results from the Lm -LLO-E7-15 Phase 2 trial indicated that axalimogene filolisbac was well tolerated and showed significant clinical activity in recurrent/refractory cervical cancer; ii) cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among Indian women (132,000 new cases per year with 74,000 deaths reported); and iii) current treatment options for non-operable refractory/recurrent disease are limited in India. As part of the MAA review process, Biocon met with the Scientific Expert Committee (the &#8220;Committee&#8221;). The Committee indicated that proof of concept for this novel immunotherapy has been established. The Committee advised Biocon to obtain data from a Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with recurrent cervical cancer who have failed prior chemo and radiation therapy. The face-to-face interaction with the Committee provided Biocon and Advaxis with valuable insight for future development. We continue to assist Biocon with the activities necessary to develop and ultimately commercialize axalimogene filolisbac in the Territory. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Global BioPharma, Inc . 

&#160; 

On December 9, 2013, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement for the development and commercialization of axalimogene filolisbac with Global BioPharma, Inc. (&#8220;GBP&#8221;), a Taiwanese based biotech company funded by a group of investors led by Taiwan Biotech Co., Ltd (TBC). 

&#160; 

GBP plans to conduct registration trials with axalimogene filolisbac for the treatment of advanced cervical cancer. GBP is also planning to conduct a randomized Phase 2, open-label, controlled study in HPV-associated NSCLC in patients following first-line induction chemotherapy. Pending Taiwanese FDA approval, the study is planned to initiate in 2016 and will enroll up to 124 patients. This trial will be fully funded by GBP. GBP will continue to explore the use of our lead product candidate in several other indications including head and neck, and anal cancer. 

&#160; 

GBP will pay us event-based financial milestones, an annual development fee, and annual net sales royalty payments in the high single to double digits. In addition, as an upfront payment, GBP made an investment in us by purchasing shares of our Common Stock (&#8220;Common Stock&#8221;) at market price. GBP has an option to purchase additional shares of our stock at a 150% premium to the stock price on the effective date of the agreement. 

&#160; 

GBP will be responsible for all clinical development and commercialization costs in the GBP territory. GBP will also reimburse us $2.25 million toward our U.S. registrational study, where such payment will help to offset our development costs. GBP is committed to establishing manufacturing capabilities for its own territory and to serving as a secondary manufacturing source for us in the future. Under the terms of the agreement, we will exclusively license the rights of axalimogene filolisbac to GBP for the Asia, Africa, and former USSR territory, exclusive of India and certain other countries, for all HPV-associated indications. We will retain exclusive rights to axalimogene filolisbac for the rest of the world. 

&#160; 

University of Pennsylvania 

&#160; 

On July 1, 2002 we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Penn with respect to the innovative work of Yvonne Paterson, Ph.D., Associate Dean for Research at the School of Nursing at Penn, and former Professor of Microbiology at Penn, in the area of innate immunity, or the immune response attributed to immune cells, including dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells, that respond to pathogens non-specifically (subject to certain U.S. government rights). This agreement was amended and restated as of February 13, 2007, and, thereafter, has been amended from time to time. 

&#160; 

This license, unless sooner terminated in accordance with its terms, terminates upon the latter of (a) the expiration of the last to expire of the Penn patent rights; or (b) twenty years after the effective date of the license. Penn may terminate the license agreement early upon the occurrence of certain defaults by us, including, but not limited to, a material breach by us of the Penn license agreement that is not cured within 60 days after notice of the breach is provided to us. 

&#160; 

The license provides us with the exclusive commercial rights to the patent portfolio developed by Penn as of the effective date of the license, in connection with Dr. Paterson and requires us to pay various milestone, legal, filing and licensing payments to commercialize the technology. In exchange for the license, Penn received shares of our Common Stock. However, as of October 31, 2015, Penn does not own shares of our Common Stock. In addition, Penn is entitled to receive a non-refundable initial license fee, royalty payments and milestone payments based on net sales and percentages of sublicense fees and certain commercial milestones. Under the amended licensing agreement, Penn is entitled to receive 2.5% of net sales in the territory. Should annual net sales exceed $250 million, the royalty rate will increase to 2.75%, but only with respect to those annual net sales in excess of $250 million. Additionally, Penn will receive tiered sales milestone payments upon the achievement of cumulative global sales ranging between $250 million and $2 billion, with the maximum aggregate amounts payable to Penn in the event that maximum sales milestones are achieved is $40 million. Notwithstanding these royalty rates, upon first in-human commercial sale (U.S. &#38; E.U.), we have agreed to pay Penn a total of $775,000 over a four-year period as an advance minimum royalty, which shall serve as an advance royalty in conjunction with the above terms. In addition, under the license, we are obligated to pay an annual maintenance fee of $100,000 commencing on December 31, 2010, and each December 31st thereafter for the remainder of the term of the agreement until the first commercial sale of a Penn licensed product. We are responsible for filing new patents and maintaining and defending the existing patents licensed to us and we are obligated to reimburse Penn for all attorney&#8217;s fees, expenses, official fees and other charges incurred in the preparation, prosecution and maintenance of the patents licensed from Penn. 

&#160; 

Upon first regulatory approval in humans (US or EU), Penn will be entitled to a milestone payment of $600,000. Furthermore, upon the achievement of the first sale of a product in certain fields, Penn will be entitled to certain milestone payments, as follows: $2.5 million will be due upon the first in-human commercial sale (US or EU) of the first product in the cancer field and $1.0 million will be due upon the date of first in-human commercial sale (US or EU) of a product in each of the secondary strategic fields sold. 

&#160; 

As of October 31, 2015, we had no outstanding balance with Penn under all licensing agreements.

Merck &#38; Co., Inc. 

&#160; 

On August 22, 2014, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration and Supply Agreement (the &#8220;Merck Agreement&#8221;) with Merck, pursuant to which the parties will collaborate on a Phase 1/2 dose-escalation and safety study. The Phase 1 portion of the study will evaluate the safety of our Lm -LLO based immunotherapy for prostate cancer, ADXS31-142 (the &#8220;Advaxis Compound&#8221;) as monotherapy and in combination with KEYTRUDA &#174; (pembrolizumab), Merck&#8217;s humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-1 (the &#8220;Merck Compound&#8221;), to determine a recommended Phase 2 combination dose. The Phase 2 portion will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Advaxis Compound in combination with the Merck Compound. Both phases of the study will be in patients with previously treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. A joint development committee, comprised of equal representatives from both parties, is responsible for coordinating all regulatory and other activities under, and pursuant to, the Merck Agreement. 

&#160; 

Each party is responsible for their own internal costs and expenses to support the study, while we will be responsible for all third party costs of conducting the study. Merck will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the Merck Compound. We will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying the Advaxis Compound. We will be the sponsor of the study and hold the IND related to the study. 

&#160;

MedImmune/AstraZeneca 

&#160; 

On July 21, 2014, we entered into a Clinical Trial Collaboration Agreement (the &#8220;MedImmune Agreement&#8221;) with MedImmune, the global biologics research and development arm of AstraZeneca, pursuant to which the parties intend to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical study in the United States to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MedImmune&#8217;s investigational anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, MEDI4736, in combination with our investigational Lm -LLO cancer immunotherapy, axalimogene filolisbac , as a combination treatment for patients with advanced, recurrent or refractory cervical cancer and HPV-associated head and neck cancer. A joint steering committee, composed of equal representatives from both parties, is responsible for various matters associated with the collaboration, including protocol approval, as well as reviewing and monitoring the progress of the study. 

&#160; 

MedImmune will be responsible for providing MEDI4736 at no cost, as well as costs related to the proprietary assays performed by MedImmune or a third party on behalf of MedImmune. We will be the sponsor of the study and be responsible for the submission of all regulatory filings to support the study, the negotiation and execution of the clinical trial agreements associated with each study site, and the packaging and labelling of the Advaxis and MedImmune product candidates to be used in the study and the costs associated therewith. 

&#160; 

For a period beginning upon the completion of the study and the receipt by MedImmune of the last final report for the study and ending one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter (unless extended), MedImmune will be granted first right to negotiate in good faith in an attempt to enter into an agreement with us with respect to the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of axalimogene filolisbac and MEDI4736 to be used in combination with each other for the treatment or prevention of cancer. Neither party is obligated to enter into such an agreement. In the event the parties do not enter an agreement and we obtain regulatory approval for axalimogene filolisbac in combination with any PD-1 antibody or PD-L1 antibody, we shall pay MedImmune a royalty obligation and one-time payment. 

&#160; 

All intellectual property rights made, conceived or generated through the clinical trials that relate solely to a MedImmune development product shall be owned solely by MedImmune. All intellectual property rights made, conceived or generated through the clinical trials that relate solely to an Advaxis development product shall be owned solely by us. All intellectual property rights made, conceived or generated through the clinical trials that relate to the combination of one or more MedImmune development product and one or more Advaxis development product shall be jointly owned by both parties; provided, however that in the event the parties do not enter into a clinical development and commercialization agreement, we will not exploit, commercialize or license the joint inventions, except for the performance of its obligations under the MedImmune Agreement. MedImmune has the sole right to prosecute and enforce all patents and other intellectual property rights covering all joint inventions and all associated costs will be shared by the parties. 

&#160; 

The MedImmune Agreement shall remain in effect until the earlier of (i) permitted termination, (ii) the parties entering into a clinical development and commercialization agreement or expiration of the negotiation period (unless extended), except with respect to rights that survive termination. Either party may terminate the MedImmune Agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice upon material breach of the other party, unless the breach is cured in such period or reasonable actions to cure the breach are initiated and pursued (if the breach is not capable of being cured during the 30-day notice period). In addition, either party may terminate the MedImmune Agreement immediately if the party determines in good faith that the trials may unreasonably affect the safety of trial subjects.

Under the terms of the Incyte Agreement, the parties will contribute their respective compounds to be dosed in combination during the course of the study, with Incyte acting as the sponsor of the study and taking the lead role in its conduct. The Incyte Agreement is to continue in full force and effect until completion of the final study report or until earlier termination by either party. Costs for the study are to be split between the parties, and Incyte will provide us with an invoice and supporting documents of our share of the costs incurred through the end of each calendar quarter. 

&#160; 

Aratana 

&#160; 

On March 19, 2014, we entered into a definitive Exclusive License Agreement (the &#8220;Aratana Agreement&#8221;) with Aratana. Pursuant to the Aratana Agreement, we granted Aratana an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, under certain Advaxis proprietary technology that enables the design of an immunotherapy utilizing live attenuated Lm bioengineered to secrete fusion proteins consisting of antigen and adjuvant molecules, including certain &#8220;Constructs&#8221; and related &#8220;Compounds&#8221; (both as defined in the Aratana Agreement) in order for Aratana to develop and commercialize animal health products containing or incorporating Compounds (&#8220;Products&#8221;) for use in non-human animal health applications (the &#8220;Aratana Field&#8221;) that will be targeted for treatment of osteosarcoma and other cancer indications in animals. Our technology licensed to Aratana includes certain patents and patent applications, as well as related know-how, data, technical information, results and other information controlled by us during the term of the Aratana Agreement that are reasonably necessary for the development, manufacture or commercialization of any Construct, Compound or Product. 

&#160; 

In addition to the Constructs licensed by Aratana upon signing of the Aratana Agreement, Aratana also has a right of first refusal to license additional constructs from us in the future if we develop (on its own or upon request of Aratana) new constructs which are reasonably believed to be suitable for treating osteosarcoma and certain other cancer indications (&#8220;Additional Constructs&#8221;). If the parties agree upon the terms pursuant to which such Additional Constructs shall be added as Constructs under the Aratana Agreement, such Additional Constructs will be added by virtue of an amendment to the Aratana Agreement. 

&#160; 

Aratana has granted us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully-paid, irrevocable and perpetual license, with the right to sublicense, under Aratana&#8217;s existing technology, and any related sole Aratana development or Aratana&#8217;s rights in any joint inventions which may be developed by the parties during the course of the Aratana Agreement, solely for us to develop and commercialize our products for any and all uses outside of the Aratana Field, including, without limitation, all human health applications. The Aratana technology to be licensed to us will include any patents or patent applications controlled by Aratana during the term of the Aratana Agreement that claim or cover the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of any Products as well as related know-how, data, technical information, results and other information controlled by Aratana during the term of the Aratana Agreement that is necessary or useful in the development, manufacture or commercialization of any Compound, Construct or Product. 

&#160; 

Under the terms of the Aratana Agreement, Aratana paid an upfront payment to us in the amount of $1,000,000 upon signing of the Aratana Agreement. Aratana will also pay us (a) up to $36.5 million based on the achievement of milestone relating to the advancement of Products through the approval process with the USDA in the United States and the relevant regulatory authorities in the European Union (&#8220;E.U.&#8221;) in all four therapeutic areas and up to an additional $15 million in cumulative sales milestones based on achievement of gross sales revenue targets for sales of any and all Products in the Aratana Field (regardless of therapeutic area), and (b) tiered royalties starting at 5% and going up to 10%, which will be paid based on net sales of any and all Products (regardless of therapeutic area) in the Aratana Field in the United States. Royalties for sales of Products outside of the United States will be paid at a rate equal to half of the royalty rate payable by Aratana on net sales of Products in the United States (starting at 2.5% and going up to 5%). Royalties will be payable on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis from first commercial sale of a Product in a country until the later of (a) the 10th anniversary of first commercial sale of such Product by Aratana, its affiliates or sub licensees in such country or (b) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of our patents or joint patents claiming or covering the composition of matter, formulation or method of use of such Product in such country. Aratana will also pay us 50% of all sublicense royalties received by Aratana and its affiliates. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, pursuant to the Aratana Agreement, we (i) issued and sold 306,122 shares of Common Stock to Aratana at a price of $4.90 per share, which was equal to the closing price of the Common Stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on March 19, 2014, and (ii) issued a ten-year warrant to Aratana giving Aratana the right to purchase up to 153,061 additional shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $4.90 per share. The warrant also contains a provision for cashless exercise if the fair market value of Advaxis&#8217; Common Stock for the five trading days ending three trading days prior to the exercise date is higher than the exercise price. In connection with the sale of the Common Stock and warrants, we received aggregate net proceeds of $1,500,000. We issued the shares and warrant in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. 

&#160; 

Aratana has filed a product license request for ADXS-HER2 (also known as AT-014 by Aratana) for the treatment of canine osteosarcoma with the USDA. Aratana received communication from the USDA in March 2015 stating that the previously submitted efficacy data for product licensure for AT-014, the cancer immunotherapy for canine osteosarcoma, was accepted and that it provides a reasonable expectation of efficacy that supports conditional licensure. While additional steps need to be completed, including in the areas of manufacturing and safety, Aratana anticipates that AT-014 could receive conditional licensure from the USDA in 2016.

In addition, pending regulatory approval, we can leverage inVentiv&#8217;s significant commercialization capabilities in select countries, should we seek to do so. 

&#160; 

Agreement with Knight Therapeutics Inc. 

&#160; 

On August 26, 2015, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Knight Therapeutics Inc. (&#8220;Knight&#8221;), a Canadian-based specialty pharmaceutical company, to commercialize in Canada Advaxis&#8217; product candidates. 

&#160; 

In connection with the agreement, Knight purchased 359,454 shares of our common stock at $13.91 per share, which represents a seven percent premium to the price of our common stock at market close on August 25, 2015. In addition, Sectoral Asset Management, a leading Canadian-based global healthcare investment advisor, purchased 1,437,815 shares at $13.91 per share directly from us on behalf of its clients. The combined gross proceeds to us from these direct investments was $25 million. 

&#160; 

Under the terms of the agreement, Knight will be responsible to conduct and fund all regulatory and commercial activities in Canada. We are eligible to receive double digit royalty as well as approximately $33 million in cumulative sales milestones. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) are the standards identified in order to conform to requirements by governmental agencies that control authorization and licensure for manufacture and distribution of drug products for either clinical investigations or commercial sale. GMPs identify the requirements for procurement, manufacturing, testing, storage, distribution and the supporting quality systems in order to ensure that a drug product is safe for its intended application. GMPs are enforced in the United States by the FDA, under the authorities of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations and use the phrase &#8220;current good manufacturing practices&#8221; (&#8220;cGMP&#8221;) to describe these standards. 

&#160; 

We have entered into agreements with multiple third-party organizations to handle the manufacturing, testing, and distribution of our product candidates. These organizations have extensive experience within the biologics space and with the production of clinical and commercial GMP supplies. In parallel, we have also continued to invest in our internal process/analytical development, quality systems, manufacturing, and quality control infrastructure with the goal of accelerating and advancing our pipeline. Construction of a new pilot plant capable of producing early phase clinical trial GMP supplies and capable of supporting process optimization/scale-up is underway at our New Jersey headquarter. In addition, we have initiated the conceptual engineering design for a potential facility expansion to allow us to produce supplies for our neoepitope and our other programs. Our strategy is to continue to leverage both our partner&#8217;s capabilities and our internal capabilities in order to build a supply chain that is reliable, flexible, and cost competitive. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid technological developments and a high degree of competition. As a result, our actual or proposed immunotherapies could become obsolete before we recoup any portion of our related research and development expenses. The biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are highly competitive, and this competition comes from both biotechnology firms and from major pharmaceutical companies, including: Aduro Biotech, Agenus Inc., Celldex Therapeutics, Inovio Pharmaceutical Inc., ISA Pharmaceuticals, MedImmune LLC, Neon Therapeutics, Oncolytics Biotech Inc., Oncothyreon Inc., et al., each of which is pursuing cancer vaccines and/or immunotherapies. 

&#160; 

Many of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing, and human resources than we do (including, in some cases, substantially greater experience in clinical testing, manufacturing, and marketing of pharmaceutical products). We also experience competition in the development of our immunotherapies from universities and other research institutions and compete with others in acquiring technology from such universities and institutions. In addition, certain of our immunotherapies may be subject to competition from investigational new drugs and/or products developed using other technologies, some of which have completed numerous clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Our competition will be determined in part by the potential indications for which drugs are developed and ultimately approved by regulatory authorities. Additionally, the timing of market introduction of some of our potential immunotherapies or of competitors&#8217; products may be an important competitive factor. Accordingly, the speed with which we can develop immunotherapies, complete preclinical testing, clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities to market are expected to be important competitive factors. We expect that competition among products approved for sale will be based on various factors, including product efficacy, safety, reliability, acceptance, availability, price and patent position.

&#160; 

Our management team has extensive experience in oncology development, including contract research, development and manufacturing across a board range of science, technologies, and process operations. We have built internal capabilities supporting research, clinical, medical, manufacturing and compliance operations and have extended our expertise with collaborations. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of January 6, 2016, we had 48 employees, all of which were full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

&#160; 

Description of Property 

&#160; 

Our corporate offices are currently located at 305 College Road East, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. On April 1, 2011, we entered into a sublease agreement for such office, which is an approximately 10,000 square foot leased facility in Princeton, NJ. The agreement had a termination date of November 29, 2015. In May 2015, we signed a direct lease for an expansion area, as well as a direct lease for the existing office, lab and vivarium space upon the expiration of the sublease agreement, which is approximately 20,000 square foot of space in total. The lease term is seven years and expires on November 30, 2022. The lease requires base annual rent of approximately $442,000 with annual increases in increments between 2% and 4% throughout the remainder of the lease. The lease contains two options to renew for five years each. 

&#160; 

We plan to further increase our capacity to include in-house clinical and commercial manufacturing capabilities, where we first intend to manufacture clinical supplies for our ADXS-NEO program. We will continue to rent necessary offices and laboratories to support our growing business.
