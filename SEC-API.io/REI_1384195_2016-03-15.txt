 Item 1: Business &#160;

General 

&#160;

Ring was incorporated in the State of Nevada in 2004 as &#8220;Blanca Corp.&#8221; The name of the corporation was changed to &#8220;Transglobal Mining Corp.&#8221; in 2007 before being changed to &#8220;Ring Energy, Inc.&#8221; in 2008. We are a Midland-based exploration and production company that is engaged in oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration, development and production activities. Our exploration and production interests are currently focused in Texas and Kansas. The Company takes a conventional approach to its drilling program and seeks to develop its traditional core areas, as well as look for new growth opportunities.

&#160;

The Company&#8217;s primary drilling operations target the Central Basin Platform in Andrews County and Gaines County, Texas and the Delaware Basin in Reeves County and Culberson County, Texas. As of December 31, 2015, Ring had 30,663 gross (18,130 net) acres in Andrews and Gaines counties and 19,983 gross (19,679 net) acres in Reeves and Culberson counties. The Company also has 17,631 gross (16,674 net) acres in Kansas.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, Ring&#8217;s proved reserves were approximately 24.4 million BOE (barrel of oil equivalent). Effectively 100% of its reserves (based on the estimates above) relate to properties located in Texas. The Company&#8217;s proved reserves are oil-weighted with 91% of proved reserves consisting of oil and 9% consisting of natural gas. Of those reserves, 33% of the proved reserves are classified as proved developed producing, or &#8220;PDP,&#8221; 2% are classified as proved developed non-producing, or &#8220;PDNP,&#8221; and approximately 65% are classified as proved undeveloped, or &#8220;PUD.&#8221;

&#160;

Production for the year ended December 31, 2015, was approximately 743,363 BOE, as compared to production of 463,495 BOE for the year ended December 31, 2014, a 60% increase in BOE. The stated production amount reflects only the oil and gas that was produced and shipped prior to the end of the fourth quarter. Any oil and gas produced in the fourth quarter but still held on site after December 31, 2015, will be credited in the first quarter of 2016.

&#160;

Ring believes that there is significant value to be created by drilling the identified undeveloped opportunities on its Texas properties. As of December 31, 2015, Ring owned interests in a total of 5,875 gross (5,169 net) developed acres and 24,789 gross (12,961 net) undeveloped acres in Andrews and Gaines County, Texas. In these counties, the Company has 212 identified proven vertical drilling locations based on the reserve reports as of December 31, 2015, and an additional 2,478 identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 10-acre downspacing. Also as of December 31, 2015, Ring owned interests in a total of 10,190 gross (10,092 net) developed acres and 9,793 (9,587 net) undeveloped acres in Culberson and Reeves County, Texas. In these counties, the Company has 43 identified proven vertical drilling locations based on the reserve reports as of December 31, 2015 and an additional 489 potential vertical drilling locations based on 20-acre downspacing. Ring intends to grow its reserves and production through development, drilling, exploitation and exploration activities on this multi-year project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet the Company&#8217;s strategic and financial objectives, targeting oil-weighted reserves. Ring has identified 23 wells that are suitable candidates for re-stimulation, providing attractive returns with lower upfront costs.

&#160;

Ring Energy&#8217;s Business Strategy and Development 

&#160; 

&#160; &#183; Pursue strategic acquisitions with exceptional upside potential. Ring has a history of acquiring leasehold positions that it believes to have substantial resource potential and to meet its targeted returns on invested capital. Ring has historically pursued acquisitions of properties that it believes to have exploitation and development potential comparable to its existing inventory of drilling locations. The Company has developed and refined an acquisition program designed to increase reserves and complement existing core properties. Ring&#8217;s experienced team of management and engineering professionals identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities, negotiate and close purchases and manage acquired properties. Management intends to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions that meet the Company&#8217;s operational and financial targets. The executive team, with its extensive experience in the Permian Basin, has many relationships with operators and service providers in the region. Ring believes that leveraging its relationships will be a competitive advantage in identifying acquisition targets. Management&#8217;s proven ability to evaluate resource potential will allow Ring to successfully acquire acreage and bring out more value in the assets. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#183; Growing production and reserves by developing our oil-rich resource base. Over the long-term, Ring intends to drill and develop its acreage base in an effort to maximize its value and resource potential. Ring&#8217;s portfolio of proved oil and natural gas reserves consists of 91% oil and 9% natural gas. Of those reserves, 33% of the proved reserves are classified as proved developed producing, or &#8220;PDP,&#8221; 2% are classified as proved developed non-producing, or &#8220;PDNP,&#8221; and approximately 65% are classified as proved undeveloped, or &#8220;PUD.&#8221; Through the conversion of undeveloped reserves to developed reserves, Ring will seek to increase production, reserves and cash flow while gaining favorable returns on invested capital. &#160;

&#160; &#160; Through December 31, 2015, we increased our proved reserves to approximately 24.4 million BOE (barrel of oil equivalent). As of December 31, 2015, our estimated proved reserves had a pre-tax &#8220;PV10&#8221; (present value of future net revenues before income taxes discounted at 10%) of approximately $240.2 million and a Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows of approximately $172.7 million. The difference between these two amounts is the effect of income taxes. The Company presents the pre-tax PV10 value, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, because it is a widely used industry standard which we believe is useful to those who may review this Annual Report when comparing our asset base and performance to other comparable oil and gas exploration and production companies.

&#160;

While Ring will continue to do some development near term, such development will be more limited while commodity prices remain low and unstable. The Company will manage any development activity around its operating cash flow.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Employ industry leading drilling and completion techniques. Ring&#8217;s executive team, which has over 100 years combined experience in the oil and gas industry, intends to utilize new and innovative technological advancements and careful geological evaluation in reservoir engineering to generate value for its stockholders and to build development opportunities for years to come. Improved efficiency through employing technological advancements can provide a significant benefit in a continuous drilling program such as the one Ring contemplates for its current inventory of drilling locations. Additionally, Ring believes that the experience of its executive team will help reduce the time and cost associated with drilling and completing both conventional and horizontal wells, while potentially increasing recovery. &#160; 

Ring Energy&#8217;s Strengths 

&#160; 

&#160; &#183; High quality asset base in one of North America&#8217;s leading resource plays. Ring&#8217;s acreage in the Permian Basin is located in Andrews and Gaines Counties, which is in the heart of the Central Basin Platform, and in Culberson and Reeves Counties, which is in the Delaware Basin. As of December 31, 2015, Ring has drilled 188 wells on its acreage and re-stimulated 33 existing wells on its Central Basin Acreage and has drilled one well and recompleted one existing well on its Delaware Basin acreage. As of December 31, 2015, estimated net proved reserves were comprised of approximately 91% oil and 9% natural gas. &#160; 

&#160; &#183; De-risked Permian acreage position with multi-year vertical drilling inventory. As of December 31, 2015, Ring has drilled 189 gross operated wells across its leasehold position with a 100% success rate. The Company has also re-stimulated 34 existing wells with attractive well economics. Ring has identified a multi-year inventory of potential drilling locations that will drive reserves and production growth and provide attractive return opportunities. As of December 31, 2015, Ring has 212 identified proven vertical drilling locations in Andrews and Gaines Counties and 43 identified proven vertical drilling locations in Culberson and Reeves Counties in its proved undeveloped reserves. It believes it has an additional 2,478 potential locations based on 10-acre downspacing in Andrews and Gaines Counties and 489 potential locations based on 20-acre downspacing in Culberson and Reeves Counties. The Company views this drilling inventory as de-risked because of the significant production history in the area and well-established industry activity surrounding the acreage. &#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Experienced and proven management team focused on the Permian Basin. The executive team has an average of approximately 23 years of industry experience per person, most of which has been focused in the Permian Basin. The Company believes its management and technical team is one of the principal competitive strengths due to the team&#8217;s proven ability to identify and integrate acquisitions, focus on cost efficiencies while managing a large-scale development program and disciplined allocation of capital to high-returning projects. Ring&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer Kelly Hoffman has had a successful career in the Permian Basin since 1975 when he started with Amoco Production Company and found further success in West Texas when he co-founded AOCO. In addition, Chairman of the Board, Lloyd T. Rochford, and Director, Stanley M. McCabe, formed Arena Resources, Inc. (&#8220;Arena&#8221;) in 2001, which operated in the same proximate area as Ring&#8217;s Andrews and Gaines County acreage. Arena eventually sold to SandRidge Energy, Inc., in July 2010 for $1.6 billion. Ring&#8217;s management team aims to execute a similar growth strategy and development plan by leveraging its industry relationships and significant operational experience in these regions. &#160;

&#160; &#183; Concentrated acreage position with high degree of operational control. Ring operates approximately 99% of its Permian Basin and Kansas acreage positions. The operating control allows Ring to implement and benefit from its strategy of enhancing returns through operational and cost efficiencies. Additionally, as the operator of substantially all of its acreage, Ring retains the ability to adjust its capital expenditures based on well performance and commodity price forecasts. &#160;

Competitive Business Conditions 

&#160;

We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel. Some of our competitors possess and employ financial resources substantially greater than ours and some of our competitors employ more technical personnel. These factors can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects, and to evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than what our financial or technical resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to identify, evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry.

&#160; 

The actual price range of crude oil is largely established by major crude oil purchasers and commodities trading. Pricing for natural gas is based on regional supply and demand conditions. To this extent, we believe we receive oil and gas prices comparable to other producers. There is little risk in our ability to sell all our current production at current prices with a reasonable profit margin. The risk of domestic overproduction at current prices is not deemed significant. We view our primary pricing risk to be related to a potential decline in prices to a level which could render our current production uneconomical.

&#160;

We are presently committed to use the services of the existing gathering systems of the companies that purchase our natural gas production. This commitment is tied to existing natural gas purchase contracts associated with our production This commitment potentially gives such gathering companies certain short-term relative monopolistic powers to set gathering and transportation costs, because obtaining the services of an alternative gathering company would require substantial additional costs (since an alternative gathering company would be required to lay new pipeline and/or obtain new rights of way to any lease from which we are selling production). We are not subject to third party gathering systems for our oil production. Some of our oil production is sold through a third party pipeline which has no regional competition. All other oil production is transported by the oil purchaser by trucks with competitive trucking costs in the area.

&#160;

Major Customers 

&#160;

We principally sell our oil and natural gas production to end users, marketers and other purchasers that have access to nearby pipeline facilities. In areas where there is no practical access to pipelines, oil is trucked to storage facilities. Our marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control, the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, sales to three customers, Occidental Energy Marketing (&#8220;Oxy&#8221;), Enterprise Crude Oil LLC (&#8220;Enterprise&#8221;) and HollyFrontier Refining and Marketing (&#8220;HollyFrontier&#8221;) represented 48%, 23% and 20%, respectively, of oil and gas revenues. At December 31, 2015, Oxy represented 53% of our accounts receivable and Enterprise represented 30%. However, we believe that the loss of these customers would not materially impact our business because we could readily find other purchasers for our oil and gas produced.

&#160; 

Delivery Commitments 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we were not committed to providing a fixed quantity of oil or gas under any existing contracts.

&#160; 

&#160; 5 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Governmental Regulations 

&#160; 

Oil and natural gas operations such as ours are subject to various types of legislation, regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities. This legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability.

&#160; 

Regulation of Drilling and Production 

&#160;

The production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local, state and federal statutes, rules, orders and regulations. Federal, state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. All of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, the regulation of well spacing, and plugging and abandonment of wells. The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.

&#160;

The failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.

&#160; 

Regulation of Transportation of Oil 

&#160;

Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.

&#160;

Our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. Intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by pro-rationing provisions set forth in the pipelines&#8217; published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.

&#160;

Regulation of Transportation and Sale of Natural Gas 

&#160;

Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and regulations issued under those Acts by the FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.

&#160;

Since 1985, the FERC has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non-discriminatory basis. The FERC has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by, among other things, unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services. Although the FERC&#8217;s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers, they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry.

&#160;

We cannot accurately predict whether the FERC&#8217;s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in markets in which our natural gas is sold. Therefore, we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach established by the FERC will continue. However, we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers.

&#160;

Intrastate natural gas transportation is subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.

&#160; 

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Environmental Compliance and Risks 

&#160;

Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Historically, most of the environmental regulation of oil and gas production has been left to state regulatory boards or agencies in those jurisdictions where there is significant gas and oil production, with limited direct regulation by such federal agencies as the Environmental Protection Agency. However, while we believe this generally to be the case for our production activities in Texas and Kansas, there are various regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and other governmental agencies that would govern significant spills, blow-outs, or uncontrolled emissions.

&#160;

In Texas and Kansas specific oil and gas regulations apply to the drilling, completion and operations of wells, and the disposal of waste oil and salt water. There are also procedures incident to the plugging and abandonment of dry holes or other non-operational wells, all as governed by the applicable governing state agency.

&#160;

At the federal level, among the more significant laws and regulations that may affect our business and the oil and gas industry are: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, also known as &#8220;CERCLA&#8221; or &#8220;Superfund; the Oil Pollution Act of 1990; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, also known as &#8220;RCRA,&#8221;; the Clean Air Act; Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or the Clean Water Act; and the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974.

&#160;

Compliance with these regulations may constitute a significant cost and effort for us. No specific accounting for environmental compliance has been maintained or projected by us at this time. We are not presently aware of any environmental demands, claims, or adverse actions, litigation or administrative proceedings in which either we or our acquired properties are involved in or subject to, or arising out of any predecessor operations.

&#160;

In the event of a breach of environmental regulations, these environmental regulatory agencies have a broad range of alternative or cumulative remedies which include: ordering a clean-up of any spills or waste material and restoration of the soil or water to conditions existing prior to the environmental violation; fines; or enjoining further drilling, completion or production activities. In certain egregious situations the agencies may also pursue criminal remedies against us or our principal officers.

&#160; 

Operational Hazards and Insurance 

&#160; 

The oil business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow outs, pipe failures and, in some cases, abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil spills, natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury, loss of life, damage or destruction to property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations.

&#160;

In accordance with what we believe to be industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.

&#160; 

Current Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had thirty-one full-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any labor union. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory and have never experienced a work stoppage or strike.

&#160;

We also retain certain engineers, geologists, landmen, pumpers and other personnel on a contract or fee basis as necessary for our operations.

&#160; 

Seasonal Nature of Business 

&#160;

Generally, the demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates depending on the time of year. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers may sometimes lessen this fluctuation. Further, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies, and industrial end users utilize oil and natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can also lessen seasonal demand.
