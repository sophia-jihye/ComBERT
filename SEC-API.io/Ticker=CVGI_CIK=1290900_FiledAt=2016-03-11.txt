Business 

C OMPANY &#32;O VERVIEW 

Commercial Vehicle Group, Inc. is a Delaware (USA) corporation. We were formed as a privately-held company in August 2000. We became a publicly held company in 2004. The Company (and its subsidiaries) is a leading supplier of a full range of cab related products and systems for the global commercial vehicle market, including the medium-and heavy-duty truck (&#8220;MD/HD Truck&#8221;) market, the medium-and heavy-construction vehicle market, and the military, bus, agriculture, specialty transportation, mining, industrial equipment and off-road recreational markets. 

The Company has manufacturing operations in the United States, Mexico, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Ukraine, China, India and Australia. Our products are primarily sold in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. 

Our products include seats and seating systems (&#8220;Seats&#8221;); trim systems and components (&#8220;Trim&#8221;); cab structures, sleeper boxes, body panels and structural components; mirrors, wipers and controls; and electronic wire harness and panel assemblies specifically designed for applications in commercial and other vehicles. 

We are differentiated from automotive industry suppliers by our ability to manufacture low volume, customized products on a sequenced basis to meet the requirements of our customers. We believe our products are used by a majority of the North American MD/HD Truck and certain leading global construction and agriculture original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;), which we believe creates an opportunity to cross-sell our products. 

Our Long-term Strategy 

Our long-term strategic plan is a roadmap by product, geographic region, and end market to guide resource allocation and other decision making to achieve our long-term goals. The overarching goal is to deliver top quartile total shareholder return. To that end, we evaluated our opportunity to grow organically by end market. We currently believe we have approximately 5% market share of the addressable global truck, bus, construction and agriculture end markets. Accordingly, we believe we have significant opportunity to grow organically in our end markets. We evaluated our product portfolio in the context of this organic market growth opportunity and our ability to win in the marketplace. Our core products are Seats, Trim and wire harnesses and our complementary products include structures, wipers, mirrors and office seats. We expect to realize some geographic diversification over the planned period toward the Asia-Pacific region. We also expect to realize some end market diversification more weighted toward the agriculture market, and to a lesser extent the construction market. We intend to allocate resources consistent with our strategic plan; and more specifically, consistent with our core and complementary product portfolio, geographic region and end market diversification objectives. We periodically evaluate our long-term strategic plan in response to significant changes in our business environment and other factors. 

Although our long-term strategic plan is an organic growth plan, we will consider opportunistic acquisitions to supplement our product portfolio, and to enhance our ability to serve our customers in our geographic end markets. 

Strategic Footprint 

We continuously review our manufacturing footprint to ensure we efficiently utilize our resources. In November 2015, management announced a restructuring and cost reduction plan, which is expected to lower operating costs by $8 to $12 million annually when fully implemented as of the end of 2017. Pre-tax costs associated with these actions, including associated capital investment, were $0.8 million in 2015 and are expected to be $6 to $8 million in 2016 and $4 to $6 million in 2017. The majority of these costs are employee-related separation costs and other costs associated with the transfer of production and subsequent closure of facilities. 

S EGMENTS 

Our operations are comprised of two reportable segments: the Global Truck and Bus Segment (&#8220;GTB Segment&#8221;) and the Global Construction and Agriculture Segment (&#8220;GCA Segment&#8221;). This is consistent with how the Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM"), the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, manages the business. Each of these segments consists of a number of manufacturing facilities. Generally, the facilities in the GTB Segment manufacture and sell Seats, Trim, wipers, mirrors, structures and other products into the MD/HD Truck and bus markets. Generally, the facilities in the GCA Segment manufacture and sell wire harnesses, Seats and other products into the construction and agriculture markets. Both segments participate in the aftermarket. Certain of our manufacturing facilities manufacture and sell products through both of our segments. Each manufacturing facility that sells products through both segments is reflected in the financial results of the segment that has the greatest amount of sales from that manufacturing facility. Our segments are more specifically described below.

Global Truck and Bus Industry 

Commercial Vehicle Supply Market Overview. &#32; Commercial vehicles are used in a wide variety of end markets, including local and long-haul commercial trucking, bus, construction, mining, agricultural, military, industrial, municipal, off-road recreation and specialty vehicle markets. The commercial vehicle supply industry can generally be separated into two categories: (1) sales to OEMs, in which products are sold in relatively large quantities directly for use by OEMs in new commercial and construction vehicles; and (2) aftermarket sales, in which products are sold as replacements in varying quantities to a wide range of original equipment service organizations, wholesalers, retailers and installers. In the OEM market, suppliers are generally divided into tiers &#8212; &#8220;Tier 1&#8221; suppliers that provide products directly to OEMs, and &#8220;Tier 2&#8221; and &#8220;Tier 3&#8221; suppliers that sell products principally to other suppliers for integration into those suppliers&#8217; own product offerings. We are generally a Tier I supplier. 

Our largest end market, the North American commercial truck industry, is supplied by medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle suppliers, as well as automotive suppliers. The commercial vehicle supplier industry is fragmented and comprised of several large companies and many smaller companies. In addition, the commercial vehicle supplier industry is characterized by relatively low production volumes and can have considerable barriers to entry, including the following: (1) specific technical and manufacturing requirements, (2) high transition costs to shift production to new suppliers, (3) just-in-time delivery requirements and (4) strong brand name recognition. Foreign competition is growing with the globalization of the world economy. 

Although OEM demand for our products is directly correlated with new vehicle production, suppliers like us can grow by increasing sales through the cross selling and bundling of products, further penetrating existing customers&#8217; businesses, gaining new customers, expanding into new geographic markets, developing new content in our products to meet changing customer needs and by increasing aftermarket sales. We believe that companies with a global presence, advanced technology, engineering and manufacturing and support capabilities, such as our company, are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities. 

North American Commercial Truck Market. &#32; Purchasers of commercial trucks include fleet operators, owner operators, governmental agencies and industrial end users. Commercial vehicles used for local and long-haul commercial trucking are generally classified by gross vehicle weight. Class 8 vehicles are trucks with gross vehicle weight in excess of 33,000 lbs. and Classes 5 through 7 vehicles are trucks with gross vehicle weight from 16,001 lbs. to 33,000 lbs. The following table shows production levels of commercial vehicles used for local and long-haul commercial trucking from 2011 through 2015 in North America:

The following describes the major markets within the commercial vehicle market in which the GTB Segment competes: 

Class 8 Truck Market. &#32; The global Class 8 ("Class 8" or "heavy-duty") truck manufacturing market is concentrated in three primary regions: North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The global Class 8 truck market is localized in nature due to the following factors: (1) the prohibitive costs of shipping components from one region to another, (2) the high degree of customization to meet the region-specific demands of end-users and (3) the ability to meet just-in-time delivery requirements. According to ACT Research, four companies represented approximately 99% of North American Class 8 truck production in 2015. The percentages of Class 8 production represented by Daimler, PACCAR, A.B. Volvo, and Navistar were approximately 40%, 27%, 20%, and 12%, respectively, in 2015. We supply products to all of these OEMs. 

New Class 8 truck commercial vehicle demand has historically been cyclical and is particularly sensitive to economic factors that generate a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled by commercial vehicles. 

The following table illustrates North American Class 8 truck build for the years 2013 to 2020: 

&#8220;E&#8221; &#8212; Estimated 

Source: ACT (January 2016). 

Class 5-7 Truck Market. &#32;&#32;&#32;North American Class 5-7 ("Class 5-7" or "medium-duty") includes recreational vehicles, buses and medium-duty trucks. We primarily participate in the Class 6 and 7 medium-duty truck market. The medium-duty market is influenced by overall economic conditions but has historically been less cyclical than the North American Class 8 market, with highs and lows generally not as pronounced as the Class 8 market. As the North American truck fleet companies move to a distribution center model, requiring less long-haul freight vehicles, the demand for medium-duty trucks may increase. 

&#32;The following table illustrates the North American Class 5-7 truck build for the years 2013 through 2020: 

&#32; 

&#8220;E&#8221; &#8212; Estimated 

Source: ACT (January 2016). 

We believe the following factors are currently driving the North American Class 8 truck market: 

Economic Conditions. &#32; The North American truck industry is directly influenced by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Since heavy-duty truck OEMs supply the fleet operators, their production levels generally reflect the demand for freight and the fleet operators' access to capital. 

Truck Replacement Cycle and Fleet Aging. The average age of the U.S. Class 8 truck population is approximately 10.6 years in 2015 . The average fleet age tends to run in cycles as freight companies permit their truck fleets to age during periods of lagging demand and then replenish those fleets during periods of increasing demand. As truck fleets age, maintenance costs typically increase. Freight companies evaluate the economics between repair and replacement as well as the potential to utilize more cost-effective technology in vehicles. The chart below illustrates the approximate average age of the U.S. Class 8 truck population: 

&#8220;E&#8221; &#8212; Estimated 

Source: ACT (January 2016). 

Commercial Truck Aftermarket. &#32; The GTB Segment sells aftermarket products primarily in North America. Demand for aftermarket products is driven by the quality of OEM parts, the number of vehicles in operation, the average age of the vehicle fleet, the content and value per vehicle, vehicle usage and the average useful life of vehicle parts. Aftermarket sales tend to be at a higher margin. The recurring nature of aftermarket revenue can be expected to provide some insulation to the overall cyclical nature of the industry as it tends to provide a more stable stream of revenues. Brand equity and the extent of a company&#8217;s distribution network also contribute to the level of aftermarket sales. We believe CVG has a widely recognized brand portfolio and participates in most retail sales channels including Original Equipment Dealer networks and independent distributors.

Global Construction and Agriculture Industries 

Commercial Construction Vehicle Market. &#32; New vehicle demand in the global construction equipment market generally follows certain economic conditions including GDP, infrastructure investment, housing starts, business investment, oil and energy investment and industrial production around the world. Within the construction market, there are two classes of construction equipment markets: the medium and heavy construction equipment market (weighing over 12 metric tons) and the light construction 

equipment market (weighing below 12 metric tons). Our construction equipment products are primarily used in the medium and heavy construction equipment markets, with a growing emphasis on light and utility machines. The platforms that we generally participate in include: cranes, pavers, planers &#38; profilers, dozers, loaders, graders, haulers, tractors, excavators, backhoes, material handling and compactors. Demand in the medium and heavy construction equipment market is typically related to the level of larger-scale infrastructure development projects such as highways, dams, harbors, hospitals, airports and industrial development as well as activity in the mining, forestry and other raw material based industries. The global production units in the construction market for the primary products we market such as pavers, dozers, excavators, graders, skid steers, compactors, material handling and loaders was soft in 2015 and we believe 2016 will have a bias toward continuing softness. 

Purchasers of medium and heavy construction equipment include construction companies, municipalities, local governments, rental fleet owners, quarrying and mining companies and forestry related industries. Purchasers of light construction equipment include contractors, rental fleet owners, landscapers, logistics companies and farmers. In the medium and heavy construction equipment market, we primarily supply OEMs with our wire harness and seating products. 

&#32;The U.S. market experienced some slow down in the construction industry in 2015 and we expect a bias toward continued softening in 2016. We expect the market for our products in Europe to grow moderately in 2016. Although we expect a continued contraction in Asia-Pacific in the short term, we believe Asia-Pacific continues to be a key market in our organic growth strategy and that the Asia-Pacific equipment markets will provide us with market penetration and growth opportunities in the long term. 

Agricultural Equipment Market. &#32; We market most of our products for small, medium and large agricultural equipment across a spectrum of machines including tractors, sprayers, bailers, farm telehandler equipment and harvesters. Sales and production of these vehicles can be influenced by rising or falling farm commodity prices, land values, profitability, and other factors such as increased mechanization in emerging economies and new uses for crop materials such as biofuels and other factors. In the medium to longer term, a combination of factors create the need for more productive agricultural equipment, such as: (1) population growth, (2) an evolving sophistication of dietary habits and (3) constraints on arable land and other macroeconomic and demographic factors. 

Military Equipment Market. &#32; We supply products for heavy- and medium-payload tactical trucks that are used by various military customers. Military equipment production is particularly sensitive to political and governmental budgetary considerations.

Due to their high cost, full body E-coat systems, such as ours, are rarely found outside of the manufacturing operations of the major OEMs. We also have large press lines which provide us with manufacturing flexibility for both aluminum and steel stampings delivered just-in-time to our cab assembly plants. 

&#8226; 

Mirrors, Wipers and Controls . We manufacture our mirrors, wipers and controls utilizing a variety of manufacturing processes and techniques. Our mirrors, wipers and controls are primarily assembled utilizing semi-automatic work cells, electronically tested and then packaged. 

&#8226; 

Electronic Wire Harnesses and Panel Assemblies . We utilize several manufacturing techniques to produce the majority of our electronic wire harnesses and panel assemblies. Our processes, manual and automated, are designed to produce a wide range of wire harnesses and panel assemblies in short time frames. Our wire harnesses and panel assemblies are electronically and hand tested. 

We have a broad array of processes to enable us to meet our OEM customers&#8217; styling and cost requirements. The vehicle cab is the most significant and appealing aspect to the operator of the vehicle; each commercial vehicle OEM therefore has unique requirements as to feel, appearance and features. 

The end markets for our products can be highly specialized and our customers frequently request modified products in low volumes within an expedited delivery timeframe. As a result, we primarily utilize flexible manufacturing cells at most of our production facilities. Manufacturing cells are clusters of individual manufacturing operations and work stations. This provides flexibility by allowing efficient changes to the number of operations each operator performs. When compared to the more traditional, less flexible assembly line process, cell manufacturing allows us to better maintain our product output consistent with our OEM customers&#8217; requirements and reduce the level of inventory. 

When an end-user buys a commercial vehicle, the end-user will specify the seat and other features for that vehicle. Because our Seats are unique, our manufacturing facilities have significant complexity which we manage by building in sequence. We build our Seats as orders are received, and the Seats are delivered to our customer&#8217;s rack in the sequence in which vehicles come down the assembly line. We have systems in place that allow us to provide complete customized interior kits in boxes that are delivered in sequence. Sequencing reduces our cost of production because it eliminates warehousing costs and reduces waste and obsolescence, offsetting any increased labor costs. Several of our manufacturing facilities are strategically located near our customers&#8217; assembly plants, which facilitates this process and minimizes shipping costs. 

We employ just-in-time manufacturing and system sourcing in our operations to meet customer requirements for faster deliveries and to minimize our need to carry significant inventory levels. We utilize material systems to manage inventory levels and, in certain locations, we have inventory delivered as often as two times per day from a nearby facility based on the previous day&#8217;s order. This eliminates the need to carry excess inventory at our facilities. 

Within our cyclical industries, we strive to maintain a certain portion of temporary labor to improve our ability to flex our costs and throughput as required by fluctuating customer demand. We engage our core employees to assist in making our processes efficient. 

Seasonality 

OEMs close their production facilities, around holidays or when demand drops, reducing work days. Our cost structure, to the extent it is variable, provides us with some flexibility during these periods. 

Our Supply Agreements 

Our supply agreements generally provide for fixed pricing but do not require us to purchase any specified quantities. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of raw materials or finished products in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules, as well as service requirements. Steel, aluminum, petroleum-based products, copper, resin, foam, fabrics, wire and wire components comprise the most significant portion of our raw material costs. We typically purchase steel, copper and petroleum-based products at market prices that are fixed over varying periods of time. Due to the volatility in pricing over the last several years, we use methods such as market index pricing and competitive bidding to assist in reducing our overall cost. We strive to align our customer pricing and material costs to minimize the impact of steel, copper and petrochemical price fluctuations. Certain component purchases and suppliers are directed by our customers, so we generally will pass through directly to the customer any cost changes from these components. We do not believe we are dependent on a single supplier or limited group of suppliers for our raw materials. 

Our Customer Contracts 

Our OEM customers generally source business to us pursuant to written contracts, purchase orders or other firm commitments (&#8220;Commercial Arrangements&#8221;) in terms of price, quality, technology and delivery. Awarded business generally covers the supply of all or a portion of a customer&#8217;s production and service requirements for a particular product program rather than the supply of a specific quantity of products. In general, these Commercial Arrangements provide that the customer can terminate them if we do not meet specified quality, delivery and cost requirements. Although these Commercial Arrangements may be terminated at any time by our customers (but not by us), such terminations have historically been minimal and have not had a material impact on our results of operations. Because we produce products for a broad cross section of vehicle models, we are not overly reliant on any one vehicle model. 

Our contracts with our OEM customers may provide for an annual prospective productivity cost reduction. These productivity cost reductions are generally calculated on an annual basis as a percentage of the previous year&#8217;s purchases by each customer. The reduction is achieved through engineering changes, material cost reductions, logistics savings, reductions in packaging cost and labor efficiencies. Historically, most of these cost reductions have been offset by both internal reductions and through the assistance of our supply base, although no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve such reductions in the future. 

Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to create customer awareness of our engineering, design and manufacturing capabilities. Our sales and marketing staff work closely with our design and engineering personnel to prepare the materials used for bidding on new business, as well as to provide a consistent interface between us and our key customers. We have sales and marketing personnel located in every major region in which we operate. From time to time, we participate in industry trade shows and advertise in industry publications. 

Our principal customers for our aftermarket sales include OEM dealers and independent wholesale or retail distributors. Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on support of these two distribution chains, as well as participation in industry trade shows and direct contact with major fleets. 

Competitive Strengths 

Our competitive strengths include, but are not limited to, the following: 

Market Positions and Brands. We believe we have a strong market position supplying Seats and Trim products to the North American MD/HD Truck market. Our strong position in the North American MD/HD Truck market leads us to believe we have processes in place to design, manufacture and introduce products that meet customers&#8217; expectations in that market. We also believe we are competitive as a global supplier of construction vehicle Seats. Our major product brands include KAB Seating &#8482; , National Seating &#8482; , Bostrom Seating &#174; , Sprague Devices &#174; , RoadWatch &#8482; , Stratos &#8482; , and FinishTEK &#8482; . 

Comprehensive Cab Product and Cab System Solutions. We manufacture a broad base of products utilized in the interior and the exterior of a commercial vehicle cab. We believe the breadth of our product offerings provides us with a potential opportunity for further customer penetration through cross-selling initiatives and by bundling our products to provide complete system solutions. 

End-User Focused Product Innovation. We believe that commercial vehicle OEMs focus on interior and exterior product design features that better serve the vehicle operator and therefore seek suppliers that can provide product innovation. Accordingly, we have engineering, and research and development capabilities to assist OEMs in meeting those needs. We believe this helps us secure content on new as well as current platforms and models. 

Flexible Manufacturing Capabilities. Because commercial vehicle OEMs permit their customers to select from an extensive menu of cab options, our end users frequently request modified products in low volumes within a limited time frame. We can leverage our flexible manufacturing capabilities to provide low volume, customized products to meet styling, cost and just-in-time delivery requirements. We manufacture or assemble our products at facilities in North America, Europe and in the Asia-Pacific region. 

Global Capabilities. Because many of our customers manufacture and sell their products on a global basis, we have sales, engineering, manufacturing and assembly capabilities in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. 

Relationships with Leading Customers and Major North American Fleets. Because of our comprehensive product offerings, brand names and product features, we are a global supplier to many of the leading MD/HD Truck, construction and specialty commercial vehicle manufacturers such as PACCAR, Caterpillar, Volvo/Mack, Navistar, Daimler Trucks, John Deere, Oshkosh Corporation, Komatsu and &#352;koda (part of the Volkswagen Group). In addition, we maintain relationships with the major MD/HD Truck fleet organizations that are end-users of our products such as Schneider National, Werner, Walmart, FedEx and JB Hunt. 

Barriers to Entry. Barriers to entry include investment, specific engineering requirements, transition costs for OEMs to shift production to new suppliers, just-in-time delivery requirements and brand name recognition. 

Management Team. We believe that our management team has substantial knowledge and expertise in critical operational areas and has a demonstrated ability to reduce costs, improve processes and expand revenue through product, market, geography and customer diversification. 

Research and Development 

Our research and development capabilities offer quality and technologically advanced products to our customers at competitive prices. We offer industrial engineering, product design, specialized simulation and testing and evaluation services that are necessary in today&#8217;s global markets. Our capabilities in acoustics, thermal efficiency, benchmarking, multi-axis durability, biomechanics, comfort, prototyping and process prove-out allow us to provide complete integrated solutions for the end-user. 

We engage in global engineering, and research and development activities that improve the reliability, performance and cost-effectiveness of our existing products and support the design and development and testing of new products for existing and new applications. We are developing a global engineering support center at our India facilities to provide a cost-effective global engineering resource to all of our seat facilities. 

Generally, we work with our customers&#8217; engineering and development teams at the beginning of the concept design process for new components and assemblies and systems, or the re-engineering process for existing components and assemblies, in order to leverage production efficiency and quality. Our customers are continuously searching for advanced products while maintaining cost, quality and performance deliverables. 

Product development cycles are compressing and we believe we are staffed with experienced engineers and have equipment and technology to support early design involvement that result in products that timely meet or exceed the customer&#8217;s design and performance requirements and are more efficient to manufacture. Our ability to support our products and customers with extensive involvement enhances our position for bidding on such business. We work aggressively to ensure that our quality and delivery metrics distinguish us from our competitors. 

Research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;totaled $7.4 million , $6.3 million &#32;and $6.0 million , respectively. 

Intellectual Property 

Our principal intellectual property consists of product and process technology, a limited number of U.S. and foreign patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights. Although our intellectual property is important to our business operations and in the aggregate constitutes a valuable asset, we do not believe that any single patent, trade secret, trademark or copyright, or group of patents, trade secrets, trademarks or copyrights is critical to the success of our business. Our policy is to seek statutory protection for all significant intellectual property embodied in patents, trademarks and copyrights. As we diversify and globalize our operations, we may encounter localized laws and practices that are not as stringent or enforceable as those in developed markets and thus risk intellectual property infringement. 

Our major brands include CVG &#8482; , Sprague Devices &#174; , Moto Mirror &#174; , RoadWatch &#174; , KAB Seating &#8482; , National Seating &#8482; , Bostrom Seating &#174; , Stratos &#8482; and FinishTEK &#8482; . We believe that our brands are valuable, but that our business is not dependent on any one brand. We own U.S. federal trademark registrations for several of our products. 

Backlog 

Our customers may place annual blanket purchase orders that do not obligate them to purchase any specific or minimum amount of products from us until a release is issued by the customer under the blanket purchase order. Releases are typically placed 30 to 90 days prior to required delivery and may be canceled at any time within agreed terms. We do not believe that our backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful indicator of future sales since orders may be rescheduled or canceled. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had approximately 6,700 permanent employees, of whom approximately 18% were salaried and the remainder hourly. As of December 31, 2015 , approximately 60% of the employees in our North American operations were unionized, with the majority of union represented personnel based in Mexico. On September 23, 2015, employees in our Piedmont, Alabama facility voted to be represented by the United Auto Workers union. We continue to actively negotiate with union representatives but no collective bargaining agreement has been reached and a contract has not yet been ratified. Approximately 57% of our employees of our European and Asia-Pacific operations were represented by shop steward committees. We did not experience any material strikes, lockouts or work stoppages during 2015 &#32;and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory. On an as-needed basis during peak periods, contract and temporary employees are utilized. During periods of weak demand, we respond to reduced volumes through flexible scheduling, furloughs and reductions in force as necessary. 

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety, including laws regulating air emissions, wastewater discharges, and the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the soil, ground or air; and the health and safety of our colleagues. We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot assure you that we are, or have been, in complete compliance with such environmental and safety laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In some instances, such a fine or sanction could have a material adverse effect on us. We are also subject to laws imposing liability for the cleanup of contaminated property. Under these laws, we could be held liable for costs and damages relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third-party sites to which we sent waste containing hazardous substances. The amount of such liability could be material. 

Several of our facilities are certified as or are in the process of being certified as ISO 9001, 14000 or 14001 compliant (the international environmental management standard) or are developing similar environmental management systems. Although we have made and will continue to make expenditures to implement such environmental programs and comply with environmental requirements, we do not expect to make material expenditures for environmental controls in 2016. The environmental laws to which we are subject have become more stringent over time, and we could incur material costs or expenses in the future to comply with environmental laws. 

Certain of our operations generate hazardous substances and wastes. If a release of such substances or wastes occurs at or from our properties, or at or from any offsite disposal location to which substances or wastes from our current or former operations were taken, or if contamination is discovered at any of our current or former properties, we may be held liable for the cost of cleanup and for any other response by governmental authorities or private parties, together with any associated fines, penalties or damages. In most jurisdictions, this liability would arise whether or not we had complied with environmental laws governing the handling of hazardous substances or wastes. 

Government Regulations 

Although the products we manufacture and supply to commercial vehicle OEMs are not subject to significant government regulation, our business is indirectly impacted by the extensive governmental regulation applicable to commercial vehicle OEMs. These regulations primarily relate to emissions and noise standards imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), state regulatory agencies, such as the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") and other regulatory agencies around the world. Commercial vehicle OEMs are also subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Changes in emission standards and other proposed governmental regulations could impact the demand for commercial vehicles and, as a result, indirectly impact our operations. For example, in 2011, the EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA") adopted a program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the fuel efficiency of medium-and heavy-duty vehicles. These standards phase in with increasing stringency in each model year from 2014 to 2018. Any changes in EPA or CARB regulations can have an impact on production volumes for new vehicles and, as a result, indirectly impact our operations. To the extent that current or future 

governmental regulation has a negative impact on the demand for commercial vehicles, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.
