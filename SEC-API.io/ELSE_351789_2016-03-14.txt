 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

Electro-Sensors, Inc. (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;ESI&#8221;) is engaged in manufacturing and selling industrial production monitoring and process control systems. 

&#160; 

In addition, through our former subsidiary ESI Investment Company, we periodically made strategic investments in other businesses and companies, primarily when we believed that these investments would facilitate the development of technology complementary to our existing products. During 2015, we sold substantially all our remaining investments in other businesses and companies. Effective December 31, 2015, we merged ESI Investment Company and Senstar Corporation, a subsidiary with no business operations, into the parent company Electro-Sensors, Inc. 

&#160; 

ESI was incorporated in Minnesota in July 1968. Our executive offices are located at 6111 Blue Circle Drive, Minnetonka, Minnesota, 55343-9108. Our telephone number is (952) 930-0100. 

&#160; 

Products 

&#160; 

We manufacture and sell several different types of monitoring systems that measure actual machine production and operation rates, as well as systems that regulate the speed of related machines in production processes. 

&#160; 

Our speed monitoring systems compare revolutions per minute or speed against acceptable rates as determined by a customer. The systems vary in complexity, from a simple system that detects slow-downs or stoppages, to more sophisticated systems that warn of deviations from precise tolerances and that permit various subsidiary operations to be determined through monitoring the shaft speed. 

&#160; 

The speed monitoring systems also include a line of products that measure production counts or rates, such as parts, gallons, or board feet. The speed monitoring systems also include alarm systems, tachometers, and other devices that translate impulses from the sensors into alarm signals, computer inputs, or digital displays that are usable by the customer. 

&#160; 

We also offer production monitoring devices that include a tilt switch, vibration monitor, and slide gate position monitor. A tilt switch is designed to alert the operator when a storage bin or production system reaches a certain capacity ( e.g., when grain fills a silo). A vibration monitor will alert an operator when the vibration of a machine in a production system exceeds or is less than a specified level. The slide gate position monitor is used in plant operations to provide feedback of the position of a slide gate. As part of our Electro-Sentry Hazard Monitoring system, we also have temperature sensors that are used to monitor bearing temperature and belt misalignment. 

&#160; 

We have several products used in drive control systems that regulate the speed of motors on related machines in a production sequence to ensure that the performances of various operations are coordinated. The products consist of a line of digital control products for motors that require a complete closed loop PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) control. The closed loop controllers coordinate production speed among process motors and reduce waste. 

&#160; 

We have a sales agreement with Motrona GmbH, a German control and interface devices manufacturer, under which we have the right to distribute Motrona products in the United States. These products interface with our products on various applications. 

&#160; 

In 2008, we introduced our Electro-Sentry 1 hazard monitoring system, which integrates our sensors for monitoring temperature, belt misalignment, and shaft speed with a programmable logic controller and touch screen interface to create a complete system for hazard monitoring. The system enables our customers to locate which part of their material handling system is operating incorrectly, typically in less than ten seconds, by using visual diagrams on a touch screen. In 2012, we introduced the Electro-Sentry 16 hazard monitoring system and added new features to the Electro-Sentry 1 system. 

&#160; 

In 2013, the Company added ION Frequency/Discrete-In, a product that allows users to measure up to 12 shaft speeds and/or signal frequencies from pulse-frequency-output sensors. This is our third ION product, completing the ION product line to support all ESI sensor products and providing the customer high-speed/accuracy signal acquisition at low cost and saved wiring costs. The Company also expanded the Series 18 shaft speed sensors to include additional housings and connection options to reach a broader range of installations. In addition, in 2013 we also introduced product upgrades for sensing capability and ruggedness on our Hall-effect sensors. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we introduced a process meter for analog output sensors, such as our TT420, temperature sensors, ST420, speed sensors, and SG1000, slide gate position monitor. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Additionally, in 2014, the Company purchased the Insta-Link wireless hazard technology monitoring system and product family, together with related technology and intellectual property rights, from Harvest Engineering Inc., a privately held Illinois-based corporation, and its affiliated parties and owners (&#8220;Harvest&#8221;). The Company is marketing the wireless hazard monitoring products under its new HazardPRO TM product line and manufacturing and servicing these products at its Minnetonka, Minnesota facility. The Company agreed to pay $1,200,000 for the product line, of which $400,000 was paid at closing, and additional payments of $400,000 will be paid on each of the first and second anniversary of the closing. The final payment of $400,000 was made on February 18, 2016. Harvest may earn up to an additional $550,000 of purchase price, depending upon the achievement of revenue measures during the four calendar years following the closing. 

&#160; 

We expect to continue to expend resources to develop new products and to market new and existing products for use in a wide variety of monitoring applications. 

&#160; 

Our customers have diverse applications for our products in the grain, feed, bio-fuels, power generation, water utilities and waste water treatment, mining, chemical, and other processing areas. We continue to look for new industries to expand sales and may also consider acquiring compatible businesses as part of our growth strategy. We believe that a wide variety of organizations can achieve significant savings in both time and materials by adding production monitoring and drive control technology to existing processes to coordinate the operation of related machines. Our products are sold into both the &#8220;retro-fit&#8221; market and into new manufacturing or processing systems. 

&#160; 

Our corporate web site provides significant information and product application knowledge to existing and prospective customers and also direct knowledge to our sales partners. Information on our website is not incorporated by reference herein and is not a part of this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

We sell our products primarily through both our internal sales team and a number of manufacturer&#8217;s representatives and distributors located throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru, United Kingdom, Ukraine, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Australia, China, Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore. Sales to customers outside the United States represent approximately 13% of sales in 2015. The sensing and control units are sold under the Electro-Sensors, Inc. brand as a range of products from simple sensors to complex motor speed controllers. These products are sold to businesses in a wide variety of industries, including agriculture, grain-handling, feed, biofuels, food processing, chemicals, mining, utility, forest products, steel, tire, glass and electronics. Any business that uses machinery with a rotating shaft is a potential customer. 

&#160; 

We advertise in national industrial periodicals that cover a range of industrial products and attend several local, national and international tradeshows designated for the industry throughout the year. We also use our corporate website and other related industry websites for advertising and marketing purposes. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We face substantial competition in the sale of our production monitoring systems from a broad range of industrial and commercial businesses. Many of these competitors are well established and have greater sales volume. Among our larger competitors are Danaher Controls, Red Lion Controls, 4B Elevator Components Ltd., and Durant Corporation. We believe our competitive advantages include our products superior design and quality, the fact that our products are sold as ready-to-install units, and they can be used in a wide range of applications. Our major disadvantages include the fact that our major competitors are much larger, have a broader variety of sensing instruments, and have larger sales forces and established names. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Suppliers 

&#160; 

We purchase parts and materials for our systems from various manufacturers and distributors. In some instances, these materials are manufactured in accordance with our proprietary designs. Multiple sources of these parts and materials are generally available, and we are not dependent on any single source for these supplies and materials. We have not experienced any significant problem of short supply or delays from our suppliers. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

We are not dependent upon a single or a few customers for a material (10% or more) portion of our sales. 

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses 

&#160; 

The Company relies on a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws to establish proprietary right in its products. 

&#160; 

We have registered the name &#8220;Electro-Sensors&#8221; as a trademark with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;), Reg. No. 1,142,310. We believe this trademark has been and will continue to be useful in developing and protecting market recognition for our products. We established the HazardPRO TM trademark in the first quarter of 2014 and intend to register the trademark with the USPTO during 2016. 

&#160; 

We hold six patents relating to our production monitoring systems. The Company believes strongly in protecting its intellectual property and has a long history of obtaining patents, when available, in connection with its research and product development programs. The Company also relies upon trade secrets and proprietary know-how. 

&#160; 

The Company seeks to protect its trade secrets and proprietary intellectual property, including know-how, in part, through confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, and other parties. We cannot ensure, however, that these agreements will not be breached, that the Company would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that the Company&#8217;s trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. 

&#160; 

Business Development Activities 

&#160; 

We continue to seek growth opportunities, both internally through our existing portfolio of products, technologies and markets, as well as externally through technology partnerships or related-product acquisitions. 

&#160; 

Governmental Approvals 

&#160; 

Although, we are not required to obtain governmental approval of our products, we choose to obtain certain third party certifications to meet our customers&#8217; needs. These certifications may expand our market opportunities in certain industries. 

&#160; 

Effect of Governmental Regulations 

&#160; 

We do not believe that any existing or proposed governmental regulations will have a material effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Research and Development (in thousands) 

&#160; 

We invest in research and development programs to develop new products in related markets and to integrate state-of-the-art technology into our existing products. We incurred research and development expenses of approximately $753 and $810 during 2015 and 2014, respectively. We undertake development projects based upon the identified specific needs of the markets we serve. 

&#160; 

Our future success depends in part upon our ability to develop new products in our varying segments. Difficulties or delays in our ability to develop, produce, test and market new products could have a material adverse effect on future sales growth. 

&#160; 

Compliance with Environmental Laws 

&#160; 

Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws has only a nominal effect on current or anticipated capital expenditures and has had no material effect on earnings or on our competitive position. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of March 9, 2016, we had 36 employees, all of whom are full-time. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are members of unions.

&#160;

Our ability to maintain a competitive position and to continue to develop and market new products depends, in part, on our ability to retain key employees and qualified personnel. If we are unable to retain our key employees, or recruit and train others, our product development, marketing and sales could be negatively impacted.

&#160;

Fluctuations in Operating Results. 

&#160;

We have experienced fluctuations in our past operating results, and expect to experience fluctuations in the future, which may affect the market price of our Common Stock. Sales can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include: product competition and acceptance, timing of customer orders, cancellation of orders, the mix of products sold, downturns in the markets we serve and economic disruptions. Because fluctuations can happen, we caution investors that results of our operations for recent periods may not accurately predict how we will perform in the future. We cannot ensure that we will experience revenue or earnings growth.

&#160;

Expending Funds for Changes in Industry Standards, Customer Preferences or Technology. 

&#160;

Our business depends upon periodically introducing new and enhanced products and solutions for customer needs. Our product development requires us to commit financial resources, personnel and time, usually in advance of significant market demand for these products. In order to compete, we must anticipate both future demand and the technology available to meet that demand. We cannot ensure that our research and development efforts will lead to new products or product innovations that can be made available to or will be accepted by the market.

&#160;

&#160;
