 Item 1. Business 

Overview 

We are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing first-in-class, oral, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C, lowering therapies for the treatment of patients with elevated LDL-C. ETC-1002, or bempedoic acid, our lead product candidate, is an inhibitor of ATP Citrate Lyase, or ACL, a well-characterized enzyme on the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Bempedoic acid inhibits cholesterol synthesis in the liver, decreases intracellular cholesterol and up-regulates LDL-receptors, resulting in increased LDL-C clearance and reduced plasma levels of LDL-C. We held an End-of-Phase 2 meeting with the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, in August 2015. We initiated a global Phase 3 long-term safety and tolerability study of bempedoic acid in January 2016, in patients with hyperlipidemia whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with low- and moderate-dose statins. We own the exclusive worldwide rights to bempedoic acid. 

Statins are the current standard of care for LDL-C lowering for approximately 35 million patients in the United States. However, it is estimated that approximately 10% of these patients are intolerant of statin therapy due to muscle pain or weakness associated with their use. We believe that bempedoic acid, if approved, has the potential to become the preferred once-daily, oral therapy for patients who are unable to tolerate statin therapy. Bempedoic acid is not pharmacologically active in muscle tissue and, thus, has reduced potential for muscle-related side effects. Additionally, because symptoms of muscle pain or weakness occur in up to 20% of patients on statin therapy in clinical practice, we believe that the size of the statin intolerant market is poised to expand as effective and better tolerated non-statin therapies, such as bempedoic acid, become available. 

We were founded in January 2008, by former executives of and investors in the original Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company which was primarily focused on the research and development of therapies to regulate high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or HDL-C. After successfully completing a Phase 2a clinical study with its synthetic HDL-C therapy ETC-216, the original Esperion was acquired by Pfizer Inc. in 2004. Bempedoic acid was first discovered at the original Esperion and we subsequently acquired the rights to the product from Pfizer in 2008. 

Bempedoic Acid 

Bempedoic acid, our lead product candidate, is an inhibitor of ACL, a well-characterized enzyme on the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Bempedoic acid inhibits cholesterol synthesis in the liver, decreases intracellular cholesterol and up-regulates LDL-receptors, resulting in increased LDL-C clearance and reduced plasma levels of LDL-C. Bempedoic acid is being developed for patients with elevated LDL-C. 

Bempedoic acid is differentiated from statins because it acts at an earlier step in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Bempedoic acid is converted to the CoA form in the liver, a required biochemical step for the inhibition of ACL, an enzyme upstream of HMG-CoA reductase, whereas statins directly inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Reductions in LDL-C levels resulting from statin therapy are primarily due to reduced cholesterol synthesis and an increase in the number of LDL-receptors in the liver. It is believed that the muscle-related side effects experienced by some patients taking statins could result from inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in skeletal muscle tissue. The CoA form of bempedoic acid also achieves reduction in LDL-C levels by the inhibition of cholesterol 

synthesis and an increase in the number of LDL-receptors in the liver, but it is not formed in skeletal muscle tissue. As a result, we believe bempedoic acid has reduced potential to cause muscle-related side effects. Bempedoic acid has been shown to provide incremental lowering of LDL-C when used in combination with both ezetimibe and statins. We plan to file an Investigational New Drug Application for the fixed-dose combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe for statin intolerant patients in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Cardiovascular Disease and Elevated LDL-C 

Cardiovascular disease, which results in heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular events, represents the number one cause of death and disability in western societies. The American Heart Association, or AHA, estimates that approximately 800,000 deaths in the United States were caused by cardiovascular disease in 2013. 

Elevated LDL-C is well-accepted as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the CDC estimates that 78 million U.S. adults have elevated levels of LDL-C. A consequence of elevated LDL-C is atherosclerosis, which is a disease that is characterized by the deposition of excess cholesterol and other lipids in the walls of arteries as plaque. The development of atherosclerotic plaques often leads to cardiovascular disease. The risk relationship between elevated LDL-C and cardiovascular disease was first defined by the Framingham Heart Study, which commenced in 1948 to define the factors that contributed to the development of cardiovascular disease. The study enrolled participants who did not have any form of cardiovascular disease and followed them over a long period of time. Elevated LDL-C was identified early on as key risk factor for the eventual development of cardiovascular disease. 

The hypothesis that lowering elevated levels of LDL-C would translate into reduced risk of cardiovascular disease was first proven in 1984 with the publication of the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial. In this study, treatment with cholestyramine, a bile acid sequestrant, showed a 20% reduction in LDL-C and, importantly, a 19% reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, or heart attack. This was the first major clinical study to demonstrate a direct relationship between lowering LDL-C levels and reduced risk of major cardiovascular events. 

The first marketed statin, lovastatin, was approved for use in the United States in 1987 as a therapy to lower elevated LDL-C levels. That same year, the National Cholesterol Education Program issued its first guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with elevated LDL-C. Over the subsequent 22 years, seven more statins were approved for use to lower elevated LDL-C levels. 

In 1994 the first clinical outcomes study with a statin was published. This study demonstrated a significant reduction in risk for total mortality and major cardiovascular events. A series of additional clinical outcomes studies with statins have each shown that lowering elevated LDL-C translated into reduced risk for major cardiovascular events. The relationship between the extent of LDL-C lowering and reduction in cardiovascular risk appeared to be linear, which has supported a hypothesis that lower LDL-C is better for cardiovascular risk. This hypothesis was tested and proven in the TNT (Treating to New Targets) study where an on-treatment LDL-C level of 77 mg/dL associated with 80 mg of atorvastatin treatment translated into a statistically significant 22% reduction in risk of major cardiovascular events as compared with the 101 mg/dL on-treatment LDL-C level associated with 10 mg of atorvastatin.

Most recently, in November 2014, the results of the IMPROVE-IT (IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial) study was presented at the Scientific Sessions of the AHA. 18,144 patients with acute coronary syndrome were enrolled in IMPROVE-IT and were randomized to receive either 40 mg of simvastatin or 10 mg of ezetimibe/40 mg of simvastatin, and were followed until &#62; 5,250 events (cardiovascular death, heart attack, documented unstable angina requiring hospitalization, coronary revascularization or stroke) occurred. The addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin resulted in a 6.4% relative risk reduction (p=0.016) in the aggregate of the events described above. This was the first study to demonstrate incremental clinical benefit with a non-statin added to a statin. 

The direct relationship between lower LDL-C levels and reduced risk for major cardiovascular events has been consistently demonstrated in 18 clinical studies completed over the last 28 years involving more than 90,000 patients. As a result, physicians are highly focused on lowering LDL-C levels in their patients, and we believe there is a trend towards even more aggressive LDL-C lowering. For example, in the United States, increased attention has been placed on aggressive LDL-C management by organizations such as the National Cholesterol Education Program, or NCEP, the AHA and the American College of Cardiology, or ACC. Additionally, both the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the Joint British Societies have supported even lower LDL-C treatment targets for high-risk patients. This has led to the combination of statins with other treatments, such as Zetia. 

In July 2004, the NCEP issued an update to its Adult Treatment Panel III clinical practice guidelines on cholesterol management, advising physicians to consider new, more intensive treatment options for people at very high risk, high risk and moderately high risk for cardiovascular disease. The LDL-C goals in these updated clinical practice guidelines, which are presented below, contemplate initiating drug therapy at lower LDL-C thresholds, thus expanding the number of potential patients for LDL-C lowering therapy.

In November 2013, ACC and the AHA issued new guidelines for the treatment of elevated cholesterol. For the first time in more than 20 years, the new guidelines do not include specific, numerical LDL-C treatment goals for patients with elevated LDL-C. However, the guidelines strongly recommend the use of more potent statins and intensive statin therapy in patients with elevated LDL-C. The new guidelines also significantly expanded the number of patients eligible for statin therapy, including patients with a history of cardiovascular disease including stroke, patients with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, all patients with LDL-C &#179; 190 mg/dL and patients with a 10-year risk of &#62; 7.5% of developing cardiovascular disease. Also for the first time, the guidelines acknowledge the existence of statin intolerance, and incorporate statin intolerance into the consideration of treatment choices and into the evaluation of statin safety. 

Other organizations continue to utilize goals of treatment in their guidelines. The National Lipid Association guidelines established &#60; 100 mg/dL as the LDL-C goal of treatment for patients at low, moderate and high risk. Patients considered to be at very high risk have a goal of &#60; 70 mg/dL of LDL-C. The International Atherosclerosis Society has recommended optimal LDL-C levels of &#60; 100 mg/dL for patients who have not had a cardiovascular event, and &#60; 70 mg/dl for patients who have had a cardiovascular event.

Other Approved Therapies for Specific Populations 

A small subpopulation of patients with extremely elevated levels of LDL-C, estimated to be approximately 300 patients in the U.S., suffer from homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH. HoFH is a serious and rare genetic disease and patients with HoFH lack or have dysfunctional LDL-receptors and cannot remove LDL-particles and LDL-C from the blood. As a result, untreated HoFH patients typically have LDL-C levels in the range of 450 mg/dL to 1,000 mg/dL. Microsomal transfer protein, or MTP inhibitors, a PCSK9 inhibitor and an ApoB antisense oligonucleotide are approved therapies to lower elevated LDL-C levels in patients with a clinical or laboratory diagnosis of HoFH. Given the serious safety concerns with the MTP inhibitor and ApoB antisense oligonucleotide, specifically hepatotoxicity, the FDA has restricted their usage to this narrow subpopulation. 

Statin Therapy 

Statins are the cornerstone of lipid treatment today and are highly effective at lowering LDL-C. This class of drugs includes atorvastatin calcium, marketed as Lipitor&#174;, the most prescribed LDL-C lowering drug in the world and the best-selling pharmaceutical drug in history. Approximately 25% of Americans over the age of 45 from 2005 to 2008 were treated for elevated LDL-C levels with statin therapy, according to a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. 

Statins are selective, competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, and work primarily in liver cells. Statin inhibition of cholesterol synthesis increases the number of LDL-receptors on the surface of liver cells. This increase in LDL-receptors increases uptake of LDL-particles into liver cells from the blood, thus lowering LDL-C levels. Statins are also thought to have the potential to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in skeletal muscle. This inhibition could be linked to the myalgia associated with statin use as seen in patients with statin intolerance. 

The benefits of statin use in lowering LDL-C levels and improving cardiovascular outcomes are well documented. Despite the effectiveness of statins and their broad market acceptance, there is a significant subset of patients who are unable to tolerate statins due to muscle pain or weakness, memory loss or increased glucose levels, or who are otherwise unable to reach their LDL-C goal on statin therapy alone. In rare but extreme cases, statins can lead to muscle breakdown, kidney failure and death. In addition, the FDA has recently warned that statins can cause hyperglycemia, an increase in blood sugar levels and create an increased risk of worsening of glycemic control and of new onset diabetes. There are approximately 36 million U.S. adults with elevated LDL-C levels who are not on an LDL-C lowering therapy. For these reasons, we believe there is a need for unique therapies to treat patients with elevated LDL-C. 

Statin Intolerance&#151;Initial Market Opportunity for Bempedoic Acid 

We are initially pursuing the development of bempedoic acid as a therapy for patients with elevated LDL-C who are intolerant of statin therapy. Upon approval, we will focus our commercialization efforts on patients with elevated LDL-C who are intolerant of statins. There are currently no approved therapies for patients with elevated LDL-C who are intolerant of statin therapy in the United States. 

Muscle pain or weakness is the most common side effect experienced by statin users and the most common cause for discontinuing therapy. According to the USAGE survey, an approximately 10,000 patient academic study of current and former statin users published during 2012 in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, 12% of patients on statins discontinue therapy and 62% of these patients cited side effects as the reason for discontinuation. More than 86% of patients who discontinued therapy because of side effects cited muscle pain or weakness as the reason. Based upon these data, approximately 6% of statin users, or more than 3 million adults in the United States, ceased therapy because of muscle pain or weakness and are, therefore, statin intolerant. 

Moreover, a significant proportion of patients remain on statin therapy despite experiencing muscle-related side effects. The rate of occurrence in the clinical setting, as highlighted by the USAGE survey, is significantly higher than the up to 5% rate reported by subjects in the controlled environment of clinical studies. The USAGE survey reported that 25% of patients currently on statins have muscle-related side effects. Similarly, a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine in August 2008, estimated that up to 20% of statin-treated patients in clinical practice complained of muscle pain. Accordingly, we believe that in the presence of a safe and effective non-statin, oral, once-daily, small molecule LDL-C lowering therapy, the statin intolerant market could grow substantially. 

Patients with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) that need additional lowering of LDL-C&#151;Subsequent Market Opportunity for Bempedoic Acid 

We expect bempedoic acid may also be used by patients and physicians as an add-on to maximally tolerated statin therapy for patients with HeFH or ASCVD, that require additional lowering of LDL-C. The severity of elevated LDL-C in these patients, their level of cardiovascular disease risk and their therapeutic options all vary widely. 

Patients with ASCVD and persistently elevated LDL-C despite maximally tolerated statin therapy represent a large population with important unmet medical needs. In a retrospective analysis of United States data, approximately one-third of high-risk patients treated with statin monotherapy for more than three months failed to achieve LDL-C target levels of &#60; 100mg/dL, and more than three-quarters did not achieve the more stringent goal of &#60; 70 mg/dL. Data from the TNT study showed that patients treated with 80 mg of atorvastatin daily demonstrated a major cardiovascular event rate of 8.7% despite having achieved mean LDL-C levels of 77 mg/dL. In this study, the higher-intensity atorvastatin 80 mg regimen lowered both LDL-C and cardiovascular events to a greater extent than the lower-intensity atorvastatin 10 mg regimen. These findings, among others, suggest that residual risk may be due to residual dyslipidemia. 

This has prompted the study of non-statin therapies as add-on treatment to statins for incremental reductions in LDL-C and cardiovascular disease risk. PCSK9 inhibitors were recently granted approval in the United States as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy for patients in these populations that require additional lowering of LDL-C. 

Recently Approved Therapies 

PCSK9 Inhibitors 

A number of larger biopharmaceutical companies have developed, or are currently developing, a new class of biologic therapies that target proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9, or PCSK9, an enzyme that binds LDL-receptors. These PCSK9 inhibitors are injectable, monoclonal antibodies that were evaluated as potential therapies to lower LDL-C. In 2015 the FDA approved two PCSK9 inhibitors: alirocumab, which was developed by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and evolocumab, which was developed by Amgen, Inc. These therapies were approved as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy for patients with HeFH or ASCVD that require additional lowering of LDL-C. Additionally, evolocumab was approved as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-C lowering therapies for patients with HoFH. Also, in 2013 Pfizer Inc. announced the initiation of Phase 3 studies of bococizumab, its PCSK9 inhibitor. As described in currently approved U.S. prescribing information, PCSK9 inhibitors have demonstrated reductions of LDL-C of up to 64%. Notwithstanding the LDL-C lowering efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors, we believe their adoption by patients, physicians, and payors could be adversely impacted by their higher cost, their injectable route of administration, and their inability to positively impact CRP. 

Additional Therapies in Development 

CETP Inhibitors 

A number of larger biopharmaceutical companies have tried to develop a class of therapies that target cholesteryl ester transfer protein, or CETP, which mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL-particles to ApoB-containing particles. CETP inhibitors were initially designed to raise levels of HDL-C and are required by FDA to complete cardiovascular outcomes trials, or CVOTs, in Phase 3 prior to approval. Pfizer brought the first drug in this class, torcetrapib, into clinical development but terminated development activities in December 2006, due to an increase in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in the ILLUMINATE (Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events) study. Two other CETP inhibitors, dalcetrapib from Roche and evacetrapib from Lilly, were investigated in the dal-OUTCOMES and ACCELERATE studies, respectively. The development of dalcetrapib and evacetrapib were terminated in May 2012, and October 2015, respectively, due to insufficient efficacy in their CVOTs. An additional CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib, from Merck, is being developed and is currently being investigated in the Phase 3 REVEAL (Randomized EValuation of the Effects of Anacetrapib through Lipid-modification) study. Anacetrapib has been shown to significantly raise levels of HDL-C and to lower LDL-C. This Phase 3 CVOT is expected to complete and report top-line results in the first half of 2017. 

Clinical Experience 

To date, bempedoic acid has been studied in sixteen completed clinical studies across six patient populations: healthy volunteers; patients with elevated LDL-C levels; patients with Type 2 diabetes and elevated LDL-C levels; patients with elevated LDL-C levels and a history of statin intolerance; patients with elevated LDL-C levels taking 10 mg of atorvastatin; and patients with both elevated LDL-C and hypertension. These clinical studies consisted of seven Phase 2 clinical studies and nine Phase 1 clinical studies. The first six clinical studies compared bempedoic acid monotherapy to placebo. In ETC-1002-007, bempedoic acid was administered as an add-on to a 10 mg dose of atorvastatin. In ETC-1002-008, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of bempedoic acid, ezetimibe, and the combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe in patients with elevated LDL-C with or without statin intolerance. In ETC-1002-009, we evaluated the efficacy of bempedoic acid in patients with elevated LDL-C already on stable statin therapy. In ETC-1002-014, we explored the safety of bempedoic acid in patients with both elevated LDL-C and hypertension. The individual design and results of each of our completed clinical studies are summarized below.

Phase 2b Clinical Studies 

ETC-1002-009&#151;Phase 2b clinical study in patients with elevated LDL-C already receiving statin therapy 

On March 17, 2015, we announced top-line results for our Phase 2b ETC-1002-009 clinical study. ETC-1002-009 was a randomized, double-blind, multi-center placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical study that evaluated 180 mg and 120 mg of bempedoic acid versus placebo for 12 weeks in 134 patients already receiving stable statin therapy. The primary endpoint of this clinical study was to assess the LDL-C lowering efficacy of bempedoic acid in patients with elevated LDL-C already on stable statin therapy. Secondary endpoints included assessment of the dose response of bempedoic acid, assessment of the effect of bempedoic acid on additional lipid and cardiometabolic risk markers including hsCRP and characterization of safety, tolerability and rates of muscle-related AEs. The full results of the ETC-1002-009 study were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions on November 10, 2015. The top-line results of this clinical study are summarized as follows:

&#149; LDL-C levels after 12 weeks of treatment of bempedoic acid, the primary endpoint of the study, were reduced by an additional 24% (p&#60;0.0001) for patients dosed with bempedoic acid 180 mg and 17% (p=0.0055) for patients dosed with bempedoic acid 120 mg, beyond stable statin therapy alone, compared to an average reduction of 4% for patients who received placebo. &#149; hsCRP, a marker of inflammation in coronary disease, was reduced by an additional 30% (p=0.08) for patients dosed with bempedoic acid 180 mg and 22% (p=0.26) for patients dosed with bempedoic acid 120 mg, beyond stable statin therapy alone, after 12 weeks of therapy versus 0% reduction with placebo. &#149; Discontinuation rates for bempedoic acid were low, less than those seen with placebo, and were not muscle-related. 14 

ETC-1002-008&#151;Phase 2b clinical study in patients with elevated LDL-C with or without statin intolerance 

On October 1, 2014, we announced top-line results for our Phase 2b ETC-1002-008 clinical study. ETC-1002-008 was a 12 week Phase 2b clinical study in 349 randomized patients across 65 participating clinical recruitment sites in the United States. The primary endpoint of this clinical study was to assess the LDL-C lowering efficacy of bempedoic acid monotherapy versus ezetimibe monotherapy in patients with elevated LDL-C with or without statin intolerance. Secondary endpoints included characterization of bempedoic acid dose-response, assessment of the effect of bempedoic acid on additional lipid and cardiometabolic biomarkers, characterization of safety, tolerability, and rates of muscle-related AEs and assessment of LDL-C lowering efficacy of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe combination therapy versus ezetimibe alone. The full results of the ETC-1002-008 study were presented at the 64 th Annual Scientific Session of the ACC on Saturday March 14, 2015. The top-line results of this clinical study are summarized as follows:

&#149; LDL-C levels after 12 weeks of treatment of bempedoic acid were reduced by up to 30% for patients dosed with bempedoic acid only, compared to an average reduction of 21% for patients dosed with ezetimibe (p&#60;0.0001). &#149; LDL-C levels were lowered up to 48% in the bempedoic acid plus ezetimibe combination treatment versus 21% for ezetimibe alone (p&#60;0.0001). &#149; hsCRP, a marker of inflammation in coronary disease, was reduced by 30% (p &#163; 0.01) with bempedoic acid 120 mg; by 40% (p &#163; 0.01) with bempedoic acid 180 mg; versus a 10% reduction with ezetimibe. &#149; Discontinuation rates and muscle-related AEs with bempedoic acid were comparable to ezetimibe. 15 

&#149; In an exploratory analysis of the data, there was comparable LDL-C lowering with bempedoic acid between patients who are statin intolerant and those who are statin tolerant. &#149; Consistent with prior clinical studies with bempedoic acid, no clinically relevant changes in HDL-C or triglycerides were observed. Phase 2a Clinical Studies 

ETC-1002-014&#151;Phase 2a exploratory clinical safety study in patients with both elevated LDL-C and hypertension 

On July 28, 2015, we announced top-line results for our Phase 2a ETC-1002-014 exploratory clinical safety study. ETC-1002-014 was a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, parallel group exploratory study that evaluated 180 mg of bempedoic acid versus placebo for six weeks in 144 patients with both elevated LDL-C and hypertension. The primary endpoint of this clinical study was to assess the LDL-C lowering efficacy of bempedoic acid monotherapy versus placebo. Secondary endpoints were to characterize the safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid in patients with co-morbid hypertension; assess the effect of bempedoic acid on systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure; assess the effect of bempedoic acid on additional lipid and cardiometabolic risk markers, including hsCRP; and characterize the safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid. A total of 143 patients with elevated LDL-C and hypertension were washed out of any lipid-regulating and blood pressure therapies for up to six weeks prior to initiating therapy with bempedoic acid or placebo. 71 patients received bempedoic acid 180 mg and 72 patients received placebo. The safety and efficacy results from ETC-1002-014 are summarized as follows: 

&#149; Bempedoic acid-treated patients achieved LDL-C lowering of 21% at six weeks (24% greater than placebo, p&#60;0.0001). &#149; Levels of hsCRP were reduced by 25% with bempedoic acid (44% greater than placebo, p&#60;0.0001). &#149; Bempedoic acid was safe and well-tolerated, with neutral effects on all blood pressure measures and no muscle-related AEs or bempedoic acid-related SAEs. There was no worsening of blood pressure parameters in hypertensive patients treated with bempedoic acid. Overall Safety Observations 

To date, 727 subjects have been treated with bempedoic acid for periods of up to 12 weeks at maximum repeated doses of 240 mg per day. Bempedoic acid has been safe and well-tolerated with no dose-limiting side effects identified to date in our ongoing or completed clinical studies. No clinical safety trends have emerged to date; although very modest shifts in group mean levels of hemoglobin, uric acid, alkaline phosphatase and homocysteine were identified in some of our completed clinical 

studies, these did not go outside the normal ranges. The clinical relevance of these shifts is not readily apparent and will be monitored in our future clinical studies.

Ongoing Clinical Studies 

ETC-1002-035&#151;Phase 2 clinical study in patients treated with high-dose statin therapy 

ETC-1002-035 is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, parallel group study evaluating 60 patients on stable atorvastatin 80 mg per day. All patients in the study will receive 80 mg of atorvastatin for four weeks. Patients will then be randomized to receive either 180 mg of bempedoic acid, or placebo, for four weeks. The study will enroll patients at approximately 20 centers across the United States. The primary objectives of the study are to assess the LDL-C lowering efficacy of bempedoic acid versus placebo on a background of atorvastatin 80 mg, as well as multiple-dose plasma PK of atorvastatin 80 mg alone and in combination with bempedoic acid. Secondary objectives include assessing the effect of bempedoic acid on lipid and cardiometabolic biomarkers, including hsCRP; characterizing the tolerability and safety of bempedoic acid; and evaluating the steady-state plasma PK of bempedoic acid. We initiated ETC-1002-035 in January 2016, and expect to report top-line results in the third quarter of 2016. 

ETC-1002-037&#151;Phase 1 clinical pharmacology study to assess the safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid added-on to maximally tolerated statin therapy 

ETC-1002-037 is a Phase 1, open-label, single-sequence, drug-drug interaction study to assess the effect of steady-state bempedoic acid on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin 80 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, pravastatin 80 mg and rosuvastatin 40 mg in 48 healthy subjects. The primary objective of this study is to assess the single-dose pharmacokinetics of the four high-dose statins alone or in combination with bempedoic acid 180 mg. Secondary objectives include characterizing the safety and tolerability of bempedoic acid alone and when used with high-dose statins. We initiated ETC-1002-037 in February 2016, and expect to report top-line results in the third quarter of 2016. 

ETC-1002-040&#151;Phase 3 global long-term safety and tolerability study in patients with hyperlipidemia whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with low- and moderate-dose statins 

ETC-1002-040 is a global Phase 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating 180 mg of bempedoic acid versus placebo in 900 patients with hyperlipidemia at high cardiovascular disease risk and whose LDL-C is not adequately controlled with maximally tolerated lipid-modifying therapy. The study will enroll patients at approximately 125 sites in the U.S., Canada and the European Union. The primary objective is to assess safety and tolerability of patients treated with bempedoic acid for 52 weeks. Secondary objectives include assessing the effects of bempedoic acid on other lipid and cardiometabolic risk markers, including LDL-C and hsCRP. We initiated ETC-1002-040 in January 2016, and expect to report top-line results in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Additional Studies 

Phase 3 Clinical Studies and CVOT 

The ETC-1002-040 study marks the launch of our Phase 3 clinical program&#151;known as C holesterol L owering via E TC-1002, an A CL-inhibiting R egimen (CLEAR)&#151;which will be focused on the development of bempedoic acid for statin intolerant patients with uncontrolled LDL-C levels. We expect to provide the global clinical and regulatory development plans for the CLEAR Phase 3 program in the second quarter of 2016. Separately, we expect to announce the design of the planned CVOT for bempedoic acid in statin intolerant patients in the second quarter of 2016. 

Studies in Response to Partial Clinical Holds 

On February 2, 2015, we announced that the FDA removed the PPAR partial clinical hold on bempedoic acid, allowing us to conduct clinical studies of longer than six months in duration. In 2009 the FDA had determined that bempedoic acid was a potential PPAR agonist. 

On July 7, 2015, we announced that the FDA removed the 240 mg partial clinical hold on bempedoic acid, allowing bempedoic acid to be used at doses above 240 mg in clinical studies. In 2012 the FDA limited our ability to dose bempedoic acid above 240 mg in our clinical studies. 

Mechanism of Action 

Bempedoic acid inhibits ACL, an enzyme upstream of HMG-CoA reductase (the molecular target of statins) in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Like statins, bempedoic acid decreases cholesterol synthesis in the liver, which results in decreased intracellular cholesterol and up-regulated LDL-receptors, resulting in increased LDL-C clearance and decreased plasma levels of LDL-C. Although bempedoic acid and statins both inhibit cholesterol synthesis in liver, an important differentiating feature is that, unlike statins, bempedoic acid is inactive in skeletal muscle. Specifically, bempedoic acid is a prodrug which requires activation by a specific enzyme, acyl-CoA synthetase, or ACS, to convert bempedoic acid to ETC-1002-CoA, the active form of the drug. While this enzyme is present in the liver, it is not found in skeletal muscle. Therefore, bempedoic acid does not appear to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis in skeletal muscle and has reduced potential for muscle-related adverse effects. These differentiating properties of bempedoic acid provide a mechanistic basis for liver-specific cholesterol synthesis inhibition. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $29.9 million. 

Sales and Marketing 

Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities, nor have we entered into any partnership or co-promotion arrangements with an established pharmaceutical company. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure to launch bempedoic acid in the United States, if approved, as a treatment for patients with elevated LDL-C, we would need to invest significant financial and managerial resources. We may engage in partnering discussions with third parties from time to time. If we elect to seek approval and launch commercial sales of bempedoic acid outside of the United States or for broader patient populations in the United States, including statin intolerant patients who are unable to reach their LDL-C goal with a statin therapy, we may either do so on our own or by establishing alliances with one or more pharmaceutical company collaborators, depending on, among other things, the applicable indications, the related development costs and our available resources. 

Manufacturing and Supply 

Bempedoic acid is a small molecule drug that is synthesized from readily available raw materials using conventional chemical processes. We currently have no manufacturing facilities and limited personnel with manufacturing experience. We rely on contract manufacturers to produce both drug substances and drug products required for our clinical studies. All lots of drug substance and drug product used in clinical studies are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and, potentially, collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of bempedoic acid, if approved. 

Licenses 

In April 2008, we entered into an agreement with Pfizer pursuant to which we acquired a worldwide, exclusive, fully paid-up license from Pfizer to certain patent rights owned or controlled by Pfizer relating to bempedoic acid, and we granted Pfizer a worldwide, exclusive, fully paid-up license to certain patent rights owned or controlled by us relating to development programs other than bempedoic acid. The license to us covers the development, manufacture and commercialization of bempedoic acid. We may grant sublicenses under the license. Under the license agreement, Pfizer is restricted from making, using, developing or testing any of the compounds claimed under the same patents that claim or cover the composition of matter of bempedoic acid. Neither party is entitled to any royalties, milestones or any similar development or commercialization payments under the license agreement, and the licenses granted are irrevocable and may not be terminated for any cause, including intentional breaches or breaches caused by gross negligence. 

Intellectual Property 

We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 

Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain the proprietary position of bempedoic acid and our other development programs. 

As of December 31, 2015, our patent estate, including patents we own or license from third parties, on a worldwide basis, included approximately 23 issued United States patents and eight pending United States patent applications and 19 issued patents and 15 pending patent applications in other foreign jurisdictions. Of our worldwide patents and pending applications, only a subset relates to our small molecule program which includes our lead product candidate, bempedoic acid. Bempedoic acid is claimed in U.S. Patent No. 7,335,799 that is scheduled to expire in December 2025, which includes 711 days of patent term adjustment, and may be eligible for a patent term extension period of up to five years. U.S. Patent Nos. 9,000,041 and 8,497,301 claim methods of treatment using bempedoic acid. We also have a pending U.S. patent application directed to bempedoic acid. There are currently three issued patents and four pending applications in countries outside the United States that relate to bempedoic acid. 

A subset of this portfolio relates to our planned fixed-dose combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe and bempedoic acid and one or more statins. We have one pending U.S. patent application claiming methods of treatment using a fixed-dose combination of bempedoic acid and ezetimibe, and two pending U.S. patent applications claiming methods of treatment using fixed-dose combinations of bempedoic acid and one or more statins. 

We hold an exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up license from Pfizer to additional patents and patent applications. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent's term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest effective filing date. Our issued U.S. patents will expire on dates ranging from 2021 to 2030. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim by claim basis for each applicable product, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 

Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical products and processes like those we intend to develop and commercialize are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in such patents has emerged to date in the U.S. The patent situation outside the U.S. is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions, and enforce our intellectual property rights and more generally, could affect the value of intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. 

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own or may receive in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive 

advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 

As a result of the America Invents Act of 2011, the United States transitioned to a first-inventor-to-file system in March 2013, under which, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent. This will require us to minimize the time from invention to the filing of a patent application. 

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and unpatented know-how to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our consultants, scientific advisors and contractors and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, please see "Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to our Intellectual Property." 

Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention. 

In addition, substantial scientific and commercial research has been conducted for many years in the areas in which we have focused our development efforts, which has resulted in third parties having a number of issued patents and pending patent applications. Patent applications in the U.S. and elsewhere are published only after eighteen months from the priority date. The publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature frequently occurs substantially later than the date on which the underlying discoveries were made. Therefore, patent applications relating to drugs similar to bempedoic acid and any future drugs, discoveries or technologies we might develop may have already been filed by others without our knowledge. 

Competition 

Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions. Key competitive factors affecting the commercial success of our product candidates are likely to be efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement. 

The market for cholesterol regulating therapies is especially large and competitive. The product candidates we are currently developing, if approved, will face intense competition, either as monotherapies or as combination therapies. 

Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in obtaining FDA approval for drugs and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors' drugs may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing any of our product candidates. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. Finally, the development of new treatment methods for the diseases we are targeting could render our drugs non-competitive or obsolete. See "Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to our Business and the Clinical Development and Commercialization of Bempedoic Acid&#151;Our market is subject to intense competition. If we are unable to compete effectively, our opportunity to generate revenue from the sale of bempedoic acid, if approved, will be materially adversely affected." 

Regulatory Matters 

Government Regulation and Product Approval 

Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates, including bempedoic acid, must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before they may legally be marketed in the United States. 

United States Drug Development Process 

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA's refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

&#149; completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations; &#149; submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin; 22 

&#149; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use; &#149; submission to the FDA of an NDA for a new drug; &#149; satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP; and &#149; FDA review and approval of the NDA. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 

Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the nonclinical, also referred to as preclinical, testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance, and may be imposed on all drug products within a certain class of drugs. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example prohibiting the initiation of clinical studies of a certain duration or for a certain dose. 

All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, an institutional review board, or IRB, must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical study are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. 

Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the IND for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. 

Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 

&#149; Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients. &#149; Phase 2. Involves clinical studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 23 

&#149; Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 

Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 

U.S. Review and Approval Processes 

The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee; a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, made into permanent law pursuant to Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. 

The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also can require, or an NDA applicant may voluntarily propose, a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Elements of a REMS may include "dear doctor 

letters," a medication guide, and in some cases restrictions on distribution. These elements are negotiated as part of the NDA approval, and in some cases may delay the approval date. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA on matters of importance that come before the agency. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. 

The approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA in its present form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the NDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing. 

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific patient populations, therapeutic settings, risk categories of disease, and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require further Phase 3 and Phase 4 testing to be conducted, which involves clinical studies designed to further assess a drug's safety and effectiveness after NDA approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 

Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 

Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA, however there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us. 

Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug 

is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and well- controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical study in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a clinical study. 

Certain foreign countries permit extension of patent term for a newly approved drug and/or grant a period of data exclusivity and/or market exclusivity. For example, depending upon the timing and duration of the marketing authorization process in certain European countries, a newly approved drug may be eligible for a supplementary protection certification, or SPC, which can extend the basic patent right for the drug for a period up to five years. 

Post-Approval Requirements 

Any drugs for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers of drugs must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 

Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the drug. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards, and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract 

manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or may require substantial resources to correct. 

The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Further, the failure to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial actions, such as fines, warning letters, holds on clinical studies, product recalls or seizures, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, refusal to approve pending applications or supplements, restrictions on marketing or manufacturing, injunctions or civil or criminal penalties. 

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, the FDA regulations and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

Foreign Regulation 

In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the United States, post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the United States. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 32 full-time employees. Two of our employees have Ph.D. degrees and one has an M.D. degree. 17 of our employees are engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees is represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 

Facilities 

Our corporate headquarters are located in Ann Arbor, Michigan where we lease and occupy approximately 7,900 square feet of office space. We lease and occupy an additional 5,500 square feet of office space in Ann Arbor, Michigan to support our clinical development operations. We believe our current facilities will be sufficient to meet our needs until expiration. 

Legal Proceedings 

On January 12, 2016, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, against us and Tim Mayleben, captioned Kevin L. Dougherty v. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., et al. (No. 16-cv-10089). The lawsuit alleges that we and Mr. Mayleben violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and SEC Rule 10b-5 by allegedly failing to disclose in an August 17, 2015, public statement that the FDA would require a cardiovascular outcomes trial before approving our lead product candidate. The 

lawsuit seeks, among other things, compensatory damages in connection with an allegedly inflated stock price between August 18, 2015, and September 28, 2015, as well as attorneys' fees and costs. In light of, among other things, the early stage of the litigation, we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter and are unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss, if any, that could result from an unfavorable outcome. 

In the future, we may become party to legal matters and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, the resolution of which we do not anticipate would have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
