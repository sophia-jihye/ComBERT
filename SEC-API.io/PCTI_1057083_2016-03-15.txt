Segment Reporting 

PCTEL operates in two segments for reporting purposes, Connected Solutions and RF Solutions. Our chief operating decision maker uses the profit and loss results through operating profit and identified assets for the Connected Solutions and RF Solutions segments to make operating decisions. Each segment has its own segment manager as well as its own engineering, sales and marketing, and operational general and administrative functions. All of our accounting and finance, human resources, IT and legal functions are provided on a centralized basis through the corporate function. We manage the balance sheet and cash flows centrally at the corporate level, with the exception of trade accounts receivable and inventory which is managed at the segment level. Each of the segment managers reports to and maintains regular contact with the chief operating decision maker to discuss operating activities, financial results, forecasts, or plans for the segment. 

Connected Solutions Segment 

Connected Solutions designs and delivers performance critical antennas and site solutions for wireless networks globally. Our antennas and site solutions support networks worldwide, including SCADA for oil, gas and utilities, fleet management, industrial operations, health care, small cell and network timing deployment, defense, public safety, education, and broadband access. PCTEL&#146;s performance critical MAXRAD &#174; and Bluewave&#153; antenna solutions include high rejection and high performance GPS and GNSS products, the industry leading Yagi antenna portfolio, mobile and indoor LTE, broadband, and LMR antennas and PIM-rated antennas for transit, in-building, and small cell applications. We provide design, logistics, and support capabilities to deliver performance critical site solutions into carrier, railroad, and utility applications. Revenue growth for antenna and site solutions is primarily driven by the increased use of wireless communications in these vertical markets. PCTEL&#146;s antenna and site solution products are primarily sold through distributors, value-added resellers, and original equipment manufacturers (&#147;OEM&#148;). 

There are many competitors for antenna products, as the market is highly fragmented. Competitors include Laird (Cushcraft, Centurion, and Antennex brands), Mobile Mark, Radiall/Larsen, Comtelco, Wilson, Commscope (Andrew products), and Kathrein, among others. We seek out product applications that command a premium for product performance and customer service, and avoid commodity markets. 

&#160;

PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the antenna engineered site solutions market. These include radio frequency engineering, mobile antenna design and manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering. 

RF Solutions Segment 

RF Solutions develops and provides performance critical test equipment, software, and engineering services for wireless networks. The industry relies upon PCTEL to benchmark network performance, analyze trends, and optimize wireless networks. The Company&#146;s SeeGull &#174; flex scanning receivers are used around the world for indoor and drive test applications, including baseline testing, acceptance testing, competitive benchmarking, spectrum clearing, troubleshooting, and network optimization. The SeeGull CW Transmitter supports the design, verification, and optimization of in-building networks. SeeHawk &#174; &#160; Analytics is a network analytics tool that translates data from multiple sources into actions that optimize network performance. PCTEL provides wireless network testing, commissioning, optimization, design, integration and consulting services for both indoor and outdoor networks. 

Revenue growth for the segment&#146;s products and services is driven by the deployment of products based on new wireless technology and the need for wireless networks to be tuned and reconfigured on a regular basis. Our RF Solutions products are sold primarily through test and measurement value-added resellers and to a lesser extent directly to network operators. Competitors for these products are OEMs such as JDS Uniphase, Rohde and Schwarz, Anritsu, Digital Receiver Technology, and Berkley Varitronics. Our services are directly marketed to wireless carriers, network deployment companies, tower companies and industrial companies. 

PCTEL maintains expertise in several technology areas in order to be competitive in the scanning receiver and related engineering services market. These include radio frequency engineering, DSP engineering, manufacturing, mechanical engineering, product quality and testing, and wireless network engineering.

Backlog 

Sales of our products are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders, which are officially acknowledged according to standard terms and conditions. The backlog, while useful for scheduling production, is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues as the order to ship cycle is extremely short. 

&#160;

Research and Development 

We recognize that a strong technology base is essential to our long-term success and we have made a substantial investment in engineering and research and development. We will continue to devote substantial resources to product development and patent submissions. The patent submissions are primarily for defensive purposes, rather than for potential license revenue generation. We monitor changing customer needs and work closely with our customers, consultants and market research organizations to track changes in the marketplace, including emerging industry standards. 

Research and development expenses include costs for hardware and related software development, prototyping, certification and pre-production costs. We spent approximately $11.2 million, $11.7 million, and $11.1 million in the fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, in research and development.

Sales, Marketing and Support 

We supply our products to public and private carriers, wireless infrastructure providers, wireless equipment distributors, value added resellers (&#147;VARs&#148;) and OEMs. PCTEL&#146;s direct sales force is technologically sophisticated and sales executives have strong industry domain knowledge. Our direct sales force supports the sales efforts of our distributors and OEM resellers. 

Our marketing strategy is focused on building market awareness and acceptance of our new products. The marketing organization also provides a wide range of programs, materials and events to support the sales organization. We spent approximately $14.2 million, $13.0 million, and $12.1 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, for sales and marketing support.

Manufacturing 

We do final assembly of most of our antenna products and all of our OEM receiver and interference management product lines. We also have arrangements with several contract manufacturers but are not dependent on any one. If any of our contract manufacturers are unable to provide satisfactory services for us, other contract manufacturers are available, although engaging a new contract manufacturer could cause unwanted delays and additional costs. We have no material guaranteed supply contracts or long-term agreements with any of our suppliers. We do have open purchase orders with our suppliers. See the contractual obligations and commercial commitments section of Item 7 for information on purchase commitments. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 491 full-time equivalent employees, consisting of 329 in operations, 61 in sales and marketing, 61 in research and development, and 40 in general and administrative functions. Total full-time equivalent employees were 465 and 449 at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Headcount increased by 26 at December 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014 primarily due to the employees from our acquisition of the business of Nexgen Wireless, Inc. See additional information related to the acquisition of the business from Nexgen in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider employee relations to be good.
