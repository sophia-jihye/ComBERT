 Item 1. Business

Business Overview

UTG, Inc. (the "Registrant", "Company" or "UTG") is an insurance holding company incorporated in the state of Delaware in 2005. Its primary direct subsidiary is Universal Guaranty Life Insurance Company ("UG"). The Registrant and its primary subsidiary have only one significant segment, insurance. The Company's dominant business is individual life insurance, which includes the servicing of existing insurance business in-force, the acquisition of other companies in the insurance business, and the administration processing of life insurance business for other entities.

The holding company has no significant business operations of its own and relies on fees, dividends and other distributions from its operating subsidiary as the principal source of cash flows to meet its obligations. Additional information regarding the cash flow and liquidity needs of the holding company can be found in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.

UG has several wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. The subsidiaries were formed to hold certain real estate and other investments. The investments were placed into the limited liability companies and partnerships to provide additional protection to the policyholders and to UG.

Increased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data. Although the Company makes efforts to maintain the security and integrity of the networks and systems, there can be no assurance that the security efforts will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging. In the event a security breach or failure results in the disclosure of sensitive third party data or the transmission of harmful/malicious code to third parties, the Company could be subject to liability claims. The Company does not currently carry insurance coverage against such liabilities. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats also could potentially lead to improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, loss of trade secrets, system downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn, could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.

This document at times will refer to the Registrant's largest shareholder, Mr. Jesse T. Correll and certain companies controlled by Mr. Correll. Mr. Correll holds a majority ownership of First Southern Funding LLC, a Kentucky corporation, ("FSF") and First Southern Bancorp, Inc. ("FSBI"), a financial services holding company. FSBI operates through its 100% owned subsidiary bank, First Southern National Bank ("FSNB"). Banking activities are conducted through multiple locations within south-central and western Kentucky. Mr. Correll is Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of UTG and is currently UTG's largest shareholder through his ownership control of FSF, FSBI and affiliates. At December 31, 2015 , Mr. Correll owns or controls directly and indirectly approximately 57.61 % of UTG's outstanding stock.

Insurance

UG's product portfolio consists of a limited number of life insurance product offerings. All of the products are individual life insurance products, with design variations from each other to provide choices to the customer. These variations generally center around the length of the premium paying period, length of the coverage period and whether the product accumulates cash value or not.

While the Company does not actively sell any new policies today, it has the following products available for issue:

Ten Pay Whole Life &#8211; This traditional insurance product has a level face amount and level premium is payable for the first ten policy years. This product is available for issue ages 0-65, and has a minimum face amount of $10,000. This policy can be used in conversion situations, where it is available up to age 75 at a minimum face amount of $5,000.

Tradition &#8211; The Tradition policy is a fixed premium whole life insurance policy. Premiums are level and payable for life. Issue ages are 0-75. The minimum face amount is the greater of $10,000 or the amount of coverage provided by a $100 annual premium.

Kid Kare &#8211; The Kid Kare product is a single premium level term policy to age 21. The product is sold in units, with one unit equal to a face amount of $5,000 for a single premium of $250. The policy is issued from ages 0-15 and has conversion privileges at age 21.

Reinsurance

As is customary in the insurance industry, the insurance subsidiary cedes insurance to, and assumes insurance from, other insurance companies under reinsurance agreements. Reinsurance agreements are intended to limit a life insurer's maximum loss on a large or unusually hazardous risk or to obtain a greater diversification of risk. The ceding insurance company remains primarily liable with respect to ceded insurance should any reinsurer be unable to meet the obligations assumed by it. However, it is the practice of insurers to reduce their exposure to loss to the extent that they have been reinsured with other insurance companies. The Company sets a limit on the amount of insurance retained on the life of any one person. The Company will not retain more than $125,000, including accidental death benefits, on any one life.

The Company's reinsured business is ceded to numerous reinsurers. The Company monitors the solvency of its reinsurers in seeking to minimize the risk of loss in the event of a failure by one of the parties. The Company is primarily liable to the insureds even if the reinsurers are unable to meet their obligations. The primary reinsurers of the Company are large, well-capitalized entities. See Note 4 &#8211; Reinsurance in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's reinsurance activities. 

Underwriting

The underwriting procedures of the insurance subsidiary are established by Management. Insurance policies are issued by the Company based upon underwriting practices established for each market in which the Company operates. Most policies are individually underwritten. Applications for insurance are reviewed to determine additional information required to make an underwriting decision, which depends on the amount of insurance applied for and the applicant's age and medical history. Additional information may include inspection reports, medical examinations, and statements from doctors who have treated the applicant in the past and, where indicated, special medical tests. After reviewing the information collected, the Company either issues the policy as applied for, issues with an extra premium charge because of unfavorable factors, or rejects the application. Substandard risks may be referred to reinsurers for full or partial reinsurance of the substandard risk.

Reserves

The applicable insurance laws under which the insurance subsidiary operates require that the insurance company report policy reserves as liabilities to meet future obligations on the policies in-force. These reserves are the amounts which, with the additional premiums to be received and interest thereon compounded annually at certain assumed rates, are calculated in accordance with applicable laws to be sufficient to meet the various policy and contract obligations as they mature. These laws specify that the reserves shall not be less than reserves calculated using certain mortality tables and interest rates.

The liabilities for traditional life insurance and accident and health insurance policy benefits are computed using a net level method. These liabilities include assumptions as to investment yields, mortality, withdrawals, and other assumptions based on the life insurance subsidiary's experience adjusted to reflect anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible unfavorable deviations. The Company makes these assumptions at the time the contract is issued or, in the case of contracts acquired by purchase, at the purchase date. Future policy benefits for individual life insurance and annuity policies are computed using interest rates ranging from 2% to 6% for life insurance and 2.5% to 7.5% for annuities. Benefit reserves for traditional life insurance policies include certain deferred profits on limited-payment policies that are being recognized in income over the policy term. Policy benefit claims are charged to expense in the period that the claims are incurred. The mortality rate assumptions for policies currently issued by the Company are based on 2001 select and ultimate tables. Withdrawal rate assumptions are based upon Linton B or Linton C, which are industry standard actuarial tables for forecasting assumed policy lapse rates.

Benefit reserves for universal life insurance and interest sensitive life insurance products are computed under a retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges. Policy benefits and claims that are charged to expense include benefit claims in excess of related policy account balances.

&#160;

Investments

Investments are subject to applicable state insurance laws and regulations, which limit the concentration of investments in any one category or class and further limit the investment in any one issuer. Generally, these limitations are imposed as a percentage of statutory assets or percentage of statutory capital and surplus of each company.

The Company, from time to time, acquires mortgage loans through participation agreements with FSNB. FSNB has been able to provide the Company with additional expertise and experience in underwriting commercial and residential mortgage loans, which provide more attractive yields than the traditional bond market. The Company is able to receive participations from FSNB for three primary reasons: 1) FSNB has already reached its maximum lending limit to a single borrower, but the borrower is still considered a suitable risk; 2) the interest rate on a particular loan may be fixed for a long period that is more suitable for UG given its asset-liability structure; and 3) FSNB's loan growth might at times outpace its deposit growth, resulting in FSNB participating such excess loan growth rather than turning customers away. For originated loans, the Company's Management is responsible for the final approval of such loans after evaluation. Before a new loan is issued, the applicant is subject to certain criteria set forth by Company Management to ensure quality control. These criteria include, but are not limited to, a credit report, personal financial information such as outstanding debt, sources of income, and personal equity. Once the loan is approved, the Company directly funds the loan to the borrower. The Company bears all risk of loss associated with the terms of the mortgage with the borrower.

The Company began purchasing discounted commercial mortgage loans in 2009. Management has extensive background and experience in the analysis and valuation of commercial real estate. The discounted loans are available through the FDIC's sale of assets of closed banks and from banks wanting to reduce their loan portfolios. The loans are available on a loan by loan bid process. Once a loan has been acquired, contact is made with the appropriate individuals to begin a dialog with a goal of determining the borrower's willingness to work together. There are generally three paths a discounted loan will take: the borrowers pay as required; a settlement is reached with the loan being paid off at a discounted value; or the loan is foreclosed.

During 2015 and 2014 , the Company acquired approximately $ 10.4 million and $ 2.3 million in mortgage loans, respectively, including both regular participation mortgage loans as well as discounted mortgage loans. FSNB services a majority of the mortgage loan portfolio of the Company. The Company pays FSNB a .25% servicing fee on these loans and a one-time fee at loan origination of .50% of the original loan cost to cover costs incurred by FSNB relating to the processing and establishment of the loan. 

Most mortgage loans are first position loans. Loans issued are generally limited to no more than 80% of the appraised value of the property.

The Company has in place a monitoring system to provide Management with information regarding potential troubled loans. Letters are sent to each mortgagee when the loan becomes 30 days or more delinquent. Management is provided with a monthly listing of loans that are 60 days or more past due along with a brief description of what steps are being taken to resolve the delinquency. All loans 90 days or more past due are placed on a non-performing status and classified as delinquent loans. Quarterly, coinciding with external financial reporting, the Company reviews each delinquent loan and determines how each delinquent loan should be classified. Management believes the current internal controls surrounding the mortgage loan selection process provide a quality portfolio with minimal risk of negative financial impact.

Management has conservatively decided to place the loans in the discounted mortgage loan portfolio on a non-accrual status, due to the instability of the borrowers.

On the remainder of the mortgage loan portfolio, interest accruals are analyzed based on the likelihood of repayment. In no event will interest continue to accrue when accrued interest along with the outstanding principal exceeds the net realizable value of the property. The Company does not utilize a specified number of days delinquent to cause an automatic non-accrual status.

A mortgage loan reserve is established and adjusted based on Management's quarterly analysis of the portfolio and any deterioration in value of the underlying property which would reduce the net realizable value of the property below its current carrying value. The Company acquired the discounted mortgage loans at below contract value, and believes that it will fully recover its carrying value upon disposal, therefore no reserve for delinquent loans is deemed necessary. The loan portfolio since purchase is performing very well with a majority of the loans currently paying. Those not currently paying are being vigorously worked by Management. The current discounted commercial mortgage loan portfolio has an average price of 39 % of face value and Management has determined that this deep discount provides a financial cushion or built in allowance for any of the loans that are not currently performing within the portfolio of loans purchased. The mortgage loan reserve was $ 0 at December 31, 2015 and 2014 .

Competition

The insurance business is a highly competitive industry and there are a number of other companies, both stock and mutual, doing business in areas where the Company operates. Many of these competing insurers are larger, have more diversified and established lines of insurance coverage, have substantially greater financial resources and brand recognition, as well as a greater number of agents. Other significant competitive factors in the insurance industry include policyholder benefits, service to policyholders, and premium rates.

In recent years, the Company has not placed an emphasis on new business production. Costs associated with supporting new business can be significant. Current sales primarily represent sales to existing customers through additional insurance needs or conservation efforts. The Company currently encourages policy retention as opposed to new sales in an attempt to maintain or improve current persistency levels.

The Company performs administrative work as a third party administrator (TPA) for unaffiliated life insurance companies. The Company intends to continue to pursue other TPA arrangements. The Company provides TPA services to insurance companies seeking business process outsourcing solutions. Management believes the Company is positioned to generate additional revenues by utilizing the Company's current excess capacity and administrative services.

Regulation

Holding Company - States have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system. Insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries, and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions.

Insurance - Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business. Generally the state supervisory agencies have broad administrative powers relating to granting and revoking licenses to transact business, licensing agents, approving policy forms, regulating trade practices, approving certain premium rates, setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, determining the form and content of required financial statements, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. Insurance companies are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies, and records of their business are subject to examination at any time. Under the rules of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"), insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies.

Risk-Based Capital - The NAIC requires a risk-based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers. The risk-based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula. It is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized. UTG's insurance subsidiary, UG, is more than adequately capitalized under the risk-based capital formula.

Guaranty Assessments &#8211; State guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund which is used, in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company, to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders. The amount which a company is assessed is determined according to the extent of these unsatisfied obligations in each state. Assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes.

Personnel

At December 31, 2015 , UTG and its subsidiaries had 42 full-time employees. UTG's operations are headquartered in Springfield, Illinois.
