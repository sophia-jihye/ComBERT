BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Business Overview 

&#160; 

We design, construct, market, and sell single-family detached homes, attached townhomes and condominiums, urban infill, and active lifestyle homes in planned residential developments and are one of the nation&#8217;s largest builders of residential homes. Founded in 1959 by Kevork Hovnanian, Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc. (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) was incorporated in New Jersey in 1967 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1983. Since the incorporation of our predecessor company and including unconsolidated joint ventures, we have delivered in excess of 324,000 homes, including 6,712 homes in fiscal 2016. The Company has two distinct operations: homebuilding and financial services. Our homebuilding operations consist of six segments: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West. Our financial services operations provide mortgage loans and title services to the customers of our homebuilding operations. 

&#160; 

We are currently, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures, offering homes for sale in 167 communities in 33 markets in 14 states throughout the United States. We market and build homes for first-time buyers, first-time and second-time move-up buyers, luxury buyers, active lifestyle buyers and empty nesters. We offer a variety of home styles at base prices ranging from $93,000 to $1,676,000 with an average sales price, including options, of $402,000 nationwide in fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

Our operations span all significant aspects of the home-buying process &#8211; from design, construction, and sale, to mortgage origination and title services. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Business Strategies 

&#160; 

Given the low levels of total U.S. housing starts, and our belief in the long-term recovery of the homebuilding market, we remain focused on identifying new land parcels, which are critical to improving our financial performance. During fiscal 2016, we had approximately $260 million of bonds mature, which we were unable to refinance because financing was unavailable in the capital and loan markets to companies with comparable credit ratings to ours. As a result, we shifted our focus from growth to gaining operating efficiencies and improving our bottom line, and we decided to temporarily reduce some of our future land acquisition and to exit from four underperforming markets during fiscal 2016. In addition, we increased our use of land bank financings and joint ventures in order to enhance our liquidity position. The net effect of these liquidity enhancing efforts was to temporarily adversely affect our ability to invest as aggressively in new land parcels as previously planned, which resulted in a reduction in our community count in fiscal 2016, along with a decrease in net contracts. However, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we were able to refinance certain of our upcoming debt maturities as discussed in Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and we ended the fiscal year with homebuilding cash of $339.8 million at October 31, 2016. This cash position will allow us to actively seek land investment opportunities in fiscal 2017, which should ultimately result in community count growth. 

&#160; 

In addition to our current focus on maintaining adequate liquidity and evaluating new investment opportunities, we intend to continue to focus on our historic key business strategies, as enumerated below. We believe that these strategies separate us from our competitors in the residential homebuilding industry and the adoption, implementation and adherence to these principles will continue to benefit our business. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Our goal is to become a significant builder in each of the selected markets in which we operate, which will enable us to achieve powers and economies of scale and differentiate ourselves from most of our competitors. 

&#160; 

We offer a broad product array to provide housing to a wide range of customers. Our customers consist of first-time buyers, first-time and second-time move-up buyers, luxury buyers, active lifestyle buyers and empty nesters. Our diverse product array includes single-family detached homes, attached townhomes and condominiums, urban infill and active lifestyle homes. 

&#160; 

We are committed to customer satisfaction and quality in the homes that we build. We recognize that our future success rests in the ability to deliver quality homes to satisfied customers. We seek to expand our commitment to customer service through a variety of quality initiatives. In addition, our focus remains on attracting and developing quality associates. We use several leadership development and mentoring programs to identify key individuals and prepare them for positions of greater responsibility within our Company. 

&#160; 

We focus on achieving high return on invested capital. Each new community is evaluated based on its ability to meet or exceed internal rate of return requirements. Our belief is that the best way to create lasting value for our shareholders is through a strong focus on return on invested capital. 

&#160; 

We prefer to use a risk-averse land strategy. We attempt to acquire land with a minimum cash investment and negotiate takedown options, thereby limiting the financial exposure to the amounts invested in property and predevelopment costs. This approach significantly reduces our risk and generally allows us to obtain necessary development approvals before acquisition of the land. 

&#160; 

We enter into homebuilding and land development joint ventures from time to time as a means of controlling lot positions, expanding our market opportunities, establishing strategic alliances, reducing our risk profile, leveraging our capital base and enhancing our returns on capital. Our homebuilding joint ventures are generally entered into with third-party investors to develop land and construct homes that are sold directly to home buyers. Our land development joint ventures include those with developers and other homebuilders, as well as financial investors to develop finished lots for sale to the joint venture&#8217;s members or other third parties. 

&#160; 

We manage our financial services operations to better serve all of our home buyers. Our current mortgage financing and title service operations enhance our contact with customers and allow us to coordinate the home-buying experience from beginning to end. 

&#160; 

Operating Policies and Procedures 

&#160; 

We attempt to reduce the effect of certain risks inherent in the housing industry through the following policies and procedures: 

&#160; 

Training - Our training is designed to provide our associates with the knowledge, attitudes, skills and habits necessary to succeed in their jobs. Our training department regularly conducts online or webinar training in sales, construction, administration and managerial skills. 

&#160; 

Land Acquisition, Planning, and Development - Before entering into a contract to acquire land, we complete extensive comparative studies and analyses which assist us in evaluating the economic feasibility of such land acquisition. We generally follow a policy of acquiring options to purchase land for future community developments. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Where possible, we acquire land for future development through the use of land options, which need not be exercised before the completion of the regulatory approval process. We attempt to structure these options with flexible takedown schedules rather than with an obligation to take down the entire parcel upon receiving regulatory approval. If we are unable to negotiate flexible takedown schedules, we will buy parcels in a single bulk purchase. Additionally, we purchase improved lots in certain markets by acquiring a small number of improved lots with an option on additional lots. This allows us to minimize the economic costs and risks of carrying a large land inventory, while maintaining our ability to commence new developments during favorable market periods. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Our option and purchase agreements are typically subject to numerous conditions, including, but not limited to, our ability to obtain necessary governmental approvals for the proposed community. Generally, the deposit on the agreement will be returned to us if all approvals are not obtained, although predevelopment costs may not be recoverable. By paying an additional nonrefundable deposit, we have the right to extend a significant number of our options for varying periods of time. In most instances, we have the right to cancel any of our land option agreements by forfeiture of our deposit on the agreement. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, rather than purchase additional lots in underperforming communities, we took advantage of this right and walked away from 6,102 lots, 4,730 lots and 5,148 lots, respectively, out of 19,210 lots, 20,653 total lots and 22,119 total lots, respectively, under option, resulting in pretax charges of $8.9 million, $4.7 million and $4.0 million, respectively. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Design - Our residential communities are generally located in urban and suburban areas easily accessible through public and personal transportation. Our communities are designed as neighborhoods that fit existing land characteristics. We strive to create diversity within the overall planned community by offering a mix of homes with differing architecture, textures and colors. Recreational amenities, such as swimming pools, tennis courts, clubhouses, open areas and tot lots, are frequently included. 

&#160; 

Construction - We design and supervise the development and building of our communities. Our homes are constructed according to standardized prototypes, which are designed and engineered to provide innovative product design while attempting to minimize costs of construction. We generally employ subcontractors for the installation of site improvements and construction of homes. Agreements with subcontractors are generally short term and provide for a fixed price for labor and materials. We rigorously control costs through the use of computerized monitoring systems. 

&#160; 

Because of the risks involved in speculative building, our general policy is to construct an attached condominium or townhouse building only after signing contracts for the sale of at least 50% of the homes in that building. A majority of our single-family detached homes are constructed after the signing of a sales contract and mortgage approval has been obtained. This limits the buildup of inventory of unsold homes and the costs of maintaining and carrying that inventory. 

&#160; 

Materials and Subcontractors - We attempt to maintain efficient operations by utilizing standardized materials available from a variety of sources. In addition, we generally contract with subcontractors to construct our homes. We have reduced construction and administrative costs by consolidating the number of vendors serving certain markets and by executing national purchasing contracts with select vendors. In recent years, we have experienced some construction delays due to shortage of labor in certain markets like Houston and Dallas; and we cannot predict the extent to which shortages in necessary materials or labor may occur in the future. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Sales - Our residential communities are sold principally through on-site sales offices. In order to respond to our customers&#8217; needs and trends in housing design, we rely upon our internal market research group to analyze information gathered from, among other sources, buyer profiles, exit interviews at model sites, focus groups and demographic databases. We make use of our website, internet, newspaper, radio, television, magazine, billboard, video and direct mail advertising, special and promotional events, illustrated brochures and full-sized and scale model homes in our comprehensive marketing program. In addition, we have home design galleries in our Florida, New Jersey and Virginia markets, which offer a wide range of customer options to satisfy individual customer tastes. 

&#160; 

Customer Service and Quality Control - In many of our markets, associates are responsible for customer service and preclosing quality control inspections as well as responding to postclosing customer needs. Prior to closing, each home is inspected and any necessary completion work is undertaken by us or our subcontractors. Our homes are enrolled in a standard limited warranty program which, in general, provides a homebuyer with a limited warranty for the home&#8217;s materials and workmanship which follows each State&#8217;s applicable statute of repose. All of the warranties contain standard exceptions, including, but not limited to, damage caused by the customer. 

&#160; 

Customer Financing - We sell our homes to customers who generally finance their purchases through mortgages. Our financial services segment provides our customers with competitive financing and coordinates and expedites the loan origination transaction through the steps of loan application, loan approval, and closing and title services. We originate loans in each of the states in which we build homes, except Ohio. We believe that our ability to offer financing to customers on competitive terms as a part of the sales process is an important factor in completing sales. 

&#160; 

During the year ended October 31, 2016, for the markets in which our mortgage subsidiaries originated loans, 10.7% of our home buyers paid in cash and 76.5% of our noncash home buyers obtained mortgages from our mortgage banking subsidiary. The loans we originated in fiscal 2016 were 74.4% prime, 25.5% Federal Housing Administration/Veterans Affairs (&#8220;FHA/VA&#8221;) and 0.1% United States Department of Agriculture. 

&#160; 

We customarily sell virtually all of the loans and loan-servicing rights that we originate within a short period of time. Loans are sold either individually or against forward commitments to institutional investors, including banks, mortgage banking firms, and savings and loan associations. 

&#160; 

Residential Development Activities 

&#160; 

Our residential development activities include site planning and engineering, obtaining environmental and other regulatory approvals and constructing roads, sewer, water, and drainage facilities, recreational facilities, and other amenities and marketing and selling homes. These activities are performed by our associates, together with independent architects, consultants and contractors. Our associates also carry out long-term planning of communities. A residential development generally includes single-family detached homes and/or a number of residential buildings containing from 2 to 24 individual homes per building, together with amenities, such as club houses, swimming pools, tennis courts, tot lots and open areas. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Current base prices for our homes in contract backlog at October 31, 2016, range from $93,000 to $868,000 in the Northeast, from $233,000 to $1,475,000 in the Mid-Atlantic, from $121,000 to $818,000 in the Midwest, from $124,000 to $1,000,000 in the Southeast, from $152,000 to $1,114,000 in the Southwest and from $190,000 to $1,676,000 in the West. Closings generally occur and are typically reflected in revenues within six to nine months of when sales contracts are signed.

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

At October 31, 2016 and 2015, including unconsolidated joint ventures, we had a backlog of signed contracts for 2,649 homes and 3,112 homes, respectively, with sales values aggregating $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The majority of our backlog at October 31, 2016 is expected to be completed and closed within the next six to nine months. At November 30, 2016 and 2015, our backlog of signed contracts, including unconsolidated joint ventures, was 2,644 homes and 3,317 homes, respectively, with sales values aggregating $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. For information on our backlog excluding unconsolidated joint ventures, see the table on page 44 under Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#8211; Results of Operations -Homebuilding.&#8221; 

&#160; 

Sales of our homes typically are made pursuant to a standard sales contract that provides the customer with a statutorily mandated right of rescission for a period ranging up to 15 days after execution. This contract requires a nominal customer deposit at the time of signing. In addition, in the Northeast, and some sections of the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest, we typically obtain an additional 5% to 10% down payment due within 30 to 60 days after signing. In most markets, an additional deposit is required when a customer selects and commits to optional upgrades in the home. The contract may include a financing contingency, which permits customers to cancel their obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates (including financing arranged or provided by us) is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract. This contingency period typically is four to eight weeks following the date of execution of the contract. When housing values decline in certain markets, some customers cancel their contracts and forfeit their deposits. Cancellation rates are discussed further in Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.&#8221; Sales contracts are included in backlog once the sales contract is signed by the customer, which in some cases includes contracts that are in the rescission or cancellation periods. However, revenues from sales of homes are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, when title to the home is conveyed to the buyer, adequate initial and continuing investments have been received, and there is no continued involvement.

Residential Land Inventory in Planning 

&#160; 

It is our objective to control a supply of land, primarily through options, whenever possible, consistent with anticipated homebuilding requirements in each of our housing markets. Controlled land (land owned and under option) as of October 31, 2016, exclusive of communities under development described above under &#8220;Active Selling Communities&#8221; and excluding unconsolidated joint ventures, is summarized in the following table. The proposed developable home sites in communities in planning are included in the 26,797 consolidated total home sites under the total residential real estate table in Item 7 &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; on page 37.

The book value of properties under option also includes costs incurred on properties not under option but which are under evaluation. For properties under option, as of October 31, 2016, option fees and deposits aggregated $18.5 million. As of October 31, 2016, we spent an additional $8.9 million in nonrefundable predevelopment costs on such properties. 

&#160; 

We either option or acquire improved or unimproved home sites from land developers or other sellers. Under a typical agreement with the land developer, we purchase a minimal number of home sites. The balance of the home sites to be purchased is covered under an option agreement or a nonrecourse purchase agreement. During the declining homebuilding market, we decided to mothball (or stop development on) certain communities where we determined that current market conditions did not justify further investment at that time. When we decide to mothball a community, the inventory is reclassified on our Consolidated Balance Sheet from Sold and unsold homes and lots under development to Land and land options held for future development or sale. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on mothballed communities. For additional financial information regarding our homebuilding segments, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

The homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced raw material and labor shortages. In particular, shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of or increase the cost of developing one or more of our residential communities. We attempt to maintain efficient operations by utilizing standardized materials available from a variety of sources. In recent years, we have experienced some construction delays due to shortage of labor in certain markets like Houston and Dallas; and we cannot predict the extent to which shortages in necessary materials or labor may occur in the future. In addition, we generally contract with subcontractors to construct our homes. We have reduced construction and administrative costs by consolidating the number of vendors serving certain markets and by executing national purchasing contracts with select vendors. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our business is seasonal in nature and, historically, weather-related problems, typically in the fall, late winter and early spring, can delay starts or closings and increase costs. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

Our homebuilding operations are highly competitive. We are among the top 10 homebuilders in the United States in both homebuilding revenues and home deliveries. We compete with numerous real estate developers in each of the geographic areas in which we operate. Our competition ranges from small local builders to larger regional builders to publicly owned builders and developers, some of which have greater sales and financial resources than we do. Previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition. We compete primarily on the basis of reputation, price, location, design, quality, service and amenities. 

&#160; 

Regulation and Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

We are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulations that affect the development of land and home building, sales and customer financing processes concerning zoning, building design, construction, and similar matters, including local regulations which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular locality. In addition, we are subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction, advertisement and sale of our communities in certain states and localities in which we operate even if all necessary government approvals have been obtained. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate. Generally, such moratoriums relate to insufficient water or sewerage facilities or inadequate road capacity. 

&#160; 

In addition, some state and local governments in markets where we operate have approved, and others may approve, slow-growth, or no-growth initiatives that could negatively affect the availability of land and building opportunities within those areas. Approval of these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to build and sell homes in the affected markets and/or could require the satisfaction of additional administrative and regulatory requirements, which could result in slowing the progress or increasing the costs of our homebuilding operations in these markets. Any such delays or costs could have a negative effect on our future revenues and earnings. 

&#160; 

We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment, including those regulating the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, the management of stormwater runoff at construction sites, the handling, use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, impacts to wetlands and other sensitive environments, and the remediation of contamination at properties that we have owned or developed or currently own or are developing (&#8220;environmental laws&#8221;). The particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site, the site&#8217;s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site. See Risk Factors &#8211; &#8220; Homebuilders are subject to a number of federal, local, state, and foreign laws and regulations concerning the development of land, the homebuilding, sales, and customer financing processes and the protection of the environment, which can cause us to incur delays and costs associated with compliance and which can prohibit or restrict our activity in some regions or areas&#8221;, Item 3 &#8220;Legal Proceedings&#8221; and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

Despite our past ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our communities, we anticipate that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future. Although we cannot reliably predict the extent of any effect these requirements may have on us, they could result in time-consuming and expensive compliance programs and in substantial expenditures, which could cause delays and increase our cost of operations. In addition, our ability to obtain or renew permits or approvals and the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors, some of which are beyond our control, such as changes in policies, rules and regulations and their interpretation and application.
