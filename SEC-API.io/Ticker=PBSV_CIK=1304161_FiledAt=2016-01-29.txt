OVERVIEW 

&#160;

We are a compliance and technology transfer services consulting firm with a laboratory testing facility with headquarters in Puerto Rico, servicing the Puerto Rico, United States, Europe and Brazil markets. The compliance consulting service sector in those markets consists of local compliance and validation consulting firms, United States dedicated validation and compliance consulting firms, large publicly traded and private domestic and foreign engineering and consulting firms. We provide a broad range of compliance related consulting services. We also provide microbiological testing services and chemical testing services through our laboratory testing facility (&#8220;Lab&#8221;) in Puerto Rico. In addition, we provide technical training/seminars, which services are not currently significant to our operating results. We market our services to pharmaceutical, chemical, biotechnology, medical devices, cosmetic and food industries, and allied products companies in Puerto Rico, the United States, Europe and Brazil. Our consulting team includes experienced engineering and life science professionals, former quality assurance managers and directors, and professionals with bachelors, masters and doctorate degrees in health sciences and engineering. 

&#160;

We have a well-established and consistent relationships with the major pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and chemical manufacturing companies in Puerto Rico and the United States, which provides us access to affiliated companies in other markets. We seek opportunities in markets that can yield profitable margins using our professional consulting force and also provide services such as those performed by our microbiological testing laboratory facility and our technical training division, Pharma Serv Academy. 

&#160;

Our Pharma Serv Academy division, through a network of leading industry professional experts in their field, which include resources of our own, provides technical seminars/training that incorporate the latest regulatory trends and standards as well as other related areas. Although these services are not currently significant to our operating results, our goal is to broaden the portfolio of services that we can provide to our customer base and also target other potential customers in other industries. 

&#160;

We believe the most significant factors to achieving future business growth include our ability to: (i) continue to provide quality value-added compliance services to our clients; (ii) recruit and retain highly educated and experienced consultants; (iii) further expand our products and services to address the expanding needs of our clients; and (iv) expand our market presence in the United States, Europe, Brazil and other emerging pharmaceutical markets in order to respond to the international compliance needs of our clients and potential clients. Our business is affected to the extent the current economic downturn affects the decision of our clients and potential clients to establish operations or to continue or expand their existing operations. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our revenue is derived from (i) time and materials contracts (representing approximately 90% of total revenue), where the clients are charged for the time, materials and expenses incurred on a particular project or service, (ii) fixed-fee contracts or from &#8220;not to exceed&#8221; contracts (approximately 1% of total revenue), which are generally short-term contracts, in which the value of the contract cannot exceed a stated amount, and (iii) laboratory testing (representing approximately 9% of total revenue) which generally is completed and certified within days of sample receipt. For time and materials contracts, our revenue is principally a function of the number of consultants and the number of hours billed per consultant. To the extent that our revenue is based on fixed-fee or &#8220;not to exceed&#8221; contracts, our ability to operate profitably is dependent upon our ability to estimate accurately the costs that we will incur on a project and to manage and monitor the project. If we underestimate our costs on any contract, we could sustain a loss on the contract or its profitability might be reduced. 

&#160;

The principal components for our consulting costs of services are resource compensation to our consulting team and expenses relating to the performance of the services. In order to ensure that our pricing is competitive yet minimize the impact on our margins, we manage increasing labor costs by (i) selecting consultants according to our cost for specific projects, (ii) negotiating, where applicable, rates with the consultant, (iii) subcontracting labor and (iv) negotiating and passing rate increases to our customers, as applicable. Although this strategy has been successful in the past, we cannot give any assurance that such strategy will continue to be successful. As for our laboratory testing operation, the major costs of services components are salaries and wages, occupancy and depreciation expenses, and consumable goods usage. 

&#160;

We have established quality systems for our employees which include: 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Training Programs - including a current Good Manufacturing Practices exam prior to recruitment and periodic refreshers; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Recruitment Full Training Program - including employee manual, dress code, time sheets and good project management and control procedures, job descriptions, and firm operating and administration procedures; 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Safety Program - including Occupational Safety and Health Act (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;), Environmental Health and Safety; and 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#9679; 

Code of Ethics and Business Conduct - a code of ethics and business conduct is used and enforced as one of the most significant company controls on personal behavior. 

&#160;

In addition, we have implemented procedures to respond to client complaints and have in place customer satisfaction survey procedures. As part of our employee performance appraisal annual process, our clients receive an evaluation form for employee project performance feedback, including compliance with our code of ethics and business conduct. 

&#160;

BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OBJECTIVES 

&#160;

We seek opportunities in markets that can yield profitable margins using our professional consulting force and also provide new services such as those performed by our microbiological testing laboratory facility.

2006 U.S. Validation Compliance Service Business Acquisition 

&#160;

In January 2006, we acquired a validation compliance service business which served as the foundation to enter the United States market. 

&#160;

2007 Entrance to Ireland Market 

&#160;

In September 2007, through the formation of an Irish subsidiary, we entered into the Ireland market. We currently provide the same consulting services in Ireland as we provide in the Puerto Rico and United States markets. 

&#160;

2009 Laboratory Testing Facility 

&#160;

Our laboratory testing facility (&#8220;Lab&#8221;) located in Puerto Rico, with an investment of $1.5 million for microbiology, chemical and environmental testing, commenced operations in early fiscal 2009. The Lab is U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") registered, European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;) inspected and ISO 9001 certified. The Lab incorporates the latest technology and test methodologies meeting pharmacopoeia industry standards and regulations. It offers testing and related services to our core industries already serviced as well as the cosmetic and food industries. 

&#160;

2012 Entrance to Spain Market 

&#160;

In January 2012, we initiated a consulting services operation to the Spanish market. Currently, these services are covered under a Spanish subsidiary. Consulting services provided in the Spanish market are similar to those covered in the other markets we serve. 

&#160;

2015 Entrance to Brazil Market 

&#160;

In April 2015, through the formation of a Brazilian subsidiary, we entered into the Brazilian market. Currently, this subsidiary is in the development stage and has not incurred significant revenues or expenses. The Company intends to provide the Brazilian market similar services as those covered in the other markets we serve. 

&#160;

2015 New Calibrations Services Division 

&#160;

During the year ended October 31, 2015, the Company started the development of a new Puerto Rico based Calibrations Services Division (&#8220;Metrologix&#8221;) that will develop and operate a central metrology/calibration laboratory and provide lab and field calibration, verification and qualification of equipment and installations, readiness audits, heating/ventilation and air conditioning ("HVAC") and clean room qualification and related services. The Company signed a three-year strategic collaboration agreement with a Spain-based company specializing in calibrations, validation, HVAC and clean room qualification services to assist the Company in the development process. 

&#160;

2015 Minority Controlled Company Certification 

&#160;

In line with the strategy to penetrate the United States market, on September 26, 2015, we obtained the renewal of the certification as a "minority-controlled company" as defined by the National Minority Supplier Development Council and Growth Initiative ("NMSDC"). The certification allows us to participate in corporate diversity programs available from existing and various potential customers in the United States and Puerto Rico. The certification is subject to renewal on September 26, 2016. 

&#160;

TECHNICAL CONSULTING SERVICES 

&#160;

We have established a reputation as a premier technical consulting services firm to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and chemical manufacturing industries in various markets. These services include regulatory compliance, validation, technology transfer, engineering, project management and process support. We have approximately 60 clients that are among the largest pharmaceutical, chemical manufacturing, medical device and biotechnology companies. We are actively participating in exhibitions, conferences, conventions and seminars as either exhibitors, sponsors or conference speakers. 

&#160;

MARKETING 

&#160;

We conduct our marketing activities in Puerto Rico, United States, Europe and other marketplaces. We actively utilize our project managers and leaders who are currently managing consulting service contracts at various client locations to also market consulting and laboratory testing services to their existing and past client relationships. Our senior management is also actively involved in the marketing process, especially in marketing to major accounts. Our senior management and staff also concentrate on developing new business opportunities and focus on the larger customer accounts (by number of consultants or dollar volume) and responding to prospective customers&#8217; requests for proposals. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

PRINCIPAL CUSTOMERS 

&#160;

We provide a substantial portion of our services to three customers, each of whom accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in either of the years ended October 31, 2015 and 2014. During the years ended October 31, 2015 and 2014, these customers accounted for, in the aggregate, 29% and 46% of total revenue, respectively. In spite of the fact that just a few customers represent a significant source of revenue, our functions are not a continuous process, accordingly, the client base for which our services are typically rendered, on a project-by-project basis, changes regularly. Therefore, in any given year a small number of customers could represent a significant source of our revenue for that year. The loss of, or significant reduction in the scope of work performed for any major customer or our inability to replace customers upon completion of contracts could adversely affect our revenue and impair our ability to operate profitably. 

&#160;

COMPETITION 

&#160;

We are engaged in a highly competitive and fragmented industry. Some of our competitors are, on an overall basis, larger than we are or are subsidiaries of larger companies, and therefore may possess greater resources than we do. Furthermore, because the technical professional aspects of our consulting business do not usually require large amounts of capital, there is relative ease of market entry for a new entrant possessing acceptable professional qualifications. Accordingly, we compete with regional, national, and international firms. Within the Puerto Rico, United States, Europe and Brazil markets, certain competitors, including local competitors, may possess greater resources than we do as well as better access to clients and potential clients. 

&#160;

Competition for validation and consulting services used to be primarily based on reputation, track record, experience, and quality of service. However, given the recent economic recession and our clients' strategies to reduce costs, price of service has become a major factor in sourcing our services. We believe we benefit from competitive advantages over other consulting service firms because of our historical market share within Puerto Rico (over 20 years), brand name, reputation and track record with many of the major pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and chemical manufacturing companies, which have a presence in the markets we service and are pursuing, and the Lab services we provide to them. 

The market of qualified and experienced consultants that are capable of providing technical consulting services is very competitive and consists primarily of our competitors as well as companies in the pharmaceutical, chemical, biotechnology and medical device industries who are our clients and potential clients. In seeking qualified personnel, we market our name recognition in the Puerto Rico market, our reputation with our clients, and salary and benefit packages. 

&#160;

RAW MATERIALS 

&#160;

We require the use of various raw materials, including culture media, DNA reagents, LAL reagents, chemical reagents, solutions, reference materials and biological indicators, in our testing laboratory facility. We purchase these raw materials from various suppliers. At times, we concentrate orders among a few suppliers in order to strengthen our supplier relationships and receive quantity discounts. Raw materials are generally available from multiple suppliers at competitive prices, and amounts kept in stock are not significant. 

&#160;

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS 

&#160;

Activities in our laboratory testing facility are regulated under Puerto Rico and U.S. federal laws designed to protect workers and the environment. Some of these laws include the OSHA and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. These laws apply to the use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in our processes. We believe we are in material compliance with these laws and that continued compliance will not have a materially adverse effect on our business. No specific accounting for environmental compliance has been maintained or projected by us at this time. 

&#160;

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 

&#160;

We have no proprietary software or products. We rely on non-disclosure agreements with our employees to protect the proprietary software and other proprietary information of our clients. Any unauthorized use or disclosure of this information could harm our business. 

&#160;

EMPLOYEES 

&#160;

We employ approximately 185 employees, all of whom are full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good. 

&#160;
