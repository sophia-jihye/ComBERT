(a) 

General Development of Business

Myers Industries, Inc. (the &#8220;Company&#8221;) was founded in Akron, Ohio, in 1933. The terms &#8220;Myers Industries,&#8221; &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221; wherever used herein refer to the Company, unless the context indicates to the contrary. Since then, the Company has grown from a small storefront distributing tire service supplies into an international manufacturing and distribution enterprise. In 1971, the Company went public, and the stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYE.

Headquartered in Akron, Ohio, the Company manufactures a diverse range of polymer products for industrial, agricultural, automotive, commercial and consumer markets. Myers Industries is a leader in the manufacturing of plastic reusable material handling containers and pallets, and plastic fuel tanks. Other principal product lines include plastic storage and organization containers, rubber tire repair products and custom plastic and rubber products.

The Company is also the largest wholesale distributor of tools, equipment and supplies for the tire, wheel and undervehicle service industry in the United States. The distribution products range from tire balancers and alignment systems to valve caps, tire repair tools and other consumable service supplies.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company operated 15 manufacturing facilities, 19 sales offices, four distribution centers and three distribution branches located throughout North, Central and South America; had approximately 15,500 manufactured products and over 12,500 distributed products; and had approximately 2,360 employees.

Serving customers around the world, products and related services from Myers Industries&#8217; brands provide a wide range of performance benefits to customers in diverse niche markets. Some of these benefits include increasing productivity, driving green initiatives, lowering material handling costs, improving product quality, reducing labor costs, shortening assembly times, eliminating solid waste and increasing profitability.

The Company&#8217;s business strategy is focused on sustainable, profitable growth guided by five key operating principles: 1) Customer Dedication, 2) Innovation, 3) Operations Excellence, 4) Organization Development, and 5) Financial Strength. Applying these principles to our business, the Company emphasizes:

&#160;

&#183; 

Industry-leading innovation of niche, high margin products; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Being the low-cost provider of certain commodity products where our brands excel; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Achieving leadership in key product areas through breadth of offering, consistent quality and superior customer service; 

&#160;

&#183;

&#160;

&#183; 

Leveraging brand equity and capabilities to grow business with existing customers and cultivate new ones, particularly in emerging growth markets where we can deliver the greatest value and achieve the best returns; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Investing in new technologies and processes to reinforce customer dedication and market strength across our key business segments; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Succession plans through our management teams at all levels in the Company, ensuring the right people are in the right positions to grow for organizational development; and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Selective acquisitions as opportunities arise to enhance our leadership in key markets and add to shareholder value. 

The Company continually reviews its segments and brands for strategic fit and growth potential. The review process is dedicated to furthering innovation and brand leadership in our markets, building strong customer relationships and positioning the Company for strong financial performance.

Description of Business 

The Company conducts its business activities in two distinct business segments, Material Handling and Distribution, consistent with the manner in which our Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates performance and makes resource allocation decisions.

During the second quarter of 2014, the Company's Board of Directors approved the commencement of the sale process to divest its Lawn and Garden business to allow it to focus resources on its core growth platforms. The divestiture of the Lawn and Garden business was completed in February 2015. The Lawn and Garden business served the North American horticulture market with plastic products such as seedling trays, nursery products, hanging baskets, custom print containers as well as decorative resin planters. The operating results for the Lawn and Garden business are classified as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under Item 8 of this report.

In our Material Handling Segment, we design, manufacture, and market a variety of plastic and metal products. These range from plastic reusable material handling containers and small parts storage bins to plastic RV tanks and parts, marine tanks and parts, portable plastic fuel tanks and water containers, portable marine fuel containers, ammunition containers, storage totes, shipping containers, beverage crates and metal carts and cabinets.

The Distribution Segment is engaged in the distribution of tools, equipment and supplies used for tire, wheel and undervehicle service on passenger, heavy truck and off-road vehicles and the manufacturing of tire repair materials and custom rubber products.

Information regarding the revenues of each segment classified as continuing operations is contained in the Industry Segments footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this report.

Segments Overview

Material Handling Segment

The Material Handling Segment manufactures highly engineered polymer packaging containers, storage and safety products, and specialty molded parts. The brands within this segment include Buckhorn &#174; , Akro-Mils &#8482; , Jamco Products , Ameri-Kart &#174; , Scepter, Myers do Brasil &#8482; and Novel &#174; . 

Buckhorn&#8217;s reusable containers and pallets are used in closed-loop supply chain systems to help customers improve product protection, increase handling efficiencies, reduce freight costs and eliminate solid waste and disposal costs. Buckhorn offers products to replace costly single use cardboard boxes, wooden pallets, and steel containers.

Jamco Products is well established in industrial and commercial markets with its wide selection of welded steel service carts, platform trucks, mobile work centers, racks and cabinets for plastic bins, safety flammable cabinets, medical cylinder carts and more. Jamco Products strong product offering, relationships with industrial distributors and reputation for quality and service complements Myers Industries' existing Akro-Mils business.

Ameri-Kart is an industry leading manufacturer and thermoformer of rotational-molded water, fuel and waste handling tanks, plastic trim and interior parts used in the production of seat components, consoles, and other applications throughout the recreational vehicle, marine, and industrial markets. In addition to standard marine parts, Ameri-Kart is well respected within the marine market for its patented Enviro-Fill &#174; overfill prevention system (&#8220;OPS&#8221;) technology and is the industry&#8217;s only turnkey provider of an integrated, Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;)-compliant marine fuel tank and patented Enviro-Fill diurnal system.

Distribution Segment

Our Distribution Segment includes the Myers Tire Supply &#174; and Myers Tire Supply International &#8482; and Patch Rubber Company &#174; brands. Within the Distribution Segment we source and manufacturer top of the line products for the tire, wheel and undervehicle service industry.

Myers Tire Supply is the largest U.S. distributor and single source for tire, wheel and undervehicle service tools, equipment and supplies. We buy and sell approximately 12,500 different items &#8212; everything that professionals need to service passenger, truck and off-road tires, wheels and related components. Independent tire dealers, mass merchandisers, commercial auto and truck fleets, auto dealerships, tire retreaders and general repair facilities rely on our broad product selection, rapid availability and personal service to be more productive and profitably grow their business.

While the needs and composition of our distribution markets constantly change, we adapt and deliver the new products and services that are crucial to our customers&#8217; success. The new product pipeline is driven by a thorough understanding of the market and its customers' needs. Myers Tire Supply in turn works closely with its suppliers to develop innovative products and services to meet these needs.

Patch Rubber Company manufactures one of the most comprehensive lines of tire repair and retreading products in the United States. Service professionals rely on our extensive product selection and quality for safe, cost-effective repairs to passenger, truck and off-road tires. Products include the plug that fills a puncture, the cement that seals the plug, the tire innerliner patch and the final sealing compound. Patch brand repair products maintain a strong position in the tire service markets including sales through our Distribution Segment&#8217;s sales network. Patch Rubber also employs its rubber calendering and compounding expertise to create a diverse portfolio of products outside of the tire repair market, such as reflective highway marking tapes. Our rubber-based tape and symbols provide the durability and brightness that construction professionals demand to replace paint for marking road repair, intersections and hazardous areas. Compared with traditional highway paint, the tape stock is easier to apply, more reflective and longer lasting.

Raw Materials &#38; Suppliers &#8212; Manufacturing and Distribution Segments 

The Company purchases substantially all of its raw materials from a wide range of third-party suppliers. These materials are primarily polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene plastic resins, as well as synthetic and natural rubber. Most raw materials are commodity products and available from several domestic suppliers. We believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers would not have a material adverse effect on our business.

Our Distribution Segment purchases substantially all of its components from third-party suppliers and has multiple sources for its products.

Competition

Competition in our Material Handling Segment is substantial and varied in form and size from manufacturers of similar products and of other products which can be substituted for those produced by the Company. In general, most direct competitors with the Company&#8217;s brands are private entities. Myers Industries maintains strong brand presence and market positions in the niche sectors of the markets it serves. The Company does not command substantial, overall market presence in the broad market sectors.

Competition in our Distribution Segment is generally comprised of small companies, regional players and national auto parts chains where product offerings may overlap. Within the overall tire, wheel and undervehicle service market, Myers Industries is the largest U.S. distributor of tools, equipment and supplies offered based on national coverage.

Customer Dependence

In 2015, 2014 and 2013, there were no customers that accounted for more than five percent of total net sales. Myers Industries serves thousands of customers who demand value through product selection, innovation, quality, delivery and responsive personal service. Our brands foster satisfied, loyal customers who have recognized our performance through numerous supplier quality awards.

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, Myers Industries had a total of approximately 2,360 full-time and part-time employees. Of these, approximately 1,800 were employed in the Company&#8217;s Material Handling Segment and the Distribution Segment employed approximately 500. The Company&#8217;s corporate offices had approximately 60 employees.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately 500 employees represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining agreements between us and these labor unions expire March 2016, June 2016 and November 2016, representing approximately 100, 200 and 200 employees, respectively. We consider our relationship with our employees generally to be satisfactory.

Backlog

The backlog of orders for our operations is estimated to have been approximately $44 million at December 31, 2015 and approximately $41 million at December 31, 2014. Our backlog is scheduled for delivery within the succeeding 12 months. During periods of shorter lead times, backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future sales. Accordingly, we do not believe our backlog data and comparisons thereof, as of different dates, reliably indicate future sales or shipments.
