 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Company Overview 

Corporate Vision: To drive &#160; the advancement of women&#8217;s health by providing innovative methods to detect, monitor and manage the treatment of both benign and malignant gynecologic disease , with our primary focus being diseases of the female pelvic cavity . &#160; 

We have expanded our corporate strategy with the goal of transforming Vermillion from a technology license company to a diagnostic service and bio-analytic solutions provider. Our plan is to broaden our commercial focus from ovarian cancer to differential diagnosis of women with a range of gynecological disorders . Our strategy is be ing deployed in three phases. The three phases are a rebuild phase , which was completed in the &#160; third &#160; quarter of 2015 , a transformation phase , which is ongoing , and a market expansion and growth phase, which we expect to begin in 2016. 

During the first phase, we expanded &#160; our leadership team by hiring several new senior leaders including a chief executive officer. &#160; In addition, we expanded our commercial strategy, reestablished medical and advisory support, rebuilt our patient advocacy strategy and established a billing system and a payer strategy outside of our relationship with Quest Diagnostics. During the second phase, we completed the process of obtaining licensure of ASPiRA LABS in all of the states that require licenses and plan to establish our own payer coverage for OVA1 and launch a second-generation OVA1 test, trademarked Overa (predicated on receipt of clearance from the FDA). In the third phase we plan to commercialize Overa by utilizing the full national licensure of ASPiRA LABS, managed care coverage in select markets, our sales force and existing customer base . Unlike OVA1, Overa uses a global testing platform, which will allow Overa to be deployed internationally. On October 26, 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market Overa in the European Union. We also plan to develop a n LDT &#160; product series, which we refer to internally as OvaX. &#160; We anticipate that OvaX will include not only biomarkers, but also clinical risk factors , other diagnostics and patient history data in order to boost predictive value. On February 11, 2016, we adopted a plan to streamline our organization. We restructur ed headcount and other expenses targeting an approximately 20% reduction in operating expenses in 2016, as compared to operating expenses in 2015. &#160; 

Mission Statement: We are dedicated to the discovery, development and commercialization of novel high-value diagnostic and bio-analytical solutions that help physicians diagnose, treat and improve outcomes for women . Our tests are intended to detect, characterize and stage disease, and to help guide decisions regarding patient treatment , which may include decisions to refer patients to specialists, to perform additional testing, or to assist in monitoring response to therapy. A distinctive feature of our approach is to combine multiple bio markers , other modalit ies and diagnostics , &#160; clinical risk factors and patient data into a single, reportable &#160; index score that has higher diagnostic accuracy &#160; than its constituents. We concentrate our development of novel diagnostic tests for &#160; gyne cologic disease , with an initial focus on ovarian cancer. We also intend to address clinical questions related to early disease detection, treatment response, monitoring of disease progression , prognosis and others through collaborations with leading academic and clinical research institutions. &#160; 

&#160;

Business: Our initial product, OVA1, is a blo od test designed to , in addition to a physician&#8217;s clinical assessment of a woman with a pelvic mass, identify women who are at high risk of having a malignant ovarian tumor prior to planned surgery. The FDA cleared OVA1 in September 2009 , and we commercially launched OVA1 in March 2010. We have completed development and validation work on a second-generation biomarker panel known as Overa, which is intended to maintain our product&#8217;s high sensitivity while improving specificity. &#160; We submitted our &#160; 510(k) clearance applicat ion to the FDA i n March &#160; 2015 , with the goal of commencing the marketing and sale of the technology on a n early access basis &#160; in 201 6 . We received FDA clearance for Overa on March 18 , 2016. Overa use s the Roche cobas &#160; 6000 platform . 

&#160; 

In June 2014, Vermillion launched ASPiRA LABS, a Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments of 1988 (&#8220;CLIA&#8221;) certified national laboratory based near Austin, Texas, &#160; which specializes in applying biomarker-based technologies, to address critical needs in the management of gynecologic cancers &#160; and specifically pelvic mass disease . ASPiRA LABS provides expert diagnostic services using a state-of-the-art biomarker-based diagnostic algorithm to inform clinical decision making and advance personalized treatment plans. The lab currently processes our OVA1 test, &#160; and we expect the lab to process the CA 125II and other disease specific profiles in the future in specific markets . We plan to expand the testing provided by ASPiRA LABS to other gynecologic conditions with high unmet need. We also plan to develop and perform LDTs at ASPiRA LAB S . ASPiRA LABS holds a CLIA Certificate of Accreditation and a state laboratory license in California , &#160; Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. This allows the lab to process OVA1 on a national basis. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;) issued a provider number to &#160; A SPiRA LABS on Mar ch 5 , 2015. 

In 2016, we began the creation of a new service within the ASPiRA channel strategy, &#8220;an ASPiRA Research and Partnership Program&#8221;. In this program, we plan to leverage existing infrastructure as w ell as enhance our pipeline of future technologies by fostering relationships with IVD companies who are developing new diagnostics including companion diagnostics platforms. We believe this will allow us to continue to be innovative in evaluating potential diagnostics as well. Our goal with the addition of this line of business is to invest in our short term and long term enterprise value while leveraging specimen bank, database, FDA experience, laboratory informatics and operating efficiency. &#160; 

Strategy: We are focused on the execution of four core strategic business drivers in ovarian cancer diagnostics to build long-term value for our investors: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Maximizing the existing OVA1 opportunity in the United States by taking the lead in payer coverage and commercialization of OVA1. This strategy included the launch of a CLIA certified clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS, in June 2014; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Improving OVA1 performance by obtaining &#160; FDA clearance of Overa , a next generation biomarker panel, while migrating OVA1 to a global testing platform, which we believe may allow for better domestic market penetration and international expansion (FDA clearance was received on March 18, 2016) ; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Building an expanded patient base by launching a n ovarian cancer test &#160; ( beyond Overa ) to monitor patients at risk for ovarian cancer in the future ; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Expanding our product offerings by adding additional gynecologic bio-analytic solutions involving biomarkers, other modalities (e.g., imaging), clinical risk factors and patient data to aid diagnosis and risk stratification of women presenting with a pelvic mass disease. 

&#160; 

&#183; 

We believe that these business drivers will contribute significantly to addressing unmet medical needs for women faced with gynecologic disease and other conditions and the continued development of our business. 

Our Product 

OVA1 &#160; addresses a clear clinical need, namely the pre-surgical identification of women who are at high risk of having a malignant ovarian tumor. Numerous studies have documented the benefit of referral of these women to gynecologic oncologists for their initial surgery. Prior to the clearance of OVA1, no blood test had been cleared by the FDA for physicians to use in the pre-surgical management of ovarian adnexal masses. OVA1 is a qualitative serum test that utilizes five well-established biomarkers and proprietary software cleared as part of the OVA1 510(k) to determine the likelihood of malignancy in women over age 18, with a pelvic mass for whom surgery is planned. OVA1 should not be used without an independent clinical/radiological evaluation and is not intended to be a screening test or to determine whether a patient should proceed to surgery. Incorrect use of OVA1 carries the risk of unnecessary testing, surgery and/or delayed diagnosis. OVA1 was developed through large pre-clinical studies in collaboration with numerous academic medical centers encompassing over 2,500 clinical samples. OVA1 was fully validated in a prospective multi- 

&#160;

center clinical trial encompassing 27 sites reflective of the diverse nature of the clinical centers at which ovarian adnexal masses are evaluated. 

&#160; 

We terminated our Strategic Alliance Agreement with Quest Diagnostics (the &#8220;Strategic Alliance Agreement&#8221;) in August 2013 . &#160; Prior to the termination of the Strategic Alliance Agreement , Quest Diagnostics had the right to be the exclusive clinical reference laboratory marketplace provider of OVA1 tests in its exclusive territory, which included the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom and India. As part of the termination, we agreed that Quest Diagnostics could continue to make OVA1 available to healthcare providers under legacy financial terms following the termination while negotiating in good faith towards an alternative business structure . Quest Diagnostics disputed the effectiveness of such termination. 

&#160; 

O n March 11, 2015, we reached a settlement agreement with Quest Diagnostics that terminated all disputes related to the S trategic A lliance Agreement and our prior loan agreement &#160; with Quest Diagnostics . We also entered into a new commercial agreement &#160; with Quest Diagnostics. Pursuant to this agreement , all OVA1 U.S. testing services for Quest Diagnostics customers were transferred to Vermillion&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary , ASPiRA LABS, as of August 10, 2015, with the exception of a nominal number of OVA1 tests distributed through Quest Diagnostics after that date. We do not expect Quest Diagnostics to distribute additional tests in the future. Quest Diagnostics is continuing to provide blood draw and logistics support by transporting specimens from its clients to ASPiRA LABS for testing through at least March 11, 2017 in exchange for a market value fee . &#160; &#160; Per the terms of the new commercial agreement, we will not offer to existing or future Quest Diagnostics customers CA &#160; 125 - II or other tests that Quest Diagnostics offers. 

Studies and publications 

&#160; 

The benefit of OVA1 was established in large clinical studies in collaboration with numerous academic medical centers encompassing over 2,500 clinical samples. OVA1 was fully validated in a prospective multi-center clinical trial encompassing 27 sites reflecti ng the diverse nature of the clinical centers at which ovarian adnexal masses are evaluated. [1] The results of the clinical trial demonstrated that in a clinical cohort of 516 patients, OVA1, in conjunction with clinical evaluation, was able to identify 95.7% (154/161) of the malignant ovarian tumors overall, and to rule out malignancy with a negative predictive value (&#8220;NPV&#8221;) of 94.6% (123/130). At the 2010 International Gynecologic Cancer Society Meeting, data was presented demonstrating the high sensitivity of OVA1 for epithelial ovarian cancers; OVA1 detected 95 out of 96 epithelial ovarian cancer cases for a sensitivity of 99.0%, including 40/41 stage I and stage II epithelial ovarian cancers . These findings resulted in an overall sensitivity of 97.6% for early stage epithelial ovarian cancers, as compared to 65.9% for the previous single-marker CA125 test using the ACOG cutoffs. The improvement in sensitivity was even greater among premenopausal women; for OVA1, sensitivity for early stage epithelial ovarian cancer in premenopausal women was 92.9% compared to CA125 with a 35.7% sensitivity. Overall, OVA1 detected 76% of malignancies missed by the CA125 assay , including all advanced stage malignancies. OVA1 is not indicated for use as a screening or stand-alone diagnostic assay. The study results were published in Obstetrics and Gynecology in 2011. 

&#160; 

In February 2013 , results from a second pivotal clinical study of OVA1, called the &#8220;OVA500 study&#8221; led by Dr. Robert E. Bristow, Director of Gynecologic Oncology Services at U niversity of California Irvine Healthcare , were published in Gynecologic Oncology . The study evaluated OVA1 diagnostic performance in a population of 494 evaluable patients who underwent surgery for an ovarian adnexal mass by a non-gynecologic oncologist. Like the earlier OVA1 validation study, this was a prospective, multi-center study of consecutively enrolled, eligible subjects coordinated through 27 sites across the United States . In the OVA500 study, adnexal surgery patients were only enrolled from non-gynecologic oncology caregivers. As a result, the patient population in this study more closely resembled the intended use population for routine OVA1 testing : women aged 18 years or older, with an adnexal mass requiring surgery , but not yet referred to gynecologic oncologist, and for which the mass was determined to be benign or malignant following enrollment in the study . 

&#160; 

O f the 27 sites in each study, only 10 were common to both studies . Therefore , the two studies collectively evaluated 1,024 eligible subjects at a total of 44 sites. Despite difference s in population and the number of sites in the two studies , the sensitivity of OVA1 added to clinical impression (also called OVA1 dual assessment) was identical, at 95.7% (88/92). O verall prevalence of malignancy in the OVA500 study was 18.6% overall (92/494) and 11.2% (31/277) in premenopausal surgery patients. Th ese malignancy rate s w ere lower than the 31.2% (161/516) found previously in the earlier OVA1 validation study. This difference is likely explained by the exclusion of subjects enrolled by gynecologic oncologist s , a potentially malignancy-enriched subset of all adnexal mass surgeries. Even so, OVA1 sensitivity was 93.5% (29/31) in premenopausal subjects, with or without clinical assessment. 

&#160; 

NPV is another critical element of OVA1 performance in the context of a presurgical triage test or referral to a gynecologic oncologist . In the OVA500 study , overall NPV of OVA1 dual assessment was 98.1% (204/208), higher than the 94.6% NPV found in the earlier validation study. In premenopausal subjects, where functional ovarian cysts are more common and gynecologists may elect to operate more frequently, the NPV of OVA1 with or without clinical assessment was 98.6%. In contrast, clinical assessment predicted just 73.9% of malignancies overall, and only 64.5% of premenopausal malignancies. Together, the differential sensitivity and high NPV of OVA1 strongly confirmed previous findings that support the clinical utility of OVA1 in the presurgical triage of patients scheduled for adnexal mass surgery. 

&#160;

An important additional finding related to medical necessity was the detection of early stage malignancies, since stage I cancers are 90-95% curable if appropriately operated and treated. Of the 92 malignancies in OVA500, 35 were early stage and 28 were stage I: 38.0% and 30.4% of all malignancies, respectively. OVA1 standalone sensitivity in stratifying patients as high-risk was 91.4% (32/35) for all early stage and 89.3% (25/28) for stage I malignancies, respectively. Comparatively, CA125-II sensitivity was 65.7% (23/35) for all early stage and 64.3% (18/28) for stage I malignancies. The success rate of OVA1 classifying a benign mass as low risk, although of secondary importance (considering surgery will be performed regardless), was also measured in the OVA500 study. This statistic (specificity) was 53.5% (215/402) overall, and in premenopausal patients was 61.4% (151/246). Overall, the results strongly and independently confirmed the value of OVA1 in presurgical triage of adnexal mass patients, and sensitive identification of premenopausal and early stage malignancies. 

&#160; 

Since many professional medical societies stress the importance of multiple independent clinical trials as so-called &#8220;evidence levels&#8221;, we also believe that the OVA500 study contributes to a higher evidence level relative to OVA1&#8217;s utility in the medical management of adnexal masses. Health economic analysis indicates that anticipated benefits of OVA1 include i) more appropriate referrals of women with high risk of malignancy to a gynecologic oncologist and fewer referrals of women at low risk of malignancy; ii) fewer second surgeries as a result of an initial surgery by a generalist on a woman with a malignant tumor; iii) reduced need for a backup surgeon (i.e. specialist) during a surgery by a generalist; iv) more appropriate and efficient administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy; and, longer survival, associated with better quality of life. 

In May 2013, the &#160; SGO issued a position statement on OVA1. This second SGO statement on OVA1 since its FDA clearance in 2009 represents another significant step toward acceptance of OVA1 as the standard of care for presurgically evaluating the risk of ovarian cancer in women with adnexal masses. The statement, titled &#8220;Multiplex Serum Testing for Women with Pelvic Mass&#8221;, reads: 

&#8220;Blood levels of five proteins in women with a known ovarian mass have been reported to change when ovarian cancer is present. Tests measuring these proteins may be useful in identifying women who should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist. Recent data have suggested that such tests, along with physician clinical assessment, may improve detection rates of malignancies among women with pelvic masses planning surgery. [1],[2] Results from such tests should not be interpreted independently, nor be used in place of a physician&#8217;s clinical assessment. Physicians are strongly encouraged to reference the ACOG &#8217; s 2011 Committee Opinion &#8220;The Role of the Obstetrician-Gynecologist in the Early Detection of Epithelial Ovarian Cancer&#8221; to determine an appropriate care plan for their patients. It is important to note that no such test has been evaluated for use as, nor cleared by, the FDA as a screening tool for ovarian cancer. SGO does not formally endorse or promote any specific products or brands.&#8221; 

&#160; 

We believe the position statement does two things: 

&#160; 

1. 

Lists as references the publications of OVA1's two pivotal clinical studies, comprised of the original FDA validation study published in June 2011 and the OVA500 "intended use" study published in 2013. Together, this offers an extensive, peer-reviewed proof source for physicians and payers to assess OVA1's clinical performance and comparative medical benefits versus today's standard of care. 

2. 

Places OVA1 use in the context of current ACOG practice guidelines, where CA125 has been used off-label for many years to predict malignancy before surgery, although with inferior performance as compared to OVA 1. 

&#160; 

In June 2013 , a study was published in Gynecologic Oncology analyzing the medical records of 13,321 women with epithelial ovarian cancer, the most common type of ovarian cancer, diagnosed from 1999 to 2006 in California [3] . Led by Dr. Robert Bristow, this study demonstrated that o nly 37 % of these patients received treatment that adhered to care guidelines established by the NCCN, an alliance of 23 major cancer centers with expert panels that analyze, research and recommend cancer treatments. The work, although initiated separately from any Vermillion-related work, points to a continuing need for better presurgical management of patients at risk for ovarian cancer. 

&#160; 

The study also found that surgeons who operated on 10 or more women per year for ovarian cancer, and hospitals that treated 20 or more women a year for ovarian cancer , were more likely to adhere to NCCN guidelines and their patients lived longer. Among women with advanced disease &#8212; the stage at which ovarian cancer is usually first found &#8212; 35 % survived at least five years if their care met the guidelines, compared with 25 % of those whose care fell short.

&#160;

Results of this &#160; study w ere featured on the front page of the New York Times under the headline, "Widespread Flaws Found in Ovarian Cancer Treatment." According to Dr. Bristow, principal investigator of the study, &#8220;If we could just make sure that women get to the people who are trained to take care of them, the impact would be much greater than that of any new chemotherapy drug or biological agent.&#8221; (NY Times, March 11, 2013, Denise Grady) . &#160; 

&#160; 

In November 2013, we announced that a new study of OVA1 clinical performance in the presurgical detection of ovarian cancer, entitled &#8220;Clinical Performance of a Multivariate Index Assay For Detecting Early-Stage Ovarian Cancer&#8221; was published in The American Journal of Obstetrics &#38; Gynecology . [4] Co-authored by Dr. Robert E. Bristow ( University of California Irvine Healthcare) and Dr. Frederick R. Ueland (University of Kentucky), the new analysis focused on presurgical detection of early-stage ovarian cancer among 1,016 ovarian mass surgery patients in two previous pivotal trials conducted in 2007 and 2012. The study compared OVA1 performance in early-stage ovarian cancer to commonly used cancer risk assessment protocols: overall clinical assessment, the CA125 biomarker or modified-American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines for evaluation of suspicious pelvic masses. 

In a statement regarding this new study, Dr. Bristow stated, &#8220;Early-stage ovarian cancer constitutes an important opportunity to improve survival and care for this most deadly gynecologic cancer. However, as evidenced by recent studies, most ovarian cancer patients fail to be referred to the doctors and hospitals best equipped to treat them, resulting in unfortunate consequences. Our new study demonstrates OVA1&#8217;s ability to detect the majority of all early-stage ovarian cancers prior to surgery and thereby aid in appropriately involving a gynecologic oncologist in their care. Even among premenopausal patients where primary ovarian cancer prevalence was just 15%, clinical assessment with OVA1 detected stage I ovarian cancer with almost 90% sensitivity. This is a very encouraging development for the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer.&#8221; 

Also in November 2013, we announced that a &#160; clinical study published in The American Journal of Obstetrics &#38; Gynecology reported superior sensitivity of OVA1 for presurgical triage of ovarian cancer, compared with commonly used risk assessment methods. &#160; [5] &#160; The study compared OVA1 performance to benchmark triage methods, within a combined cohort of 770 ovarian mass surgery patients (including 164 malignancies) from two independent but related OVA1 pivotal trials conducted in 2007 and 2012. The study also compared the actual rate of patient referral from non-specialist physicians to gynecologic oncologists with rates predicted from clinical assessment, OVA1, CA125 or from the modified-American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guidelines. 

Dr. Robert Bristow, lead author of the study, commented: &#8220;Despite widely endorsed treatment standards published by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, several studies published earlier this year show that only a minority of ovarian cancer patients actually receive treatment by the doctors and hospitals best equipped to care for them. Our new publication shows that the FDA-cleared OVA1 test achieves significantly higher sensitivity than two commonly used methods. And despite lower specificity, the referral rates predicted by OVA1 were roughly comparable to actual clinical practice.&#8221; 

I n March 2014, we announced that a study of OVA1&#174; clinical performance, titled "The Effect of Ovarian Imaging on the Clinical Interpretation of a Multivariate Index Assay," was released as an online advance publication of The American Journal of Obstetrics &#38; Gynecology . The study examines the relationship between two commonly used imaging methods &#8211; ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) &#8211; and the OVA1 test result, in assessing the risk of ovarian cancer among patients planning surgery for an ovarian mass. We view this study as an initial proof of concept for our planned OvaX products. 

"This new study advances our understanding of how OVA1 and imaging work together in the presurgical assessment of ovarian cancer risk," said study co-author Fred Ueland , M.D., associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Kentucky's Markey Cancer Center. "This is important for two reasons. First, adding OVA1 reduced the number of ovarian cancers missed with imaging alone, by 85 - 90 % . &#160; Recent publications have reinforced that the first surgery is an important opportunity to improve ovarian cancer survival by ensuring that cancers are detected earlier and that they are operated on by the most experienced specialists. Second, this study provides new evidence of how menopausal status, imaging and OVA1 score may interrelate." 

Dr. Scott Goodrich of the University of Kentucky led the study in collaboration with colleagues Drs. Fred Ueland and Rachel Ware Miller . The authors compared the performance of each imaging method alone, to the performance of OVA1 alone (for risk stratification), as well as in combination with OVA1. In addition, the authors presented logistic regression models showing how menopausal status, high- or low-risk imaging and OVA1 score interact in the assessment of ovarian cancer risk. The researchers concluded that "serum biomarkers and imaging are a complementary set of clinica l tools and that when the OVA1 score is further stratified by imaging risk and menopausal status, there is a better understanding of the clinical risk of ovarian malignancy."

&#160;

In May 2014, we announced a Vermillion - funded study with Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Fl orida. The purpose of the study is to produce clinical and economic data to support a new value-based practice model that may improve survival, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of care for patients with ovarian cancer. It features two phases . &#160; The first phase was retrospective, and benchmark ed the care standards and variances provided to patients with ovarian, fallopian tube and/or primary peritoneal cancer. The second phase model ed improvements in care quality and cost that may be afforded by creating a standardized triage algorithm employing different FDA-cleared or prototype multi-marker blood tests, along with established clinical diagnostic or prognostic factors such as pelvic exams and ultrasound imaging. 

We expect to complete our collaboration with Moffitt Cancer Center (&#8220;MCC&#8221;) i n 2016 . We expect MCC to issue t wo or three &#8220;market development&#8221; publications in connection with this collaboration , which should &#160; offer real-world evidence of opportunities for improvement in pre-surgical management of patients eventually referred to a NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) center with ovarian cancer. One of these studies appeared as a poster presentation at the Annual Meeting of SGO (the Society for Gynecologic Oncology) on March 20-21, 2016. The poster, titled &#8220;Inbound referral patterns for ovarian cancer patients at a National Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCCN) institution&#8221;, evaluated the highly varying paths experienced by 345 women which led to eventual diagnosis and referral to Moffitt. Evidence of delays, surgery by non-specialists, and significant impact on survival was found among these patients, supporting Vermillion&#8217;s contention that better pre-surgical referral is relevant to high-volume cancer care; not just under-served market segments. &#160; 

&#160; 

On March 27, 2015, we announced initial results from a cost-effectiveness analysis study which was presented in a poster at the Annual Meeting of the American College of Medical Quality in Alexandria, Virginia. The study was co-authored by Dr. Robert E. Bristow and Dr. Gareth K. Forde, clinicians at the University of California at Irvine, and Dr. John Hornberger, a leading health economist at Stanford University School of Medicine. The new study, entitled: &#8220;Cost Effectiveness Analysis of a Multivariate Index Assay compared to Modified ACOG Criteria and CA-125 in the Triage of Women with Adnexal Masses&#8221;, compared the cost-effectiveness of triaging ovarian masses using OVA1 versus two important clinical benchmarks: the CA-125 biomarker and the modified ACOG (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists) guideline for ovarian cancer risk assessment (&#8220;mod-ACOG&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Study endpoints included treatment costs, quality-adjusted life-years (&#8220;QALYs&#8221;) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (&#8220;ICER&#8221;). The health economic model utilized OVA1 performance data from the OVA500 prospective trial, published survival, cost and QALY parameters, and a best-practice patient management decision tree. Several important health economic and quality outcomes conclusions were reported in the study: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Use of OVA1 resulted in fewer projected re-operations and pre-treatment CT scans versus CA 125-II or mod-ACOG , 

&#160; 

&#183; 

OVA1 was QALY-increasing and cost-effective relative to CA 125-II or mod-ACOG , 

&#160; 

&#183; 

ICERs of $12,189/QALY and $35,094/QALY were calculated for OVA1 versus CA 125-II and mod-ACOG, respectively; resulting in a &#8220;cost-effective&#8221; outcome based on the $50,000 threshold , and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Relative to the best-practice mod-ACOG benchmark, OVA1 projected an annual increase in patient survival and QALY in excess of 1,000 years, when the surgical cohort was projected to national annual adnexal mass surgeries including about 22,000 new cases of ovarian cancer . 

&#160; 

In April 2015, we announced the initiation of a strategic &#160; collaboration &#160; with Kaiser Permanente's Southern California Permanente Medical Group (&#8220;SCPMG&#8221;) . Vermillion continues in the second year of this strategic collaboration in order to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer. The ultimate goal of this collaboration is to create a "best practice" for identification and "first time right" treatment of patients with ovarian cancer. Once d ata collection from the first phase of this relationship focused on retrospective benchmarking of ovarian cancer care within the SCPMG system is complete , we expect findings to be submitted for publication . Future phases, which will depend on phase 1 findings, may assess the potential value of OVA1 or Overa, to better inform ovarian cancer referral and patient management within an integrated care setting. Vermillion&#8217;s goal is to optimize the on-label testing protocol to SCPMG&#8217;s practice requirements and quality metrics, thereby obtaining evidence for broader application. 

In May 2015, we announced publication of two abstracts reporting initial positive top-line results regarding the development and validation of Overa, Vermillion&#8217;s second-generation OVA1 ovarian cancer triage test. The results were presented in two posters at the 2015 American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meeting. 

The abstracts represent the first publication of data from the development of the next generation of OVA1, which we call Overa. The data show significant improvement in Overa specificity compared to OVA1, while maintaining strong sensitivity (92% for OVA1 in a 2013 study). We received FDA clearance for Overa on March 18, 2016 and o ur goal is to launch Overa on an early access basis in 2016 . &#160;

In May 2015 we announced that the Company was approved for a product development grant from the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (&#8220;CPRIT&#8221;) for $7,500,000, to help fund the Company's new multi-site pelvic mass registry. The grant would assist the Company in creating a first-in-kind clinical registry of patients undergoing evaluation, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up for pelvic masses that may lead to gynecologic malignancy. Receipt of the grant award is subject to execution of a grant contract on terms acceptable to both Vermillion and CPRIT which may include such terms as payment of future product royalties to CPRIT by Vermillion. &#160; 

On March 22, 2016, we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we may borrow up to $4,000,000 from the State of Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development (&#8220;DECD&#8221;). Proceeds from the loan are to be utilized primarily to fund the build-out, information technology infrastructure and other costs related to our Trumbull, Connecticut facility and operations. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 2.0% per annum and requires equal monthly payments of principal and interest until maturity, which is 10 years from the initial funding date. As security for the loan, we have granted the DECD a blanket security interest in our personal and intellectual property. The DECD&#8217;s security interest in our intellectual property may be subordinated to a qualified institutional lender. Under the terms of the agreement, we may be eligible for forgiveness of up to $2,000,000 of the principal amount of the loan if we achieve certain job creation and retention milestones measured by March 1, 2018. If we are unable to meet these job creation milestones within the allotted timeframe or do not maintain our Connecticut operations for a period of 10 years, the DECD may require early repayment of a portion or all of the loan depending on job attainment as compared to the required amount. 

&#160; 

Under the agreement, an initial disbursement of $2 ,000,000 will be made to us after final State of Connecticut approval and satisfaction of customary closing conditions . The remaining $2,000,000 will be advanced if and when we achieve certain future milestones. 

Current and former academic and research institutions that we have or have had collaborations with include the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (&#8220;JHU&#8221;) ; the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (&#8220;M.D. Anderson&#8221;) ; University College London (&#8220;UCL&#8221;) ; the University of Texas Medical Branch (&#8220;UTMB&#8221;) ; the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven; Clinic of Gynecology and Clinic of Oncology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital (&#8220;Rigshospitalet&#8221;) ; the Ohio State University Office of Sponsored Programs &#160; (&#8220;OSU&#8221;) ; Stanford; the University of Kentucky (&#8220;UK&#8221;) , &#160; UC Irvine and Southern California Permanente Medical Group (&#8220;SCPMG&#8221;) . 

The Diagnostic M arket 

The economics of healthcare demand effective and efficient allocation of resources which can be accomplished through disease prevention, early detection of disease leading to early intervention, and diagnostic tools that can triage patients to more appropriate therapy and intervention. Allied Market Research, a market research and business consulting partnership , expects that IVD market revenue will reach $74 billion by 2020. We have chosen to concentrate our business focus in the areas of oncology and women&#8217;s health where we have established strong key opinion leader s, and provider and patient relationships . Demographic trends suggest that, as the population ages, the burden from gynecologic diseases, including cancers , &#160; will increase and the demand for quality diagnostic, prognostic and predictive tests will escalate . In addition, the areas &#160; of oncology and women&#8217;s health generally lack quality diagnostic tests and, therefore, we believe patient outcomes can be significantly improved by the development of novel diagnostic tests. 

Our focus on translational biomarkers &#160; and informatics enables us to address the market for novel diagnostic tests that simultaneously measure multiple biomarkers. A biomarker is a biomolecule or variant biomolecule that is present at measurably greater or lesser concentrations in a disease state versus a normal condition. Conventional protein tests measure a single protein biomarker whereas most diseases are complex. We believe that efforts to diagnose cancer and other complex diseases have failed in large part because the disease is heterogeneous at the causative level (i.e. , most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies) and at the human response level (i.e. , each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner). 

&#160;

Consequently, measuring a single biomarker when multiple biomarkers may be altered in a complex disease is unlikely to provide meaningful information about the disease state. We believe that our approach of monitoring and combining multiple protein biomarkers using a variety of analytical techniques has allowed and will continue to allow us to create diagnostic tests with sufficient sensitivity and specificity about the disease state to aid the physician considering treatment options for patients with complex diseases. Such assays are commonly referred to as IVD MIA ( also known as In Vitro Diagnostic Multiv ariate Index Assays), &#160; and often utilize advanced algorithms based on logistic regression, pattern recognition and the like. Often, IVDMIA algorithms are non-intuitive, and therefore require rigorous clinical validation and error modeling. Vermillion and its collaborators are expert in these areas, and in the case of OVA1, presented both the clinical validation and error modeling needed in order to gain 510(k) clearance of OVA1 as an IVD software device. 

Ovarian Cancer 

Background 

Commonly known as the &#8220;silent killer , &#8221; ovarian cancer leads to over 14 ,000 deaths each year in the United States. As of early 2016, The American Cancer Society ( &#8220; ACS &#8221; ) estimate d that over &#160; 2 2 ,000 new ovarian cancer cases will be diagnosed, with the majority of patients diagnosed in the late stages of the disease in which the cancer has spread beyond the ovary. Unfortunately, ovarian cancer patients in the late stages of the disease have a poor prognosis, which leads to high mortality rates. According to the A CS , when ovarian cancer is diagnosed at its earliest stage, the patient has a 5-year survival rate of 9 2 %. Ovarian cancer patients have up to a 90% cure rate following surgery and/or chemotherapy if detected in stage 1. However, only 1 5 % of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed before the tumor has spread outside the ovary. For ovarian cancer patients diagnosed in the late-stages of the disease, the 5-year survival rate falls to as low as 1 7 %. &#160; 

While the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in its earliest stages greatly increases the likelihood of survival from the disease, another factor that predicts survival from ovarian cancer is the specialized training of the surgeon who operates on the ovarian cancer patient. Numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment of malignant ovarian tumors by specialists such as gynecologic oncologists or at specialist medical centers improves outcomes for women with these tumors. Published guidelines from the SGO and the ACOG &#160; recommend referral of women with malignant ovarian tumors to specialists. Unfortunately, we believe only about one - third of women with these types of tumors are operated on by specialists, in part because of inadequate diagnostics that can identify such malignancies with high sensitivity. Accordingly, there is a clinical need for a diagnostic test that can provide adequate predictive value to stratify patients with a pelvic mass into those with a high risk of invasive ovarian cancer versus those with a low risk of ovarian cancer, which is essential for improving overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer. 

Although adnexal masses are relatively common, malignant tumors are less so. Screening studies have indicated that the prevalence of adnexal masses in postmenopausal women can be as high as 5 % . A dnexal masses are thought to be even more common in premenopausal women, but there are more non-persistent, physiologic ovarian masses in this demographic group . In a &#160; prostate, lung , colorectal and ovarian cancer study, 28, 519 post-menopausal women were screened for ovarian malignancy and 4.7% received an abnormal ultrasound. According to 2010 &#160; U . S . census data, there are 36.8 million women between the age s of 50 and 70 in the U.S. , suggesting that there are more than 1.7 million adnexal masses in this segment alone. Although many of these do not present to the physician or are not concerning enough to warrant surgery, those that do require evaluation for the likelihood for malignancy could potentially benefit from the use of OVA1 . 

The ACOG and the SGO have issued guidelines to help physicians evaluate adnexal masses for malignancy. These guidelines take into account menopausal status, CA125 levels, and physical and imaging findings. However, these guidelines have notable shortcomings because of their reliance on diagnostics with certain weaknesses. Most notably, the CA125 blood test, which is cleared by the FDA only for monitoring for recurrence of ovarian cancer, is negative in up to 50% of early stage ovarian cancer cases . Moreover, CA125 can be elevated in numerous conditions and diseases ot her than ovarian cancer, including benign ovarian masses and endometriosis. These shortcomings limit the CA125 blood test&#8217;s utility in distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors or for use in detection of early stage ovarian cancer. Transvaginal ultrasound is another diagnostic modality used with patients with ovarian masses . Attempts at defining specific morphological criteria that can aid in a benign versus malignant diagnosis have led to the morphology index and the risk of malignancy index, with reports of 40-70% predictive value . However, ultrasound interpretation can be variable and dependent on the experience of the operator. Accordingly, the ACOG and SGO guidelines perform only modestly in identifying early stage ovarian cancer and malignancy in pre-menopausal women. Efforts to improve detection of cancer by lowering the cutoff for CA125 (the &#8220;Modified ACOG/SGO Guidelines&#8221;) provide only a modest benefit, since CA125 is absent in about 20% of epithelial ovarian cancer cases and is poorly detected in early stage ovarian cancer overall . 

Commercialization 

In 2013, we offered OVA1 exclusively through Quest Diagnostics and in 2014, w e offer ed OVA1 both through Quest Diagnostics and ASPiRA LABS. &#160; On March 11, 2015, the Company entered into a new commercial agreement with Quest Diagnostics. &#160; Pursuant to this agreement, all OVA1 U.S. testing services for Quest Diagnostics customers were transferred to Vermillion&#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary, ASPiRA LABS, as of August 10, 2015, with the exception of a nominal number of OVA1 tests distributed through Quest Diagnostics after that date. &#160; Quest Diagnostics is continuing to provide blood draw and logistics support by transporting specimens from its clients to ASPiRA LABS for testing through at least March 11, 2017 in exchange for a 

&#160;

market value fee. &#160; Per the terms of the new commercial agreement, the Company will not offer to existing or future Quest Diagnostics customers CA 125-II or other tests that Quest Diagnostics offers. 

&#160; 

Customers 

In the United States, the IVD market can be segmented into three major groups: clinical reference laboratories, the largest of which are Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America; hospital laboratories; and physician offices. &#160; In 2013 and 201 4 , &#160; virtually all of our &#160; product revenue was generated through Quest Diagnostics . &#160; In 2015, our revenue was generated through Quest Diagnostics and ASPiRA LABS. &#160; In 2016, we expect to generate virtually all of our revenue through ASPiRA LABS. &#160; Outside the United States, laboratories may become customers, either directly with us or via distribution rel ationships established between us and authorized distributors. &#160; In 201 5 , &#160; we began to actively seek out distributors/partners outside the United States for an anticipated 201 6 launch . 

Research and Development 

Our research and development efforts center on the discovery and validation of biomarkers and combinations of biomarkers that can be developed into diagnostic assays. We do this predominantly through collaborations we have established with academic institutions such as JHU and M.D. Anderson as well as through contract research organizations such as PrecisionMed. In addition, we actively seek collaborations and initiate dialog with clinical academics, in order to generate publications, intellectual property or test development in broader areas of gynecologic oncology and other gynecologic diseases . 

Scientific Background 

Genes are the hereditary coding system of living organisms. Genes encode proteins that are responsible for cellular functions. The study of genes and their functions has led to the discovery of new targets for drug development. Industry sources estimate that, within the human genome, there are approximately 30,000 genes. Although the primary structure of a protein is determined by a gene, the active structure of a protein is frequently altered by interactions with additional genes or proteins. These subsequent modifications result in hundreds of thousands of different proteins. In addition, proteins may interact with one another to form complex structures that are ultimately responsible for cellular functions. 

Genomics allows researchers to establish the relationship between gene activity and disease. However, many diseases are manifested not at the genetic level, but at the protein level. The complete structure of modified proteins cannot be determined by reference to the encoding gene alone. Thus, while genomics provides some information about diseases, it does not provide a full understanding of disease processes. We are focused on converting recent advances in proteomics into clinically useful diagnostic tests. 

Relationship Between Proteins and Diseases 

The entire genetic content of any organism, known as its genome, is encoded in strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (&#8220;DNA&#8221;). Cells perform their normal biological functions through the genetic instructions encoded in their DNA, which results in the production of proteins. The process of producing proteins from DNA is known as gene expression or protein expression. Differences in living organisms result from variability in their genomes, which can affect the types of genes expressed and the levels of gene expression. Each cell of an organism expresses only approximately 10% to 20% of the genome. The type of cell determines which genes are expressed and the amount of a particular protein produced. For example, liver cells produce different proteins from those produced by cells found in the heart, lungs, skin, etc. Proteins play a crucial role in virtually all biological processes, including transportation and storage of energy, immune protection, generation and transmission of nerve impulses and control of growth. Diseases may be caused by a mutation of a gene that alters a protein directly or indirectly, or alters the level of protein expression. These alterations interrupt the normal balance of proteins and create disease symptoms. A protein biomarker is a protein or protein variant that is present in a greater or lesser amount in a disease state versus a normal condition. By studying changes in protein biomarkers, researchers may identify diseases prior to the appearance of physical symptoms. Historically, researchers discovered protein biomarkers as a byproduct of basic biological disease research, which resulted in the validation by researchers of approximately 200 protein biomarkers that are being used in commercially available clinical diagnostic products. 

Limitations of Existing Diagnostic Approaches 

The IVD industry manufactures and distributes products that are used to detect thousands of individual components present in human derived specimens. However, the vast majority of these assays are used specifically to identify single protein biomarkers. The development of new diagnostic products has been limited by the complexity of disease states, which may be caused or characterized by several or many proteins or post-translationally modified protein variants. Diagnostic assays that are limited to the detection of a single protein often have limitations in clinical specificity (true negatives) and sensitivity (true positives) due to the complex nature of many diseases and the inherent biological diversity among populations of people. Diagnostic products that are limited to the detection of a single protein may lack the ability to detect more complex diseases, and thus produce results that are unacceptable for practical use. The heterogeneity of disease and of the human response to disease often underlies the shortcoming of single biomarkers to diagnose and predict many diseases accurately. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Solution 

Our studies &#160; in ovarian cancer have given us a better understanding of both the disease pathophysiology and the host response. By using multiple biomarkers rather than a single biomarker , we are able to better characterize the disease and host response heterogeneity. In addition, by examining specific biomarkers and their variants , (e.g. , post-translational modifications ) , we believe we can improve sensitivity and specificity over traditional diagnostic biomarkers because these biomarker combinations reflect both the pathophysiology and host response. This is accomplished using novel biomarker panels coupled with multivariate pattern recognition software to identify IVDMIA algorithms &#160; which can be commercialized as disease-specific assays. 

We are applying translational biomarker research, algorithm development tools, and statistical error modeling methods to discover robust associations between biomarker panels and clinically relevant disease endpoint s. We &#160; plan to develop new IVDMIA algorithms and molecular diagnostic tests based on known and newly identified protein markers to help physicians better predict and manage disease and treatment, and thereby improve patient outcomes and overall health economic resource utilization. &#160; Examples of diagnostic applications include, but are not limited to: asymptomatic population screening, early detection, triage to specialists, aid in diagnosis, prognosis or disease sub-classification, prediction or selection of therapy, monitoring of therapeutic response or residual disease, monitoring for recurrence or identification of appropriate fallback therapy or clinical trial eligibility. &#160; 

We therefore anticipate ongoing and new partner ships with leading scientific and clinical institutions who have active proteomic or genomic programs in the area of gynecologic cancers , or with relevant clinical trial interests, with the goal of expanding our product portfolio with relevant solu tions to unmet medical needs in women&#8217;s health. 

Addressing the Heterogeneity of Disease 

Our approach is to create a diagnostics paradigm that is based on risk estimation , multiple-biomarker testing and information integration. This is based on the belief that cancer and other gynecologic disease s &#160; are heterogeneous and, therefore, that relying on a single disease biomarker to provide a simple &#8220;yes-no&#8221; answer is likely to fail. We believe that efforts to diagnose cancer and other complex diseases have failed in large part because the disease is heterogeneous at the causative level, meaning that most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies, and at the individual response level, meaning that each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner. Consequently, diagnosis, disease monitoring and treatment decisions can be challenging. This heterogeneity of disease and difference in human response to disease and/or treatment underlies the shortcomings of single biomarkers to predict and identify many diseases. A better understanding of heterogeneity of disease and human response is necessary for improved diagnosis and treatment of many diseases. 

Validation of Biomarkers Through Proper Study Design 

Analysis of peer-reviewed publications reveals almost daily reports of novel biomarkers or biomarker combinations associated with specific diseases. Few of these are used clinically. As with drug discovery, preliminary research results fail to canvass sufficient variation in study populations or laboratory practices and, therefore, the vast majority of candidate biomarkers fail to be substantiated in subsequent studies. Recognizing that validation is the point at which most biomarkers fail, our strategy is to reduce the attrition rate between discovery and clinical implementation by building validation into the discovery process. Biomarkers fail to validate for a number of reasons, which can be broadly classified into pre-analytical and analytical factors. Pre-analytical factors include study design that does not mimic actual clinical practice, inclusion of the wrong types of control individuals and demographic bias (usually seen in studies in which samples are collected from a single institution). Analytical factors include poor control over laboratory protocols, inadequate randomization of study samples and instrumentation biases ( e .g. , higher signal early in the experimental run compared to later in the experimental run). Finally, the manner in which the data are analyzed can have a profound impact on the reliability of the statistical conclusions. 

When designing clinical studies, we begin with the clinical question, since this drives the downstream clinical utility of the biomarkers. With the starting point of building validation into the discovery process, we design our studies to include the appropriate cases and control groups. We further incorporate an initial validation component within the discovery component. We place an emphasis on multi-institutional studies, inclusion of clinically relevant controls, using qualified and trained operators to run assays and collect data. For example, in an August 2004 cancer research paper, which describes the first three biomarkers in the ovarian cancer panel, there were more than 600 specimen samples taken from five hospitals that were analyzed. In the development of OVA1 and Overa , we analyzed more than 2,500 samples from five additional medical centers prior to initiating the prospective ovarian clinical study for submission to the FDA. In analyzing the complex proteomics data, we take a skeptical view of statistical methodologies, choosing to use a variety of approaches and looking for concordance between approaches, taking the view that biomarkers deemed significant by multiple statistical algorithms are more likely to reflect biological conditions than mathematical artifacts. 

New Ovarian Cancer Indications 

While our focus on supporting the commercialization of OVA1 is our primary priority, we also may e xten d our ovarian cancer franchise beyond OVA1 , enabled by several factors: 

&#183; 

We completed development and validation of a product improvement to OVA1 , known as O vera , &#160; with submission of a FDA 510(k) clearance application in &#160; March 2015 , and we received such FDA clearance on March 18, 2016 ; 

&#160;

&#183; 

The collection of clinical samples from prospectively enrolled adnexal surgery patients enables further biomarker and bio-analytical research, both in detection of ovarian cancer and also markers and risk factors for other gynecologic diseases which present with similar signs and symptoms; 

&#183; 

Vermillion possesses a large and growing portfolio of intellectual property, generated through collaborative research and licensing; &#160; 

&#183; 

We have highly curated clinical samples, intellectual property and promising biomarker leads. These have the potential to further amplify our ovarian cancer diagnostic efforts in the future ; 

&#183; 

Clinical collaborations such as the independent clinical research program mentioned above typically include licensing options when valuable intellectual property or product opportunities result; and &#160; 

&#183; 

Vermillion&#8217;s success in translating biomarkers into FDA-cleared, widely available commercial products creates increasing interest in licensing, co-marketing and/or acquisition of intellectual property and products from academics and technology providers. We believe we are well-positioned in gynecologic health markets to launch new products developed, licensed, co-marketed or acquired by any of these routes. 

Our research and development expenses were $ 3,751 ,000 and $ 4,667 ,000 for the years ended December 31, 201 5 &#160; and &#160; 201 4 , respectively. The de crease from the prior year was due primarily to a significant &#160; de crease in payments to JHU as development work on O vera was completed in 2014 . 

Commercial Operations 

We have a commercial infrastructure, including sales and marketing and reimbursement expertise. We also operate a national CLIA certified clinical laboratory, ASPiRA LABS . Our sales representatives work to identify opportunities for educating general gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists on the benefits of OVA1 . In March 2015 , we announced that OVA1 was CE marked, a requirement for marketing the test in the European Union . In February 2015, Vermillion received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world's leading certification bodies. We are target ing &#160; markets outside of the United States now that we have migrated OVA1 onto the Roche cobas platform , which is available globally . In 201 5 , we began to actively seek out distributors/partners outside the United States so that we may begin marketing OVA1 outside the United States in 201 6 . &#160; On October 26, 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market Overa in the European Union. 

Approximately 13,598 OVA1 tests were performed in 2015 compared to 16,839 in 2014 with the decrease being attributed to account losses associated with the transition of accounts from Quest Diagnostics to ASPiRA . &#160; In 2015, w e continue d to develop the market through exp erienced strategic account managers, market development specialists , customer account managers and medical scien ce liaisons . As market awareness continues to build, these managers are focused on efforts that will have a positive impact on regional payers and create positive coverage decisions. They are working with local key opinion leaders and meeting with medical directors to discuss the clinical need, our technology assessment package and increasing experience and cases studies showing the positive outcomes utilizing OVA1. 

There are still obstacles to overcome and significant milestones ahead . First, the average g ynecologist will only see about 2 to 4 patients per month who may need our test , &#160; and additional effort will be required to establish a consistent ordering pattern. Second, insurance coverage and patient bills are a concern to the physician and can disrupt the ordering pattern of a generalist who is supportive of OVA1. 

Reimbursement 

Because testing has transitioned from Quest Diagnostics to ASPiRA LABS, we assumed responsibility for billing third-party payers for OVA1. In the United States, revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources, including third-party payers such as insurance companies , government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid and patients . Novitas Solutions , the Medicare c ontractor that has jurisdiction over claims submitted by Quest Diagnostics for OVA1 , cover s and reimburses for &#160; OVA1 . This local coverage determination from Novitas Solutions &#160; should essentially provide national coverage for patients enrolled in Medicare as well as Medicare Advantage health plans. However, ASPiRA has experienced difficulty in obtaining payment from Novitas Solutions for most claims submitted due to Novitas Solutions &#8217; &#160; administrative requirements . ASPiRA is working actively to re ctify th is issue. 

&#160; 

In December 2013, the CMS made its final determination and authorized Medicare contractors to set prices for Multianalyte Assays with Algorithmic Analyses (&#8220; MAAA&#8221;) test CPT codes when they determine it is payable. New and innovative diagnostic tests often face reimbursement challenges that can affect adoption , including: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Coding 

&#183; 

OVA1 is a new class of diagnostics , and therefore n o specific code existed at the time of its launch. This is often the case with new diagnostic tests , and companies will bill using a miscellaneous code , which is the path we and Quest Diagnostics implemented. A fter establishing OVA1 in the market, creating dem and and demonstrating the utility of the test, we applied for and received &#160; an American Medical Association (&#8220;AMA&#8221;) Current Procedural Terminology (&#8220;CPT&#8221;) Category I code specific for OVA1 &#160; which was effective beginning January 1, 2013 . &#160; Achieving the unique Category I C PT c ode # 81503 was &#160; a critical step in our commercialization process. 

&#183; 

Our test list price through ASPiRA LABS is $1,495 per test. 

Claims Process 

&#183; 

In the early launch of a product, claims can be rejected due to lack of medical necessity, lack of payer understanding , or even billing process errors. To address these items , we are engaging with physicians &#8217; offices to assist in the appeals process for our customers . We are using these claims to educate payers and create awareness about the medical necessity of our test. 

Payer Coverage 

&#183; 

We have continue d to focus ongoing efforts toward obtaining national coverage decisions. However, these decisions typically have a much longer lead time due to industry established processes and time frames. In most cases, these entail clinical and technical reviews that are performed on an annual basis. 

&#183; 

We have assembled a Technology Assessment Package t o provide a nucleus of materials tailored to each National Plan. 

&#183; 

We have launched a program to aid local key opinion leaders to work with health plans to support coverage for OVA1. These strategic actions are necessary steps to convert those plans representing numerous regional payers and late adopters. 

Competition 

The diagnostics industry in which we operate is competitive and evolving. There is intense competition among healthcare, biotechnology and diagnostics companies attempting to discover candidates for potential new diagnostic products. These companies may: 

&#183; 

develop new diagnostic products in advance of us or our collaborators; 

&#183; 

develop diagnostic products that are more effective or cost-effective than those developed by us or our collaborators; 

&#183; 

obtain regulatory clearance or approval of their diagnostic products more rapidly than us or our collaborators; or 

&#183; 

obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit our or our collaborators&#8217; ability to develop and commercialize, or a customers&#8217; ability to use our or our collaborators&#8217; diagnostic products. 

We compete with companies in the United States and abroad that are engaged in the development and commercialization of novel biomarkers that may form the basis of novel diagnostic tests. These companies may develop products that are competitive with and/or perform the same or similar functions as the products offered by us or our collaborators, such as biomarker specific reagents or diagnostic test kits. Also, clinical laboratories may offer testing services that are competitive with the products sold by us or our collaborators. For example, a clinical laboratory can either use reagents purchased from manufacturers other than us or use its own internally developed reagents to make diagnostic tests. If clinical laboratories make tests in this manner for a particular disease, they could offer testing services for that disease as an alternative to products sold by us used to test for the same disease. The testing services offered by clinical laboratories may be easier to develop and market than test kits developed by us or our collaborators because the testing services are not subject to the same clinical validation requirements that are applicable to FDA-cleared or approved diagnostic test kits. 

Fujirebio Diagnostics sells &#160; Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (&#8220;ROMA&#8221;). ROMA &#160; combines two tumor markers and menopausal status into a numerical score using a publicly available algorithm. Th is test has the sam e intended use and precautions as OVA1. ROMA is currently marketed as having utility limited to epithelial ovarian cancers, which accounts for 80% of ovarian malignancies. Based upon the results of a 2013 study, we believe that OVA1 has superior performance when compared to the Fujirebio Diagnostics test . 

In addition, competitors such as Becton Dickinson, ArrayIt Corporation and Abbott Laboratories have publicly disclosed that they have been or are currently working on ovarian cancer diagnostic assays. Academic institutions periodically report new findings in ovarian cancer diagnostics that may have commercial value. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Intellectual Property Protection 

Our intellectual property includes the registered trademarks for Vermillion, OVA1 and OvaCalc and a portfolio of owned, co-owned or licensed patents and patent applications . As of December 31 , 201 5 , our &#160; clinical diagnostics patent portfolio included 20 &#160; issued United States patents, 13 &#160; pending United States patent applications, and numerous pending patent applications and issued patents outside the United States. These patents and patent applications fall into 25 &#160; patent families and are directed to diagnostic technologies . &#160; Core assets include diagnostic technologies for ovarian and breast cancer, which fall into our corporate focus on gynecologic oncology and women&#8217;s health. These may be useful in the development of patent-protected products. The clinical diagnostics market includes laboratories engaged in the research and development and/or manufacture of diagnostic tests using biomarkers, commercial clinical laboratories, hospitals and medical clinics that perform diagnostic tests. &#160; 

O ur existing research collaboration agreement with JHU expires on March 31, 2016 . Collaboration costs under the JHU collaboration were $ 600 ,000 and $ 1,323 ,000 for the years ended December 3 1 , 201 5 &#160; and 201 4 , respectively .

Manufacturing 

We are the manufacturer of OVA1 . Components of OVA1 include purchased reagents for each of the component assays as well as the OvaCalc &#174; software. Because we do not directly manufacture the component assays, we are required to maintain supply agreements with manufacturers of each of the assays . As part of our &#160; quality systems , reagent lots for these assays are tested to ensure they meet specifications required for inclusion in OVA1 . Only reagent lots determined by us as having met these specifications are permitted for use in OVA1 . Our principal suppliers are Roche Diagnostics Corporation and Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc. 

Environmental Matters 

Medical Waste 

We are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste as well as to the safety and health of laboratory employees. ASPiRA LABS is operated in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to disposal of all laboratory specimens. We utilize outside vendors for disposal of specimens. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials. We could be subject to fines, penalties and damages claims in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of, or exposure of individuals to, hazardous materials. In addition, claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use, or the use by third parties, of these materials, and our liability may exceed our total assets. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. 

Occupational Safety 

In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals and transmission of the blood-borne and airborne pathogens. Although we believe that we have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. 

Specimen Transportation 

Regulations of the Department of Transportation, the International Air Transportation Agency, the Public Health Service and the Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens. Although we believe that we have complied in all material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

General. Our activities related to diagnostic products are, or have the potential to be, subject to regulatory oversight by the FDA under provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations thereunder, including regulations governing the development, marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of our products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requires that medical devices introduced to the United States market, unless exempted by regulation, be the subject of either a pre- 

&#160;

market notification clearance, known as a 510(k) clearance or 510(k) de novo clearance, or a pre-market approval (&#8220; PMA &#8221;) . OVA1 was cleared by the FDA in September 2009 under the 510(k) de novo guidelines. OVA1 was the first FDA-cleared blood test for the pre-operative assessment of ovarian masses . We &#160; submitted a 510(k) clearance application to the FDA for Overa, our second-generation biomarker panel in early March 2015 . &#160; We received FDA clearance for Overa on March 18 , 2016. &#160; 

Even in the case of devices like analyte specific reagents (&#8220;ASRs&#8221;), which may be exempt from 510(k) clearance or PMA approval requirements, the FDA may impose restrictions on marketing. Our potential future ASR products may be sold only to clinical laboratories certified under CLIA to perform high complexity testing. In addition to requiring approval or clearance for new products, the FDA may require approval or clearance prior to marketing products that are modifications of existing products or the intended uses of these products. Additionally, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection for PMA devices. Our suppliers&#8217; &#160; manufacturing &#160; facilities &#160; are subject &#160; to periodic &#160; and unannounced &#160; inspections &#160; by the &#160; FDA &#160; and state &#160; agencies &#160; for &#160; compliance &#160; with Quality &#160; System &#160; Regulations &#160; (&#8220;QSRs&#8221;). Additionally, &#160; the &#160; FDA will &#160; generally &#160; conduct &#160; a pre-approval &#160; inspection &#160; for &#160; PMA devices. Although we believe that we and our suppliers will be able to operate in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s QSRs for ASRs, we cannot ensure that we or our suppliers will be in or be able to maintain compliance in the future. We have never been subject to an FDA inspection and cannot ensure that we will pass an inspection, if and when it occurs. If the FDA believes that we or our suppliers are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the FDA can issue a Form 483 List of Observations or warning letter, detain or seize our products, issue a recall notice, enjoin future violations and assess civil and criminal penalties against us. In addition, approvals or clearances could be withdrawn under certain circumstances. 

&#160; 

ASPiRA LABS and any customers using our products for clinical use in the United States may be regulated under CLIA, which is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. The regulations promulgated under CLIA establish three levels of diagnostic tests - namely, waived, moderately complex and highly complex - and the standards applicable to a clinical laboratory depend on the level of the tests it performs. 

FDA Regulation of Cleared Tests . Once granted, a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval may place substantial restrictions on how our device is marketed or to whom it may be sold. All devices cleared by the FDA are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and certain sta te agencies. As a medical device manufacturer, we are also required to register and list our products with the FDA. We are required to set forth and adhere to a quality policy and other regulations. In addition, we are required to comply with the FDA&#8217;s QSRs, which require that our devices be manufactured and records be maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities. Additionally, we may be subject to inspection by federal and state regulatory agencies. Non-compliance with these standards can result in, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, and total or partial suspension of production. Further, we are required to comply with FDA requirements for labeling and promotion. For example, the FDA prohibits cleared or approved devices from being promoted for uncleared or unapproved uses. Labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA, which prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses. Additionally, the FDA require s us to perform certain post-marketing studies to verify or validate the clinical performance of FDA- cleared tests , as is permitted by their statutory authority . &#160; Failure to comply with our post-marketing study requirements may lead to enforcement actions by the FDA, including seizure of our product, injunction, prosecution and/or civil money penalties . 

&#160; 

In addition, the medical device reporting regulation requires that we provide information to the FDA whenever evidence reasonably suggests that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. 

&#160; 

Foreign Government Regulation of Our Products . We intend to obtain regulatory approval in other countries to market our tests. Medical device laws and regulations are in effect in many of the countries in which we may do business outside the United States. These range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our potential future medical device products, to requests for product data or certifications. The number and scope of these requirements are increasing. In addition, products which have not yet been cleared or approved for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to the FDA Export Reform and Enhancement Act of 1996 . Each country also maintains its own regulatory review process, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements, product standards, and labeling requirements. In March 201 5 , OVA1 was &#160; CE marked, a requirement for marketing the test in the European Union. &#160; In February 2015 , Vermillion also received ISO 13485:2003 certification for our quality management system from the British Standards Institution (BSI), one of the world's leading certification bodies. &#160; On October 26, 2015, we announced registration of the CE mark for and clearance to market Overa in the European Union.
