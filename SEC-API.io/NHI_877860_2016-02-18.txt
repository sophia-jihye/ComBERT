 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

National Health Investors, Inc., established in 1991 as a Maryland corporation, is a self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT") specializing in sale-leaseback, joint-venture, mortgage and mezzanine financing of need-driven and discretionary senior housing and medical investments. Our portfolio consists of real estate investments in independent living facilities, assisted living facilities, entrance-fee communities, senior living campuses, skilled nursing facilities, specialty hospitals and medical office buildings. Other investments include mortgages and other notes, marketable securities, and a joint venture structured to comply with the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification Empowerment Act of 2007 (&#8220;RIDEA&#8221;). Through a RIDEA joint venture, we invest in facility operations managed by independent third-parties. We fund our real estate investments primarily through: (1) operating cash flow, (2) debt offerings, including bank lines of credit and term debt, both unsecured and secured, and (3) the sale of equity securities. 

At December 31, 2015 , we had investments in real estate and mortgage and other notes receivable involving 189 &#32;facilities located in 31 &#32;states. These investments involve 116 &#32;senior housing properties, 68 &#32;skilled nursing facilities, 3 &#32;hospitals, 2 &#32;medical office buildings and other notes receivable. These investments (excluding pre-development costs of $168,000 &#32;and our corporate office of $920,000 ) consisted of properties with an original cost of $2,094,778,000 , rented under triple-net leases to 26 &#32;lessees, and $135,031,000 &#32;aggregate carrying value of mortgage and other notes receivable due from 14 &#32;borrowers. 

Our investments in real estate and mortgage loans are secured by real estate located within the United States. We are managed as one reporting unit, rather than multiple reporting units, for internal reporting purposes and for internal decision making. Therefore, we have concluded that we operate as a single segment. Information about revenues from our tenants and borrowers, a measure of our income, and total assets can be found in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 

Classification of Properties in our Portfolio 

Senior Housing 

As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio included 113 &#32;senior housing properties (&#8220;SHO&#8221;) leased to operators and mortgage loans secured by 3 &#32;SHOs. SHOs within our portfolio are either need-driven or discretionary for end users and consist of assisted 

living facilities, independent living facilities, entrance-fee communities and senior living campuses which are more fully described below. 

Need-Driven Senior Housing 

Assisted Living Facilities. &#32;&#32; As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio included 69 &#32;assisted living facilities (&#8220;ALF&#8221;) leased to operators and mortgage loans secured by 2 &#32;ALFs. ALFs are free-standing facilities that provide basic room and board functions for elderly residents. As residents typically receive assistance with activities of daily living such as bathing, grooming, memory care services and administering medication, we consider these facilities to be need-driven senior housing. On-site staff personnel are available to assist in minor medical needs on an as-needed basis. Operators of ALFs are typically paid from private sources without assistance from government. ALFs may be licensed and regulated in some states, but do not require the issuance of a Certificate of Need (&#8220;CON&#8221;) as required for skilled nursing facilities. 

Senior Living Campuses. As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio included 9 &#32;senior living campuses ("SLC") leased to operators. SLCs are either freestanding or multi-site campuses that include skilled nursing beds combined with an independent or assisted living facility that provides basic room and board functions for elderly residents. They may also provide assistance to residents with activities of daily living such as bathing, grooming and administering medication and as such are considered need-driven senior housing. On-site staff personnel are available to assist in minor medical needs on an as-needed basis. As the decision to transition to a senior living campus is typically more than a lifestyle choice and is usually driven by the need to receive some moderate level of care, we consider this facility type to be need-driven. Operators of SLCs are typically paid from private sources and from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid for skilled nursing residents. 

Discretionary Senior Housing 

Entrance-Fee Communities. As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio included 7 &#32;entrance-fee communities ("EFC") leased to operators and a mortgage loan secured by 1 EFC. Entrance-fee communities, frequently referred to as continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, typically include a combination of detached homes, an independent living facility, an assisted living facility and a skilled nursing facility on one campus. These communities appeal to residents because there is no need to relocate when health and medical needs change. EFCs are classified as either Type A, B, or C depending upon the amount of healthcare benefits included in the entrance fee. &#8220;Type A&#8221; EFCs, or &#8220;Lifecare&#8221; communities, include substantially all future healthcare costs. Communities providing a modified healthcare contract offering access to skilled nursing care but only paying for a maximum number of days are referred to as &#8220;Type B.&#8221; Finally, "Type C" EFCs, the type in our portfolio, are fee-for-service communities which do not provide any healthcare benefits and correspondingly have the lowest entrance fees. However, monthly fees may be higher to reflect the current healthcare components delivered to each resident. EFC licensure is state-specific, but generally the skilled nursing beds included in our EFC portfolio are subject to state licensure and regulation. As the decision to transition to an EFC is typically made as a lifestyle choice and not as the result of a pressing medical concern, we consider the decision to transition to an EFC to be discretionary. Similarly, the predominant source of revenue for operators of EFCs is from private payor sources. 

Independent Living Facilities. &#32;&#32; As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio included 28 &#32;independent living facilities (&#8220;ILF&#8221;) leased to operators. ILFs offer specially designed residential units for the active senior adults and provide various ancillary services for their residents including restaurants, activity rooms and social areas. Services provided by ILF operators are generally paid from private sources without assistance from government programs. ILFs may be licensed and regulated in some states, but do not require the issuance of a CON as required for skilled nursing facilities. As ILFs typically do not provide assistance with activities of daily living, we consider the decision to transition to an ILF facility to be discretionary. 

Medical 

As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio included 67 &#32;medical facilities leased to operators and mortgage loans secured by 6 &#32;medical facilities. The medical facilities within our portfolio consist of skilled nursing facilities, hospitals and medical office buildings, which are more fully described below. 

Skilled Nursing Facilities. &#32;&#32; As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio included 62 &#32;skilled nursing facilities (&#8220;SNF&#8221;) leased to operators and mortgage loans secured by 6 &#32;SNFs. SNFs provide some combination of skilled and intermediate nursing and rehabilitative care, including speech, physical and occupational therapy. As the decision to utilize the services of a SNF is typically made as the result of a pressing medical concern, we consider this to be a need driven medical facility. The operators of the SNFs receive payment from a combination of private pay sources and government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. SNFs are required to obtain state licenses and are highly regulated at the federal, state and local 

level. Most SNFs must obtain a CON from the state before opening or expanding such facilities. Some SNFs also include assisted living beds. 

Hospitals. &#32;&#32; As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio included 3 &#32;hospitals (&#8220;HOSP&#8221;) leased to operators. Hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services, including acute psychiatric and rehabilitation services, and are subject to extensive federal, state and local legislation and regulation. Hospitals undergo periodic inspections regarding standards of medical care, equipment and hygiene as a condition of licensure. Services provided by hospitals are generally paid for by a combination of private pay sources and government programs. As the decision to utilize the services of a hospital is typically made as the result of a pressing medical concern, we consider this to be a need driven medical facility. 

Medical Office Buildings. &#32;&#32; As of December 31, 2015 , our portfolio included 2 &#32;medical office buildings (&#8220;MOB&#8221;) leased to operators. MOBs are specifically configured office buildings whose tenants are primarily physicians and other medical practitioners. As the decision to utilize the services of an MOB is typically made as a the result of a pressing medical concern, we consider this to be a need driven medical facility. MOBs differ from conventional office buildings due to the special requirements of the tenants. Each of our MOBs is leased to one lessee, and is either physically attached to or located on an acute care hospital campus. The lessee sub-leases individual office space to the physicians or other medical practitioners. The lessee is responsible to us for the lease obligations of the entire building, regardless of their ability to sub-lease the individual office space. 

Nature of Investments 

Our investments are typically structured as acquisitions of properties through purchase-leaseback transactions, acquisitions of properties from other real estate investors, mortgage loans or, in operations through structures allowed by RIDEA. We have also provided construction loans for facilities for which we were already committed to provide long-term financing or for which the operator agreed to enter into a purchase option and lease with us upon completion of construction or after the facility is stabilized. The annual lease rates on our leases and the annual interest rates on our mortgage, construction and mezzanine loans ranged between 6.75% and 13.50% during 2015. We believe our lease and loan terms are competitive within our peer group. Typical characteristics of these transactions are as follows: 

Leases. &#32;&#32;Our leases generally have an initial leasehold term of 10 to 15 years with one or more 5-year renewal options. The leases are "triple net leases" under which the tenant is responsible for the payment of all taxes, utilities, insurance premium costs, repairs and other charges relating to the ownership and operation of the properties, including required levels of capital expenditure each year. The tenant is obligated at its expense to keep all improvements, fixtures and other components of the properties covered by "all risk" insurance in an amount equal to at least the full replacement cost thereof, and to maintain specified minimal personal injury and property damage insurance, protecting us as well as the tenant. The leases also require the tenant to indemnify and hold us harmless from all claims resulting from the use and occupancy of each facility by the tenant and related activities, and to indemnify us against all costs related to any release, discovery, clean-up and removal of hazardous substances or materials on, or other environmental responsibility with respect to each facility. 

Most of our existing leases contain annual escalators in rent payments. For financial statement purposes, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of our operators hold purchase options allowing them to acquire properties they currently lease from NHI. When present, tenant purchase options generally give the lessee an option to purchase the underlying property for consideration determined by i) a sliding base dependent upon the extent of appreciation in the property plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; ii) our acquisition costs plus a specified proportion of any appreciation; iii) an agreed capitalization rate applied to the current rental; or iv) our acquisition costs plus a profit floor plus a specified proportion of any appreciation. Where stipulated above, appreciation is to be established by independent appraisal. 

Some of the obligations under the leases are guaranteed by the parent corporation of the lessee, if any, or affiliates or individual principals of the lessee. In some leases, the third party operator will also guarantee some portion of the lease obligations. Some obligations are backed further by other collateral such as security deposits, machinery, equipment, furnishings and other personal property. 

We monitor our triple-net lessee tenant credit quality and identify any material changes by performing the following activities: 

&#8226; 

Obtaining financial statements on a monthly, quarterly and/or annual basis to assess the operational trends of our tenants and the financial position and capability of those tenants 

&#8226; 

Calculating the operating cash flow for each of our tenants 

&#8226; 

Calculating the lease service coverage ratio and other ratios pertinent to our tenants 

&#8226; 

Obtaining property-level occupancy rates for our tenants 

&#8226; 

Verifying the payment of taxes by our tenants 

&#8226; 

Obtaining certificates of insurance for each tenant 

&#8226; 

Obtaining financial statements of our lessee guarantors on an annual basis 

&#8226; 

Conducting a periodic inspection of our properties to ascertain proper maintenance, repair and upkeep 

&#8226; 

Monitoring those tenants with indications of continuing and material deteriorating credit quality through discussions with our executive management and Board of Directors 

RIDEA Transactions. &#32;&#32;Our arrangement with Bickford Senior Living ("Bickford") is structured to be compliant with the provisions of RIDEA which permits NHI to receive rent payments through a triple-net lease between a property company and an operating company and gives NHI the opportunity to capture additional value on the improving performance of the operating company through distributions to a Taxable REIT Subsidiary ("TRS"). Accordingly, the TRS holds our 85% equity interest in an unconsolidated operating company, which we do not control, and provides an organizational structure that will allow the TRS to engage in a broad range of activities and share in revenues that would otherwise be non-qualifying income under the REIT gross income tests. The TRS is subject to state and federal income taxes. 

Mortgage loans. &#32;&#32;We have first mortgage loans with maturities of at least 5 years from inception with varying amortization schedules from interest only to fully amortizing. Most of the loans are at a fixed interest rate; however, some interest rates increase based on a fixed schedule of rate increases. In most cases, the owner of the facility is committed to make minimum annual capital expenditures for the purpose of maintaining or upgrading their respective facility. Additionally, most of our loans are collateralized by first mortgage liens and corporate or personal guarantees. 

We have made mortgage loans to borrowers secured by a second deed-of-trust where there is a process in place for the borrower to obtain long-term financing, primarily with a U.S. government agency, and where the historical financial performance of the underlying facility meets our loan underwriting criteria. We currently have one second mortgage loan with an interest rate of 12%. 

Construction loans. &#32;&#32;From time to time, we also provide construction loans that by their terms convert to mortgage loans upon the completion of the construction of the facility. We may also obtain a purchase option to acquire the facility at a future date and lease the facility back to the operator. The terms of such construction loans are for a period which commences upon the closing of such loans and terminates upon the earlier of (a) the completion of the construction of the applicable facility or (b) a specific date. During the term of the construction loan, funds are usually advanced pursuant to draw requests made by the borrower in accordance with the terms and conditions of the loan. Interest is typically assessed on these loans at rates equivalent to the eventual mortgage rate upon conversion. In addition to the security of the lien against the property, we will generally require additional security and collateral in the form of either payment and performance completion bonds or completion guarantees by the borrower's parent, affiliates of the borrower or one or more of the individuals who control the borrower. 

Other notes receivable. &#32;&#32;We have provided a revolving credit facility to a borrower whose business is to provide bridge loans to owner-operators who are qualifying for long-term HUD financing secured by real estate. Our interest rate on the credit facility is 13.5%. We have provided loans to borrowers involved in the skilled nursing and senior housing industries who have pledged personal and business guarantees as security for the loans. The interest rates on these loans currently range from 8% to13.5%. 

Investment in marketable securities. &#32;&#32;At December 31, 2015, we invested a portion of our funds in various marketable securities with quoted market prices, including the common shares of other publicly-held REITs. We classify these highly-liquid securities as available-for-sale and carry the investments at their then quoted fair market value at the balance sheet date. We may choose to liquidate these investments to invest the proceeds into real estate assets. With respect to the safekeeping of certain security deposits or where liquidity is otherwise of significant concern, a portion of our funds may be invested in government agency debt securities, long-term certificates of deposit, or other risk-appropriate securities as determined by management. 

Competition and Market Conditions 

We compete with other REITs, private equity funds and other investors (including, but not limited to, banks, insurance companies, and investment banks who market securities in mortgage funds) in the acquisition, leasing and financing of health care real estate. 

Operators of our facilities compete on a local and regional basis with operators of facilities that provide comparable services. Operators compete for residents and/or patients and staff based on quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of facilities, services offered, family preference, physicians, staff and price. Competition is with independent operators as well as companies managing multiple facilities, some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than the operators of our facilities. Some of these facilities are operated for profit while others are owned by governmental agencies or tax exempt not-for-profit organizations. 

The SNFs which either secure our mortgage loans or we lease to operators receive the majority of their revenues from Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. From time to time, these facilities have experienced Medicare and Medicaid revenue reductions brought about by the enactment of legislation to reduce government costs. In particular, the establishment of a Medicare Prospective Payment System (&#8220;PPS&#8221;) for SNF services to replace the cost-based reimbursement system significantly reduced Medicare reimbursement to SNF providers. While Congress subsequently took steps to mitigate the impact of PPS on SNFs, other federal legislative policies have been adopted and continue to be proposed that would reduce the growth rate of Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to SNFs. State Medicaid funding is not expected to keep pace with inflation according to industry studies. Any changes in government reimbursement methodology that reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the operating costs of our borrowers and lessees could adversely impact us. 

Senior housing communities generally rely on private-pay residents who may be negatively impacted in an economic downturn. The success of these facilities is often impacted by the existence of comparable, competing facilities in a local market. 

Operator Diversification 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , approximately 21% &#32;of our portfolio revenue was from publicly-owned operators, 53% &#32;was from regional operators, 22% &#32;from national chains which are privately owned and 5% &#32;was from smaller operators. We consider the creditworthiness of the operator to be an important factor in our underwriting of the investment, and we generally have the right to approve any changes in operators. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , operators of facilities which provided more than 3% of our total revenues were (in alphabetical order): Bickford Senior Living; Fundamental; Health Services Management; Holiday Retirement; Legend Healthcare; National HealthCare Corporation; and Senior Living Communities. 

Major Customers 

We have four operators, an affiliate of Holiday Retirement ("Holiday"), Senior Living Communities, LLC ("Senior Living"), National HealthCare Corporation (&#8220;NHC&#8221;) and Bickford Senior Living ("Bickford"), from whom we individually derive at least 10% of our income. 

Holiday 

In December 2013 we acquired 25 &#32;independent living facilities from an affiliate of Holiday for $491,000,000 plus transaction costs of $1,959,000. We have leased this portfolio to Holiday AL Holdings, LP, a subsidiary of Holiday. Our tenant operates the facilities pursuant to a management agreement with a Holiday-affiliated manager. The master lease term of 17 &#32;years began in December 2013 and provided for initial base rent of $31,915,000 &#32;plus annual escalators of 4.5% in the first 3 years and a minimum of 3.5% each year thereafter. 

Of our total revenue from continuing operations, $43,817,000 &#32;( 19% ) and $43,817,000 &#32;( 25% ) were recorded as rental income from Holiday, including straight-line revenues of $10,466,000 &#32;and $11,902,000 &#32;for the years ended December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Senior Living Communities 

In December 2014, we acquired a portfolio of eight retirement communities (the &#8220;Senior Living Portfolio&#8221;) with a total of 1,671 units from Health Care REIT, Inc. and certain of its affiliates for a cash purchase price of $476,000,000. The Senior Living Portfolio includes seven entrance-fee communities and one senior living campus. 

We have leased the Senior Living Portfolio under a triple-net master lease with an affiliate of Senior Living which continues to manage the facilities. The 15-year master lease contains two 5-year renewal options and provides for year one cash rent of $31,000,000, subject to annual escalators of 4% in years two through four and 3% thereafter. 

In connection with the Senior Living acquisition, we provided a $15,000,000 revolving line of credit to Senior Living, the maturity of which mirrors the term of the master lease. Borrowings will be used primarily to finance construction projects within the Senior Living Portfolio, including building additional units. Amounts outstanding under the facility, $6,282,000 &#32;at December 31, 2015 , bear interest at an annual rate equal to the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, 2.27% &#32;at December 31, 2015 , plus 6% . 

Of our total revenue from continuing operations, $39,422,000 &#32;( 17% ), and $1,533,000 &#32;( 1% ), including $8,422,000 &#32;and $328,000 &#32;of straight-line revenues, were recorded as rental income from Senior Living, in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

NHC 

NHC is a publicly-held company and the lessee of our legacy properties. We lease 42 &#32;facilities to NHC comprised of 3 &#32;independent living facilities and 39 &#32;skilled nursing facilities (4 of which are subleased to other parties for whom the lease payments are guaranteed to us by NHC). These facilities are leased to NHC under the terms of an amended Master Lease Agreement dated October 17, 1991 ("the 1991 lease") which includes our 35 remaining legacy properties and a Master Lease Agreement dated August 30, 2013 ("the 2013 lease") which includes 7 skilled nursing facilities acquired from a third party. Under the terms of the 1991 lease, base annual rental of $30,750,000 escalates by 4% of the increase, if any, in each facility&#8217;s revenue over a 2007 base year. Similarly, the 2013 lease provides for base annual rental of $3,450,000 plus percentage rent equal to 4% of the increase, if any, in each facility's annual revenue over a 2014 base year. 

Of our total revenue from continuing operations, $36,625,000 &#32;( 16% ), $36,446,000 &#32;( 21% ) and $34,756,000 &#32;( 29% ) in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, were derived from the two lease agreements with NHC. 

NHC owned 1,630,462 &#32;shares of our common stock at December 31, 2015 . The chairman of our board of directors is also a director on NHC&#8217;s board. 

Bickford 

As of December 31, 2015 , we owned an 85% &#32;equity interest, and Sycamore Street, LLC ("Sycamore"), an affiliate of Bickford, owned a 15% &#32;equity interest in our consolidated subsidiary ("PropCo"), which owns 32 &#32;assisted living/memory care facilities, plus 5 &#32;facilities under development. The facilities are leased to an operating company, ("OpCo"), in which we retain an 85/15 non-controlling ownership interest with Sycamore. The facilities are managed by Bickford. This joint venture is structured to comply with the provisions of RIDEA. 

The current annual contractual rent from OpCo to PropCo is $25,529,000 , plus fixed annual escalators. NHI has an exclusive right to Bickford's future acquisitions, development projects and refinancing transactions. 

Of our total revenue from continuing operations, $24,121,000 &#32;( 11% ), $21,421,000 &#32;( 12% ) and $14,586,000 &#32;( 12% ) were recorded as rental income from Bickford for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 , respectively.

Sources of Revenues 

General. &#32;&#32;Our revenues are derived primarily from rental income, mortgage and other note interest income and income from our other investments, substantially all of which are in marketable securities, including the common stock of other healthcare REITs. During 2015 , rental income was $214,447,000 &#32;( 94% ), interest income from mortgages and other notes was $9,978,000 &#32;( 4% ) and income from our other investments was $4,563,000 &#32;( 2% ) of total revenue from continuing operations of $228,988,000 . Our revenues depend on the operating success of our facility operators whose source and amount of revenues are determined by (i) the licensed beds or other capacity of the facility, (ii) the occupancy rate of the facility, (iii) the extent to which the services provided at each facility are utilized by the patients, (iv) the mix of private pay, Medicare and Medicaid patients at the facility, and (v) the rates paid by private paying patients and by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 

Governmental and other concerns regarding health care costs have and may continue to result in significant downward pressure on payments to health care facilities, and there can be no assurance that future payment rates for either governmental or private health care plans will be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients. Any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care could have an adverse effect on revenues of our lessees and borrowers and thereby adversely affect those lessees' and borrowers' abilities to make their lease or debt payments to us. Failure of the lessees or borrowers to make their lease or debt payments would have a direct and material adverse impact on us. 

Medicare and Medicaid. &#32;&#32;A significant portion of the revenue of our SNF lessees and borrowers is derived from government funded reimbursement programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Reimbursement under these programs is subject to periodic payment review and other audits by federal and state authorities. Medicare is uniform nationwide and reimburses skilled nursing centers under a Prospective Payment System (&#8220;PPS&#8221;) which is based on a predetermined, fixed amount. PPS is an acuity based classification system that uses nursing and therapy indexes adjusted by geographical wage indexes to calculate per diem rates for each Medicare patient. Payment rates are updated annually and are generally adjusted each October when the federal fiscal year begins. The current acuity classification system is named Resource Utilization Groups IV (&#8220;RUGs IV&#8221;) and was effective October 1, 2010. Federal legislative policies have been adopted and continue to be proposed that would provide smaller increases in annual Medicare payments to nursing facilities. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") announced the Skilled Nursing Facilities &#8211; PPS final rule for fiscal year 2016 which increases Medicare payments to SNF operators by only 1.2% beginning October 1, 2015. The fiscal year 2015 increase was 2.0%, the fiscal year 2014 increase was 1.4% and the fiscal year 2013 increase was 1.8%. 

In the future, any failure of Congress to agree on spending reductions to meet long-term mandated deficit reduction goals would trigger automatic spending cuts of 2% to Medicare. 

RUGs IV incorporated changes to PPS that significantly altered how SNFs are paid for rendering care. Some examples are as follows: 

&#8226; 

A shift to 66 payment categories from 53 payment categories; 

&#8226; 

Changes related to assessment reference dates and qualifiers that will significantly reduce utilization of rehabilitation and extensive service categories; 

&#8226; 

Modification to therapy services related to estimating treatments and utilization of concurrent therapy that will likely result in RUG classifications at much lower levels of therapy than previous results; and 

&#8226; 

Adjustments related to assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs) and an increased emphasis on ADL scores in the nursing case mix indices and related RUG payment rates. 

Medicaid is a joint federal and state program designed to provide medical assistance to &#8220;eligible needy persons.&#8221; Medicaid programs are operated by state agencies that adopt their own medical reimbursement methodology and standards. Payment rates and covered services vary from state to state. In many instances, revenues from Medicaid programs are insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred in providing care to those patients. With regard to Medicaid payment increases to skilled nursing operators, changes in federal funding coupled with state budget problems have produced uncertainty. States will more than likely be unable to keep pace with nursing center inflation. States are under pressure to pursue other alternatives to long term care such as community and home-based services. Furthermore, several of the states in which we have investments have actively sought to reduce or slow the increase of Medicaid spending for nursing home care. 

Medicare and Medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation, adoption of rules and regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law. Moreover, as health care facilities have experienced increasing pressure from private payors attempting to control health care costs, reimbursement from private payors has in many cases effectively been reduced to levels approaching those of government payors. Healthcare reimbursement will likely continue to be of significant importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or the effect that any future legislative reforms may have on our lessees&#8217; and borrowers&#8217; costs of doing business and on the amount of reimbursement by government and other third-party payors. There can be no assurance that future payment rates for either government or private payors will be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients. Any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care could adversely affect the operating revenues of our SNF and hospital lessees and borrowers, and thereby adversely affect their ability to make their lease or debt payments to us. Failure of our lessees and borrowers to make their scheduled lease and loan payments to us would have a direct and material adverse impact on us. 

Government Regulation 

Licensure and Certification. The health care industry is highly regulated by federal, state and local law and is directly affected by state and local licensing requirements, facility inspections, state and federal reimbursement policies, regulations concerning capital and other expenditures, certification requirements and other such laws, regulations and rules. Sanctions for failure to comply with these regulations and laws include (but are not limited to) loss of licensure, fines and loss of certification to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as potential criminal penalties. The failure of any lessee or borrower to comply with such laws, requirements and regulations could affect their ability to operate the facility or facilities and could adversely affect such lessee's or borrower's ability to make lease or debt payments to us. 

In the past several years, due to rising health care costs, there has been an increased emphasis on detecting and eliminating fraud and abuse in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Payment of any consideration in exchange for referral of Medicare and Medicaid patients is generally prohibited by federal statute, which subjects violators to severe penalties, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, fines and even prison sentences. In recent years, both federal and state governments have significantly increased investigation and enforcement activity to detect and punish wrongdoers. In addition, legislation has been adopted at both state and federal levels which severely restrict the ability of physicians to refer patients to entities in which they have a financial interest. 

It is anticipated that the trend toward increased investigation and enforcement activity in the area of fraud and abuse, as well as self-referral, will continue in future years. Certain of our investments are with lessees or borrowers which are partially or wholly owned by physicians. In the event that any lessee or borrower were to be found in violation of laws regarding fraud and abuse or self-referral, that lessee's or borrower's ability to operate the facility could be jeopardized, which could adversely affect the lessee's or borrower's ability to make lease or debt payments to us and thereby adversely affect us. 

Certificates of Need. The SNFs and hospitals in which we invest are also generally subject to state statutes which may require regulatory approval in the form of a CON prior to the construction or expansion of facilities to accommodate new beds (or addition of new beds to existing facilities), the addition of services or certain capital expenditures. CON requirements are not uniform throughout the United States and are subject to change. We cannot predict the impact of regulatory changes with respect to CONs on the operations of our lessees and borrowers; however, in our primary market areas, a significant reduction in new construction of long-term care beds has occurred. 

Investment Policies 

Our investment objectives are (i) to provide consistent and growing current income for distribution to our stockholders through investments primarily in health care related facilities or in the operations thereof through independent third-party management, (ii) to provide the opportunity to realize capital growth resulting from appreciation, if any, in the residual value of our portfolio properties, and (iii) to preserve and protect stockholders' capital through a balance of diversity, flexibility and liquidity. There can be no assurance that these objectives will be realized. Our investment policies include making investments in real estate, mortgage and other notes receivable, marketable securities, including the common stock of other REITs, and joint ventures structured to comply with the provisions of RIDEA. 

As described in Item 7 and in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, included herein, we have funded or made commitments to fund new investments in real estate and loans since January 1, 2015 &#32;totaling $310,075,000 , and we anticipate making additional investments in 2016 &#32;that meet our underwriting criteria. In making new investments, we consider such factors as (i) the geographic area and type of property, (ii) the location, construction quality, condition and design of the property, (iii) the current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs, and lease or mortgage obligations to provide a competitive income return to our investors, (iv) the growth, tax and regulatory environments of the communities in which the properties are located, (v) occupancy and demand for similar facilities in the same or nearby communities, (vi) the quality, experience and creditworthiness of the management operating the facilities located on the property and (vii) the mix of private and government-sponsored residents. There can be no assurances that investments meeting our standards regarding these attributes will be found or closed. 

We will not, without the approval of a majority of the Board of Directors, and review of a committee comprised of independent directors, enter into any joint venture relationships with or acquire from or sell to any director, officer or employee of NHI, or any affiliate thereof, as the case may be, any of our assets or other property. 

The Board of Directors, without the approval of the stockholders, may alter our investment policies if it determines that such a change is in our best interests and our stockholders&#8217; best interests. The methods of implementing our investment policies may vary as new investment and financing techniques are developed or for other reasons. Management may recommend changes in investment criteria from time to time. 

Future investments in health care related facilities may utilize borrowed funds or issuance of equity when it is advisable in the opinion of the Board of Directors. We may negotiate lines of credit or arrange for other short or long-term borrowings from lenders. We may arrange for long-term borrowings from institutional investors or through public offerings. We have previously invested and may in the future invest in properties subject to existing loans or secured by mortgages, deeds of trust or similar liens with favorable terms or in mortgage investment pools.
