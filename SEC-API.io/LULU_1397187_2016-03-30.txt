 ITEM 1. &#32;BUSINESS 

General 

lululemon athletica inc. is a designer, distributor, and retailer of technical athletic apparel. Since our inception, we have developed a distinctive corporate culture with a mission to produce products which create transformational experiences for people to live happy, healthy, fun lives. We promote a set of core values in our business which include developing the highest quality products, operating with integrity, leading a balanced and fun life, and nurturing entrepreneurial spirit. These core values attract passionate and motivated employees who are driven to succeed and share our purpose of "elevating the world from mediocrity to greatness." 

In this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("10-K" or "Report") for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016 &#160;("fiscal 2015"), lululemon athletica inc. (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as "lululemon," "the Company," "we," "us" or "our." 

Our Products 

Our healthy lifestyle inspired athletic apparel is marketed under the lululemon athletica and ivivva athletica brand names. We offer a comprehensive line of apparel and accessories for women, men, and female youth. Our apparel assortment includes items such as pants, shorts, tops, and jackets designed for healthy lifestyle and athletic activities such as yoga, running, other sweaty pursuits, and athletic wear for female youth. 

Although we benefit from the growing number of people that participate in yoga, we believe the percentage of our products sold for other activities will continue to increase as we broaden our product range. Our fitness-related accessories include an array of items such as bags, socks, underwear, yoga mats, and water bottles. 

Our design team continues to source and develop technically advanced fabrics and innovative functional features that we believe will help advance our product lines and differentiate us from the competition. 

Our Market 

Our primary target customer is a sophisticated and educated woman who understands the importance of an active, healthy lifestyle. She is increasingly tasked with the dual responsibilities of career and family and is constantly challenged to balance her work, life and health. We believe she pursues exercise to achieve physical fitness and inner peace. 

As women have continued to embrace a variety of fitness and athletic activities, including yoga, we believe we have been able to effectively address their unique fit and performance needs by incorporating style along with comfort and functionality into our products through our vertical retail strategy. 

Although we were founded to address the unique needs of women, we are also successfully designing products for men and female youth who appreciate the technical rigor and premium quality of our products. We also believe longer-term growth in athletic participation will be reinforced as the aging Baby Boomer generation focuses more on longevity. In addition, we believe consumer purchase decisions are driven by both an actual need for functional products and a desire to live a particular 

lifestyle. As such, we believe the credibility and authenticity of our brand expands our potential market beyond just athletes to those who desire to lead an active, healthy, and balanced life. 

Our Segments 

We primarily conduct our business through two channels: company-operated stores and direct to consumer. 

We also generate net revenue from our outlets, showrooms, sales to wholesale accounts, warehouse sales, sales from temporary locations, and license and supply arrangements. The net revenue we generate from these sources is combined in our other segment. 

As of January 31, 2016 , we operated 363 &#32;company-operated stores located in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Hong Kong, Germany, and Puerto Rico. We believe our vertical retail strategy allows us to interact more directly with, and gain feedback from, our customers, whom we call guests, while providing us with greater control of our brand. 

Our direct to consumer segment includes the net revenue which we generate from our lululemon and ivivva e-commerce websites, www.lululemon.com and www.ivivva.com , and other country and region specific websites. 

Company-Operated Stores 

As of January 31, 2016 , our retail footprint included 363 &#32;company-operated stores. While most of our company-operated stores are branded lululemon athletica, 43 &#32;of our company-operated stores are branded ivivva athletica and specialize in athletic wear for female youth. Our retail stores are located primarily on street locations, in lifestyle centers, and in malls. 

Our company-operated stores by brand, and by country, as of January 31, 2016 &#32;and February 1, 2015 , are summarized in the table below:

Total 

&#160; 

&#160; 

We opened 61 &#32;net new company-operated stores in fiscal 2015 , including eight &#32;new stores outside of North America. 

In fiscal 2016, our new store growth will be primarily focused on continuing the build-out of our company-operated stores in the United States while also expanding our retail footprint in Asia and Europe. Our real estate strategy over the next several years will not only consist of opening new company-operated stores, but also in overall square footage growth through store expansions and relocations. 

We perform ongoing evaluations of our portfolio of company-operated store locations. In fiscal 2015, we closed one of our company-operated stores. As we continue our evaluation we may, in future periods, close or relocate additional company-operated store locations. 

We believe that our innovative retail concept and guest experience contribute to the success of our stores. During fiscal 2015 , our company-operated stores open at least one year, which average approximately 2,968 square feet, averaged sales of $1,541 &#32;per square foot. The square footage of our company-operated stores excludes space used for non-retail activities such as yoga studios and office space. 

Direct to Consumer 

Direct to consumer is an increasingly substantial part of our business, representing approximately 19.5% &#32;of our net revenue in fiscal 2015 , compared to 17.9% &#32;of our net revenue in fiscal 2014 &#32;and 16.5% &#32;of our net revenue in fiscal 2013 . We believe that a direct to consumer channel is convenient for our core customer and enhances the image of our brand. Our direct to consumer channel makes our product accessible to more markets than our company-operated store channel alone. We believe this channel is effective in building brand awareness, especially in new markets. 

Other Channels 

Other net revenue accounted for 6.9% of total net revenue in fiscal 2015 , compared to 7.1% in fiscal 2014 , and 6.2% of total net revenue in fiscal 2013 . Other net revenue includes sales made through the following channels: 

&#8226; 

Outlets and warehouse sales &#32;- We utilize outlets as well as warehouse sales, which are held from time to time, to sell slow moving inventory and inventory from prior seasons to retail customers at discounted prices. 

&#8226; 

Showrooms &#32;- Our showrooms are typically small locations that we open when we enter new markets and feature a limited selection of our product offering. 

&#8226; 

Wholesale &#32;- Our wholesale accounts include premium yoga studios, health clubs, and fitness centers. We believe these premium wholesale locations offer an alternative distribution channel that is convenient for our core consumer and enhances the image of our brand. We do not intend wholesale to be a significant contributor to overall sales. Instead, we use the channel to build brand awareness, especially in new markets, including those outside of North America. 

&#8226; 

Temporary locations &#32;- Our temporary locations are typically opened for a short period of time in markets in which we may not already have a presence. 

&#8226; 

License and supply arrangements - We enter into license and supply arrangements from time to time when we believe that it will be to our advantage to partner with companies and individuals with significant experience and proven success in certain target markets. 

In January 2015, we entered into a license and supply arrangement with a partner in the Middle East which grants our partner the right to operate lululemon athletica branded retail locations in the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain for an initial term of five years. We retain the rights to sell lululemon products through our e-commerce websites in these countries. Under this arrangement, we supply our partner with lululemon products, training, and other support. As of January 31, 2016 , there were two &#32;licensed stores in the United Arab Emirates, which are not included in the above company-operated stores table. 

Community-Based Marketing 

We utilize a community-based approach to building brand awareness and customer loyalty. We pursue a multi-faceted strategy which leverages our local ambassadors, social media, in-store community boards, and a variety of grassroots initiatives. 

Product Design and Development 

Our product design efforts are led by a team of designers based in Vancouver, British Columbia partnering with international designers. Our team is comprised of dedicated athletes and users of our products who embody our design philosophy and dedication to premium quality. Our design team identifies trends based on market intelligence and research, proactively seeks the input of our guests and our ambassadors and broadly seeks inspiration consistent with our goals of style, function and technical superiority. 

As we strive to continue to provide our guests with technically advanced fabrics, our design team works closely with our suppliers to incorporate innovative fabrics that bring particular specifications to our products. We partner with independent inspection, verification, and testing companies, who conduct a variety of tests on our fabrics, testing performance characteristics including pilling, shrinkage, abrasion resistance, and colorfastness. We collaborate with leading fabric suppliers to develop fabrics that we ultimately trademark for brand recognition whenever possible. 

Sourcing and Manufacturing 

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We rely on a limited number of suppliers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products. We work with a group of approximately 57 suppliers to provide the fabrics for our products. We use a wide variety of fabrics in our products, including our Luon fabric. We obtain substantially all of our Luon fabric, which represents approximately 30% of the fabric we use in our products, from four suppliers. We work with a group of approximately 35 suppliers that manufacture our products, five of which produced approximately 65% of our products in fiscal 2015 . During fiscal 2015 , no single manufacturer produced more than 30% of our product offering. During fiscal 2015 , approximately 44% of our products were produced in South East Asia, approximately 28% in South Asia, approximately 20% in China, approximately 2% in North America, and the remainder in other regions. 

We have developed long-standing relationships with a number of our vendors and take great care to ensure that they share our commitment to quality and ethics. We do not, however, have any long-term term contracts with the majority of our suppliers or manufacturing sources for the production and supply of our fabrics and garments, and we compete with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, and production. We require that all of our manufacturers adhere to a vendor code of ethics regarding social and environmental sustainability practices. Our product quality and sustainability teams partner with leading inspection and verification firms to closely monitor each supplier's compliance with applicable laws and our vendor code of ethics. 

Distribution Facilities 

We operate and distribute finished products from our owned or leased distribution facilities in the United States, Canada, and Australia. We own our distribution center in Columbus (Ohio), which has approximately 307,000 square feet. The distribution facilities in Sumner (Washington), Vancouver (British Columbia), and Melbourne (Victoria) are leased and are approximately 167,000, 120,000, and 54,000 square feet, respectively. During fiscal 2015, we entered into a new lease for an approximately 156,000 square foot distribution center in Vancouver. We plan to relocate our existing leased distribution center in Vancouver to this premises. We believe our distribution infrastructure will be sufficient to accommodate our expected store growth and expanded product offerings over the next several years. 

We also utilize third-party logistic providers to store and distribute finished products from their warehouse locations in Hong Kong, China, and the Netherlands. 

Competition 

Competition in the athletic apparel industry is principally on the basis of brand image and recognition as well as product quality, innovation, style, distribution, and price. We believe that we successfully compete on the basis of our premium brand image, our focus on women and our technical product innovation. In addition, we believe our vertical retail distribution strategy differentiates us from our competitors and allows us to more effectively control our brand image. 

The market for athletic apparel is highly competitive. It includes increasing competition from established companies that are expanding their production and marketing of performance products, as well as from frequent new entrants to the market. We are in direct competition with wholesalers and direct sellers of athletic apparel, such as Nike, Inc., adidas AG, and Under Armour, Inc. We also compete with retailers specifically focused on women's athletic apparel including The Gap, Inc. (including the Athleta brand), VF Corporation (including the lucy brand), and bebe stores, inc. (including the BEBE SPORT collection). 

Seasonality 

Our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the retail apparel industry. Our annual net revenue is weighted more heavily toward our fourth fiscal quarter, reflecting our historical strength in sales during the holiday season, while our operating expenses are more equally distributed throughout the year. As a result, a substantial portion of our operating profits are generated in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. For example, we generated approximately 45% , 42% , and 39% &#32;of our full year operating profit during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2015 , fiscal 2014 , and fiscal 2013 , respectively. 

Our Employees 

As of January 31, 2016 , we had approximately 11,000 employees, of which 6,500 &#32;were employed in the United States, 3,500 &#32;were employed in Canada, and 1,000 &#32;were employed outside of North America. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages by our employees and we believe our relations with our employees are excellent. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe we own the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of all of our products in the United States, Canada and in the other countries in which our products are currently or intended to be either sold or manufactured. Our major trademarks include lululemon athletica &#38; design, the logo design (WAVE design) and lululemon as a word mark. We own trademark registrations for names of several of our brands, slogans, fabrics, and products including ivivva, ivivva logo (kite design), Luon, Silverescent, Pace Breaker, Rulu, Scuba, Wunder Under, VitaSea, Boolux, Luxtreme, Groove Pant, Stuff Your Bra, Set-My-Ponytail-Free, Define Jacket, Light as Air, Booby Bracer, Ta Ta Tamer, and Power Y. In addition to trademarks, we own 45 industrial design registrations in Canada that protect our distinctive apparel and accessory designs, as well as a number of corresponding design patents in the United States and registered community designs in Europe.
