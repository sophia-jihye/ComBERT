 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Harmony Merger Corp. (the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;we&#8221;) is a blank check company formed on May 21, 2014 for the purpose of entering into a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. The Company&#8217;s efforts in identifying a prospective target business are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region of the world. 

&#160; 

On March 27, 2015, we closed our initial public offering of 11,500,000 units, including 1,500,000 units that were subject to the underwriters&#8217; over-allotment option, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock, par value $.0001 per share (&#8220;Common Stock&#8221;), and one redeemable warrant (&#8220;Warrant&#8221;) entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share commencing on the later of 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination or March 23, 2016. Simultaneous with the consummation of the initial public offering, we consummated the private placement of 558,500 units (&#8220;Private Placement Units&#8221;) at a price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating total proceeds of $5,585,000. The Private Placement Units were purchased by the Initial Stockholders (defined below) and Cantor Fitzgerald &#38; Co., the representative of the underwriters in the initial public offering (&#8220;Cantor&#8221;). 

&#160; 

Competitive Advantages 

&#160; 

We believe our competitive strengths to be the following: 

&#160; 

Status as a Public Company 

&#160; 

We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares in the target business for our shares or for a combination of shares and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us. Furthermore, once the business combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters&#8217; ability to complete the offering as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders&#8217; interests than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company&#8217;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. 

&#160; 

While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a business combination with a more established entity or with a private company. 

&#160; 

Transaction flexibility 

&#160; 

We offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. In addition, we have the ability to offer stock- or cash-based contingency (or earnout) payments which may not be available in other types of transactions. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Management Experience 

&#160; 

We believe that our executive officers and directors possess the experience, skills and contacts necessary to source, evaluate, and execute an attractive business combination. Eric S. Rosenfeld, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has also served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of four prior publicly-held blank check companies: (i) Arpeggio Acquisition Corporation, or Arpeggio, which raised $40.8 million in June 2004 and consummated a business combination with Hill International, Inc., or Hill International, in June 2006, (ii) Rhapsody Acquisition Corp., or Rhapsody, which raised $41.4 million in October 2006 and consummated a business combination with Primoris Corporation, or Primoris, in July 2008, (iii) Trio Merger Corp., or Trio, which raised $69 million in June 2011 and consummated a business combination with SAExploration Holdings Inc., or SAE, in June 2013 and (iv) Quartet Merger Corp., which raised $96.6 million in November 2013 and consummated a business combination with Pangea Logistics Solutions Ltd., or Pangaea, in October 2014. David D. Sgro, our Chief Operating Officer, has also served as Chief Financial Officer of Rhapsody, Trio and Quartet. Additionally, Leonard B. Schlemm, a member of our Board, served as a member of the Board of Arpeggio and Rhapsody, and John P. Schauerman has served as a member of the Board of Quartet. We believe that potential sellers of target businesses will view the fact that our management team has successfully closed four business combinations with vehicles similar to our company as a positive factor in considering whether or not to enter into a business combination with us. However, there is no assurance that we will complete a business combination. 

&#160; 

Effecting a Business Combination 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of Private Placement Units, our share capital, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of the initial public offering and the private placement of Private Placement Units are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination. 

&#160; 

Sources of Target Businesses 

&#160; 

While we have not yet identified any acquisition candidates, we believe based on our management&#8217;s business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous acquisition candidates. We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this annual report and know what types of businesses we are targeting. For instance, the transaction between Primoris and Rhapsody was made possible because an industry professional that was aware of Rhapsody&#8217;s management team and their prior deal with Hill International encouraged Primoris to contact Rhapsody. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. For instance, the Hill International transaction was brought to Eric Rosenfeld as a result of his prior work experience with a member of an investment banking firm that was representing Hill International as it explored strategic alternatives. We may also determine to engage the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on a formal basis (in addition to Canaccord Genuity Inc. who we engaged to provide us with certain financial advisory services at the time of our initial public offering described elsewhere in this annual report), in which event we may pay a finder&#8217;s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm&#8217;s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will any of our existing officers, directors, special advisor or initial stockholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder&#8217;s fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination (regardless of the type of transaction). If we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our officers, directors or initial stockholders, we will do so only if we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm reasonably acceptable to Cantor that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination 

&#160; 

Subject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following: 

&#160;

&#9679; financial condition and results of operation; &#160; &#160; &#9679; growth potential; &#160; &#160; &#9679; brand recognition and potential; &#160; &#160; &#9679; return on equity or invested capital; &#160; &#160; &#9679; market capitalization or enterprise value; &#160; &#160; &#9679; experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; &#160; &#160; &#9679; capital requirements; &#160; &#160; &#9679; competitive position; &#160; &#160; &#9679; barriers to entry; &#160; &#160; &#9679; stage of development of its products, processes or services; &#160; &#160; &#9679; existing distribution and potential for expansion; &#160; &#160; &#9679; degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; &#160; &#160; &#9679; proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for its products, processes, formulas or services; &#160; &#160; &#9679; impact of regulation on the business; &#160; &#160; &#9679; regulatory environment of the industry; &#160; &#160; &#9679; costs associated with effecting the business combination; &#160; &#160; &#9679; industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and &#160; &#160; &#9679; macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes. &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe such factors will be important in evaluating prospective target businesses, regardless of the location or industry in which such target business operates. However, this list is not intended to be exhaustive. Furthermore, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines. 

&#160; 

Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties. 

&#160; 

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination. 

&#160; 

Fair Market Value of Target Business 

&#160; 

Pursuant to NASDAQ listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting fees and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Lack of Business Diversification 

&#160; 

Our business combination must be with a target business or businesses that collectively satisfy the minimum valuation standard at the time of such acquisition, as discussed above, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses at the same time. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may: 

&#160; 

&#9679; subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and &#160; &#160; &#9679; result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. &#160; 

If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business. 

&#160; 

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business&#8217; Management 

&#160; 

Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business&#8217; management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business. 

&#160; 

Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management. 

&#160; 

Stockholder Approval of Business Combination 

In connection with any proposed business combination, we will seek stockholder approval of an initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. The amount in the trust account as of December 31, 2015 was $10.21 per share sold in our initial public offering. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. 

&#160; 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, such condition may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until March 27, 2017 in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account. 

&#160; 

Our stockholders prior to our initial public offering, or &#8220;initial stockholders,&#8221; and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination and (2) not to convert any shares owned by them prior to our initial public offering, or &#8220;insider shares,&#8221; in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-business combination activity. Additionally, Eric S. Rosenfeld, our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to enter into an agreement in accordance with the guidelines of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, pursuant to which he will place limit orders for an aggregate of up to $500,000 of our common stock, or &#8220;buyback shares,&#8221; as described in more detail in this annual report. Any buyback shares purchased by Mr. Rosenfeld pursuant to this arrangement will be voted in favor of the proposed business combination, thereby further reducing the number of public shares needed to be voted in favor of a business combination to have it approved. 

&#160; 

If we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates could purchase shares in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company&#8217;s stock. 

&#160; 

Conversion Rights 

&#160; 

At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders (including NPIC Limited, DKU 2013 LLC, The K2 Principal Fund L.P., Covalent Capital Partners Master Fund, L.P. and Halcyon Master Fund L.P. but not our other initial stockholders) may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, for a pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. A holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares. 

&#160; 

Our initial stockholders have agreed not to convert any insider shares or shares included in the Private Placement Units, or &#8220;private shares,&#8221; for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination. Additionally, each initial stockholder other than NPIC Limited, DKU 2013 LLC, The K2 Principal Fund L.P., Covalent Capital Partners Master Fund, L.P. and Halcyon Master Fund L.P. has agreed not to convert any shares sold in the initial public offering, or &#8220;public shares,&#8221; they hold for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination. NPIC Limited, DKU 2013 LLC, The K2 Principal Fund L.P., Covalent Capital Partners Master Fund, L.P. and Halcyon Master Fund L.P. would be allowed to convert any public shares they purchase in our initial public offering or in the aftermarket for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a &#8220;group&#8221; (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to 20% or more of the shares of common stock. Accordingly, all shares in excess of 20% of the shares of common stock held by a holder will not be converted for cash. We believe this restriction will prevent stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares before the vote held to approve a proposed business combination and attempt to use the conversion right as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then current market price. By limiting a stockholder&#8217;s ability to convert no more than 20% of the shares of common stock, we believe we have limited the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block a transaction which is favored by our other public stockholders. 

&#160; 

Our initial stockholders will not have conversion rights with respect to any insider shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly. 

&#160; 

We may also require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in &#8220;street name,&#8221; to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time through the vote on the business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company&#8217;s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&#8217;s option. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under Delaware law and our bylaws, we are required to provide at least 10 days advance notice of any stockholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a stockholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. 

&#160; 

There is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to tender their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to stockholders. 

&#160; 

Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). 

&#160; 

If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders. 

&#160; 

Liquidation if No Business Combination 

&#160; 

If we do not complete a business combination by March 27, 2017, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In connection with our redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes payable on such funds (subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors). At such time, the warrants will expire, holder of warrants will receive nothing upon a liquidation with respect to such warrants and the warrants will be worthless. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&#8217;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the prescribed time frame, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders&#8217; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our March 27, 2017 deadline and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date. 

&#160; 

Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. 

&#160; 

We will seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage) and any prospective target businesses enter into valid and enforceable agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, there is no guarantee that vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. In the event that a potential contracted party was to refuse to execute such a waiver, we will execute an agreement with that entity only if our management first determines that we would be unable to obtain, on a reasonable basis, substantially similar services or opportunities from another entity willing to execute such a waiver. Examples of instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver would be the engagement of a third party consultant who cannot sign such an agreement due to regulatory restrictions, such as our auditors who are unable to sign due to independence requirements, the underwriters, who have not waived their rights to indemnification provided by us under the underwriting agreement, or other third parties whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or a situation in which management does not believe it would be able to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. There is also no guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Eric S. Rosenfeld has agreed that he will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. We have not independently verified whether Mr. Rosenfeld has sufficient funds to satisfy these indemnity obligations. Accordingly, he may not be able to satisfy his indemnification obligations if he is required to so as we have not required Mr. Rosenfeld to retain any assets to provide for his indemnification obligations, nor have we taken any further steps to ensure that he will be able to satisfy any indemnification obligations that arise. Additionally the agreement entered into by Mr. Rosenfeld specifically provides that he will have no personal liability as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed a valid and enforceable agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against Mr. Rosenfeld to enforce his indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Moreover, he will not be personally liable to our public stockholders and instead will only have liability to us. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.20 due to claims or potential claims of creditors. We will distribute to all of our public stockholders, in proportion to their respective equity interests, an aggregate sum equal to the amount then held in the trust account, inclusive of any interest not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations, plus any remaining net assets (subject to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors as described below).

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after such date and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. Our initial stockholders have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to their insider shares and private shares. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Mr. Rosenfeld has agreed to pay the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. 

&#160; 

If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination and are forced to redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, each holder will receive a full pro rata portion of the amount then in the trust account, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not released to us to pay our taxes. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders. 

&#160; 

Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete our initial business combination in the required time period or if the stockholders seek to have us convert their respective shares of common stock upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders&#8217; rights or pre-business combination activity (including the time within which we have to complete a business combination). In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. 

&#160; 

If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.20 per share. 

&#160; 

If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a &#8220;preferential transfer&#8221; or a &#8220;fraudulent conveyance.&#8221; As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after March 27, 2017, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. Claims may be brought against us for these reasons. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. Our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources. 

&#160; 

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses: 

&#160;

&#9679; our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination may delay the completion of a transaction; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our obligation to convert shares of common stock held by our public stockholders (including NPIC Limited, DKU 2013 LLC, The K2 Principal Fund L.P., Covalent Capital Partners Master Fund, L.P. and Halcyon Master Fund L.P. but not our other initial stockholders) may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; &#160; &#160; &#9679; NASDAQ may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our obligation to pay a deferred underwriting fee of $4,325,000; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our obligation to either repay or issue Private Placement Units upon conversion of up to $500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates; &#160; &#160; &#9679; our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the Private Placement Units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and &#160; &#160; &#9679; the impact on the target business&#8217; assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination. &#160;

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms. 

&#160; 

If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

We have three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect each of our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
