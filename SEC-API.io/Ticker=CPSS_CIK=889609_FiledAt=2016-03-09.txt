Overview

&#160;

We are a specialty finance company. Our business is to purchase and service retail automobile contracts originated primarily by franchised automobile dealers and, to a lesser extent, by select independent dealers in the United States in the sale of new and used automobiles, light trucks and passenger vans. Through our automobile contract purchases, we provide indirect financing to the customers of dealers who have limited credit histories or past credit problems, who we refer to as sub-prime customers. We serve as an alternative source of financing for dealers, facilitating sales to customers who otherwise might not be able to obtain financing from traditional sources, such as commercial banks, credit unions and the captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. In addition to purchasing installment purchase contracts directly from dealers, we have also acquired installment purchase contracts in four merger and acquisition transactions, and purchased or originated immaterial amounts of loans secured by vehicles. In this report, we refer to all of such contracts and loans as &#34;automobile contracts.&#34;

&#160;

We were incorporated and began our operations in March 1991. We consist of Consumer Portfolio Services, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively, &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;CPS&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221;). From inception through December 31, 2015, we have purchased a total of approximately $12.4 billion of automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, we acquired a total of approximately $822.3 million of automobile contracts in mergers and acquisitions in 2002, 2003, 2004 and, most recently in September 2011. The September 2011 acquisition consisted of approximately $217.8 million of automobile contracts that we purchased from Fireside Bank of Pleasanton, California. In 2004 and 2009, we were appointed as a third-party servicer for certain portfolios of automobile contracts originated and owned by non-affiliated entities. From 2008 through 2010, our managed portfolio decreased each year due to our strategy of limiting contract purchases to conserve our liquidity during the financial crisis and resulting recession, as discussed further below. However, since October 2009, we have gradually increased contract purchases, which, in turn, has resulted in increases in our managed portfolio. Contract purchase volumes and managed portfolio levels for the five years ended December 31, 2015 are shown in the table below:

Our principal executive offices are in Las Vegas, Nevada. Most of our operational and administrative functions take place in Irvine, California. Credit and underwriting functions are performed primarily in our California branch with certain of these functions also performed in our Florida and Nevada branches. We service our automobile contracts from our California, Nevada, Virginia, Florida and Illinois branches.

&#160; 

We direct our marketing efforts primarily to dealers, rather than to consumers. We establish relationships with dealers through our employee marketing representatives, who contact prospective dealers to explain our automobile contract purchase programs, and thereafter provide dealer training and support services. Our marketing representatives represent us exclusively. They may be located in our Irvine branch, in our Las Vegas branch, or in the field, in which case they work from their homes and support dealers in their geographic area. Our marketing representatives present dealers with a marketing package, which includes our promotional material containing the terms offered by us for the purchase of automobile contracts, a copy of our standard-form dealer agreement, and required documentation relating to automobile contracts. As of December 31, 2015, we had 109 marketing representatives and in that month we received applications from 7,941 dealers in 47 states. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 67% of our active dealers were franchised new car dealers that sell both new and used vehicles, and the remainder were independent used car dealers. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 78% of the automobile contracts purchased under our programs consisted of financing for used cars and 22% consisted of financing for new cars, as compared to 84% financing for used cars and 16% for new cars in the year ended December 31, 2014.

&#160;

&#160;

We purchase automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations. Securitizations are transactions in which we sell a specified pool of contracts to a special purpose subsidiary of ours. The subsidiary in turn issues (or contributes to a trust that issues) asset-backed securities, which are purchased by institutional investors. Since 1994, we have completed 68 term securitizations of approximately $10.2 billion in contracts. We depend upon the availability of short-term warehouse credit facilities as interim financing for our contract purchases prior to the time we pool those contracts for a securitization. From February 2011 through October 2015 we maintained two $100 million revolving warehouse credit facilities. In November 2015 we added a third $100 million facility.

&#160;

Sub-Prime Auto Finance Industry

&#160;

Automobile financing is the second largest consumer finance market in the United States. The automobile finance industry can be considered a continuum where participants choose to provide financing to consumers in various segments of the spectrum of creditworthiness depending on each participant&#8217;s business strategy. We operate in a segment of the spectrum that is frequently referred to as sub-prime since we provide financing to less credit-worthy borrowers at higher rates of interest than more credit-worthy borrowers are likely to obtain.

&#160;

Traditional automobile finance companies, such as banks, their subsidiaries, credit unions and captive finance subsidiaries of automobile manufacturers, generally lend to the most creditworthy, or so-called prime, borrowers, although some traditional lenders are significant participants in the sub-prime segment in which we operate. Historically, independent companies specializing in sub-prime automobile financing and subsidiaries of larger financial services companies have competed in the sub-prime segment which we believe remains highly fragmented, with no single company having a dominant position in the market.

&#160;

Economic conditions of uncertainty have from time to time negatively affected our industry. Notably, and most recently, throughout 2008 and 2009 there was reduced demand for asset-backed securities secured by consumer finance receivables, including sub-prime automobile receivables. Over roughly that same period, lenders who previously provided short-term warehouse financing for sub-prime automobile finance companies such as ours were reluctant to provide such short-term financing due to the uncertainty regarding the prospects of obtaining long-term financing through the issuance of asset-backed securities. In addition, many capital market participants such as investment banks, financial guaranty providers and institutional investors who previously played a role in the sub-prime auto finance industry withdrew from the industry, or in some cases, ceased to do business. Finally, broad economic weakness and high levels of unemployment during 2008, 2009 and thereafter caused many of the obligors under our receivables to be less willing or able to pay, resulting in higher delinquencies, charge-offs and losses. Each of these factors adversely affected our results of operations in the period 2008 through 2011. Since October 2009, however, improvements in the capital markets have allowed us to obtain new short-term credit facilities, and to regularly access long-term funding through the issuance of asset-backed securities.

&#160;

Our Operations

&#160;

Our automobile financing programs are designed to serve sub-prime customers, who generally have limited credit histories or past credit problems. Because we serve customers who are unable to meet certain credit standards, we incur greater risks, and generally receive interest rates higher than those charged in the prime credit market. We also sustain a higher level of credit losses because of the higher risk customers we serve.

&#160;

Originations

&#160;

When a retail automobile buyer elects to obtain financing from a dealer, the dealer takes a credit application to submit to its financing sources. Typically, a dealer will submit the buyer's application to more than one financing source for review. We believe the dealer&#8217;s decision to choose a financing source is based primarily on: (i) the interest rate and monthly payment made available to the dealer's customer; (ii) any fees to be charged to (or paid to) the dealer by the financing source; (iii) the timeliness, consistency and predictability of response; (iv) funding turnaround time; (v) any conditions to purchase; and (vi) the financial stability of the financing source. Dealers can send credit applications to us by entering the necessary data on our website or through one of two third-party application aggregators. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we received approximately 78% of all applications through DealerTrack (the industry leading dealership application aggregator), 3% via our website and 19% via another aggregator, Route One. Our automated application decisioning system produced our initial decision within seconds on approximately 98% of those applications.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Upon receipt of information from a dealer, we immediately order two credit reports to document the buyer's credit history. If, upon review by our proprietary automated decisioning system, or in some cases, one of our credit analysts, we determine that the automobile contract meets our underwriting criteria, we advise the dealer of our decision to approve the contract and the terms under which we will purchase it. In some cases where we don&#8217;t grant an approval, we may suggest alternatives from the terms proposed by the dealer or request and review further information from the dealer.

&#160;

Dealers with which we do business are under no obligation to submit any automobile contracts to us, nor are we obligated to purchase any automobile contracts from them. During the year ended December 31, 2015, no dealer accounted for more than 0.75% of the total number of automobile contracts we purchased. The following table sets forth the geographical sources of the automobile contracts we purchased (based on the addresses of the customers as stated on our records) during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

We purchase automobile contracts from dealers at a price generally computed as the total amount financed under the automobile contracts, adjusted for an acquisition fee, which may either increase or decrease the automobile contract purchase price we pay. The amount of the acquisition fee, and whether it results in an increase or decrease to the automobile contract purchase price, is based on the perceived credit risk of and, in some cases, the interest rate on the automobile contract. The following table summarizes the average net acquisition fees we charged dealers and the weighted average annual percentage rate on our purchased contracts for the periods shown:

We believe that levels of acquisition fees are determined partially by competition in the marketplace, which has increased over the periods presented, and also by our pricing strategy. Our pricing strategy is driven by our objectives for new contract purchase quantities and yield.

&#160;

We offer eight different financing programs to our dealership customers, and price each program according to the relative credit risk. Our programs cover a wide band of the credit spectrum and are labeled as follows:

&#160;

Bravo - this program accommodates an applicant with significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. Advance rates are lowest of all of our programs to offset the greater risk. To offset the low up-front advance to the dealer, we agree to pay the dealer a portion of future payments we receive from the obligor, depending on loan performance. The Bravo program was introduced in November of 2015 and as of December 31, 2015, only a few such contracts have been acquired.

&#160;

First Time Buyer &#8211; This program accommodates an applicant who has limited significant past credit history, such as a previous auto loan. Since the applicant has limited credit history, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs.

&#160;

Mercury / Delta &#8211; This program accommodates an applicant who may have had significant past non-performing credit including recent derogatory credit. As a result, the contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees tend to be higher, and the loan amount, loan-to-value ratio, down payment, and payment-to-income ratio requirements tend to be more restrictive compared to our other programs.

&#160;

Standard &#8211; This program accommodates an applicant who may have significant past non-performing credit, but who has also exhibited some performing credit in their history. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are comparable to the First Time Buyer and Mercury/Delta programs, but the loan amount and loan-to-value ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive.

&#160;

Alpha &#8211; This program accommodates applicants who may have a discharged bankruptcy, but who have also exhibited performing credit. In addition, the program allows for homeowners who may have had other significant non-performing credit in the past. The contract interest rate and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Standard program, down payment and payment-to-income ratio requirements are somewhat less restrictive.

&#160;

Alpha Plus &#8211; This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a stronger history of recent performing credit, such as auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower than the Alpha program.

&#160;

Super Alpha &#8211; This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but with a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit, including auto or mortgage related credit, and higher incomes than the Alpha Plus program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher, than the Alpha Plus program.

&#160;

Preferred - This program accommodates applicants with past non-performing credit, but who demonstrate a somewhat stronger history of recent performing credit than the Super Alpha program. Contract interest rates and dealer acquisition fees are lower, and the maximum loan amount is somewhat higher than the Super Alpha program.

&#160;

Our upper credit tier products, which are our Preferred, Super Alpha, Alpha Plus and Alpha programs, accounted for approximately 77% of our new contract originations in 2015, 74% in 2014 and 74% in 2013, measured by aggregate amount financed.

We attempt to control misrepresentation regarding the customer's credit worthiness by carefully screening the automobile contracts we purchase, by establishing and maintaining professional business relationships with dealers, and by including certain representations and warranties by the dealer in the dealer agreement. Pursuant to the dealer agreement, we may require the dealer to repurchase any automobile contract in the event that the dealer breaches its representations or warranties. There can be no assurance, however, that any dealer will have the willingness or the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations to us.

&#160;

In addition to our purchases of installment contracts from dealers, we purchased from 2006 through 2008 an immaterial number of vehicle purchase money loans, evidenced by promissory notes and security agreements. A non-affiliated lender originated all such loans directly to vehicle purchasers, and sold the loans to us. We began financing vehicle purchases by lending money directly to consumers in January 2008, on terms similar to those that we offered through dealers, though without a down payment requirement and with more restrictive loan-to-value and credit score requirements. In October 2008 we suspended purchases of loans from other lenders and direct lending to consumers. In April of 2015, we re-established our platform for direct lending to consumers and originated $1.5 million of such loans during 2015.

&#160;

In 2012, we initiated a program to make direct loans secured by automobiles to consumers who own their vehicles. As of December 31, 2015 our managed portfolio includes $1.6 million of such loans.

&#160;

Underwriting

&#160;

To be eligible for purchase, we require that the automobile contract be originated by a dealer that has entered into a dealer agreement with us. The automobile contract must be secured by a first priority lien on a new or used automobile, light truck or passenger van and must meet our underwriting criteria. In addition, each automobile contract requires the customer to maintain physical damage insurance covering the financed vehicle and naming us as a loss payee. We may, nonetheless, suffer a loss upon theft or physical damage of any financed vehicle if the customer fails to maintain insurance as required by the automobile contract and is unable to pay for repairs to or replacement of the vehicle.

&#160;

We believe that our underwriting criteria enable us to evaluate effectively the creditworthiness of sub-prime customers and the adequacy of the financed vehicle as security for an automobile contract. The underwriting criteria include standards for price, term, amount of down payment, installment payment and interest rate; mileage, age and type of vehicle; principal amount of the automobile contract in relation to the value of the vehicle; customer income level, employment and residence stability, credit history and debt service ability, as well as other factors. Specifically, our underwriting guidelines generally limit the maximum principal amount of a purchased automobile contract to 115% of wholesale book value in the case of used vehicles or to 115% of the manufacturer's invoice in the case of new vehicles, plus, in each case, sales tax, licensing and, when the customer purchases such additional items, a service contract or a policy to supplement the customer&#8217;s casualty policy in the event of a total loss of the related vehicle. We generally do not finance vehicles that are more than 11 model years old or have in excess of 150,000 miles. The maximum term of a purchased contract is 72 months, although we consider the loan to value and mileage as significant factors in determining the maximum term of a contract. Automobile contract purchase criteria are subject to change from time to time as circumstances may warrant. Prior to purchasing an automobile contract, our underwriters verify the customer's employment, income, residency, insurance coverage, and credit information by contacting various parties noted on the customer's application, credit information bureaus and other sources. In addition, we contact each customer by telephone to confirm that the customer understands and agrees to the terms of the related automobile contract. During this &#34; welcome call, &#34; we also ask the customer a series of open ended questions about his application and the contract, which may uncover potential misrepresentations.

&#160;

&#160;

Credit Scoring . We use proprietary scoring models to assign each automobile contract several &#34;credit scores&#34; at the time the application is received from the dealer and the customer's credit information is retrieved from the credit reporting agencies. These proprietary scores are used to help determine whether or not we want to approve the application and, if so, the program and pricing we will offer to the dealer. The credit scores are based on a variety of parameters including the customer's credit history, residence stability and total income. Once a vehicle is selected by the customer and a proposed deal structure is provided to us by the dealer, our scores will then consider various deal structure parameters such as down payment amount and the make and mileage of the vehicle. We have developed the credit scores utilizing statistical risk management techniques and historical performance data from our managed portfolio. We believe this improves our allocation of credit evaluation resources, enhances our competitiveness in the marketplace and manages the risk inherent in the sub-prime market.

&#160;

Characteristics of Contracts. All of the automobile contracts we purchase are fully amortizing and provide for level payments over the term of the automobile contract. All automobile contracts may be prepaid at any time without penalty. The average original principal amount financed under the CPS programs in 2015 was $16,447, with an average original term of 65 months and an average down payment amount of 11.3%. Based on information contained in customer applications for this 12-month period, the retail purchase price of the related automobiles averaged $16,377 (which excludes tax, license fees and any additional costs such as a service contract) and the average age of the vehicle at the time the automobile contract was purchased was five years. The average age of our customers is approximately 43, with approximately $54,000 in average annual household income and an average of six years tenure with his or her current employer.

&#160;

Dealer Compliance . The dealer agreement and related assignment contain representations and warranties by the dealer that an application for state registration of each financed vehicle, naming us as secured party with respect to the vehicle, was effected by the time of sale of the related automobile contract to us, and that all necessary steps have been taken to obtain a perfected first priority security interest in each financed vehicle in favor of us under the laws of the state in which the financed vehicle is registered. To the extent that we do not receive such state registration within three months of purchasing the automobile contract, our dealer compliance group will work with the dealer in an attempt to rectify the situation. If these efforts are unsuccessful, we generally will require the dealer to repurchase the automobile contract.

&#160;

Servicing and Collection

&#160;

We currently service all automobile contracts that we own as well as those automobile contracts that are included in portfolios that we have sold in securitizations or service for third parties. We organize our servicing activities based on the tasks performed by our personnel. Our servicing activities consist of mailing monthly billing statements; collecting, accounting for and posting of all payments received; responding to customer inquiries; taking all necessary action to maintain the security interest granted in the financed vehicle or other collateral; investigating delinquencies; communicating with the customer to obtain timely payments; repossessing and liquidating the collateral when necessary; collecting deficiency balances; and generally monitoring each automobile contract and the related collateral. We are typically entitled to receive a base monthly servicing fee equal to 2.5% per annum computed as a percentage of the declining outstanding principal balance of the non-charged-off automobile contracts in the securitization pools . The servicing fee is included in interest income for those securitization transactions that are treated as financings.

&#160;

Collection Procedures. We believe that our ability to monitor performance and collect payments owed from sub-prime customers is primarily a function of our collection approach and support systems. We believe that if payment problems are identified early and our collection staff works closely with customers to address these problems, it is possible to correct many problems before they deteriorate further. To this end, we utilize pro-active collection procedures, which include making early and frequent contact with delinquent customers; educating customers as to the importance of maintaining good credit; and employing a consultative and customer service approach to assist the customer in meeting his or her obligations, which includes attempting to identify the underlying causes of delinquency and cure them whenever possible. In support of our collection activities, we maintain a computerized collection system specifically designed to service automobile contracts with sub-prime customers and similar consumer obligations.

&#160;

We attempt to make telephonic contact with delinquent customers from one to 15 days after their monthly payment due date, depending on our proprietary behavioral scorecards which assess the customer&#8217;s likelihood of payment during early stages of delinquency. Our contact priorities may be based on the customers' physical location, stage of delinquency, size of balance or other parameters. Our collectors inquire of the customer the reason for the delinquency and when we can expect to receive the payment. The collector will attempt to get the customer to make an electronic payment over the phone or a promise for the payment for a time generally not to exceed one week from the date of the call. If the customer makes such a promise, the account is routed to a promise queue and is not contacted until the outcome of the promise is known. If the payment is made by the promise date and the account is no longer delinquent, the account is routed out of the collection system. If the payment is not made, or if the payment is made, but the account remains delinquent, the account is returned to the queue for subsequent contacts.

&#160;

&#160; 6 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If a customer fails to make or keep promises for payments, or if the customer is uncooperative or attempts to evade contact or hide the vehicle, a supervisor will review the collection activity relating to the account to determine if repossession of the vehicle is warranted. Generally, such a decision will occur between the 60th and 90th day past the customer's payment due date, but could occur sooner or later, depending on the specific circumstances. At the time the vehicle is repossessed we will stop accruing interest on this automobile contract, and reclassify the remaining automobile contract balance to other assets. In addition we will apply a specific reserve to this automobile contract so that the net balance represents the estimated fair value less costs to sell.

&#160;

If we elect to repossess the vehicle, we assign the task to an independent local repossession service. Such services are licensed and/or bonded as required by law. When the vehicle is recovered, the repossession service delivers it to a wholesale automobile auction, where it is kept until sold. Financed vehicles that have been repossessed are generally resold through unaffiliated automobile auctions, which are attended principally by car dealers. Net liquidation proceeds are applied to the customer's outstanding obligation under the automobile contract. Such proceeds usually are insufficient to pay the customer's obligation in full, resulting in a deficiency. In most cases we will continue to contact our customers to recover all or a portion of this deficiency for up to several years after charge-off. From time to time, we sell certain charged off accounts to unaffiliated purchasers who specialize in collecting such accounts.

&#160;

Once an automobile contract becomes greater than 90 days delinquent, we do not recognize additional interest income until the borrower makes sufficient payments to be less than 90 days delinquent. Any payments received by a borrower that are greater than 90 days delinquent are first applied to accrued interest and then to principal reduction.

&#160;

We generally charge off the balance of any contract by the earlier of the end of the month in which the automobile contract becomes five scheduled installments past due or, in the case of repossessions, the month that after we receive the proceeds from the liquidation of the financed vehicle or if the vehicle has been in repossession inventory for more than three months. In the case of repossession, the amount of the charge-off is the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the defaulted automobile contract and the net repossession sale proceeds.

&#160;

Credit Experience

&#160;

Our primary method of monitoring ongoing credit quality of our portfolio is to closely review monthly delinquency, default and net charge off activity and the related trends. Our internal credit performance data consistently show that new receivables have lower levels of delinquency and losses early in their lives, with delinquencies increasing throughout their lives and losses gradually increasing to a peak between 36 and 42 months, after which they gradually decrease. The weighted average seasoning of our total owned portfolio, represented in the tables below, was 16 months, 14 months and 14 months as of December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively. Our financial results are dependent on the performance of the automobile contracts in which we retain an ownership interest. Broad economic factors such as recession and significant changes in unemployment levels influence the credit performance of our portfolio, as does the weighted average age of the receivables at any given time. In addition, in June 2014 we became subject to a consent decree that required that we implement procedural changes in our servicing practices, which changes may have contributed to somewhat higher delinquencies, extensions and net losses compared to prior periods. The tables below document the delinquency, repossession and net credit loss experience of all such automobile contracts that we were servicing as of the respective dates shown. The tables do not include the experience of third party servicing portfolios.

The information in the table represents the gross principal amount of all automobile contracts we purchased, including automobile contracts we subsequently sold in securitization transactions that we continue to service. The table does not include certain contracts we have serviced for third-parties on which we earn servicing fees only, and have no credit risk. (2) We consider an automobile contract delinquent when an obligor fails to make at least 90% of a contractually due payment by the following due date, which date may have been extended within limits specified in the servicing agreements. The period of delinquency is based on the number of days payments are contractually past due. Automobile contracts less than 31 days delinquent are not included. The delinquency aging categories shown in the tables reflect the effect of extensions. (3) Amount in repossession represents the contract balance on financed vehicles that have been repossessed but not yet liquidated. (4) Accounts past due more than 90 days are on non-accrual. &#160;

(1) All amounts and percentages are based on the principal amount scheduled to be paid on each automobile contract contracts. The information in the table represents all automobile contracts we service, excluding certain contracts we have serviced for third-parties on which we earn servicing fees only, and have no credit risk. (2) Net charge-offs include the remaining principal balance, after the application of the net proceeds from the liquidation of the vehicle (excluding accrued and unpaid interest) and amounts collected subsequent to the date of charge-off, including some recoveries which have been classified as other income in the accompanying financial statements. &#160; 

Extensions 

&#160; 

In certain circumstances we will grant obligors one-month payment extensions to assist them with temporary cash flow problems. In general, an obligor would not be entitled to more than two such extensions in any 12-month period and no more than six over the life of the contract. The only modification of terms is to advance the obligor&#8217;s next due date by one month and extend the maturity date of the receivable by one month. In some cases, a two-month extension may be granted. There are no other concessions such as a reduction in interest rate, forgiveness of principal or of accrued interest. Accordingly, we consider such extensions to be insignificant delays in payments rather than troubled debt restructurings.

&#160;

The basic question in deciding to grant an extension is whether or not we will (a) be delaying an inevitable repossession and liquidation or (b) risk losing the vehicle as a result of not being able to locate the obligor and vehicle. In both of those situations, the loss would likely be higher than if the vehicle had been repossessed without the extension. The benefits of granting an extension include minimizing current losses and delinquencies, minimizing lifetime losses, getting the obligor&#8217;s account current (or close to it) and building goodwill with the obligor so that he might prioritize us over other creditors on future payments. Our servicing staff are trained to identify when a past due obligor is facing a temporary problem that may be resolved with an extension. In most cases, the extension will be granted in conjunction with our receiving a past due payment (and where allowed by law, a nominal fee) from the obligor, thereby indicating an additional monetary and psychological commitment to the contract on the obligor&#8217;s part. Fees collected in conjunction with an extension are credited to obligors&#8217; outstanding accrued interest.

&#160;

The credit assessment for granting an extension is initially made by our collector, who bases the recommendation on the collector&#8217;s discussions with the obligor. In such assessments the collector will consider, among other things, the following factors: (1) the reason the obligor has fallen behind in payments; (2) whether or not the reason for the delinquency is temporary, and if it is, have conditions changed such that the obligor can begin making regular monthly payments again after the extension; (3) the obligor's past payment history, including past extensions if applicable; and (4) the obligor&#8217;s willingness to communicate and cooperate on resolving the delinquency. If the collector believes the obligor is a good candidate for an extension, he must obtain approval from his supervisor, who will review the same factors stated above prior to offering the extension to the obligor. After receiving an extension, an account remains subject to our normal policies and procedures for interest accrual, reporting delinquency and recognizing charge-offs.

We believe that a prudent extension program is an integral component to mitigating losses in our portfolio of sub-prime automobile receivables. The table below summarizes the status, as of December 31, 2015, for accounts that received extensions from 2008 through 2014:

We view these results as a confirmation of the effectiveness of our extension program. We consider accounts that have had extensions and were active or paid off at December 31, 2015 to be successful. Successful extensions result in continued payments of interest and principal (including payment in full in many cases). Without the extension, however, we would have likely incurred a substantial loss and no additional interest revenue.

&#160;

For extension accounts that ultimately charged off, we consider accounts that charged off more than six months after the extension to be at least partially successful. In such cases, in spite of the ultimate loss, we received additional payments of principal and interest that otherwise we would not have received.

&#160;

Non-Accrual Receivables 

&#160; 

It is not uncommon for our obligors to fall behind in their payments. However, with the diligent efforts of our servicing staff and systems for managing our collection efforts, we regularly work with our customers to resolve delinquencies. Our staff is trained to employ a counseling approach to assist our customers with their cash flow management skills and help them to prioritize their payment obligations in order to avoid losing their vehicle to repossession. Through our experience, we have learned that once a contract becomes greater than 90 days past due, it is more likely than not that the delinquency will not be resolved and will ultimately result in a charge-off. As a result, we do not recognize any interest income for contracts that are greater than 90 days past due.

&#160;

If an obligor exceeds the 90 days past due threshold at the end of one period, and then makes the necessary payments such that it becomes equal to or below 90 days delinquent at the end of a subsequent period, the related contract would be restored to full accrual status for our financial reporting purposes. At the time a contract is restored to full accrual in this manner, there can be no assurance that full repayment of interest and principal will ultimately be made. However, we monitor each obligor&#8217;s payment performance and are aware of the severity of his delinquency at any time. The fact that the delinquency has been reduced below the 90-day threshold is a positive indicator. Should the contract again exceed the 90-day delinquency level at the end of any reporting period, it would again be reflected as a non-accrual account.

&#160;

Our policy for placing a contract on non-accrual status is independent of our policy to grant an extension. In practice, it would be an uncommon circumstance where an extension was granted and the account remained in a non-accrual status, since the goal of the extension is to bring the contract current (or nearly current).

Securitization of Automobile Contracts

&#160;

Throughout the period for which information is presented in this report, we have purchased automobile contracts with the intention of financing them on a long-term basis through securitizations, and on an interim basis through warehouse credit facilities. All such financings have involved identification of specific automobile contracts, sale of those automobile contracts (and associated rights) to one of our special-purpose subsidiaries, and issuance of asset-backed securities to be purchased by institutional investors. Depending on the structure, these transactions may be accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles as sales of the automobile contracts or as secured financings.

&#160;

When structured to be treated as a secured financing for accounting purposes, the subsidiary is consolidated with us. Accordingly, the sold automobile contracts and the related debt appear as assets and liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. We then periodically (i) recognize interest and fee income on the contracts, (ii) recognize interest expense on the securities issued in the transaction and (iii) record as expense a provision for credit losses on the contracts.

&#160;

Since 1994 we have conducted 68 term securitizations of automobile contracts that we purchased from dealers under our regular programs. As of December 31, 2015, 18 of those securitizations are active and all but one are structured as secured financings. The exception is our September 2010 transaction, which is structured as a sale of the related contracts. From 1994 through April 2008 we generally utilized financial guarantees for the senior asset-backed notes issued in the securitization. Since September 2010 we have utilized senior subordinated structures without any financial guarantees. We have generally conducted our securitizations on a quarterly basis, near the end of each calendar quarter, resulting in four securitizations per calendar year. In recent years, we have found that the securitizations we conducted in December of those years, had a tendency toward less investor demand in the related bonds than the securitizations we conducted in other times of the year. As a result, in 2015, we elected to defer what would have been our December securitization in favor of a securitization in January 2016.

&#160;

Our history of term securitizations, over the most recent ten years, is summarized in the table below:

&#160;

Recent Asset-Backed Term Securitizations

From time to time we have also completed financings of our residual interests in other securitizations that we and our affiliates previously sponsored. As of December 31, 2015 we have one such residual interest financing outstanding.

&#160;

Since December 2011, our securitizations have included a pre-funding feature in which a portion of the receivables to be sold to the securitization trust were not delivered until after the initial closing. As a result, our restricted cash balance at December 31, 2014 included $85.3 million from the proceeds of the sale of the asset-backed notes that were held by a trustee pending delivery of the remaining receivables. In January 2015, the requisite additional receivables were delivered to the securitization trust and we received the related restricted cash, most of which was used to repay amounts owed under our warehouse credit facilities. Since we did not do a securitization in December of 2015, there was no related amount of restricted cash representing the pre-funding proceeds.

&#160;

Generally, prior to a securitization transaction we fund our automobile contract purchases primarily with proceeds from warehouse credit facilities. Our current short-term funding capacity is $300 million, comprising three credit facilities. The first $100 million credit facility was established in May 2012. This facility was renewed in August 2014, extending the revolving period to August 2016, and adding an amortization period through August 2017. In April 2015, we entered into a new $100 million facility with a revolving period extending to April 2017 followed by an amortization period to April 2019. In November 2015, we entered into a third $100 million facility, which has a revolving period extending to November 2017, followed by an amortization period to November 2019.

&#160;

&#160; 12 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In a securitization and in our warehouse credit facilities, we are required to make certain representations and warranties, which are generally similar to the representations and warranties made by dealers in connection with our purchase of the automobile contracts. If we breach any of our representations or warranties, we may be required to repurchase the automobile contract at a price equal to the principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest. We may then be entitled under the terms of our dealer agreement to require the selling dealer to repurchase the contract at a price equal to our purchase price, less any principal payments made by the customer. Subject to any recourse against dealers, we will bear the risk of loss on repossession and resale of vehicles under automobile contracts that we repurchase.

&#160;

Whether a securitization is treated as a secured financing or as a sale for financial accounting purposes, the related special purpose subsidiary may be unable to release excess cash to us if the credit performance of the securitized automobile contracts falls short of pre-determined standards. Such releases represent a material portion of the cash that we use to fund our operations. An unexpected deterioration in the performance of securitized automobile contracts could therefore have a material adverse effect on both our liquidity and results of operations, regardless of whether such automobile contracts are treated as having been sold or as having been financed.

&#160;

Certain of our securitization transactions and our warehouse credit facilities contain various financial covenants requiring certain minimum financial ratios and results. Such covenants include maintaining minimum levels of liquidity and net worth and not exceeding maximum leverage levels. In addition, certain securitization and non-securitization related debt contain cross-default provisions that would allow certain creditors to declare a default if a default occurred under a different facility. As of December 31, 2015 we were in compliance with all such covenants.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

The automobile financing business is highly competitive. We compete with a number of national, regional and local finance companies with operations similar to ours. In addition, competitors or potential competitors include other types of financial services companies, such as banks, leasing companies, credit unions providing retail loan financing and lease financing for new and used vehicles, and captive finance companies affiliated with major automobile manufacturers. Many of our competitors and potential competitors possess substantially greater financial, marketing, technical, personnel and other resources than we do. Moreover, our future profitability will be directly related to the availability and cost of our capital in relation to the availability and cost of capital to our competitors. Our competitors and potential competitors include far larger, more established companies that have access to capital markets for unsecured commercial paper and investment grade-rated debt instruments and to other funding sources that may be unavailable to us. Many of these companies also have long-standing relationships with dealers and may provide other financing to dealers, including floor plan financing for the dealers' purchase of automobiles from manufacturers, which we do not offer.

&#160;

We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting a dealer's decision to offer automobile contracts for sale to a particular financing source are the monthly payment amount made available to the dealer&#8217;s customer, the purchase price offered for the automobile contracts, the timeliness of the response to the dealer upon submission of the initial application, the amount of required documentation, the consistency and timeliness of purchases and the financial stability of the funding source. While we believe that we can obtain from dealers sufficient automobile contracts for purchase at attractive prices by consistently applying reasonable underwriting criteria and making timely purchases of qualifying automobile contracts, there can be no assurance that we will do so.

&#160;

Regulation

&#160;

Numerous federal and state consumer protection laws, including the federal Truth-In-Lending Act, the federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Federal Trade Commission Act, regulate consumer credit transactions. These laws mandate certain disclosures with respect to finance charges on automobile contracts and impose certain other restrictions. In most states, a license is required to engage in the business of purchasing automobile contracts from dealers. In addition, laws in a number of states impose limitations on the amount of finance charges that may be charged by dealers on credit sales. The so-called Lemon Laws enacted by various states provide certain rights to purchasers with respect to automobiles that fail to satisfy express warranties. The application of Lemon Laws or violation of such other federal and state laws may give rise to a claim or defense of a customer against a dealer and its assignees, including us and those who purchase automobile contracts from us. The dealer agreement contains representations by the dealer that, as of the date of assignment of automobile contracts, no such claims or defenses have been asserted or threatened with respect to the automobile contracts and that all requirements of such federal and state laws have been complied with in all material respects. Although a dealer would be obligated to repurchase automobile contracts that involve a breach of such warranty, there can be no assurance that the dealer will have the financial resources to satisfy its repurchase obligations. Certain of these laws also regulate our servicing activities, including our methods of collection.

&#160;

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#8220;Dodd-Frank Act&#8221;) was enacted in July 2010, and many of its provisions became effective in July 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act restructured the regulation and supervision of the financial services industry and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the &#8220;CFPB&#8221;). The CFPB has rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over &#8220;non-banks,&#8221; including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies from engaging in &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB also may restrict the use of pre-dispute mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts for a consumer financial product or service. The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to us. Further, the CFPB has general supervisory and examination authority over non-depository &#8220;larger participants&#8221; in the market for automotive finance companies. We are subject to such supervision and examination.

&#160;

The Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations are likely to affect our cost of doing business, may limit or expand our permissible activities, may affect the competitive balance within our industry and market areas and could have a material adverse effect on us. For example, in March 2013, the CFPB stated its view that policies of indirect auto lenders that allow auto dealers to mark up lender-established buy rates and that compensate dealers for those markups could present a risk of impermissible pricing disparities on the basis of race and national origin, and potentially other prohibited bases. We continue to assess the Dodd-Frank Act&#8217;s probable effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and to monitor developments involving the entities charged with promulgating regulations. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and on us in particular, is uncertain at this time.

&#160;

In addition to the CFPB, other state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of our business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for state Attorneys General to investigate us. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of our business. We expect that regulatory investigation by both state and federal agencies will continue, and there can be no assurance that the results of such investigations will not have a material adverse effect on us.

&#160;

We believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that we are correct, nor that we will be able to maintain such compliance. The past or future failure to comply with applicable statutes and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, the adoption of additional statutes and regulations, changes in the interpretation and enforcement of current statutes and regulations or the expansion of our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent regulatory requirements than those in which we currently conduct business could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, due to the consumer-oriented nature of our industry and the application of certain laws and regulations, industry participants are regularly named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer law torts, including fraud. Many of these actions involve alleged violations of consumer protection laws. A significant judgment against us or within the industry in connection with any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
