 Item 1&#8212;Business 

Costco Wholesale Corporation and its subsidiaries (Costco or the Company) began operations in 1983 in Seattle, Washington. We are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the United States (U.S.) and Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.), Mexico, Japan, Australia, Spain, and through majority-owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Korea. Costco operated 715 , 686, and 663 warehouses worldwide at August 28, 2016, August 30, 2015, and August 31, 2014, respectively. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, under the symbol &#8220;COST.&#8221; 

We report on a 52/53-week fiscal year, consisting of thirteen, four-week periods and ending on the Sunday nearest the end of August. The first three quarters consist of three periods each, and the fourth quarter consists of four periods (five weeks in the thirteenth period in a 53-week year). The material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season. References to 2016, 2015, and 2014 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 28, 2016, August 30, 2015, and August 31, 2014, respectively. 

General 

We operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and private-label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover. When combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing, efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities, these volumes and turnover enable us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins (net sales less merchandise costs) than most other retailers. We generally sell inventory before we are required to pay for it, even while taking advantage of early payment discounts when available. To the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid, more inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital. 

We buy most of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a cross-docking consolidation point (depot) or directly to our warehouses. Our depots receive large shipments from manufacturers and quickly ship these goods to our individual warehouses. This process maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies, eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiple-step distribution channels. 

Item 1&#8212;Business (Continued) 

Our average warehouse space is approximately 144,000 square feet, with newer units slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format, we have limited inventory losses (shrinkage) to amounts well below those of typical discount retail operations. 

Marketing activities for new locations generally include community outreach to local businesses in new and existing markets and direct mail to prospective new members. Ongoing promotional programs primarily relate to coupon mailers, The Costco Connection (a magazine we publish for our members), and promotional e-mails to members. 

Our warehouses on average operate on a seven-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally have extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, thereby reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain debit and credit cards, co-branded Costco credit cards, cash, or checks. 

Our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believe are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry an average of approximately 3,700 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only. 

In keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items. 

We offer merchandise in the following categories: 

&#8226; 

Foods &#32;(including dry foods, packaged foods, and groceries) 

&#8226; 

Sundries &#32;(including snack foods, candy, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, and cleaning supplies) 

&#8226; 

Hardlines &#32;(including major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, and garden and patio) 

&#8226; 

Fresh Foods &#32;(including meat, produce, deli, and bakery) 

&#8226; 

Softlines &#32;(including apparel and small appliances) 

&#8226; 

Other (including gas stations and pharmacy) 

Ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently. We sell gasoline in all countries except Mexico, Korea, and Taiwan and operated 508, 472, and 445 gas stations at the end of 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Ancillary businesses also include optical dispensing centers, food courts, and hearing-aid centers. 

Our online businesses, which include e-commerce, business delivery, and travel, operate websites in all countries except Japan, Australia, and Spain. They provide our members additional products and services, typically not found in our warehouses. Net sales for our online business were approximately 4% of our net sales in 2016 and 3% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

We have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand-name merchandise. We do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier. We generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise, and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of 

Item 1&#8212;Business (Continued) 

our business. We also purchase private label merchandise, as long as quality and member demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to brand-name items. 

Certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. 

Membership 

Our members may utilize their memberships at any of our warehouses worldwide. Gold Star memberships are available to individuals; Business memberships are limited to businesses, including individuals with a business license, retail sales license or other evidence of business existence. Business members have the ability to add additional cardholders (add-ons). Add-ons are not available for Gold Star members. Our annual fee for these memberships is $55 in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies by country in our Other International operations. All paid memberships include a free household card. 

Our member renewal rate was 90% &#32;in the U.S. and Canada, and 88% &#32;on a worldwide basis in 2016 . The majority of members renew within six months following their renewal date. Therefore, our renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date. 

Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands):

Paid cardholders are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of $55, and in Mexico and the U.K., for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a 2% reward on qualified purchases (up to a maximum reward of $750 per year in our U.S. and Canadian operations and varies in our Other International operations), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico) additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program and check printing services. The services are generally provided by third-parties and vary by state and country. Executive members represented 39% &#32;of paid cardholders at the end of 2016 , 2015 , and 2014 . Executive members generally spend more than other members, and where executive memberships are offered the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase.

Competition 

Our industry is highly competitive, based on factors such as price, merchandise quality and selection, location, and customer service. We compete on a worldwide basis with global, national, and regional wholesalers and retailers, including supermarkets, supercenters, department and specialty stores, gasoline stations, internet retailers, and operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise. Competitors such as Wal-Mart, Target, Kroger, and Amazon.com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors. We also compete with warehouse club operations (primarily Wal-Mart&#8217;s Sam&#8217;s Club and BJ&#8217;s Wholesale Club), and nearly every major U.S. metropolitan area has multiple club operations. 

Intellectual Property 

We believe that, to varying degrees, our trademarks, trade names, copyrights, proprietary processes, trade secrets, patents, trade dress, domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important to our success. We have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well-recognized brands, including the Costco Wholesale &#174; &#32;series of trademarks and our private label brand, Kirkland Signature. &#174; &#32;We believe that Kirkland Signature products are premium products, offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for similar national brand products and that they help lower costs, differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers, and generally earn higher margins. We expect to continue to increase the sales penetration of our private label items. 

We rely on trademark and copyright laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality, license and other agreements with our suppliers, employees and others to protect our intellectual property rights. The availability and duration of trademark registrations vary by country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained.
