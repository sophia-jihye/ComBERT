Note : The detailed proved reserves information presented in accordance with Item 1202(a)(2) to Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is provided under the heading "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information". Proved reserves are stated on a net basis after applicable royalties. 

(a) 

Natural gas volumes are converted to BOE at six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas per one barrel of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence. The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years. For example, in 2015 , the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were $48.80 &#32;per barrel and $2.75 &#32;per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of 18 to 1. 

(b) 

Excludes proved reserves and sales volumes for Occidental's California oil and gas operations, which were transferred to California Resources Corporation (California Resources) in November 2014, and has been treated as discontinued operations. 

&#160; 

Competition 

As a producer of oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other domestic and foreign private and government producers. Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and local, current and anticipated market conditions. Occidental competes for transportation capacity and infrastructure for the delivery of its products. They are sold at current market prices or on a forward basis to refiners and other market participants. Occidental&#8217;s competitive strategy relies on increasing production through developing conventional and unconventional fields, utilizing primary and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques and strategic acquisitions in areas where Occidental has a competitive advantage as a result of its current successful operations or investments in shared infrastructure. Occidental also competes to develop and produce its worldwide oil and gas reserves cost-effectively, maintain a skilled workforce and obtain quality services. 

&#160;

CHEMICAL OPERATIONS 

General 

OxyChem owns and operates manufacturing plants at 23 domestic sites in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas and at two international sites in Canada and Chile. In early 2014, OxyChem, through a 50/50 joint venture with Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., broke ground on a 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside facility. The cracker remains on budget and schedule and is expected to begin operating in early 2017. 

Competition 

OxyChem competes with numerous other domestic and foreign chemical producers. OxyChem&#8217;s market position was first or second in the United States in 2015 &#32;for the principal products it manufactures and markets. OxyChem&#8217;s competitive strategy is to be a low-cost producer of its products in order to compete on price. 

OxyChem produces the following products:

MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING OPERATIONS 

General 

Occidental's midstream and marketing operations primarily support and enhance its oil and gas and chemicals businesses and also provide similar services for third parties. 

Competition 

Occidental's midstream and marketing businesses operate in competitive and highly regulated markets. Occidental's domestic pipeline business competes with other midstream transportation companies to provide transportation services. The competitive strategy of Occidental's domestic pipeline business is to ensure that 

&#160;

its pipeline and gathering systems connect various production areas to multiple market locations. Transportation rates are regulated and tariff-based. Occidental maximizes the value of its transportation and storage assets by marketing its own and third-party production in the oil and gas business. Other midstream and marketing operations also support Occidental's domestic and international oil and gas and chemical operations. Occidental's marketing business competes with other market participants on exchange platforms and through other bilateral transactions with direct counterparties. 

The midstream and marketing operations are conducted in the locations described below:
