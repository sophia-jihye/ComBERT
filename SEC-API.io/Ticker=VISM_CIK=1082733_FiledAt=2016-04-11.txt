Overview 

&#160; 

NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. is a technology company specializing in providing pertinent, real-time information to the worldwide transportation and security industries. NuState&#8217;s proprietary software, GPSTrax, is built on an Open Architecture platform for the logistics and telematics industries. 

&#160; 

We believe there are many opportunities to leverage and monetize our software technology by licensing it to companies that provide green technology solutions to medium and large logistics companies. In November 2014, NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. signed a definitive agreement with The Ronn Motor Group, with offices in Dalian, China and the United States, to license and market GPSTrax in China and other international markets. 

&#160; 

NuState is launching a new GPSTrax Value-Added Reseller (VAR) Program, focusing on opportunities in consumer-based solutions such as asset tracking. The VAR Program will increase awareness, availability and support of the GPSTrax solution at a time when a growing number of companies are looking to update and optimize their solutions. We expect to generate revenues from this Program during fiscal 2016. 

&#160; 

Our software technology provides validation and verification of fuel cost consumption reporting and fuel tax credits to logistics companies. The software also is designed to document the exact amount of reduction of harmful emissions that results from the alternative energy products. This data will enable users in certain countries to generate emissions credits that are tradable under the protocol of the Kyoto Treaty. 

&#160; 

Through our existing relationships in the country of Suriname, NuState is evaluating several projects in the alternative renewable energy market in Suriname. NuState has been in discussions with AMPS, NV (&#8220; AMPS &#8221;), based in Paramaribo, Suriname, to enter into a license agreement with its partner, The Ronn Motor Group, in relation to the purchase of GPSTrax&#169; for their multi-million dollar alternative energy projects. AMPS focuses on providing engineering, procurement and construction management (EPC) services, Power Transmission &#38; Distribution, Renewable and Conventional Energy as well as Power Management Systems to Suriname and its fellow Caribbean Community members.
