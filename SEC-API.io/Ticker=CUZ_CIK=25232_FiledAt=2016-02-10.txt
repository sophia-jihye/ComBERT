Business 

Corporate Profile 

Cousins Properties Incorporated (the &#8220;Registrant&#8221; or &#8220;Cousins&#8221;) is a Georgia corporation, which has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (&#8220;REIT&#8221;). Through December 31, 2014, Cousins Real Estate Corporation (&#8220;CREC&#8221;), including its subsidiaries, was a taxable entity wholly-owned by the Registrant, which was consolidated with the Registrant. CREC owned, developed, and managed its own real estate portfolio and performed certain real estate related services for other parties. On December 31, 2014, CREC merged into the Registrant. Coincident with this merger, the Registrant formed Cousins TRS Services LLC ("CTRS"), a new taxable entity wholly-owned by the Registrant. Upon formation, CTRS received a capital contribution of certain real estate assets and contracts that were previously owned by CREC. CTRS owns and manages its own real estate portfolio and performs certain real estate related services for other parties beginning in 2015. The Registrant, its subsidiaries, CREC and CTRS combined are hereafter referred to as &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221; and the &#8220;Company.&#8221; Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &#8220;CUZ.&#8221; 

Our operations are conducted through a number of segments based on our method of internal reporting, which classifies operations by property and geographical area. For financial information related to each of our operating segments, see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Company Strategy 

Our strategy is to create value for our stockholders through the acquisition, development, ownership, and management of Class A office assets and opportunistic mixed-use developments in Sunbelt markets, with a particular focus on Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina. This strategy is based on a simple platform, trophy assets, opportunistic investments, and a strong balance sheet. This approach enables us to maintain a targeted, asset-specific approach to investing where we seek to leverage our acquisition and development skills, relationships, market knowledge, and operational expertise. 

2015 &#32;Activities 

During 2015 , we shifted our investment activities from acquisitions to development by initiating and completing Class A office assets in our target markets, enhancing the value of our existing assets through leasing activities, and maintaining a strong balance sheet.

Environmental Matters 

Our business operations are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations governing land, water, and wetlands resources. Among these are certain laws and regulations under which an owner or operator of real estate could become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances present on or in such property. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of such substances, or the failure to properly remediate such substances, may subject the owner to substantial liability and may adversely affect the owner&#8217;s ability to develop the property or to borrow using such real estate as collateral. 

We typically manage this potential liability through performance of Phase I Environmental Site Assessments and, as necessary, Phase II environmental sampling, on properties we acquire or develop, although no assurance can be given that environmental liabilities do not exist, that the reports revealed all environmental liabilities, or that no prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us. In certain situations, we have also sought to avail ourselves of legal and regulatory protections offered by federal and state authorities to prospective purchasers of property. Where applicable studies have resulted in the determination that remediation was required by applicable law, the necessary remediation is typically incorporated into the acquisition or development activity of the relevant property. We are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations. 

Certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of a property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period. A transfer of the property does not necessarily relieve an owner of such liability. Thus, although we are not aware of any such situation, we may have such liabilities on properties previously sold. We believe that we and our properties are in compliance in all material respects with applicable federal, state, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations governing the environment. 

Competition 

We compete with other real estate owners with similar properties located in our markets and distinguish ourselves to tenants/buyers primarily on the basis of location, rental rates/sales prices, services provided, reputation, and the design and condition of the facilities. We also compete with other real estate companies, financial institutions, pension funds, partnerships, individual investors, and others when attempting to acquire and develop properties.

Our executive offices are located at 191 Peachtree Street NE, Suite 500, Atlanta, Georgia 30303-1740. On December 31, 2015 , we employed 257 people.
