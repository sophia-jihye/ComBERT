Products and Services 

Our products are designed to enable new process technologies, improve productivity, and lower the cost of ownership for our customers. We also provide repair and maintenance services for all of our products. 

In 2014, we changed our organizational structure from two business units (formerly known as the Thin Films Business Unit and the Solar Energy Business Unit) to a single functional organization with various product lines organized as reportable segments, Precision Power and Inverters. However, as of December 31, 2015, we have discontinued our Inverter production, 

&#32;3 

engineering, and sales product line representing a strategic shift in our business. As such, all Inverter revenues, costs, assets and liabilities are reported in Discontinued Operations for all periods presented herein and we currently report as a single unit. 

We principally serve OEMs and end customers in the semiconductor, flat panel display, high voltage, solar panel, and other industrial capital equipment markets. Our products are used in diverse markets, applications, and processes including the manufacture of capital equipment for semiconductor devices, thin film applications for thin film renewables and architectural glass, and for other thin film applications including flat panel displays, data storage, and industrial coatings. These markets can be cyclical in nature. Therefore, demand for our products and our financial results can change as demand for manufacturing equipment and repair and maintenance services change in response to consumer demand. Other factors, such as global economic and market conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes and renewable applications can also have an impact on our financial results, both positively and negatively. 

Our thin film deposition power conversion systems include direct current ("DC"), pulsed DC low frequency, high voltage, and radio frequency ("RF") power supplies, matching networks, remote plasma sources for reactive gas applications and RF instrumentation. These power conversion systems refine, modify, and control the raw electrical power from a utility and convert it into power that may be customized and is predictable and repeatable. Our power conversion systems are primarily used by semiconductor, solar panel, and similar thin film manufacturers including flat panel display, data storage, industrial hard coating and ophthalmic optical coating equipment makers, and architectural glass manufacturers. 

Our power control modules and thermal instrumentation products are used in the semiconductor industry, including adjacent thin film applications for solar PV and light emitting diode ("LED") industries, and heavy industries, for thermal control and temperature measurement solutions for applications in which time-temperature cycles affect material properties, productivity, and yield. These products are used in rapid thermal processing, chemical vapor deposition, crystal growing, and other semiconductor and solar applications requiring non-contact temperature measurement. They are also used in chemical processing, glass manufacturing and numerous other general industrial power applications. 

Our global support services group offers in-warranty and out-of-warranty repair services in the regions in which we operate, providing us with preventive maintenance opportunities. Our customers continue to pursue low cost of ownership of their capital equipment and are increasingly sensitive to the significant costs of system downtime. They expect that suppliers offer comprehensive local repair service and customer support. To meet these market requirements, we maintain a worldwide support organization comprising of both direct and indirect activities through partnership with local distributors primarily in the United States ("U.S."), the People&#8217;s Republic of China ("PRC"), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Germany, and Great Britain. 

Effective with the conclusion of our inverter wind-down on December 31, 2015, we consider all inverter new product warranties historically sold to be discontinued operations. However, extended warranties historically sold and reflected as &#8220;Deferred Revenue&#8221; on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, represent future revenue and service costs to be incurred by our global services group and are reflected as continuing operations for historical periods and future periods. Please See Note 3. Discontinued Operations &#32;in PART II ITEM 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." 

Markets 

Our products compete in markets for high tech manufacturing capital equipment and renewable energy production. Our markets are not generally subject to seasonality; however, these markets are cyclical due to sudden changes in customers&#8217; manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers&#8217; products, inventory levels relative to demand, government incentives and subsidies, and access to affordable capital. For more information related to the markets in which we compete and the current environment in those markets, please see Business Environment and Trends &#32;in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis. 

SEMICONDUCTOR CAPITAL EQUIPMENT 

Customers in the semiconductor capital equipment market incorporate our products into equipment that make integrated circuits. Our power conversion systems provide the energy to enable thin film processes, such as deposition and etch, and high voltage applications such as ion implant. Our thermal instrumentation products measure the temperature of the processed substrate or the process chamber. Our remote plasma sources deliver ionized gases for reactive chemical processes used in cleaning, surface treatment, and gas abatement. Precise control over the energy delivered to plasma-based processes enables the production of integrated circuits with reduced feature sizes and increased speed and performance. 

&#32;4 

SOLAR PANEL CAPITAL EQUIPMENT 

We sell our products to OEMs and manufacturers of solar cells who use our products to produce thin films using silicon substrates, as well as glass or metal substrates. The majority of solar cell manufacturing currently uses a silicon wafer as the substrate and employs chemical vapor deposition ("CVD") thin film processing. The solar cell industry has developed processes for manufacturing solar cells on non-silicon substrates, such as glass and metal by using thin film processes that employ CVD tools. Our RF and DC power supply products are designed for use in these CVD and physical vapor deposition ("PVD") tools. Our products are used in leading thin film solar cell technologies, including amorphous and microcrystalline silicon, copper, indium, gallium, selenide, and cadmium telluride. 

FLAT PANEL DISPLAY CAPITAL EQUIPMENT 

Manufacturers of flat panel displays use thin film processes similar to those employed in manufacturing semiconductor integrated circuits. Flat panel display technology produces bright, sharp, large, color-rich images on flat screens for products ranging from hand-held devices to laptop and desktop computer monitors and flat TVs. This technology is used in manufacturing liquid crystal display, LED backlit, and 3-dimensional ("3D") television screens. The transition to larger panel sizes and higher display resolution is driving the need for tighter process controls to reduce manufacturing costs and defects. Increased focus on user experience and interface drives the use for new materials and device architecture such as organic light-emitting diode ("OLED") and active-matrix organic light-emitting diode ("AMOLED") and new technologies for touch screen. The emerging migration to flexible display drives the development of new materials and thin film technologies for encapsulation. 

DATA STORAGE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT 

Data storage equipment manufacturers use our products in their capital equipment which allows them to produce a variety of products, including optical disks, such as CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray, and magnetic storage, such as computer hard discs, including both magnetic media and thin film heads. These products use a PVD process to produce optical and magnetic thin film layers, as well as a protective-wear layer. In this market, the trend towards higher recording densities requires thinner and more precise films. The use of equipment incorporating optical and magnetic media to store digital data expands with the growth of the laptop, desktop and network server computer markets, and consumer electronics including audio, video, gaming, cell phone, and entertainment markets. 

ARCHITECTURAL GLASS CAPITAL EQUIPMENT 

Low Emissivity or Low-E architectural glass manufacturers use our power supplies in their production equipment. This glass is used in commercial and residential buildings to reduce energy absorption and loss through the use of thin films coated directly on the glass which reduces the energy absorbed in the building. The thin film deposition process employs PVD tools which use our DC and mid-frequency power products. This market is driven by end market demand for glass related to the residential and commercial construction industry. 

INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS CAPITAL EQUIPMENT 

The thin film deposition processes are also used in the manufacturing process of products for a variety of industrial and consumer markets. Our process power solutions allow thin films to be applied to products in plasma-based processes to strengthen and harden surfaces on such diverse products as machine tools, automotive parts, and various other end products. The advanced thin film production processes allow precise control of various optical and physical properties, including color, transparency, and electrical and thermal conductivity. The improved adhesion and specular surfaces resulting from plasma-based processing make it the preferred method of applying thin films. The need for improved films properties for both hard coating and optical coating requires a precision power conversion technology which we achieved through the acquisition of Solvix products and technology. 

Customers 

Our products are sold worldwide to approximately 316 &#32;OEMs and integrators and directly to more than 1,771 &#32;end users. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 61.2% &#32;of our sales in 2015 , 59.7% &#32;of our sales in 2014 , and 61.6% &#32;of our sales in 2013 . We expect that the sale of products to our largest customers will continue to account for a significant percentage of our sales for the foreseeable future. 

Applied Materials Inc., our largest customer, accounted for 29.8% &#32;of our sales in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , and 32.1% &#32;of our sales in 2013 . Lam Research accounted for 20.3% &#32;of our sales in 2015 , 19.9% &#32;of our sales in 2014 , and 16.8% &#32;of our sales in 2013 . No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our sales in 2015 , 2014 , or 2013 . The loss of Applied Materials, Inc. or Lam Research as a customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 

&#32;5 

Backlog 

Our backlog was approximately $43.7 million &#32;at December 31, 2015 , a 31.5% &#32; decrease &#32;from $63.8 million &#32;at December 31, 2014 . This decrease &#32;resulted primarily from the pause in investment in the semiconductor capital equipment markets in the fourth quarter of 2015. We expect overall growth in backlog as the semiconductor market rebounds in 2016. For more information related to our expectations for the markets we serve, please see Business Environment and Trends &#32;in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis. Backlog orders are firm orders scheduled to be filled and shipped in the next 12 months and include our just-in-time supply agreements with major OEM&#8217;s. 

Backlog orders are not necessarily an indicator of future sales levels because of variations in lead times and customer production demand pull systems. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Delays in delivery schedules and/or customer changes to backlog orders during any particular period could cause a decrease in sales and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 

Marketing, Sales and Distribution 

We sell our products through direct and indirect sales channels in North America, Europe, and Asia. Our sales operations are primarily located in the United States, the PRC, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, South Korea, India, Singapore, and Taiwan. In addition to a direct sales force, we have independent sales representatives and distributors that support our selling efforts. We maintain customer service offices at many of the locations listed above, as well as other sites near our customers' locations. We believe that customer service and technical support are important competitive factors and are essential to building and maintaining close, long-term relationships with our customers. 

The following table presents our net sales by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 , and 2013 . Sales are attributed to individual countries based on customer location.

See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; in Item 1A for a discussion of certain risks related to our foreign operations. 

Manufacturing 

The manufacturing of our Precision Power related products is performed in Shenzhen, PRC; Ronkonkoma, New York; and Littlehampton, United Kingdom. Manufacturing in these three locations, primarily the PRC, exposes us to risks, such as exchange controls and currency restrictions, changes in local economic conditions, changes in PRC laws and regulations, government actions, and unsettled political conditions. The thermal instrumentation product line is manufactured in Vancouver, Washington. 

Manufacturing requires raw materials, including a wide variety of mechanical and electrical components, to be manufactured to our specifications. We use numerous companies, including contract manufacturers, to supply parts for the 

&#32;6 

manufacture and support of our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers. 

Some key parts may be obtained from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We seek to reduce costs and to lower the risks of production and service interruptions, as well as shortages of key parts by: 

&#8226; 

selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts using rigorous technical and commercial evaluation of suppliers' products and business processes including testing their components' performance, quality, and reliability on our power conversion product at our customers' and their customer's processes. The qualification process for Precision Power, particularly as it pertains to semiconductor customers, follows semiconductor industry standard practices, such as &#8220;copy exact&#8221;; 

&#8226; 

monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers; 

&#8226; 

maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts, including making last time purchases of key parts when notified by suppliers that they are ending the supply of those parts; 

&#8226; 

qualifying new parts on a timely basis and in geographies that reduce costs without degradation in quality; 

&#8226; 

locating certain manufacturing operations in areas that are closer to suppliers and customers; and 

&#8226; 

competitively sourcing parts through electronic bidding tools to ensure the lowest total cost is achieved for the parts needed in our products. 

Intellectual Property 

We seek patent protection for inventions governing new products or technologies as part of our ongoing research and development. We currently hold 104 &#32;United States patents and 62 &#32;foreign-issued patents, and have 116 &#32;patent applications pending in the United States, Europe and Asia. A substantial majority of our patents relate to our Precision Power business. Generally, our efforts to obtain international patents have been concentrated in the industrialized countries within Europe and Asia because there are other manufacturers and developers of power conversion and control systems in those countries, as well as customers for those systems for which our intellectual property applies. 

Litigation may, from time to time, be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how owned by us, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others, or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. See "Risk Factors &#8212; We are highly dependent on our intellectual property" in Item 1A. 

Competition 

The markets we serve are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological development and changing customer requirements. No single company dominates any of our markets. Significant competitive factors in our markets include product performance, compatibility with adjacent products, price, quality, reliability, and level of customer service and support. 

We have seen an increase in global competition in the markets in which we compete, especially from Asian and European-based component suppliers. We encounter substantial competition from foreign and domestic companies for each of our product lines. Some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In some cases, competitors are smaller than we are, but are well established in specific product niches. MKS Instruments, Inc. ("MKSI"), Comdel, Inc., Daihen Corporation, Kyosan Electric Mfg. Co., Ltd., H&#252;ttinger Elektronik GmbH, Comet Holding AG, New Plasma Products (NPP), Entech, Plasmart (now a division of MKSI), and ADTech compete with our power conversion products for thin film processing. Spellman High Voltage, Crane, and Matsusada Precision offer products that compete with our high voltage products. Lumasense Technologies, CI Systems, BASF, and Laytec GmbH offer products that compete with our thermal instrumentation products. Eurotherm by Schneider Electric, Control Concepts Inc., CD Automation, and Spang Power Electronics offer products that compete with our power control modules. 

Additionally, a focus on local content is causing new competitors to emerge around the world, with strong support from local governments, industry leaders, and investors. 

Our ability to continue to compete successfully in these markets depends on our ability to make timely introductions of product enhancements and new products, to localize these development and production activities in key world regions, and to produce quality products. We expect our competitors will continue to improve the design and performance of their products, and introduce new products with competitive performance characteristics. We believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to these factors, although we cannot assure that we will be able to compete effectively in the future. 

&#32;7 

Research and Development 

The market for our precision power conversion, thermal, and high voltage products is characterized by ongoing technological changes. We believe that continued and timely development of new highly differentiated products and enhancements to existing products to support end user and OEM requirements is necessary for us to maintain a competitive position in the markets we serve. Accordingly, we continue to devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development projects and seek to maintain close relationships with our key customers and other industry leaders in order to remain responsive to their product requirements now and in the future. 

Research and development expenses were $39.6 million &#32;in 2015 , $36.9 million &#32;in 2014 , and $35.4 million &#32;in 2013 , representing 9.5% &#32;of our sales in 2015 , 10.0% &#32;of our sales in 2014 , and 11.8% &#32;of our sales in 2013 . 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we had a total of 1,382 employees. Our employees are not represented by unions, except for statutory organization rights applicable to our employees in the PRC, and we have never experienced an involuntary work stoppage. We believe that our continued success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

Effect of Environmental Laws 

We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as the environmental laws and regulations of the foreign federal and local jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities. We believe we are in material compliance with all such laws and regulations. 

Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, an adverse effect on our capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations.
