BUSINESS 

Introduction 

We are the largest regional theme park operator in the world based on the number of parks we operate. Of our 18 regional theme and water parks, 16 are located in the United States, one is located in Mexico City, Mexico and one is located in Montreal, Canada. Our U.S. theme parks serve each of the top 10 designated market areas, as determined by a survey of television households within designated market areas published by A.C. Nielsen Media Research in September 2015. Our diversified portfolio of North American theme parks serves an aggregate population of approximately 100 million &#32;people and 175 million &#32;people within a radius of 50 miles and 100 miles, respectively, with some of the highest per capita gross domestic product in the United States. 

Our parks occupy approximately 4,500 &#32;acres of land, and we own approximately 800 &#32;acres of other potentially developable land. Our parks are located in geographically diverse markets across North America. Our parks generally offer a broad selection of state-of-the-art and traditional thrill rides, water attractions, themed areas, concerts and shows, restaurants, game venues and retail outlets, and thereby provide a complete family-oriented entertainment experience. In the aggregate, during 2015 , our parks offered approximately 830 &#32;rides, including over 135 &#32;roller coasters, making us the leading provider of "thrill rides" in the industry. 

In 1998, we acquired the former Six Flags Entertainment Corporation ("Former SFEC", a corporation that has been merged out of existence and that has always been a separate corporation from Holdings), which had operated regional theme parks under the Six Flags name for nearly forty years and established an internationally recognized brand name. We own the "Six Flags" brand name in the United States and foreign countries throughout the world. To capitalize on this name recognition, 16 of our parks are branded as "Six Flags" parks and beginning in 2014 we also began the development, with third-party partners, of Six Flags-branded theme parks outside of North America. 

We hold exclusive long-term licenses for theme park usage of certain Warner Bros. and DC Comics characters throughout the United States (except the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada, Mexico and other countries. These characters include Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck , Tweety Bird , Yosemite Sam , Batman , Superman, The Joker &#32;and others. In addition, we have certain rights to use the Hanna-Barbera and Cartoon Network characters, including Yogi Bear , Scooby-Doo , The Flintstones &#32;and others. We use these characters to market our parks and to provide an enhanced family entertainment experience. Our licenses include the right to sell merchandise featuring the characters at the parks, and to use the characters in our advertising, as walk-around characters and in theming for rides, attractions and retail outlets. We believe using these characters promotes increased attendance, supports higher ticket prices, increases lengths-of-stay and enhances in-park sales. 

We believe that our parks benefit from limited direct theme park competition. A limited supply of real estate appropriate for theme park development, substantial initial capital investment requirements, and long development lead-time and zoning restrictions provides each of our parks with a significant degree of protection from competitive new theme park openings. Based on our knowledge of the development of our own and other regional theme parks, we estimate it would cost $300 million to $500 million and would take a minimum of three years to construct a new regional theme park comparable to one of our major Six Flags-branded theme parks. 

Chapter 11 Reorganization and Related Subsequent Events 

On June 13, 2009, Six Flags, Inc. ("SFI") and certain of its domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors") filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the "Bankruptcy Court") (Case No. 9-12019) (the "Chapter 11 Filing"). SFI's subsidiaries that own interests in Six Flags Over Texas ("SFOT") and Six Flags Over Georgia (including Six Flags White Water Atlanta) ("SFOG" and together with SFOT, the "Partnership Parks") and the parks in Canada and Mexico were not debtors in the Chapter 11 Filing. 

On April 30, 2010, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Debtors' Modified Fourth Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization and the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11. Pursuant to the reorganization plan, all of SFI's common stock and other equity and debt securities were cancelled as of April 30, 2010. Also, on April 30, 2010, but after the reorganization plan became effective and prior to the issuance of securities under the reorganization plan, SFI changed its corporate name to Six Flags Entertainment Corporation ("Holdings"). On April 30, 2010, Holdings issued an aggregate of 109,555,556 shares of common stock at $0.025 par value, as adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock splits in June 2011 and June 2013. On June 21, 2010, Holdings' common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SIX."

Partnership Park Arrangements 

In 1998, we acquired the former Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (a corporation that has been merged out of existence and that has always been a separate corporation from Holdings, "Former SFEC"). In connection with our 1998 acquisition of Former SFEC, we guaranteed certain obligations relating to the Partnership Parks. These obligations continue until 2027, in the case of SFOG, and 2028, in the case of SFOT. Such obligations include (i) minimum annual distributions (including rent) of approximately $68.3 million &#32;in 2016 &#32;(subject to cost of living adjustments in subsequent years) to the limited partners in the Partnerships Parks (based on our ownership of units as of December 31, 2015 , our share of the distribution will be approximately $29.8 million ) and (ii) minimum capital expenditures at each park during rolling five-year periods based generally on 6% of Partnership Park revenues. Cash flow from operations at the Partnership Parks is used to satisfy these requirements first, before any funds are required from us. We also guaranteed the obligation of our subsidiaries to annually purchase all outstanding limited partnership units to the extent tendered by the unit holders (the "Partnership Park Put"). 

After payment of the minimum distribution, we are entitled to a management fee equal to 3% of prior year gross revenues and, thereafter, any additional cash will be distributed first to management fee in arrears, repayment of any interest and principal on intercompany loans with any additional cash being distributed 95% to us, in the case of SFOG, and 92.5% to us, in the case of SFOT. 

The agreed price for units tendered in the Partnership Park Put is based on a valuation of each of the respective Partnership Parks (the "Specified Price") that is the greater of (i) a valuation for each of the respective Partnership Parks derived by multiplying such park's weighted average four &#32;year EBITDA (as defined in the agreements that govern the partnerships) by a specified multiple ( 8.0 &#32;in the case of SFOG and 8.5 &#32;in the case of SFOT) and (ii) a valuation derived from the highest prices previously paid for the units of the Partnership Parks by certain entities. Pursuant to the valuation methodologies described in the preceding sentence, the Specified Price for the Partnership Parks, if determined as of December 31, 2015 , is $343.0 million &#32;in the case of SFOG and $392.5 million &#32;in the case of SFOT. As of December 31, 2015 , we owned approximately 31.0% &#32;and 53.1% &#32;of the Georgia limited partner interests and Texas limited partner interests, respectively. The remaining redeemable units of approximately 69.0% &#32;and 46.9% &#32;of the Georgia limited partner and Texas limited partner, respectively, represent a current redemption value for the limited partnership units of approximately $420.9 million . Our obligations with respect to SFOG and SFOT will continue until 2027 and 2028, respectively. 

Pursuant to the 2015 &#32;annual offer, we did not purchase any units from the Texas partnership and we purchased 0.50 &#32;units from the Georgia partnership for approximately $1.6 million &#32;in May 2015. With respect to the 2015 &#32;"put" obligations, no borrowing occurred. The $350 million &#32;accordion feature on the Amended and Restated Term Loan B under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility (as defined in "Management's Discussion and Analysis - Liquidity and Capital Resources of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Item 7 of this Annual Report) is available for borrowing for future "put" obligations if necessary. 

In connection with our acquisition of the Former SFEC, we entered into the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement with certain of the Company's entities, Time Warner and an affiliate of Time Warner, pursuant to which, among other things, we transferred to Time Warner (which has guaranteed all of our obligations under the Partnership Park arrangements) record title to the corporations which own the entities that have purchased and will purchase limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks, and we received an assignment from Time Warner of all cash flow received on such limited partnership units, and we otherwise control such entities. In addition, we issued preferred stock of the managing partner of the partnerships to Time Warner. In the event of a default by us under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement or of our obligations to our partners in the Partnership Parks, these arrangements would permit Time Warner to take full control of both the entities that own limited partnership units and the managing partner. If we satisfy all such obligations, Time Warner is required to transfer to us the entire equity interests of these entities. 

We incurred $14.8 million &#32;of capital expenditures at these parks during the 2015 &#32;season and intend to incur approximately $20.0 million &#32;of capital expenditures at these parks for the 2016 &#32;season, an amount in excess of the minimum required expenditure. Cash flows from operations at the Partnership Parks will be used to satisfy the annual distribution and capital expenditure requirements, before any funds are required from us. The two partnerships generated approximately $79.8 million &#32;of cash in 2015 &#32;from operating activities after deduction of capital expenditures and excluding the impact of short-term intercompany advances from or payments to SFI or Holdings, as the case may be. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , we had total loans receivable outstanding of $239.3 million &#32;from the partnerships that own the Partnership Parks. The proceeds from these loans were primarily used to fund the acquisition of Six Flags White Water Atlanta and to make capital improvements and distributions to the limited partners in prior years. 

Marketing and Promotion 

We attract visitors through multi-media marketing and promotional programs for each of our parks. The programs are designed to attract guests and enhance the Six Flags brand name, and are tailored to address the different characteristics of our various markets and to maximize the impact of specific park attractions and product introductions. All marketing and promotional programs are updated or completely changed each year to address new developments. These initiatives are supervised by our Senior Vice President, Marketing and Sales, with the assistance of our senior management and advertising and promotion agencies. 

We also develop alliance, sponsorship and co-marketing relationships with well-known national, regional and local consumer goods companies and retailers to supplement our advertising efforts and to provide attendance incentives in the form of discounts. We also arrange for popular local radio and television programs to be filmed or broadcast live from our parks. 

Group sales represented approximately 19% , 22% , and 23% &#32;of the aggregate attendance during the 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;seasons, respectively, at our parks. Each park has a group sales manager and a sales staff dedicated to selling multiple group sales and pre-sold ticket programs through a variety of methods, including online promotions, direct mail, telemarketing and personal sales calls. 

During 2013 we launched a monthly membership program. Season pass and membership sales establish an attendance base in advance of the season, thus reducing exposure to inclement weather. In general, a season pass holder or member contributes higher aggregate revenue and profitability to the Company over the course of a year compared to a single day ticket guest because a season pass holder or member pays a higher ticket price and contributes to in-park guest spending over multiple visits. Additionally, guests enrolled in our membership program and season pass holders often bring paying guests and generate "word-of-mouth" advertising for the parks. During the 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;seasons, season pass and membership attendance constituted approximately 56% , 50% &#32;and 48% , respectively, of the total attendance at our parks. 

At times, we offer discounts on season passes, multi-visit tickets, tickets for specific dates and tickets to affiliated groups such as businesses, schools and religious, fraternal and similar organizations. 

We also implement promotional programs as a means of targeting specific market segments and geographic locations not generally reached through group or retail sales efforts. The promotional programs utilize coupons, sweepstakes, reward incentives and rebates to attract additional visitors. These programs are implemented through online promotions, direct mail, telemarketing, direct-response media, sponsorship marketing and targeted multi-media programs. The special promotional offers are usually for a limited time and offer a reduced admission price or provide some additional incentive to purchase a ticket. 

Licenses 

We have the exclusive right on a long-term basis to theme park usage of the Warner Bros. and DC Comics animated characters throughout the United States (except for the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada, Mexico and certain other countries. In particular, our license agreements entitle us to use, subject to customary approval rights of Warner Bros. and, in limited circumstances, approval rights of certain third parties, all animated, cartoon and comic book characters that Warner Bros. and DC Comics have the right to license, including Batman, The Joker , Superman , Bugs Bunny , Daffy Duck , Tweety Bird &#32;and Yosemite Sam , and include the right to sell merchandise using the characters. In addition, certain Hanna-Barbera characters including Yogi Bear , Scooby-Doo &#32;and The Flintstones &#32;are available for our use at certain of our theme parks. In addition to annual license fees, we are required to pay a royalty fee on merchandise manufactured by or for us and sold that uses the licensed characters. Warner Bros. and Hanna-Barbera have the right to terminate their license agreements under certain circumstances, including if any persons involved in the movie or television industries obtain control of us or, in the case of Warner Bros., upon a default under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement. 

Park Operations 

We currently operate in geographically diverse markets in North America. Each park is managed by a park president who reports to a senior vice president of the Company. The park presidents are responsible for all operations and management of the individual parks. Local advertising, ticket sales, community relations and hiring and training of personnel are the responsibility of individual park management in coordination with corporate support teams. 

Each park president directs a full-time, on-site management team. Each management team includes senior personnel responsible for operations and maintenance, in-park food, beverage, merchandising and games, marketing and promotion, sponsorships, human resources and finance. Finance directors at our parks report to a corporate vice president of the Company, and with their support staff provide financial services to their respective parks and park management teams. Park management 

compensation structures are designed to provide financial incentives for individual park managers to execute our strategy and to maximize revenues and free cash flow. 

Our parks are generally open daily from Memorial Day through Labor Day. In addition, most of our parks are open weekends prior to and following their daily seasons, often in conjunction with themed events, such as Fright Fest &#174; &#32;and Holiday in the Park &#174; . Due to their location, certain parks have longer operating seasons. Typically, the parks charge a basic daily admission price, which allows unlimited use of all rides and attractions, although in certain cases special rides and attractions require the payment of an additional fee. 

See Note 16 &#32;to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information concerning revenues and long-lived assets by domestic and international categories. 

Capital Improvements and Other Initiatives 

We regularly make capital investments for new rides and attractions in our parks that, in total, approximate 9% of revenues annually. We purchase both new and used rides and attractions. In addition, on occasion we relocate rides among parks to provide fresh attractions. We believe that the selective introduction of new rides and attractions, including family entertainment attractions, is an important factor in promoting each of the parks in order to draw higher attendance and encourage longer visits, which can lead to higher in-park sales. 

During 2015 , we (i) added a world-record-breaking hybrid roller coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain (Valencia, CA), a state-of-the-art hybrid roller coaster at Six Flags New England (Agawam, MA), and a 4D free fly coaster at Six Flags Fiesta Texas (San Antonio, TX); (ii) introduced all-new 3D interactive dark ride attractions at Six Flags Over Texas (Arlington, TX) and Six Flags St. Louis (Eureka, MO); (iii) debuted a looping coaster, expanded Fright Fest&#174; with a new haunted house attraction and debuted Holiday in the Park &#174; &#32;at Six Flags Great Adventure (Jackson, NJ); (iv) added a seven-story looping coaster and a classic spin ride at Six Flags Over Georgia (Austell, GA) and a water slide featuring a 90-degree drop, with riders plunging through a trap door and traveling down at speeds of more than 40 miles per hour at Six Flags White Water Atlanta (Marietta, GA); (v) upgraded the signature areas of Six Flags Great America (Gurnee, IL), Carousel Plaza and Hometown Square, and re-introduced children&#8217;s rides for families to share with the next generation of thrill-seekers; (vi) introduced a newly renovated family attraction and other updates to Splashwater Kingdom at The Great Escape (Queensbury, NY); (vii) added a looping coaster with a unique ride experience at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (Vallejo, CA) and Six Flags America (outside Washington, D.C.); (viii) added a 242 foot tall swing ride at Six Flags Mexico (Mexico City, Mexico) and a year-round haunted attraction at La Ronde (Montreal, Canada); and (ix) introduced its first outdoor grill and new, luxury cabanas at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor (Jackson, NJ). 

Planned initiatives for 2016 &#32;include (i) adding The Joker, a new hybrid roller coaster at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (Vallejo, CA); (ii) introducing 3D interactive dark ride attractions at Six Flags Great America (Gurnee, IL) and Six Flags Mexico (Mexico City, Mexico); (iii) adding The Joker, a 4D free fly coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure (Jackson, NJ); (iv) reintroducing The New Revolution, a new look at the world's first 360 degree coaster during its 40th Anniversary at Six Flags Magic Mountain (Valencia, CA) and Superman the Ride at Six Flags New England (Agawam, MA); (v) debuting looping coasters at Six Flags Fiesta Texas (San Antonio, TX), Six Flags St. Louis (Eureka, MO), Six Flags New England (Agawam, MA) and The Great Escape (Queensbury, NY); (vi) adding new themed kids area at Six Flags Over Georgia (Austell, GA); (vii) adding three new thrilling rides to the Gotham City area at Six Flags Over Texas (Arlington, TX); (viii) adding an interactive water play structure at Six Flags America (outside Washington, D.C.); (ix) adding two new thrilling rides and running Vampire backwards at La Ronde (Montreal, Canada); (x) debuting Holiday in the Park &#174; &#32;at Six Flags America (outside Washington, D.C.) and Six Flags St. Louis (Eureka, MO); and (xi) adding a variety of rides, shows and attractions at several of our water parks. 

In addition, as part of our overall capital improvements, we generally make capital investments in the food, retail, games and other in-park areas to increase per capita guest spending. We also make annual enhancements in the theming and landscaping of our parks in order to provide a more complete family-oriented entertainment experience. Each year we invest in our information technology infrastructure, which helps enhance our operational efficiencies. Capital expenditures are planned on an annual basis with most expenditures made during the off-season. Expenditures for materials and services associated with maintaining assets, such as painting and inspecting existing rides, are expensed as incurred and are not included in capital expenditures. 

Also during 2016 , we plan to continue (i) our targeted marketing strategies to attract guests, including focusing on our breadth of product and value offerings and maintaining our focus on containing our operating expenses; (ii) improving and expanding upon our branded product offerings and guest-focused initiatives to continue driving guest spending growth, including our all season dining pass program, which enables season pass holders and members to eat lunch and dinner any day they visit the park for one upfront payment; and (iii) growing sponsorship and international revenue opportunities. 

In addition, the acceptance of our public bid to open and operate a 67-acre water park in Oaxtepec, Mexico in early 2017 will require a multi-million dollar investment in the property, which will be incremental to our planned capital spend of 9% of revenue. The major expansion of the property will include the addition of new water slides, rides and attractions along with several new culinary and retail locations. 

International Licensing 

We have signed agreements to assist third parties in the planning, design, development, operation and management of Six Flags-branded theme parks outside of North America. As compensation for our design and management services, the exclusivity rights granted, and the rights to use our brand, we will receive fees over the design and development period as well as an ongoing remuneration once the parks open to the public. The agreements do not require us to make any capital investments in the parks. 

Maintenance and Inspection 

Rides are inspected at various levels and frequencies in accordance with manufacturer specifications. Our rides are inspected daily during the operating season by our maintenance personnel. These inspections include safety checks, as well as regular maintenance, and are made through both visual inspection and test operations of the rides. Our senior management and the individual park personnel evaluate the risk aspects of each park's operation. Potential risks to employees and staff as well as to the public are evaluated. Contingency plans for potential emergency situations have been developed for each facility. During the off-season, maintenance personnel examine the rides and repair, refurbish and rebuild them where necessary. This process includes x-raying and magnafluxing (a further examination for minute cracks and defects) steel portions of certain rides at high-stress points. We have approximately 800 &#32;full-time employees who devote substantially all of their time to maintaining the parks and our rides and attractions. We continue to utilize a computerized maintenance management system across all of our domestic parks. 

In addition to our maintenance and inspection procedures, third-party consultants are retained by us or our insurance carriers to perform an annual inspection of each park and all attractions and related maintenance procedures. The results of these inspections are reported in written evaluation and inspection reports, as well as written suggestions on various aspects of park operations. In certain states, state inspectors also conduct annual ride inspections before the beginning of each season. Other portions of each park are subject to inspections by local fire marshals and health and building department officials. Furthermore, we use Ellis &#38; Associates as water safety consultants at our water parks to train life guards and audit safety procedures. 

Insurance 

We maintain insurance of the types and in amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable and that are available to businesses in our industry. We maintain multi-layered general liability policies that provide for excess liability coverage of up to $100.0 million &#32;per occurrence. For incidents arising after November 15, 2003 but prior to December 31, 2008, our self-insured retention is $2.5 million &#32;per occurrence ( $2.0 million &#32;per occurrence for the twelve months ended November 15, 2003 and $1.0 million &#32;per occurrence for the twelve months ended November 15, 2002) for our domestic parks and a nominal amount per occurrence for our international parks. For incidents arising after November 1, 2004 but prior to December 31, 2008, we have a one-time additional $0.5 million &#32;self-insured retention, in the aggregate, applicable to all claims in the policy year. For incidents arising on or after December 31, 2008, our self-insured retention is $2.0 million , followed by a $0.5 million &#32;deductible per occurrence applicable to all claims in the policy year for our domestic parks and our park in Canada and a nominal amount per occurrence for our park in Mexico. Defense costs are in addition to these retentions. Our general liability policies cover the cost of punitive damages only in certain jurisdictions. Based upon reported claims and an estimate for incurred, but not reported claims, we accrue a liability for our self-insured contingencies. For workers' compensation claims arising after November 15, 2003, our deductible is $0.75 million &#32;( $0.5 million &#32;deductible for the period from November 15, 2001 to November 15, 2003). We also maintain fire and extended coverage, business interruption, terrorism and other forms of insurance typical to businesses in this industry. The all peril property coverage policies insure our real and personal properties (other than land) against physical damage resulting from a variety of hazards. Additionally, we maintain information security and privacy liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million &#32;with a $0.25 million &#32;self-insured retention per event. 

The majority of our current insurance policies expire on December 31, 2016 . We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any self-insurance retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks. 

Competition 

Our parks compete directly with other theme parks, water and amusement parks and indirectly with all other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment within their market areas, including movies, sporting events, home entertainment options, restaurants and vacation travel. Accordingly, our business is and will continue to be subject to factors affecting the recreation and leisure time industries generally, such as general economic conditions and changes in discretionary consumer spending habits. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors." Within each park's regional market area, the principal factors affecting direct theme park competition include location, price, the uniqueness and perceived safety and quality of the rides and attractions in a particular park, the atmosphere and cleanliness of a park and the quality of its food and entertainment. 

Seasonality 

Our operations are highly seasonal, with approximately 80% &#32;of park attendance and revenues occurring in the second and third calendar quarters of each year, with the most significant period falling between Memorial Day and Labor Day. 

Environmental and Other Regulations 

Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing water and sewer discharges, air emissions, soil and groundwater contamination, the maintenance of underground and above-ground storage tanks and the disposal of waste and hazardous materials. In addition, our operations are subject to other local, state and federal governmental regulations including, without limitation, labor, health, safety, zoning and land use and minimum wage regulations applicable to theme park operations, and local and state regulations applicable to restaurant operations at each park. Finally, certain of our facilities are subject to laws and regulations relating to the care of animals. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations and, although no assurance can be given, we do not foresee the need for any significant expenditures in this area in the near future. 

Portions of the undeveloped areas at certain of our parks are classified as wetlands. Accordingly, we may need to obtain governmental permits and other approvals prior to conducting development activities that affect these areas, and future development may be prohibited in some or all of these areas. Additionally, the presence of wetlands in portions of our undeveloped land could adversely affect our ability to dispose of such land and/or the price we receive in any such disposition. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 1,900 &#32;full-time employees, and over the course of the 2015 &#32;operating season we employed approximately 42,000 &#32;seasonal employees. In this regard, we compete with other local employers for qualified students and other candidates on a season-by-season basis. As part of the seasonal employment program, we employ a significant number of teenagers, which subjects us to child labor laws. 

Approximately 19% &#32;of our full-time and approximately 11% &#32;of our seasonal employees are subject to labor agreements with local chapters of national unions. These labor agreements expire in December 2016 (Six Flags Over Georgia), December 2017 (Six Flags Magic Mountain and one union at Six Flags Great Adventure), January 2018 (Six Flags Over Texas and the other union at Six Flags Great Adventure), and January 2020 (Six Flags St. Louis). The labor agreements for La Ronde expire in various years ranging from December 2015 (currently under negotiation) through December 2020 and the labor agreement for Six Flags Discovery Kingdom was terminated effective January 1, 2016 following an NLRB supervised election in which employees voted to cease their relationship with the union. We consider our employee relations to be good.
