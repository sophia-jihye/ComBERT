General 

Bankwell Financial Group, Inc. (the Company, we, our, us) is a bank holding company, headquartered in New Canaan, Connecticut and offers a broad range of financial services through our banking subsidiary, Bankwell Bank (the Bank), a Connecticut state non-member bank founded in 2002. Our primary market is the greater Fairfield and New Haven County, Connecticut area, which we serve from our main banking office located in New Canaan, Connecticut and eight other branch offices located throughout the Fairfield and New Haven County area. As of December 31, 2015, on a consolidated basis, we had total assets of approximately $1.3 billion, net loans of approximately $1.1 billion, total deposits of approximately $1.0 billion, and shareholders&#8217; equity of approximately $131.8 million. 

We are committed to being the premier &#8220;Hometown&#8221; bank in Fairfield and New Haven Counties and surrounding areas. We believe that our market exhibits highly attractive demographic attributes and presents favorable competitive dynamics, thereby offering long-term opportunities for growth. We have a history of building long-term customer relationships and attracting new customers through what we believe is our superior customer service and our ability to deliver a diverse product offering. In addition, we believe that our strong capital position and extensive local ownership, coupled with a highly respected and experienced executive management team and board of directors, give us credibility with our customers and potential customers in our market. Our focus is on building a franchise with meaningful market share and consistent revenue growth complemented by operational efficiencies that we believe will produce attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. 

On May 15, 2014, Bankwell Financial Group, Inc. priced 2,702,703 common shares in its IPO at $18.00 per share, and on May 15, 2014, Bankwell common shares began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The net proceeds from the IPO were approximately $44.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discount of approximately $2.5 million and approximately $1.3 million of expenses. 

Our History and Growth 

Bankwell Bank was originally chartered as two separate banks, The Bank of New Canaan (including a separate division, Stamford First Bank) and The Bank of Fairfield, which were subsequently merged and rebranded as &#8220;Bankwell Bank.&#8221; It was chartered with a commitment to building the premier community bank in the market we serve. We began operations in April 2002 with an initial capitalization of&#8201; $8.6 million. On November 5, 2013, we acquired The Wilton Bank, and it was merged into Bankwell Bank. On October 1, 2014, we acquired Quinnipiac Bank and Trust Company and it was merged into Bankwell Bank. 

With the efforts of our strong management team, we continued our growth and maintained a strong track record of performance. From December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2015, our total assets grew from $395.7 million to approximately $1.3 billion; our loans outstanding grew from $282.6 million to approximately $1.1 billion and our noninterest bearing deposits grew from $50.2 million to approximately $164.6 million. We believe this growth was driven by our ability to provide superior service to our customers and our financial stability. This loan growth was achieved while maintaining our focus on our strong underwriting standards, which has been reflected in our low net charge-off levels.

Business Strategy 

We are focused on being the &#8220;Hometown&#8221; bank and banking provider of choice in our highly attractive market areas through: 

&#8226; 

Responsive, Customer-Centric Products and Services and a Community Focus. We offer a broad array of products and services which we customize to allow us to focus on building long-term relationships with our customers through high-quality, responsive and personal customer service. By focusing on the entire customer relationship, we build the trust of our customers which leads to long-term relationships and generates our organic growth. In addition, we are committed to meeting the needs of the communities that we serve. Our employees are involved in many civic and community organizations which we support through sponsorships. As a result, customers and potential customers within our market know about us and frequently interact with our employees which allows us to develop long-term customer relationships without extensive advertising. 

&#8203;

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Strategic Acquisitions. To complement our organic growth, we focus on strategic acquisitions in or around our existing markets that further our objectives. We believe there are banking institutions that continue to face credit challenges, capital constraints and liquidity issues and that lack the scale and management expertise to manage the increasing regulatory burden and will likely need to partner with an institution like ours. As we evaluate potential acquisitions, we will continue to seek acquisitions that provide meaningful financial benefits, long-term organic growth opportunities and expense reductions, without compromising our risk profile. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Utilization of Efficient and Scalable Infrastructure. We employ a systematic and calculated approach to increasing our profitability and improving our efficiencies. We continually upgrade our operating infrastructure particularly in the areas of technology, data processing, compliance and personnel. We believe that our scalable infrastructure provides us with an efficient operating platform from which to grow in the near term, and without incurring significant incremental noninterest expenses, while continuing to deliver our high-quality, responsive customer service, which will enhance our ability to grow and increase our returns. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Disciplined Focus on Risk Management. Effective risk management is a key component of our strong corporate culture. We use our strong risk management process to monitor our existing loan and investment securities portfolios, support operational decision-making and improve our ability to generate earning assets with strong credit quality. To maintain our strong credit quality, we use a comprehensive underwriting process and we seek to maintain a diversified loan portfolio and a conservative investment securities portfolio. Board-approved policies contain approval authorities, as appropriate, and are reviewed at least annually. We have a Risk Management Steering Committee comprised of executive officers who oversee new business initiatives and other activities that warrant oversight of risk and related mitigants. Internal review procedures are performed regarding anti-money laundering and consumer compliance requirements. Our Chief Risk Officer reports directly to the Chair of our Audit Committee.

&#8203;

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that we are especially well-positioned to create value for our shareholders as a result of the following competitive strengths: 

&#8226; 

Our Market. Our current market is defined as the greater Fairfield and New Haven County area. The Stamford market area includes numerous affluent suburban communities of professionals who work and commute into New York City, approximately 50 miles from our headquarters, and many small to mid-sized businesses which support these communities. Fairfield County is the wealthiest county in Connecticut, with a 2010 &#8211; 2014 median household income of&#8201; $83,163 according to estimates from United States Census Bureau. We believe that this market has economic and competitive dynamics that are favorable to executing our growth strategy. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Experienced and Respected Management Team with a Proven and Successful Track Record. Our executive management team, is comprised of seasoned professionals with significant banking experience, a history of high performance at local financial institutions and success in identifying, acquiring and integrating financial institutions. Our senior management team includes Christopher R. Gruseke, Chief Executive Officer (one year with us), Heidi S. DeWyngaert, Executive Vice President, Chief Lending Officer (eleven years with us), Ernest J. Verrico, Sr., Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (six years with us), Christine A. Chivily, Executive Vice President, Chief Credit Officer (three years with us), and Michele Johnson, Senior Vice President, Chief Risk Officer (seven years with us). 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Dedicated Board of Directors with Strong Community Involvement. Our board of directors is comprised of a group of local business leaders who understand the need for strong community banks that focus on serving the financial needs of their customers. One of our directors, Frederick R. Afragola, was instrumental in our organization and growth. Mr. Afragola was the Chief Executive Officer and President of Bankwell from its opening in 2002 until his retirement in 2008 and played an integral role in building our foundation and guiding our growth. The interests of our executive management team and directors are aligned with those of our shareholders 

&#8203;

&#8203;

through common stock ownership. By capitalizing on the close community ties and business relationships of our executive management team and directors, we are positioned to continue taking advantage of the market opportunity present in our primary market. 

&#8226; 

Strong Capital Position. At December 31, 2015, we had a 9.68% tangible common equity ratio, and the Bank had a 10.84% tier 1 leverage ratio and a 12.18% tier 1 risk-based ratio. We believe that our ability to attract capital has facilitated our growth and is an integral component to the execution of our business plan. 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Scalable Operating Platform. We provide banking technology, including remote deposit capture, internet banking and mobile banking, to provide our customers with maximum flexibility and create a scalable platform to accommodate our future growth aspirations. We believe that our advanced technology combined with responsive and personal service provides our customers with a superior banking experience. 

&#8203;

Employees 

At December 31, 2015, we had a total of 123 full-time employees, 2 part-time employees and no temporary employees. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement.

Information on the website is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this annual report on Form 10-K. 

Competition 

The financial services industry in our market and the surrounding area is highly competitive. We compete with commercial banks, savings banks, savings associations, money market funds, mortgage brokers, finance companies, credit unions, insurance companies, investment firms and private lenders in various segments of our business. Many of these competitors have more assets, capital and higher lending limits, and more resources than we do and may be able to conduct more intensive and broader-based promotional efforts to reach both commercial and individual customers. Competition for deposit products can depend heavily on pricing because of the ease with which customers can transfer deposits from one institution to another. 

We focus our marketing efforts on small to medium-sized businesses, professionals and individuals and their employees. This focus includes retail, service, wholesale distribution, manufacturing and international businesses. We attract these customers based on relationships and contacts that our management and our board of directors have within and beyond the market area. We do not expect to compete with large institutions for the primary banking relationships of large corporations. Rather, we compete for niches in this business segment and for the consumer business of employees of such entities. Many of our larger commercial bank competitors have greater name recognition and offer certain services that we do not. However, we believe that our presence in our primary market area and focus on providing superior service to professionals at small to medium sized businesses and individual employees of such businesses are instrumental to our success. 

We emphasize personalized banking services and the advantage of local decision-making in our banking businesses, and this emphasis has been well received by the public in our market area. We derive a majority of our business from our local market area which includes its primary market area of Fairfield and New Haven Counties. 

Lending Activities 

General. Our primary lending focus is to serve commercial and middle-market businesses and their executives, high net worth individuals, not-for-profit organizations and consumers with a variety of 

financial products and services, while maintaining strong and disciplined credit policies and procedures. We offer a full array of commercial and retail lending products to serve the needs of our customers. Commercial lending products include owner-occupied commercial real estate loans, commercial real estate investment loans, commercial loans (such as business term loans, equipment financing and lines of credit) to small and mid-sized businesses and real estate construction and development loans. Retail lending products include residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and consumer installment loans. Our retail lending products are offered to the community in general and as an accommodation to our commercial customers, and their executives and employees. We focus our lending activities on loans that we originate from borrowers located in our market. We have established an informal, internal lending limit to one borrower/relationship subject to the statutory maximum of 15% of our unimpaired capital and reserves for loan loss and up to 40% for commercial real estate secured loans.

We market our lending products and services to qualified borrowers through conveniently located banking offices, relationship networks and high touch personal service. We target our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small to medium businesses with between $5 million and $50 million in annual revenue. Our relationship managers actively solicit the business of companies entering our market areas as well as long-standing businesses operating in the communities we serve. We seek to attract new lending customers through professional service, relationship networks, competitive pricing and innovative structure, including the utilization of federal and state tax incentives. We pride ourselves on smart, efficient underwriting and timely decision making for new loan requests due to our leaner approval structure and local decision-making. We believe this gives us a competitive advantage over larger institutions that are not as nimble. 

Total loans before deferred loan fees and the allowance for loan losses were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2015. Since December 31, 2011, total loans have increased $778.2 million from $369.3 million, reflecting expansion of our branch network, including $87.4 million of acquired loans from The Wilton Bank and Quinnipiac Bank and Trust Company. The following table summarizes the composition of our loan portfolio for the dates indicated.

&#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 530,050 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 100.00 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; $ 369,294 &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; 100.00 % &#8203; &#8203; &#8203; Commercial loans. We offer a wide range of commercial loans, including business term loans, equipment financing and lines of credit to small and midsized businesses. Our target commercial loan market is retail and professional establishments and small to medium sized businesses. The terms of these loans vary by purpose and by type of underlying collateral. The commercial loans primarily are underwritten on the basis of the borrower&#8217;s ability to service the loan from cash flow. We make equipment loans with conservative margins generally for a term of ten years or less, supported by the useful life of the equipment, at fixed or variable rates, with the loan fully amortizing over the term. Loans to support working capital typically have terms not exceeding one year and usually are secured by accounts receivable, inventory and personal guarantees of the principals of the business and at times by the commercial real estate of the borrower. For loans secured by accounts receivable or inventory, principal typically is repaid as the assets securing the loan are converted into cash, and for loans secured with other types of collateral, principal is typically due at maturity. The quality of the commercial borrower&#8217;s management and its ability both to properly evaluate changes in the supply and demand characteristics affecting its markets for products and services and to effectively respond to such changes are significant factors in a commercial borrower&#8217;s creditworthiness. Risks associated with our commercial loan portfolio include those related to the strength of the borrower&#8217;s business, which may be affected not only by local, regional and national market conditions, but also changes in the borrower&#8217;s management and other factors beyond the borrower&#8217;s control; those related to fluctuations in value of any collateral securing the loan; and those related to terms of the commercial loan, which may include balloon payments that must be refinanced or paid off at the end of the term of the loan. Our commercial loan portfolio presents a higher risk than our consumer real estate and consumer loan portfolios. 

Commercial real estate loans. We offer real estate loans for commercial property that is owner occupied as well as commercial property owned by real estate investors. Commercial loans that are secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate and primarily collateralized by operating cash flows are also included in this category of loan. Commercial real estate loan terms generally are limited to ten years or less, although payments may be structured on a longer amortization basis of 20 to 30 years. The interest rates on our commercial real estate loans may be fixed or adjustable, although rates typically are not fixed for a period exceeding five to ten years. We generally charge an origination fee for our services. We typically require personal guarantees from the principal owners of the business or real estate supported by a review of the principal owners&#8217; personal financial statements. Risks associated with commercial real estate loans include fluctuations in the value of real estate, the overall strength of the economy, new job creation trends, tenant vacancy rates, environmental contamination, and the quality of the borrower&#8217;s management. We make efforts to limit our risk by analyzing borrowers&#8217; cash flow and collateral value as well as all of the sponsors&#8217; investment activities. The real estate securing our existing commercial real estate loans includes a 

wide variety of property types, such as owner-occupied offices/warehouses/production facilities, office buildings, industrial, mixed-use residential/commercial, retail centers and multifamily properties. Our commercial real estate loan portfolio presents a higher risk than our consumer real estate and consumer loan portfolios. 

Construction loans. Our construction portfolio includes loans to small and midsized businesses to construct owner-user properties, loans to developers of commercial real estate investment properties and residential developments and, to a lesser extent, loans to individual clients for construction of single family homes in our market. Construction and development loans are generally made with a term of one to two years and interest is paid monthly. The ratio of the loan principal to the value of the collateral, as established by independent appraisal, typically will not exceed industry standards. Loan proceeds are disbursed based on the percentage of completion and only after the project has been inspected by an experienced construction lender or third-party inspector. Risks associated with construction loans include fluctuations in the value of real estate, project completion risk and change in market trends. We are also exposed to risk based on the ability of the construction loan borrower to refinance the debt or sell the property upon completion of the project, which may be affected by changes in market trends since the time that we funded the construction loan. 

Consumer real estate loans. We offer first lien one-to-four family mortgage loans, as well as home equity lines of credit, in each case primarily on owner-occupied primary residences. We also originate for resale one-to-four family mortgage loans, which are classified as loans held for sale until sold to investors. Although our consumer real estate loan portfolio presents lower levels of risk than our commercial, commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios, we are exposed to risk based on fluctuations in the value of the real estate collateral securing the loan, as well as changes in the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, which could be affected by numerous factors, including divorce, job loss, illness or other personal hardship. 

Consumer loans. We offer consumer loans as an accommodation to our existing customers, but do not market consumer loans to persons who do not have a pre-existing relationship with us. As of December 31, 2015, our consumer loans represented less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. We do not expect our consumer loans to become a material component of our loan portfolio at any time in the foreseeable future. Although we do not engage in any material amount of consumer lending, our consumer loans, which are underwritten primarily based on the borrower&#8217;s financial condition and, in many cases, are unsecured credits, subject us to risk based on changes in the borrower&#8217;s financial condition, which could be affected by numerous factors, including those discussed above. 

Credit Policy and Procedures 

General. We adhere to what we believe are disciplined underwriting standards, but also remain cognizant of the need to serve the credit needs of customers in our primary market areas by offering flexible loan solutions in a responsive and timely manner. We also seek to maintain a broadly diversified loan portfolio across customer, product and industry types. However, our lending policies do not provide for any loans that are highly speculative, subprime, or that have high loan-to-value ratios. These components, together with active credit management, are the foundation of our credit culture, which we believe is critical to enhancing the long term value of our organization to our customers, employees, shareholders and communities. 

We have a service-driven, relationship-based, business-focused credit culture, rather than a price-driven, transaction-based culture. Accordingly, substantially all of our loans are made to borrowers located or operating in our primary market with whom we have ongoing relationships across various product lines. The limited number of loans secured by properties located in out-of-market areas that we have made are generally to borrowers who are well-known to us. These borrowers typically have strong deposit relationships with the Bank. 

Credit concentrations. In connection with the management of our credit portfolio, we actively manage the composition of our loan portfolio, including credit concentrations. We monitor borrower and loan product concentrations on at least a quarterly basis. Loan product concentrations are reviewed annually in conjunction with the portfolio&#8217;s credit quality and the business plan for the coming year. All concentrations are monitored by our Chief Credit Officer and our Loan Committee. We have also established an informal, 

internal lending limit to one borrower/relationship subject to the statutory maximum of 15% of our unimpaired capital and reserves for loan loss and up to 40% for commercial real estate-secured loans. Our top 20 borrowing relationships range in exposure from $9.6 million to $51.0 million and are monitored on an on-going basis. 

Loan approval process. We seek to achieve an appropriate balance between prudent, disciplined underwriting, on the one hand, and flexibility in our decision-making and responsiveness to our customers, on the other hand. Our credit approval policies have a tiered approval process, with larger exposures referred to the Bank&#8217;s internal loan committee and the Directors&#8217; Loan Committee, as appropriate, based on the size of the loan. Smaller exposures are approved under a three-signature system. Loans with policy exceptions require the next higher level of approval authority, the highest of which is the Directors&#8217; Loan Committee, depending on dollar amount. These authorities are periodically reviewed and updated by our board of directors. We believe that our credit approval process provides for thorough underwriting and efficient decision making. 

Credit risk management. Credit risk management involves a partnership between our relationship managers and our credit approval, credit administration and collections personnel. Portfolio monitoring and early problem recognition are an important aspect of maintaining our high credit quality standards. Past due reports are reviewed on an ongoing basis and insurance and tax payment monitoring is in place. Our evaluation and compensation program for our relationship managers includes significant goals that we believe motivate the relationship managers to focus on high quality credit consistent with our strategic focus on asset quality. 

It is our policy to review all non-amortizing commercial loans in excess of&#8201; $50 thousand and amortizing commercial loans in excess of&#8201; $750 thousand on an annual basis, or more frequently through the receipt of interim and annual financial statements and borrowing base certificates depending on loan structure and covenants. Our policies require rapid notification of delinquency and prompt initiation of collection actions. Relationship managers, credit administration personnel and senior management proactively support collection activities in order to maximize accountability and efficiency. 

As part of these annual review procedures, we analyze recent financial statements of the collateral property, business and/or borrower to determine the current level of occupancy, revenues and expenses and to investigate any deterioration in the value of the real estate collateral or in the borrower&#8217;s or Company&#8217;s financial condition. Upon completion, we update or confirm the risk rating assigned to each loan. Relationship managers are encouraged to bring potential credit issues to the attention of our Chief Credit Officer immediately upon any sign of deterioration in the performance of the borrower. We maintain a list of loans that receive additional attention if we believe there may be a potential credit risk via our Watch List report. 

Loans that are upgraded or downgraded are reviewed by our Chief Credit Officer, while classified loans undergo a detailed quarterly analysis prepared by the lending officer and reviewed by management, our Internal Loan Committee and Directors&#8217; Loan Committee. This review includes an evaluation of the market conditions, the property&#8217;s or company&#8217;s trends, the borrower and guarantor status, the level of reserves required and loan accrual status. Additionally, we have an independent, third-party loan review performed which includes loan grades and our credit administration functions each year. Finally, we perform an annual stress test of our commercial real estate portfolio, in which we evaluate the impact on the portfolio of declining economic conditions, including lower values and decline in net operating income which may result from lower rental rates, lower occupancy rates and higher interest rates. Management reviews these reports and presents them to our Loan Committees. These asset review procedures provide management with additional information for assessing our asset quality. 

Investment Activities 

We manage our investment portfolio primarily for liquidity purposes, with a secondary focus on returns through the use of a liquidity portfolio and an earnings portfolio. Our liquidity portfolio&#8217;s primary purpose is to provide adequate liquidity necessary to meet any reasonable decline in deposits and any anticipated increase in the loan portfolio. The majority of these securities are classified as available for sale. Our earnings portfolio&#8217;s primary purpose is to generate earnings adequate to provide and contribute to 

stable income and to generate a profitable return while minimizing risk. Additionally, our investment portfolio is used to provide adequate collateral for various regulatory or statutory requirements and to manage our interest rate risk. We invest in a variety of high-grade securities, including government agency securities, government guaranteed mortgage backed securities, highly rated corporate bonds and municipal securities. We regularly evaluate the composition of our portfolio as changes occur with respect to the interest rate yield curve. Although we may sell investment securities from time to time to take advantage of changes in interest rate spreads, it is our policy not to sell investment securities unless we can reinvest the proceeds at a similar or higher spread, so as not to take gains to the detriment of future income. 

The investment policy is reviewed annually by our board of directors. Overall investment goals are established by our board of directors, Chief Financial Officer and our asset/liability management committee, or ALCO. Our board of directors has delegated the responsibility of monitoring our investment activities to ALCO. Day-to-day activities pertaining to the investment portfolio are conducted within our accounting department under the supervision of our Chief Financial Officer. 

Deposits 

Deposits are our primary source of funds to support our earning assets. We offer traditional depository products, including checking, savings, money market and certificates of deposit with a variety of rates. Deposits at the Bank are insured by the FDIC up to statutory limits. We price our deposit products with a view to maximizing our share of each customer&#8217;s financial services business, and our loan pricing gives value to deposits from our loan customers. 

We have built out a network of nine deposit-taking branch offices and attracted significant transaction account business through our relationship-based approach. As a result of our significant deposit growth in transaction accounts, which we define as demand, NOW and money market deposits, we have achieved a favorable deposit mix between transaction accounts and certificates of deposit. 

Borrowed Funds 

The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (FHLBB), which is part of a twelve district Federal Home Loan Bank System. Members are required to own capital stock of the FHLBB, and borrowings are collateralized by qualifying assets not otherwise pledged (principally single family residential mortgage loans and securities). The maximum amount of credit that the FHLBB will extend varies from time to time, depending on its policies and the amount of qualifying collateral the member can pledge. We utilize advances from the FHLBB as part of our overall funding strategy and to meet short-term liquidity needs 

On August 19, 2015 the Company completed a private placement of&#8201; $25.5 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed rate subordinated notes (the &#8220;Notes&#8221;) to certain institutional investors. The Notes are non-callable for five years, have a stated maturity of August 15, 2025, and bear interest at a quarterly pay fixed rate of 5.75% per annum to the maturity date or the early redemption date. 

The Notes have been structured to qualify for the Company as Tier 2 capital under regulatory guidelines. The Company will use the net proceeds from the sales of the Notes for general corporate purposes, including the redemption of the $11.0 million outstanding of its Senior Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock issued in 2011 to the U.S. Treasury under the Small Business Lending Fund Program on November 20, 2015. The Notes were assigned an investment grade rating of BBB by Kroll Bond Rating Agency. 

Small Business Lending Fund Program 

Starting in 2011, we participated in the Small Business Lending Fund program, or SBLF, offered by the United States Department of the Treasury, a dedicated investment fund designed to encourage lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks and community development loan funds with assets of less than $10 billion. In connection with SBLF, the Treasury purchased shares of our preferred stock on August 4, 2011 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $11.0 million. We used the proceeds from the SBLF funding to repurchase the preferred stock issued by us to the Treasury in 

connection with its Capital Purchase Program, as well as to provide additional capital to the Bank, allowing the Bank to expand its small business lending programs. As a result of our success in making loans through the program, we were allowed to pay dividends at a 1% interest rate. The company repaid the SBLF funds in full on November 20, 2015. 

Enterprise Risk Management 

We place significant emphasis on risk mitigation as an integral component of our organizational culture. We believe that our emphasis on risk management is manifested in our solid asset quality statistics. Risk management with respect to our lending philosophy focuses, among other things, on structuring credits to provide for multiple sources of repayment, coupled with strong underwriting undertaken by experienced bank officers and credit policy personnel. We perform quarterly loan impairment analyses on criticized loans and criticized asset action plans for those borrowers who display deteriorating financial conditions in order to monitor those relationships and implement corrective measures on a timely basis to minimize losses. In addition, we perform an annual stress test of our commercial real estate portfolio, in which we evaluate the impact on the portfolio of declining property values and lower net operating incomes as a result of economic conditions, including lower rental rates and lower occupancy rates. The stress test focuses only on the cash flow and valuation of the properties and ignores the liquidity, net worth and cash flow of any guarantors related to the credits.

We also focus on risk management in other areas throughout our organization. The Chief Risk Officer oversees the Risk Management function and chairs a Risk Management Steering Committee. We currently outsource our asset/liability management process to a reputable third party, and on a quarterly basis, we run the full interest rate risk model. Results of the model are reviewed and validated by our ALCO. 

Supervision and Regulation 

General 

The Bank, a Connecticut state-chartered commercial bank, is subject to extensive regulation by the Connecticut Department of Banking, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as its deposit insurer. The Bank&#8217;s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC through the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the Connecticut Department of Banking concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. 

The primary goals of the bank regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system and to facilitate the conduct of sound monetary policy. This scheme is intended primarily for the protection of the Deposit Insurance Fund and bank depositors, rather than our shareholders and creditors. The banking agencies have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks, including the authority, among other things, to enjoin &#8220;unsafe or unsound&#8221; practices, require affirmative action to correct any violation or practice, issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced, direct increases in capital, direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets, limit dividends and distributions, restrict growth, assess civil money penalties, remove officers and directors, and, with respect to banks, terminate deposit insurance or place the bank into conservatorship or receivership. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations or unsafe or unsound practices. 

The following discussion is a summary of the material laws and regulations applicable to our operations, but does not purport to be a complete summary of all applicable laws, rules and regulations. These laws and regulations may change from time to time and the regulatory agencies often have broad discretion in interpreting them. Any change in such laws or regulations, whether by the Connecticut Department of Banking, the FDIC or the Federal Reserve Board could have a material adverse impact on the financial markets in general, and our operations and activities, financial condition, results of operations, growth plans and future prospects specifically. 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

The Dodd-Frank Act has significantly changed the current bank regulatory structure and will affect into the immediate future the lending and investment activities and general operations of depository institutions and their holding companies. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with extensive powers to implement and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings associations including, among other things, the authority to prohibit &#8220;unfair, deceptive or abusive&#8221; acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings associations with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings associations with $10 billion or less in assets will continue to be examined for compliance with federal consumer protection and fair lending laws by their applicable primary federal bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also weakens the federal preemption available for national banks and federal savings associations and gives state attorneys general certain authority to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws. 

The Dodd-Frank Act made many other changes to banking regulations including authorizing depository institutions, for the first time, to pay interest on business checking accounts, requiring originators of securitized loans to retain a percentage of the risk for transferred loans, establishing regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, establishing a number of reforms for mortgage originations, requiring bank holding companies and banks to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; in order to acquire banks located outside of their home state, requiring any bank holding company electing to be treated as a financial holding company to be &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; and &#8220;well managed&#8221; and authorizing national and state banks to establish de novo branches in any state that would permit a bank chartered in that state to open a branch at that location. 

The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for the FDIC insurance assessments. The FDIC was required to promulgate rules revising its assessment system so that insurance assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of an insured depository institution instead of deposits. That rule took effect April 1, 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor, retroactive to January 1, 2008. 

The Dodd-Frank Act increased shareholder influence over boards of directors by requiring companies to give shareholders a nonbinding vote on executive compensation and so-called &#8220;golden parachute&#8221; payments, and by authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate and solicit votes for their own candidates using a company&#8217;s proxy materials. 

Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require various federal agencies to promulgate numerous and extensive implementing regulations over the next several years. It is therefore challenging to predict at this time the full impact the Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations will have on community banks and their holding companies. It is expected that the legislation and implementing regulations, particularly those provisions relating to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has and will increase our operating and compliance costs. 

Connecticut Banking Laws and Supervision 

Connecticut Department of Banking. The Connecticut Department of Banking regulates internal organization as well as the deposit, lending and investment activities of state-chartered banks, including the Bank. The approval of the Connecticut Department of Banking is required for, among other things, the establishment of branch offices and business combination transactions. The Connecticut Department of Banking conducts periodic examinations of Connecticut chartered banks. The FDIC also regulates many of the areas regulated by the Connecticut Department of Banking, and federal law may limit some of the authority provided to Connecticut chartered banks by Connecticut law.

Lending Activities. Connecticut banking laws grant banks broad lending authority. With certain limited exceptions, fully secured and unsecured loans of any one obligor under this statutory authority may not exceed 10% and 15%, respectively, of a bank&#8217;s equity capital and allowance for loan losses. 

Dividends. The Bank may pay cash dividends out of its net profits. For purposes of this restriction, &#8220;net profits&#8221; represents the remainder of all earnings from current operations. Further, the total amount of all dividends declared by a bank in any year may not exceed the sum of a bank&#8217;s net profits for the year in question combined with its retained net profits from the preceding two years. Federal law also prevents an institution from paying dividends or making other capital distributions that, if by doing so, would cause it 

to become &#8220;undercapitalized&#8221;. Beginning January 1, 2016, the Basel III Capital Rules limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay if its capital ratios are below the threshold levels of the capital conservation buffer established by the rules. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer of 2.5% (as a percentage of risk-weighted assets) will be effective. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of common equity tier 1 capital and is in addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirement. The FDIC may further limit a bank&#8217;s ability to pay dividends. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.

Powers. Connecticut law permits Connecticut banks to sell insurance and fixed and variable rate annuities if licensed to do so by the Connecticut Insurance Department. With the prior approval of the Connecticut Department of Banking, Connecticut banks are also authorized to engage in a broad range of activities related to the business of banking, or that are financial in nature or that are permitted under the Bank Holding Company Act or the Home Owners&#8217; Loan Act, both federal statutes, or the regulations promulgated as a result of these statutes. Connecticut banks are also authorized to engage in any activity permitted for a national bank or a federal savings association upon filing notice with the Connecticut Department of Banking unless the Connecticut Department of Banking disapproves the activity. 

Assessments. Connecticut banks are required to pay annual assessments to the Connecticut Department of Banking to fund the Connecticut Department of Banking&#8217;s operations. The general assessments are paid pro-rata based upon a bank&#8217;s asset size.

Enforcement. Under Connecticut law, the Connecticut Department of Banking has extensive enforcement authority over Connecticut banks and, under certain circumstances, affiliated parties, insiders, and agents. The Connecticut Department of Banking&#8217;s enforcement authority includes cease and desist orders, fines, receivership, conservatorship, removal of officers and directors, emergency closures, dissolution and liquidation. 

Federal Bank Holding Company Regulation 

General. As a bank holding company, we are subject to comprehensive regulation and regular examinations by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a bank holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.

Under Federal Reserve Board policy which has been codified by the Dodd-Frank Act, a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength for its subsidiary bank. Under this policy, the Federal Reserve Board may require, and has required in the past, a bank holding company to contribute additional capital to an undercapitalized subsidiary bank. A bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve Board approval before: (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting securities of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such securities (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such securities); (2) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (3) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. Under Connecticut banking law, no person may acquire beneficial ownership of more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a Connecticut chartered bank, or any bank holding company of such a bank, without prior notification of, and lack of disapproval by, the Connecticut Department of Banking. 

The Bank Holding Company Act also prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities which, by statute or by Federal Reserve Board regulation or order, have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks. The list of activities permitted by the Federal Reserve Board includes, among other things: (1) operating a savings institution, mortgage company, finance company, 

credit card company or factoring company; (2) performing certain data processing operations; (3) providing certain investment and financial advice; (4) underwriting and acting as an insurance agent for certain types of credit-related insurance; (5) leasing property on a full-payout, non-operating basis; (6) selling money orders, travelers&#8217; checks and United States savings bonds; (7) real estate and personal property appraising; (8) providing tax planning and preparation services; (9) financing and investing in certain community development activities; and (10) subject to certain limitations, providing securities brokerage services for customers. 

Dividends. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the Bank Holding Company&#8217;s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the Bank Holding Company&#8217;s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. 

Substantially all of our income is derived from, and the principal source of our liquidity is, dividends from the Bank. The ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us is also restricted by federal and state laws, regulations and policies. The Bank may pay cash dividends out of its net profits. For purposes of this restriction, &#8220;net profits&#8221; represents the remainder of all earnings from current operations. Further, the total amount of all dividends declared by a bank in any year may not exceed the sum of a bank&#8217;s net profits for the past two fiscal years, plus the portion of the year in which the dividend is paid.

Under federal law, the Bank may not pay any dividend to us if the Bank is undercapitalized or the payment of the dividend would cause it to become undercapitalized. Beginning January 1, 2016, the Basel III Capital Rules limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to us if its capital ratios are below the threshold levels of the capital conservation buffer established by the rules. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer of 2.5% (as a percentage of risk-weighted assets) will be effective. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of common equity tier 1 capital and is in addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirement. The FDIC may further restrict the payment of dividends by requiring the Bank to maintain a higher level of capital than would otherwise be required for it to be adequately capitalized for regulatory purposes. Moreover, if, in the opinion of the FDIC, the Bank is engaged in an unsafe or unsound practice (which could include the payment of dividends), the FDIC may require, generally after notice and hearing, it to cease such practice. The FDIC has indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution&#8217;s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe banking practice. The FDIC has also issued policy statements providing that insured depository institutions generally should pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. 

Redemption. Bank holding companies are required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the consolidated net worth of the Bank Holding Company. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. This notification requirement does not apply to any bank holding company that meets the well capitalized standard for commercial banks, is &#8220;well managed&#8221; within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Board regulations and is not subject to any unresolved supervisory issues. 

Federal Bank Regulation 

Safety and Soundness. The federal banking agencies, including the FDIC, have implemented rules and guidelines concerning standards for safety and soundness required pursuant to Section 39 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, or FDICIA. In general, the standards relate to (1) operational and managerial matters; (2) asset quality and earnings; and (3) compensation. The operational and managerial standards cover (a) internal controls and information systems, (b) internal audit systems, (c) loan documentation, (d) credit underwriting, (e) interest rate exposure, (f) asset growth, and 

(g) compensation, fees and benefits. Under the asset quality and earnings standards, the Bank is required to establish and maintain systems to (i) identify problem assets and prevent deterioration in those assets, and (ii) evaluate and monitor earnings and ensure that earnings are sufficient to maintain adequate capital reserves. Finally, the compensation standard states that compensation will be considered excessive if it is unreasonable or disproportionate to the services actually performed by the individual being compensated. If an insured state-chartered bank fails to meet any of the standards promulgated by regulation, then such institution will be required to submit a plan within 30 days to the FDIC specifying the steps it will take to correct the deficiency. In the event that an insured state-chartered bank fails to submit or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan within the time allowed by the federal banking agency, Section 39 of the FDICIA provides that the FDIC must order the institution to correct the deficiency and may (1) restrict asset growth; (2) require the bank to increase its ratio of tangible equity to assets; (3) restrict the rates of interest that the bank may pay; or (4) take any other action that would better carry out the purpose of prompt corrective action. We believe that the Bank has been and will continue to be in compliance with each of the standards as they have been adopted by the FDICIA. 

Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve Board monitors our capital adequacy, on a consolidated basis, and the FDIC and Connecticut Department of Banking monitor the capital adequacy of the Bank.

The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the other federal and state bank regulatory agencies establish regulatory capital guidelines for U.S. banking organizations. 

As of January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank became subject to new capital rules set forth by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the other federal and state bank regulatory agencies. The new capital rules revise the banking agencies&#8217; leverage and risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk weighted assets to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the Basel III Capital Rules). 

The Basel III Capital Rules establish a new minimum common equity Tier 1 capital requirement of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; set the minimum leverage ratio at 4% of total assets; increased the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets requirement from 4% to 6%; and retained the minimum total capital to risk weighted assets requirement at 8.0%. A &#8220;well-capitalized&#8221; institution must generally maintain capital ratios 200 basis points higher than the minimum guidelines. 

The Basel III Capital Rules also change the risk weights assigned to certain assets. The Basel III Capital Rules assigned a higher risk weight (150%) to loans that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property. The Basel III Capital Rules also alter the risk weighting for other assets, including marketable equity securities that are risk weighted generally at 300%. The Basel III Capital Rules require certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. The Bank did exercise its opt-out option and will exclude the unrealized gain (loss) on investment securities component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from regulatory capital. 

The Basel III Capital Rules limit a banking organization&#8217;s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if the banking organization does not hold a &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The &#8220;capital conservation buffer&#8221; is being phased in from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer will be effective. 

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company&#8217;s consolidated financial statements. 

Liquidity. We are required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure our safe and sound operation.

The final Basel III framework also requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests. Although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and banking agencies for management and supervisory purposes, the Basel III framework would require specific liquidity tests by rule.

Transactions with Affiliates. Under current federal law, transactions between depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, or FRA, and the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Regulation W. In a holding company context, at a minimum, the parent holding company of a bank and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company is an affiliate of the bank. Generally, Section 23A limits the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with any one affiliate to 10% of such bank&#8217;s capital stock and surplus, and contains an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to 20% of capital stock and surplus. The term &#8220;covered transaction&#8221; includes, among other things, the making of loans or other extensions of credit to an affiliate and the purchase of assets from an affiliate. Section 23A also establishes specific collateral requirements for loans or extensions of credit to, or guarantees, acceptances on letters of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate. Section 23B requires that covered transactions and a broad list of other specified transactions be on terms substantially the same, or no less favorable, to the bank or its subsidiary as similar transactions with non-affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act has expanded the definition of covered transactions and increased the timing and other aspects of the collateral requirements associated with covered transactions, including an expansion of the covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives, repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be satisfied. 

Loans to Insiders. Further, Section 22(h) of the FRA restricts a depository institution with respect to loans to directors, executive officers, and principal shareholders (or insiders). Under Section 22(h), loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed, together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities, the depository institution&#8217;s total unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the board of directors. Further, under Section 22(h), loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons, except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the depository institution&#8217;s employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees. Section 22(g) of the FRA places additional limitations on loans to executive officers. In addition to enhancing restrictions on insider transactions, the Dodd-Frank Act increases the types of transactions with insiders subject to restrictions, including certain asset sales with insiders. 

Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured banks, including the Bank. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. 

The FDIC has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under limited circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state nonmember bank if that bank was &#8220;critically undercapitalized&#8221; on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became &#8220;critically undercapitalized.&#8221; The FDIC may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member institution under specific circumstances on the basis of the institution&#8217;s financial condition or upon the occurrence of other events, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; and (4) insufficient capital, or the incurring of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution&#8217;s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Deposit accounts at the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, generally up to a maximum of&#8201; $250,000 per separately insured depositor, pursuant to changes made permanent by the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of its deposit insurance assessment. 

Under the FDIC&#8217;s risk-based assessment system, insured depository institutions are assigned to a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and other factors. A depository institution&#8217;s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by the FDIC, with less risky institutions paying lower assessments. 

On February 7, 2011, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC published a final rule to revise the deposit insurance assessment system. The rule, which took effect April 1, 2011, changed the assessment base used for calculating deposit insurance assessments from deposits to average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity capital. Since the new base is larger than the previous base, the FDIC also lowered assessment rates so that the rule would not significantly alter the total amount of revenue collected from the industry. The range of adjusted assessment rates is now 2.5 to 45 basis points of the new assessment base. The rule is expected to benefit smaller financial institutions, which typically rely more on deposits for funding, and shift more of the burden for supporting the Deposit Insurance Fund to larger financial institutions, which are thought to have greater access to nondeposit funding. 

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. In setting the assessments necessary to achieve the 1.35% ratio, the FDIC is supposed to offset the effect of the increased ratio on insured institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC. The FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long range fund ratio of 2%. 

A material increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that a depository institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of the Bank&#8217;s deposit insurance. 

Deposit Operations. In addition to the regulations above, the Bank&#8217;s deposit operations are subject to other federal laws applicable to depository accounts, such as the: 

&#8226; 

Truth-In-Savings Act, requiring certain disclosures for consumer deposit accounts; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the Federal Reserve to implement that act, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers&#8217; rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Rules and regulations of the various federal banking agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. 

&#8203;

Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain noninterest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). The Federal Reserve Board regulations generally require that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts. We are in compliance with these requirements. 

Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (FHLBB). The Bank is a member of the FHLBB, which is one of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks composing the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Each Federal Home Loan Bank serves as a central credit facility primarily for its member institutions. The Bank, as a member of the FHLBB, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLBB. 

Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Under the CRA, as amended by FDIC regulations, a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution&#8217;s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a bank, to 

assess the bank&#8217;s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such bank, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of a bank&#8217;s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. In particular, the system focuses on three tests: 

&#8226; 

A lending test, to evaluate the bank&#8217;s record of making loans in its assessment areas; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

An investment test, to evaluate the bank&#8217;s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

A service test, to evaluate the bank&#8217;s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs, and other offices. 

&#8203;

Connecticut has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA which is applicable to the Bank. The Connecticut version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Connecticut law requires the Connecticut Department of Banking to consider, but not be limited to, a bank&#8217;s record of performance under Connecticut law in considering any application by the Bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. In our most recent evaluation under Connecticut law Bankwell received a CRA rating of&#8201; &#8220;satisfactory&#8221;.

Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. We are subject to a variety of federal and Connecticut statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys&#8217; fees for certain types of violations. 

At the federal level, these laws include, among others, the following: 

&#8226; 

Federal Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use of consumer credit reports and the provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, governing closing costs and settlement procedures and disclosures to consumers related thereto; 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Service members Civil Relief Act of 2004, governing the repayment terms of, and property rights underlying, secured obligations of persons in military service; and 

&#8203;

&#8226; 

Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing these federal laws. 

&#8203;

Additional Considerations 

Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Federal banking agencies have substantial enforcement authority over the financial institutions that they regulate including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties, as defined. In general, these enforcement actions 

may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities. Except under certain circumstances, federal law requires public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the federal banking agencies. 

Incentive Compensation Guidance. The federal banking agencies have released comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation policies focused on ensuring that financial institutions&#8217; incentive compensation policies do not undermine the safety and soundness of those institutions by encouraging excessive risk taking. The incentive compensation guidance sets expectations for financial institutions concerning their incentive compensation arrangements and related risk management, control and governance processes. All employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of a financial institution, either individually or as part of a group, are covered by the guidance. The guidance is based upon three core concepts: (1) balanced risk-taking incentives; (2) effective controls and risk management compatibility; and (3) strong corporate governance.

Deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the institution&#8217;s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization&#8217;s ability to take certain actions, including the ability to make acquisitions or take other actions. Enforcement actions by the institution&#8217;s primary federal banking agency may be initiated if the institution&#8217;s incentive compensation programs pose a risk to the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, beginning January 1, 2016, the Basel III Capital Rules limit discretionary bonus payments to the Bank&#8217;s executive officers if its capital ratios are below the threshold levels of the capital conservation buffer established by the rules. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer of 2.5% (as a percentage of risk-weighted assets) will be effective. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of common equity tier 1 capital and is in addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirement.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally established a comprehensive framework to modernize and reform the oversight of public company auditing, improve the quality and transparency of financial reporting by those companies and strengthen the independence of auditors. Among other things, the legislation (1) created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which is empowered to set auditing, quality control and ethics standards, to inspect registered public accounting firms, to conduct investigations and to take disciplinary actions, subject to SEC oversight and review; (2) strengthened auditor independence from corporate management by, among other things, limiting the scope of consulting services that auditors can offer their public company audit clients; (3) heightened the responsibility of public company directors and senior managers for the quality of the financial reporting and disclosure made by their companies; (4) adopted a number of provisions to deter wrongdoing by corporate management; (5) imposed a number of new corporate disclosure requirements; (6) adopted provisions which generally seek to limit and expose to public view possible conflicts of interest affecting securities analysts; and (7) imposed a range of new criminal penalties for fraud and other wrongful acts, as well as extended the period during which certain types of lawsuits can be brought against a company or its insiders. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act applies generally to all companies that file or are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Exchange Act. 

Financial Modernization. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or the GLB Act, permits greater affiliation among banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other companies under a type of financial services company known as a &#8220;financial holding company&#8221;. A financial holding company essentially is a bank holding company with significantly expanded powers. Financial holding companies are authorized by statute to engage in a number of financial activities previously impermissible for bank holding companies, including securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; and merchant banking activities. The GLB Act also permits the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury Department to authorize additional activities for financial holding companies if they are &#8220;financial in nature&#8221; or &#8220;incidental&#8221; to financial activities. A bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized, well managed, and has at least a &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; CRA rating. A financial holding company must provide notice to the Federal Reserve Board within 30 days after commencing activities previously determined by statute or by the Federal Reserve Board and Department of the Treasury to be permissible. 

We have not submitted notice to the Federal Reserve Board of our intent to be deemed a financial holding company. However, we are not precluded from submitting a notice in the future should we wish to engage in activities only permitted to financial holding companies.

Privacy Requirements. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or the GLB Act, all financial institutions are required to establish policies and procedures to restrict the sharing of non-public customer data with non-affiliated parties and to protect customer data from unauthorized access. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, or FCRA, includes many provisions concerning national credit reporting standards and permits consumers, including customers of the Bank, to opt out of information-sharing for marketing purposes among affiliated companies. The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2004 amended certain provisions of the FCRA and requires banks and other financial institutions to notify their customers if they report negative information about them to a credit bureau or if they are granted credit on terms less favorable than those generally available. The Bank currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes such policy is in compliance with the regulations. 

The Bank Secrecy Act and Related Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Legislation. The Bank Secrecy Act, or the BSA, provides, in part, for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering by enhancing anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, as well as enhanced information collection tools and enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government, including: (1) requiring standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; (2) rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; (3) reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the Treasury Department&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; (4) filing suspicious activities reports by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating U.S. laws and regulations; and (5) requiring enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons. 

Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 amended the BSA and incorporates anti-terrorist financing provisions into the requirements of the BSA and its implementing regulations. Among other things, the USA PATRIOT Act requires all financial institutions, including us, to institute and maintain a risk-based anti-money laundering compliance program that includes a customer identification program, provides for information sharing with law enforcement and between certain financial institutions by means of an exemption from the privacy provisions of the GLB Act, prohibits U.S. banks and broker-dealers from maintaining accounts with foreign &#8220;shell&#8221; banks, establishes due diligence and enhanced due diligence requirements for certain foreign correspondent banking and foreign private banking accounts and imposes additional record keeping requirements for certain correspondent banking arrangements. The USA PATRIOT Act also grants broad authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to take actions to combat money laundering, and federal bank regulators are required to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve any application submitted by a financial institution. 

The Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, which is a division of the Treasury Department, is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with &#8220;enemies&#8221; of the United States, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC has sent, and will send, our banking regulatory agencies lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts. If the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, the Bank must freeze such account, file a suspicious activity report and notify OFAC. We have established policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the federal anti-laundering provisions.

Proposed Legislation and Regulatory Action. New statutes, regulations and guidance are regularly proposed that contain wide-ranging potential changes to the statutes, regulations and competitive relationships of financial institutions operating and doing business in the United States. We cannot predict whether or in what form any proposed regulation or statute will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected by any new regulation or statute. 

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies. Our earnings will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. The Federal 

Reserve Board&#8217;s monetary policies have had, and are likely to continue to have, an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through its power to implement national monetary policy in order, among other things, to curb inflation or combat a recession. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board affect the levels of bank loans, investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of U.S. government securities, its regulation of the discount rate applicable to member banks and its influence over reserve requirements to which member banks are subject. We cannot predict the nature or impact of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies. 

Taxation 

Federal Taxation 

General: We are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with limited exceptions. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to us. 

Method of Accounting: For Federal income tax purposes, we report income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use tax year ending December 31 for filing federal income tax returns. 

Alternative Minimum Tax: The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), imposes an alternative minimum tax (&#8220;AMT&#8221;) at a rate of 20.0% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences which we refer to as &#8220;alternative minimum taxable income.&#8221; The AMT is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount and the AMT exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90.0% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain AMT payments may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. We have not been subject to the AMT and have no such amounts available as credits for carryover. 

Net Operating Loss Carryovers: A corporation may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2015, we had $3.3 million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. The carryovers were transferred to the Company upon the merger with The Wilton Bank and Quinnipiac Bank &#38; Trust. 

Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction: The Company may exclude from its income 100.0% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations. The corporate dividends received deduction is 80.0% in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, and corporations which own less than 20.0% of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only 70.0% of dividends received or accrued on their behalf. 

The Company and the Bank are not currently under audit with respect to their federal tax returns. 

State Taxation 

Connecticut 

We are subject to the Connecticut corporation business tax. The Connecticut corporation business tax is based on the federal taxable income before net operating loss and special deductions and makes certain modifications to federal taxable income to arrive at Connecticut taxable income. Connecticut taxable income is multiplied by the state tax rate (7.5% for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2015 and 2014) to arrive at Connecticut income tax. 

On October 8, 2015, the Bank formed a passive investment company, Bankwell Loan Servicing Group, Inc., in accordance with Connecticut tax laws, which permit transfers of real estate collateralized loans to such subsidiaries. The related earnings of the subsidiary, and any dividends it pays to the parent, are not subject to Connecticut income tax. The formation of the passive investment company will reduce state income taxes in the future. 

The Company and the Bank are not currently under audit with respect to their state tax returns. 

&#8203;
