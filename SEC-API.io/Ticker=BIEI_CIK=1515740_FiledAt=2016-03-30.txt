 ITEM 1 &#8211; BUSINESS 

&#160;

Corporate History 

&#160;

We were incorporated on May 10, 2010 in the State of Nevada.

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We are a research-based company that intends to discover and develop medical treatments for humans, specifically targeting the treatment of: 

&#160;

- Cancer 

- Fibromyalgia 

- Multiple Sclerosis (MS) 

- Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) 

- Neuropathic Pain 

- Alzheimer's Disease (AD) 

- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS/Lou Gehrig's Disease) 

- Blood Sepsis and Viremia 

&#160;

We have a two-fold corporate focus:

&#160;

One is to target Cancer, Alzheimer's disease, ALS, Blood Sepsis, Leukemia, and other life-threatening cancers, and to do this we intend to develop our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique . The methodology involved in this technique is largely unexplored and has been described by scientists as the "wild west" of modern medicine. Consequently, our first entry into the therapeutics market for medications that work against cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, infectious diseases, Alzheimer's disease, strokes and traumatic brain injury carries significant obstacles before reaching the opportunities of a $700 billion industry. &#160;

&#160; 3 

&#160; 

&#160;

The other is the development of our proprietary drug candidate Feldetrex&#8482; , a potential treatment for Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, Neuropathic Pain and Traumatic Brain Injury. The formulation used in the current Feldetrex&#8482; will be individually tailored to the various illnesses we intend to target, with each formulation being given a unique proprietary brand name. The annual market size of MS treatment is $500 million and the annual market size for all proposed Feldetrex&#8482; market segments is $16 billion.

&#160;

To overcome the significant obstacles inherent to the development of our Sequential-Dialysis Technique and Feldetrex&#8482; candidate drug, we are seeking to partner with prestigious institutions and pharmaceutical companies with the substantial infrastructure and resource capacity to perform experimentation and to engage in product development in an inexpensive and efficient manner. &#160;

SEQUENTIAL-DIALYSIS TECHNIQUE 

&#160;

Our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique is a methodology for the removal of those molecules which are harmful and responsible for causing diseases. A significant disappointment in the practice of modern medicine is that the capabilities do exist to eliminate the presence of most illnesses, including life-threatening diseases such as AIDS and cancer, but with a caveat that the process of treatment comes with catastrophic side effects that can and often do kill the patient.

&#160;

Our development is that the innovative Sequential-Dialysis Methodology is done extracorporeally (outside the body). This is a truly unique and innovative method for alleviating disease.

&#160;

We believe that this methodology can be used for the prevention of cancer metastasis, for directly attacking the causation of intractable seizures, for preventing the death of anterior motor neurons in ALS, for preventing the cause of the neuropathological changes in Alzheimer's disease and Traumatic Brain Injury and for eradicating the causations of infectious diseases, and our intention is that the effectiveness of this technique will be demonstrated and supported in future clinical studies.

&#160;

Through our Sequential-Dialysis Technique , we ultimately hope to provide a cure for cancer if not only to dramatically extend the lives of suffering patients. Our initial focus is on lab and animal tests. Clinical trials, as required, will be undertaken subsequently. &#160;

&#160;

CANCER 

&#160;

Description of Illness 

&#160;

Cancer is a class of diseases in which a group of cells display 1) uncontrolled growth beyond the normal limits of cell reproduction, 2) invasion and destruction of adjacent tissues, and sometimes 3) metastasis or spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood. These three properties of malignant cancers differentiate them from benign tumors which are self-limited and do not invade or metastasize. Most cancers form a tumor, but some, like leukemia, do not. 1 

&#160;

Cancer may affect people at all ages but the risk for most varieties of cancer increases with age. In the United States, cancer accounts for nearly 1 in 4 deaths. According to the American Cancer Society about 577,190 Americans will die of Cancer this year, making the death toll a staggering 1,500 people per day. 2 Globally and on average, 7.5 million people die of Cancer every year. There are about 12.7 million people living with cancer in the United States. 3 

&#160;

Nearly all cancers are caused by abnormalities in the genetic material of the transformed cells. These abnormalities may be due to the effect of carcinogens, such as tobacco smoke, radiation, chemicals, or infectious agents. Other cancer-promoting genetic abnormalities may be randomly acquired through errors in DNA replication, or are inherited, and thus are present in all cells from birth. The heritability of cancers is usually affected by complex interactions between carcinogens and the host's genome. New aspects of the genetics of cancer pathogenesis, such as DNA methylation and microRNAs are increasingly recognized as important.

&#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; 

&#160; Conventional Method of Treatment 

&#160;

Cancer can be treated today by surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, or other methods. The choice of therapy depends upon the location and grade of the tumor and the stage of the disease, as well as the general state of the patient. A number of experimental cancer treatments are also under development. Complete removal of the cancer without damage to the rest of the body is the goal of treatment. Sometimes this can be accomplished by surgery, but the propensity of cancers to invade adjacent tissue or to spread to distant sites by microscopic metastasis often limits its effectiveness. The effectiveness of chemotherapy is often limited by toxicity to other tissues in the body. Radiation damages normal tissue. 4 

&#160;

Potential for Sequential Dialysis Technique 

&#160;

We intend to develop a methodology for treating cancer which is completely different from the standard treatments of chemotherapy and radiation therapy that are now being utilized. Due to the fact that all presently known treatments directly inject chemotherapeutic agents into the body of a patient and/or directly irradiate the patient, there is a very high level of adverse side effects, such as kidney failure, encephalopathy, neuropathy, heart toxicity, and other severe morbidities.

&#160;

We intend to develop our intellectual property applications for utilizing a proprietary methodology in which the cancer patient's blood or other bodily fluid is utilized to remove metastatic cancer cells or other disease causing antigens. This is accomplished by sequentially dialyzing the patient's blood or other bodily fluid extracorporeally. The method will utilize designer antibodies to physically remove the pathophysiologic basis of the disease. For example, in sepsis there will be the physical attachment and removal of bacteria. In cancer treatment, there will be the physical attachment and then physical removal of metastasizing cancer cells. There will also be the physical attachment, and removal of those proteins which allow cancer to metastasize successfully and then thrive-such as angiogenic proteins. To date there has been no specific clinical evidence to support a conclusion that this treatment is effective for premetastatic or metastatic cancers. We hope to demonstrate this in future lab and animal experiments. Through this process, the cancer can be targeted through a number of innovative techniques being developed by the Company.

&#160;

&#160;

This extracorporeal sequential dialysis methodology for cancer treatment has an enormous potentiality for decreasing the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment in cancer patients. Our methodology may also increase the efficacy of cancer treatment by allowing for much higher dosages of anti-neoplastic agents to be used through this extracorporeal methodology. Due to the fact that this methodology completely avoids exposure of the patient's body to these anti-cancer agents, dosages that cannot be normally tolerated can now be utilized in fighting the cancer.

ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE 

&#160;

Description of Illness 

&#160;

Alzheimer's disease is a dementing illness, which induces a progressive impairment of intellectual functioning, including a loss of short term memory. There is also a progressive impairment in executive functioning with occasional psychiatric manifestations such as depression and delirium. Delirium is characterized by an acute confusion. Oftentimes patients have language impairment and apraxia&#8212;an inability to perform previously learned tasks. Patients also often times show agnosia, an inability to recognize objects, and patients have a loss of visual-spatial abilities, for example oftentimes becoming lost in familiar surroundings. Occasionally hallucinations occur in severe forms of Alzheimer's disease.

&#160;

Alzheimer's disease comes from neuropathic changes in the brain which includes the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the cortex of the brain. 5 Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of Tau proteins, which are deposited within the neurons of the brain. Thus, Tau proteins are the causation of Alzheimer's disease and other Tauopathies such as Pick's Disease, Tuberous Sclerosis and certain forms of Parkinson's disease.

&#160;

A report by the Alzheimer's Association examining the current trajectory of Alzheimer's disease shows that the number of Americans age 65 and older who have Alzheimer's disease will increase from 5.1 million in 2010 to 13.5 million by mid-century. The report entitled " Changing the Trajectory of Alzheimer's Disease: A National Imperative " shows that "in the absence of disease-modifying treatments, the cumulative cost of care for people with Alzheimer's from 2010 to 2050 will exceed $20 trillion, in today's dollars. Total costs of care for individuals with Alzheimer's disease by all payers will soar from $172 billion in 2010 to more than $1 trillion in 2050." During this time, the Medicare costs of Alzheimer's disease will soar 600% to $627 billion and the Medicaid costs of Alzheimer's disease will soar 400% to $178 billion. 6 

&#160;

Conventional Method of Treatment 

&#160;

Presently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. Treatments exist but only target the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease without targeting the underlying progression of the disease. Consequently the projected future life span of an individual diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease is 5 to 7 years. 7 

&#160;

Potential for Sequential-Dialysis Technique 

&#160;

We believe that our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique can be used to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's disease. This would be done by removing the proteins responsible for the pathologic changes in the brain, namely the protein Tau; thus, preventing the cause of the neuropathic changes that cause Alzheimer's disease. The Tau protein will be removed from the cerebral spinal fluid in which it resides utilizing a designer antibody (an antibody genetically engineered for a specific purpose) which will allow for the efficacious removal of the protein. We hope to demonstrate this in future lab and animal experiments. We believe that our Sequential-Dialysis Technique can also be used in this fashion to treat Traumatic Brain Injury.

ALS 

&#160;

Description of Illness 

&#160;

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. While the cause of ALS is uncertain, the process of ALS is known to occur as motor neurons in affected patients progressively degenerate until death. As motor neurons degenerate, they can no longer send impulses to muscle fibers that normally result in muscle movement. Eventually, the motor neurons die and the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movements is lost. With voluntary muscle action progressively affected, patients in the later stages of the disease become totally paralyzed. 8 

&#160;

ALS has been frequently referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous New York Yankees baseball player diagnosed with the disease in 1939.

&#160;

Annually, about 5,600 people are diagnosed with ALS in the United States. The projected future life span of a diagnosed patient is two to five years. It is projected that of the current US population, 300,000 people will die of ALS before a cure is found.

&#160;

The financial cost to families of persons with ALS is exceedingly high. In the advanced stages, care can cost up to $200,000 a year. Entire savings of relatives of patients are quickly depleted because of the extraordinary cost involved in the care of ALS patients. 9 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Conventional Method of Treatment 

&#160;

There is currently no cure or treatment that halts or reverses ALS. However, there is one FDA approved drug, Riluzole, which modestly slows the progression of ALS.

&#160;

Potential for Sequential-Dialysis Technique 

&#160;

Numerous medical studies have proven that the causation of ALS is an over excitation of the anterior motor neurons in the spinal cord. Our Sequential-Dialysis Technique method removes those excitatory neural transmitters that cause the death of those cells. The method will utilize designer antibodies to physically remove excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate from cerebrospinal fluid. We hope to demonstrate this methodology in future lab and animal experiments. Thus, we hope to prevent the development of ALS; thereby, giving hope to patients of a currently unconquerable disease.

&#160; &#160;

BLOOD SEPSIS AND VIREMIA 

&#160;

Description of Illness 

&#160;

Blood Sepsis, also known as Blood Poisoning, is an infection of the blood stream. Sepsis is caused when toxin releasing bacteria, such as Staphylococcus, enter the blood. Blood Sepsis is a particularly devastating disease due to the domino-effect of organ shutdown which causes multiple organ failure. Blood Sepsis causes a whole body inflammatory state called Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS). 

&#160;

Blood Sepsis first results in the shutdown of kidneys; thus patients require standard dialysis immediately to prevent death. As the disease progresses, vital signs collapse&#8212;the foremost of these being blood pressure. Subsequently, symptoms of Sepsis include elevated temperature, elevated heart rate, respiratory collapse, further organ failures, altered mental status and cardiac failure.

&#160; Septicemia is a major cause of death in the United States and puts people in the intensive care unit at a very high rate. Only about 1-2% of all hospitalizations in the United States are attributed to Septicemia, though Septicemia accounts for as much as 25% of bed-utilization in intensive-care units.

&#160;

&#160;

Conventional Method of Treatment 

&#160;

The traditional therapy of Blood Sepsis (bacteremia) relies on intravenous treatment using multiple antibiotics. However, in intensive care units, even with today's treatment, approximately 35% of patients with severe sepsis and 60% of patients with septic shock die within 30 days. 

&#160;

Septicemia is of particular concern because of the exceedingly high cost of treatment for Septicemia patients. A typical stay in the intensive care unit costs $10,000 per day with testing. Consequently, the treatment of Blood Sepsis is one of the most costly expenditures for hospitals in America.

&#160;

Potential for Sequential-Dialysis Technique 

&#160;

We hope to conquer Blood Sepsis and Viremia (a disease having symptoms similar to Sepsis but caused by virus) by using our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique . If proven successful, this technique would dialyze the toxin producing bacteria out of the blood by using antibodies; thus saving countless lives while also providing significant cost savings to hospitals around the country. The method will utilize designer antibodies to physically remove the toxin producing bacteria out of the blood. The designer antibodies will attach to the toxin producing bacteria or virus, and then the antibody-antigen compound will be efficaciously dialyzed out of the blood extracorporeally. We hope to demonstrate this methodology in future lab and animal experiments.

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

FELDETREX&#8482; 

&#160;

Although a combination of generic medications, we have a U.S. Patent (No. 8,865,733) on our Feldetrex&#8482; candidate drug. In this way, Feldetrex&#8482; is similar to Viagra &#210; , which was a proprietary cardiac drug prior to its current use and ownership by Pfizer. Consequently, we have one pending patent application for our Feldetrex&#8482; candidate drug&#8212;intending to increase our Feldetrex&#8482; related patent applications to three in the near future.

&#160;

Feldetrex&#8482; may serve as an additional medication utilized by physicians for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, or Traumatic Brain Injury, and is designed to decrease symptomatology in those conditions. Feldetrex&#8482; will not compete against our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique in the market to treat Traumatic Brain Injury, but rather the two will work conjunctively.

&#160;

Feldetrex&#8482; utilizes a low dosage of Naltrexone which has been shown in multiple medical articles, in the medical literature, to increase endogenous enkephalins 10 (endogenous enkephalins are pain-relieving pentapeptides produced in the body, located in the pituitary gland, brain, and GI tract. Axon terminals that release enkephalins are concentrated in the posterior horn of the gray matter of the spinal cord, in the central part of the thalamus, and in the amygdala of the limbic system of the cerebrum. Endogenous Enkephalins function as neurotransmitters that inhibit neurotransmitters in the pathway for pain perception, thereby reducing the emotional as well as the physical impact of pain). We have not independently conducted medical or laboratory tests to show the mechanism of action of this medication. While Naltrexone in high dosages acts as an opioid antagonist, it inhibits opiate receptors. Naltrexone in low dosages causes a compensatory upregulation (increase in the number of receptors) of native endorphins and enkephalins, which last beyond the effects of the Naltrexone itself. We believe that this means, paradoxically, that a daily dose of low dose Naltrexone can be used to chronically increase endorphin and enkephalin levels. We believe that by utilizing a low dosage, Naltrexone has a unique ability to increase enkephalins and other neurotransmitters in the brainstem of patients.

MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS 

&#160;

Description of Illness 

&#160;

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a devastating inflammatory neurologic disease in which white matter, known as myelin, is damaged&#8212;causing episodic or neurological symptoms. The destruction of myelin inhibits communications between the nerves in the brain.

&#160;

Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis include extreme fatigue, numbness, weakness, difficulty with eyesight, spasticity, speech problems, and problems with coordination. Multiple Sclerosis has its greatest incidence in young adults and patients are usually diagnosed at less than 55 years of age at the onset of the illness.

&#160;

The cause of Multiple Sclerosis is unknown, although the disease is believed to be an autoimmune problem triggered by a virus&#8212;meaning that the patient's immune cells attack and destroy the patient's myelin. In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 patients diagnosed with MS and approximately 200 new patients are diagnosed every week. 11 Globally, Multiple Sclerosis is believed to effect 2.1 million people, mostly of European origin.

&#160;

Conventional Method of Treatment 

&#160;

'ABC' drugs Avonex, Beta-Seron, Copaxone are used to treat Multiple Sclerosis but have been shown to barely beat out placebos in efficacy and are not approved in England for government subsidy. The drug Tysavri was deemed dangerous and was taken off the market for over a year.

&#160;

Another treatment of MS is high dose steroids; though, this treatment simply decreases symptoms without curing MS.

&#160;

Potential for Feldetrex&#8482; 

&#160;

Our proprietary Feldetrex&#8482; candidate drug will not compete with typical treatment methods for Multiple Sclerosis, but rather, is simply an add-on drug to increase the effectiveness of treatment.

&#160; &#160;

FIBROMYALGIA 

&#160;

Description of Illness 

&#160;

Fibromyalgia is a common illness affecting approximately 2% of the general population, most common amongst women 20 to 50 years of age. Approximately five million Americans suffer from the debilitating illness. The cause of Fibromyalgia is officially unknown and diagnosis of Fibromyalgia is a 'diagnosis of exclusion'&#8212;meaning that Fibromyalgia is diagnosed as an illness after Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lupus have been ruled out with a blood test.

&#160;

Patients with Fibromyalgia suffer from debilitating fatigue, numbness, headaches, and chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain with multiple tender points. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition lasting 6 months to many years. Patients commonly complain of chronic aching, pain, stiffness, sleep difficulty, headaches, and irritable bowel syndrome. Consequently, approximately 25% of patients with Fibromyalgia are work disabled. The direct and indirect costs of Fibromyalgia are, on average, $5,945 per patient. 12 

&#160;

&#160;

Conventional Method of Treatment 

&#160;

Lyrica (Pregabalin) is the only FDA approved medication for the treatment of Fibromyalgia. However, Lyrica oftentimes has side effects of dizziness, drowsiness and dry mouth. Rarely, Lyrica can cause suicidal ideation and severe agitation.

&#160;

Potential for Feldetrex&#8482; 

&#160;

Our Feldetrex&#8482; candidate drug will not compete with currently existing treatments of Fibromyalgia, but, rather, would be an add-on-drug to increase the effectiveness of treatment.

&#160; &#160;

TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY 

&#160;

Description of Illness 

&#160;

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) occurs when an external force traumatically injures the brain. TBI is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, especially in children and young adults. Causes of TBI include falls, vehicle accidents, and violence. Three separate processes of Traumatic Brain Injury work to injure the brain: 1) bruising (bleeding), 2) tearing, and 3) swelling. Brain trauma can be caused by a direct impact or by acceleration alone. In addition to the damage caused at the moment of injury, brain trauma causes 'secondary injury' , a variety of events that take place in the minutes and days following the injury. These processes, which include alterations in the cerebral blood flow and the pressure within the skull contribute substantially to the damage from the initial injury.

&#160;

&#160;

Each year, an estimated two million TBI-related deaths, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits occur in the United States. Of these patients, 56,000 die and 300,000 are hospitalized. 1.7 million patients are treated and released from an emergency department. 13 

&#160;

Conventional Method of Treatment 

&#160;

The present treatment methodology for Traumatic Brain Injury is centered on the treatment of symptoms. There are currently no treatments that target the underlying pathology of Traumatic Brain Injury.

&#160;

Currently used medications used to treat Traumatic Brain Injury, such as narcotics and antidepressants, have many side effects including addiction, arrhythmia, liver and kidney damage, abdominal problems, nausea, and vomiting.

&#160;

Potential for Feldetrex&#8482; 

&#160;

Our proprietary Feldetrex&#8482; candidate drug has a mechanism of action via a manipulation of central nervous system neurotransmitters, which involves the cerebral cortex, limbic system, and spinothalamic tracts. Feldetrex&#8482; utilizes a low dosage of Naltrexone which has been shown in multiple medical articles, in the medical literature, to increase endogenous enkephalins. We have not independently conducted medical or laboratory tests to show the mechanism of action of this medication.

Development Plans 

&#160;

Central Nervous System Disorders 

&#160;

Feldetrex&#8482; 

&#160;

Feldetrex&#8482; , our candidate drug, is a treatment for decreasing the morbidity of Multiple Sclerosis patients. Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic, progressive illness that affects the nerves in the brain, spinal cord, and other parts of the central nervous system. Multiple Sclerosis affects over 400,000 people in the United States and may affect 2.5 million people worldwide. The licensor under our License Agreements has two pending provisional patent applications with variations featuring oral and/or possibly transdermal medication applications. We intend to compare the efficacy of Feldetrex&#8482; to the standard injectable medications currently utilized to treat Multiple Sclerosis, such as Betaseron (Interferon beta-1b), Avonex (Interferon beta-1a), and Copaxone (Glatiramer acetate). Additionally, we plan on utilizing Feldetrex&#8482; in peer reviewed medical studies at major medical centers to ascertain the efficacy of Feldetrex&#8482; in symbiotically increasing the efficacy of the standard FDA approved Multiple Sclerosis injection drugs.

&#160;

Feldetrex&#8482; Development Plans 

&#160;

We don't have the financial ability to conduct the necessary clinical trials for FDA approval of our Feldetrex&#8482; product candidate. We intend to enter into agreements with larger pharmaceutical companies as collaboration partners, in part to help cover the cost of such processes. 

&#160;

At the conclusion of the studies involving Feldetrex&#8482; , we plan to publish the results in established medical journals and subsequently contact the large pharmaceutical firms for a possible sale or license of the rights to conduct clinical trials, manufacture, and distribute Feldetrex&#8482; . 

&#160;

Infectious Diseases 

&#160;

The licensor under our License Agreements has filed a provisional patent application for the dialyzation of blood from a patient who is dying from septicemia. Septicemia is a rapidly fatal condition in which bacteria have infected the bloodstream of a patient. These patients subsequently suffer from rapid renal failure, encephalopathy, and heart failure unless the septicemia is quickly reversed. Each year approximately 200,000 Americans die from septicemia. 14 The traditional treatment of septicemia has been intravenous antibiotics, which have limited efficacy and are highly toxic.

&#160;

Our method of treatment is to use an extracorporeal methodology of blood dialysis in which the bacteria-infected blood is sterilized through a proprietary methodology of dialyzation in which the blood is placed into contact with antibiotics within the dialysis lumen for a specified period, which subsequently kills the bacterial pathogen with a sequential removal of the antibiotic in order to negate any toxicity to the treated patient. We anticipate that this method could be utilized in place of the standard methodology or could be utilized as an adjunctive treatment for intensive care unit patients.

&#160;

&#160; 14 

&#160; &#160;

Development Plans 

&#160;

Initial concept experimentations began in 2012. After proof of concept experimentations, we intend to implement a clinical hospital/doctor test plan for patients using the same contacts developed in the studies described above for Feldetrex &#8482;. We anticipate that these studies will be initiated after successful laboratory testing no earlier than 2014. Actual clinical trials with patients, conducted in conjunction with our collaboration partners, may continue for many years. We plan to contact the large medical firms, such as Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, and Eli Lilly, to attempt to sell the rights to use our technology and conduct the anticipated clinical trials, beginning as early as mid-to-late 2014. 

&#160;

Oncology 

&#160;

The licensor under our License Agreements is currently developing applications for utilizing a proprietary methodology in which the cancer patient's blood is utilized to remove metastatic cancer cells. This is accomplished by dialyzing the patient's blood extracorporeally, and, through our proprietary methodology, placing the cancer cells in contact with anti-neoplastic agents within the lumen of the dialysis apparatus. We believe this extracorporeal methodology for cancer treatment has an enormous potentiality for decreasing the side effects of chemotherapy and irradiation treatment in cancer patients. Our methodology may also increase the efficacy of cancer treatment by allowing for much higher dosages of anti-neoplastic agents to be used through this extracorporeal methodology. Because this method completely avoids exposure of the patient's corpus to these anti-cancer agents, we believe dosages that cannot be normally tolerated can now be utilized in fighting the cancer.

&#160;

Development Plans 

&#160;

We initiated laboratory tests to prove our cancer-fighting technology in late 2012. In 2013, we completed two breast oncology studies to test the effectiveness of a treatment proposed by Premier Biomedical, Inc. on small mice populations. Premier Biomedical, Inc. believes that the results of these studies will be published in a scientific journal in January 2014, although the results will ultimately be published at the discretion of the University of Texas at El Paso. We plan to undertake additional studies at a university/hospital during 2014. We estimate the cost for each of these studies to be between $300,000 and $500,000, including actual testing with cancer patients, which we anticipate funding from additional capital raises. At the anticipated successful conclusion of these studies, we plan to contact the large pharmaceutical/medical devices firms, such as Johnson &#38; Johnson, Boston Scientific, Medtronics, Pfizer, and E. I. Lilly, to attempt to negotiate a partnership and/or sale of the technology.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

Innovation by our research and development operations is very important to our success. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative products and treatments that address major unmet medical needs, including initially, Multiple Sclerosis, Septicemia, and Cancer. We expect this goal to be supported by substantial research and development investments. 

&#160;

We plan on conducting research internally and may also through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with pharmaceutical firms. We may also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development methods and procedures or projects, as well as our future product lines, through acquisition, licensing or other arrangements.

&#160;

&#160; 15 

&#160; &#160;

In addition to discovering and developing new products, methods and procedures of treatment and treatments, we expect our research operations to add value to our existing products and methods and procedures of treatment in development by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them. 

&#160;

Marketing 

&#160;

Currently, we manage our marketing responsibilities internally. We intend to seek a partnership with and/or sale of our product candidates/technologies to large pharmaceutical and/or medical devices firms. These firms have the ability to effectively promote our product candidates to healthcare providers and patients. Through their marketing organizations, they can explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our product candidates to healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, hospitals, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), employers and government agencies. They also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that communicates the approved uses, benefits, and risks of our product candidates while continuing to motivate people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, they sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, important public health issues, and patient assistance programs. 

&#160;

The large pharmaceutical/medical devices firms principally sell their products to wholesalers, but they also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies and also work with MCOs, PBMs, employers and other appropriate healthcare providers to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines. 

&#160;

Patents and Intellectual Property Rights 

&#160;

We have licensed three U.S. patents: Sequential Extracorporeal Treatment of Bodily Fluids, U.S. Patent No. 9,216,386 and Utilization of Stents for the Treatment of Blood Borne Carcinomas, U.S. Patent No. 8,758,287 (both from Marv Enterprises, LLC), and Medication and Treatment for Disease, U.S. Patent No. 8,865,733 (from Altman Enterprises, LLC), in the areas of cancer, sepsis, and multiple sclerosis. We expect these patents to cover the medical treatments discussed above for Multiple Sclerosis, Blood Sepsis, and Cancer and be effective until 2029. Marv and Altman have licensed these technologies to us pursuant to the terms of the License Agreements. Because our license agreements cover the patents and "all applications of the United States and foreign countries that claim priority to the above PCT applications, including any non-provisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, reissues, re-examinations or extensions thereof," we anticipate that other technologies that derive from these patents will also belong to us and are covered by the license agreements.

&#160;

Patents extend for twenty years from the date of patent filing. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 

&#160;

&#160; 16 

&#160; &#160;

Dr. Felder is the owner of the Feldetrex mark, and has also licensed this to us pursuant to the terms of the License Agreements.

&#160;

We expect our patent and related rights to be of material importance to our business.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Our business is conducted in an intensely competitive and often highly regulated market. Our treatments face competition in the form of branded drugs, generic drugs and the currently practiced treatments for Multiple Sclerosis, Blood Sepsis, and Cancer. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. Where possible, companies compete on the basis of the unique features of their products, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price. Though the means of competition vary among product categories, demonstrating the value of our medications and procedures will be a critical factor for our success.

&#160;

Our competitors include large worldwide research-based drug companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, and generic drug manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases as our major medications and procedures.

&#160;

Environment 

&#160;

Our business may be subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. We intend to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.

&#160;

Regulation 

&#160;

We expect our business to be subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the United States and any other countries in which our operations are conducted. In the United States, regulation by various federal and state agencies has long been focused primarily on product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the FDA continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Likewise, the approval process with the FDA is estimated to take approximately seven (7) years from the time it is started. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States. 

&#160;

&#160; 17 

&#160; &#160;

Clinical trials are a set of procedures in medical research conducted to allow safety (or more specifically, information about adverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments) and efficacy data to be collected for health interventions (e.g., drugs, diagnostics, devices, therapy protocols). These trials can take place only after satisfactory information has been gathered on the quality of the non-clinical safety, and Health Authority/Ethics Committee approval is granted in the country where the trial is taking place.

&#160;

Depending on the type of product and the stage of its development, investigators enroll healthy volunteers and/or patients into small pilot studies initially, followed by larger scale studies in patients that often compare the new product with the currently prescribed treatment. As positive safety and efficacy data are gathered, the number of patients is typically increased. Clinical trials can vary in size from a single center in one country to multicenter trials in multiple countries.

&#160;

Due to the sizable cost a full series of clinical trials may incur, the burden of paying for all the necessary people and services is usually borne by the sponsor who may be a governmental organization, a pharmaceutical, or biotechnology company. Since the diversity of roles may exceed resources of the sponsor, often a clinical trial is managed by an outsourced partner such as a contract research organization or a clinical trials unit in the academic sector.

&#160;

The regulatory agencies under whose purview we intend to operate have administrative powers that may subject us to such actions as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions.

&#160;

Because we intend to seek a partnership with and/or sale of our product candidates/technologies to large pharmaceutical and/or medical devices firms, we anticipate that a larger pharmaceutical company will undertake to navigate the regulatory pathway, including conducting clinical trials, for a product such as Feldetrex &#8482;.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of the date hereof, we do not have any employees other than our two officers and four additional directors that work on a part-time basis. Our officers and directors will continue to work for us for the foreseeable future. We anticipate hiring appropriate personnel on an as-needed basis, and utilizing the services of independent contractors as needed.
