Revenue for the Company's technology service providers vertical market as a percentage of total revenue increased in 2015 &#32;as compared with 2014 &#32;due to strong demand for the first three quarters of 2015 from several of the Company's largest clients in its IT staffing services business unit, which are included in this vertical market. Demand from this vertical did slow significantly in the 2015 fourth quarter, however, as several large customers cut back on their requirements for our services due to their own challenging financial results. 

The revenue in our manufacturing vertical market is primarily generated from several large staffing customers, including Lenovo (through SDI as a vendor manager for Lenovo). Revenue from Lenovo increased by approximately $7 million in 2015 as compared with 2014 primarily as a result of the acquisition from IBM of the x86 server business. 

Previously, the Company&#8217;s growth efforts were primarily focused in the healthcare market based on its leading position in serving the provider market, and its expertise and experience serving other segments of this market, primarily payers and life sciences companies. In 2012, there was higher demand for solutions offerings and support from healthcare companies, and in general, higher demand compared with other sectors of the U.S. economy. However, in 2013 and 2014, the demand from our healthcare clients decreased. This decrease was directly related to the U.S. federal government sequestration which cut Medicare reimbursements to hospitals and health systems by 2% starting in April 2013. As a result, the Company&#8217;s healthcare revenue, primarily from EHR and related projects, declined in 2013 and 2014, and continued to decrease in 2015. As part of the strategy in 2016 to shift to other non-EHR services, the Company combined the delivery of the services of its healthcare and life sciences business under one individual, and has expanded its healthcare IT business development team with individuals who have experience selling other (non-EHR) healthcare IT services such as advisory and technical services, outsourcing, and staff augmentation. 

During 2015 , the percentage of revenue attributable to the financial services market decreased from 2014 , primarily due to the fact that most of the revenue generated in this vertical market is in Europe, and there was a significant decrease in the value of the Euro and British pound in 2015 as compared with 2014. 

Revenue for the Company's diversified industrials vertical market decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenue in 2015 &#32;as compared with 2014 &#32;as demand in this vertical market declined. Generally, the decrease in the price of oil caused several of our clients to reduce their overall spending, including requirements for IT services, during 2014 and 2015. 

For the year ended December 31, 2015 , CTG provided its services to approximately 350 clients in North America and Europe. In North America, the Company operates in the United States and Canada, with greater than 99% of 2015 &#32;North American revenue generated in the United States. In Europe, the Company operates in Belgium, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. Of total 2015 &#32;consolidated revenue of $369.5 million , approximately 82% &#32;was generated in North America and 18% &#32;in Europe. Two clients, IBM and SDI, each accounted for greater than 10% &#32;of CTG&#8217;s consolidated revenue in 2015 . 

Pricing and Backlog 

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, when the services have been rendered, when the price is determinable, and when collectibility of the amounts due is reasonably assured. For time-and-material contracts, revenue is recognized as hours are incurred and costs are expended. For contracts with periodic billing schedules, primarily monthly, revenue is recognized as services are rendered to the customer. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized per the proportional method of accounting using an input-based approach. On a given project, actual salary and indirect labor costs incurred are measured and compared against the total estimated costs of such items at the completion of the project. Revenue is recognized based upon the percentage-of-completion calculation of total incurred costs to total estimated costs. The Company infrequently works on fixed-price projects that include significant amounts of material or other non-labor related costs which could distort the percent complete within a percentage-of-completion calculation. The Company&#8217;s estimate of the total labor costs it expects to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our past experience on similar projects, and includes management judgments and estimates which affect the amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts in any accounting period. 

The Company&#8217;s revenue from contracts accounted for under time-and-material, progress billing, and percentage-of-completion methods as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;is as follows:

As of December 31, 2015 &#32;and 2014 , the backlog for fixed-price and all managed-support contracts was approximately $30.2 million &#32;and $41.8 million , respectively. Approximately 76.0% &#32;or $23.0 million &#32;of the December 31, 2015 &#32;backlog is expected to be earned in 2016 . Of the $41.8 million &#32;of backlog at December 31, 2014 , approximately 66.9% , or $28.0 million &#32;was earned in 2015 . Revenue is subject to slight seasonal variations, with a minor slowdown in months of high vacation and legal holidays (July, August, and December). Backlog does not tend to be seasonal; however, it does fluctuate based upon the timing of entry into long-term contracts. 

Competition 

The IT services market, for both IT solutions and IT staffing services, is highly competitive. The market is also highly fragmented with many providers and no single competitor maintaining clear market leadership. Competition varies by location, the type of service provided, and the customer to whom services are provided. The Company&#8217;s competition comes from four major channels: large national or international companies, including major accounting and consulting firms; hardware vendors and suppliers of packaged software systems; small local firms or individuals specializing in specific programming services or applications; and from a customer&#8217;s internal IT staff. CTG competes against all four of these channels for its share of the market. The Company believes that to compete successfully it is necessary to have a local geographic presence, offer appropriate IT solutions, provide skilled professional resources, and price its services competitively. 

Intellectual Property 

The Company has registered its symbol and logo with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has taken steps to preserve its rights in other countries where it operates. We regard patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on them in the United States and foreign countries to protect our investments in products and technology. Our patents expire at various times, but we believe that the loss or expiration of any individual patent would not materially affect our business. We, like any other company, may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties from time to time in the ordinary course of business. CTG has entered into agreements with various software and hardware vendors from time to time in the normal course of business, and has capitalized certain costs under software development projects. 

Employees 

CTG&#8217;s business depends on the Company&#8217;s ability to attract and retain qualified professional staff to provide services to its customers. The Company has a structured recruiting organization that works with its clients to meet their requirements by recruiting and providing high quality, motivated staff. The Company employs approximately 3,600 &#32;employees worldwide, with approximately 2,900 &#32;in the United States and Canada and 700 &#32;in Europe. Of these employees, approximately 3,300 &#32;are IT professionals and 300 &#32;are individuals who work in sales, recruiting, delivery, administrative and support positions. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good. No employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. CTG is an equal opportunity employer.
