We are highly focused on high-grade and custom product designs for the commercial, medical and military/defense markets, where customers demand high density, high efficiency and ruggedized products to meet the harshest and/or military mission critical operating conditions. We are a California corporation originally formed in 1969, and our common stock trades on the NYSE MKT under the symbol &#8220;DPW&#8221;. Our corporate headquarters are located in the heart of the Silicon Valley. 

&#160; 

Our wholly-owned UK -based subsidiary, Digital Power Limited ("DPL"), located in Salisbury, England, operates under the brand name of &#8220;Gresham Power Electronics&#8221; (&#8220;Gresham&#8221;). DPL designs, manufactures and sells power products and system solutions mainly for the European marketplace, including power conversion, power distribution equipment, DC/AC (Direct Current/Active Current) inverters and UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) products. Our European defense business is specialized in the field of naval power distribution products . 

&#160; 

We believe that we are one of the first companies in the power solutions industry to introduce a product strategy based on the premise that products developed with an extremely flexible architecture enable rapid modifications to meet unique customer requirements for non-standard input and output voltages. We continue to sell products with flexible configurations to customers serving diversified applications in telecom, industrial and medical market segments. We believe our high density and high efficiency power products have set an industry standard for providing high-power output in a small packaging sizes. 

&#160; 

We market and sell our products to many diverse market segments, including the telecom, industrial, medical and military/defense industries. Our products serve a global market, with an emphasis on North America and Europe. We offer a broad product variety, including a full custom product design, standard and modified-standard products. Our unique high-speed switching power rectifiers include but are not limited to defense and commercial custom power products, server power supplies, front-end, open-frame, enclosed, CompactPCI, MicroTCA, Desktop/Wall-mount Adaptors, Power over Ethernet POE) and other product solutions. Our product power range is from 10 watts to 75,000 watts. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In an effort to provide high quality products, better control our manufacturing costs and sell our products in a competitive pricing to support our markets, we have entered into several contract manufacturing agreements with several manufacturers both domestically and in Asia, primarily China. To comply with the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (&#8220;ITAR&#8221;) regulations, we manufacture our military products by a domestic manufacturer that complies with US ITAR regulations and is certified to perform such manufacturing services. 

&#160; 

We intend to remain an innovative leader in the development of cutting-edge custom power solutions and feature rich products to meet any customer needs and requirements, rugged power systems to meet harsh and extreme operation environment conditions, and high efficiency, high-density and scalable power systems. 

&#160; 

Power System Solutions 

&#160; 

We provide custom power system solutions, high-grade flexibility series power supply products, off-the-shelf products and value-added services to diverse industries and markets including military/defense, telecom, medical and industrial. We believe that our solutions leverage a combination of low leakage power emissions, high power density, superior power efficiency, design flexibility and short time to market. 

&#160; 

Custom Power System Solution. We provide high-grade custom power system solutions to several customers in multiple industry segments. Our custom solution technology includes full Digital Signal Processing (&#8220;DSP&#8221;) control, digital load sharing intelligent power management and customizable firmware. The products feature high power density, special layout and multiple outputs to meet each of our customer&#8217;s unique requirements. We combine our power design capabilities with the latest circuit designs to provide complete power solutions for virtually any need. In the design of custom power solutions, we work closely with our customers&#8217; engineering teams to develop mechanical enclosures to ensure 100% compatibility with any hosted platform. 

&#160; 

Our standard contract for custom power solutions includes a multi-year high-volume production forecast that allows us to secure long-term production guarantees (and therefore possible savings on manufacturing costs for volume orders) while providing an environment that promotes the development of our intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) portfolio. We believe that this business model provides an incentive to our customers to be committed to high-volume production orders. 

&#160; 

High-Grade Flexibility Series Power Supply Product . We offer our feature rich based power rectifiers that support flexible configuration and high-grade design implementation. This includes innovative designs and implementation including DSP control for Power Factor Correction (&#8220;PFC&#8221;) and DC/DC, synchronous rectifier outputs under DSP control, two phase PFC, hot pluggable, current sharing and other features. While some of our customers have special requirements that include a full custom design, other customers may require only certain electrical changes to standard power supply products, such as modified output voltages and unique status and control signals, and mechanical repackaging tailored to fit the specific application. We offer a wide range of standard and modified standard products that can be easily integrated with any platform across our diversified market segments. 

&#160; 

Value-Added Services . In addition to our custom solutions and high-grade flexibility series proprietary products that we offer, we also provide value-added services to original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;). We incorporate an OEM&#8217;s selected electronic components, enclosures, cable assemblies and other compliance components into our power system solutions to produce a power subassembly that is compatible with the OEM&#8217;s own equipment and specifically tailored to meet the OEM&#8217;s needs. We purchase parts and components that the OEM itself would otherwise attach to, or integrate with, our power systems, and provide the OEM with the integration and installation service, thus eliminating a complex, time-consuming and costly integration. We believe that this value-added service is well suited to those OEMs who wish to reduce their vendor base and minimize their investment in manufacturing that leads to increased fixed costs. Based on these value-added services, the OEMs do not need to build assembly facilities to manufacture their own power sub-assemblies and thus are not required to purchase individual parts from many vendors. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our products have a warranty period from date of shipment to the customer. 

&#160;

Strategy 

&#160; 

Our strategy is to be the supplier of choice to those companies and OEMs requiring high-quality power system solutions where custom design, superior product, high quality, time to market and very competitive prices are critical to business success. We believe that we provide advanced custom product design services to deliver high-grade products that reach a high level of efficiency and density and can meet rigorous environmental requirements. Our customers benefit from a direct relationship with us that support all of their needs for designing and manufacturing power solutions and products. By implementing our advanced core technology, including process implementation in integrated circuits, we can provide cost reductions to our customers by replacing their existing power sources with our custom design cost-effective products. Our target market segments include the industrial, telecommunication, medical, and military/defense industries. 

&#160; 

Our strategy will continue to focus on expanding our market share by adding new customers from all of our target market segments. We are developing long term relationships, and we intend to expand our customer base in our commercial market segments, including medical, telecom and industrial, while continuing to maintain our existing customers. In the military and defense market segment, we will continue to provide advanced rugged products to customers, and we are striving to expand our business to support the military and defense industries. We believe that our custom power supply solutions, flexibility series, high-grade and high-efficiency power product solutions provide customers with a more effective choice as compared to products offered by other power solution competitors, due in part to a customer&#8217;s requirement for output voltages and other features such as redundancy and sense control tailored to its exact requirements within specific parameters. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, we believe that we have the talent and engineering experience to satisfy any of our customers&#8217; product or platform requirements. If an OEM customer specifies a different set of power system parameters, we will custom design or modify a product to meet the OEM&#8217;s requirements. With a wide range of solutions from our custom designs to our high-grade flexibility series products, our professional design team can provide economical and timely product solutions to our OEM customers. In addition, as our power systems meet all appropriate environmental requirements and safety standards, our smaller OEM customers can expedite the process of independent safety agency testing by companies such as Underwriters Laboratories, and save considerable expense. By offering OEM customers choices with our custom, flexibility series, high-grade and high-efficiency power system solutions, we believe we provide certain strategic advantages over our competitors. 

&#160; 

Digital Power Limited (Gresham Power Electronics) 

&#160; 

Digital Power Limited, our wholly-owned subsidiary organized and headquartered in Salisbury, United Kingdom , designs, manufactures, and distributes switching power supplies, uninterruptible power supplies, and power conversion and distribution equipment frequency converters for the commercial and military markets, under the name Gresham Power Electronics (&#8220;Gresham&#8221;). Frequency converters manufactured by Gresham are used by naval warships to convert their generated 60-cycle electricity supply to 400 cycles. This 400-cycle supply is used to power their critical equipment such as gyro, compass, and weapons systems. Gresham also designs and manufactures transformer rectifiers for naval use. Typically, these provide battery supported back up for critical DC systems, such as machinery and communications. In addition, higher power rectifiers are used for the starting and servicing of helicopters on naval vessels, and Gresham now supplies these as part of overall helicopter start and servicing systems. We believe that Gresham products add diversity to our product line, provide greater access to the United Kingdom and European markets, and strengthen our engineering and technical resources. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing and Testing 

&#160; 

Consistent with our strategy of focusing on custom design products and high-grade flexibility series products, we aim to maintain a high degree of flexibility in our manufacturing through the use of strategically focused contract manufacturers. We select contract manufacturers to ensure that they will meet our near term cost, delivery, and quality goals. In addition, we believe these relationships will eventually give us access to new markets and beneficial cross-licensing opportunities. The competitive nature of the power supply industry has placed continual downward pressure on selling prices. In order to achieve our low cost manufacturing goals with labor-intensive products, we have entered into manufacturing agreements with certain contract manufacturers domestically and in Asia. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

We sell certain products that are developed, manufactured and sold to us by Advice Electronics Ltd. (&#8220;Advice&#8221;), an Israeli company that acquired the assets and commercial operations of our major shareholder Telkoor Telecom Ltd. in January 2016. We entered into a manufacturing and royalty rights agreement with Advice in January 2016. This agreement formalized the business relationship between Advice and us in order to allow us to continue manufacturing certain of Telkoor&#8217;s products (currently owned by Advice) and the respective royalty charge. 

&#160; 

In June 2015, OHM Power Solutions Ltd. (&#8220;Ohm&#8221;) acquired from Telkoor its entire military assets and military operation. The asset sale between Telkoor and Ohm does not affect our ability to manufacturing and sell certain of Telkoor&#8217;s military products. 

&#160; 

We are continually improving our internal processes, while monitoring the processes of our contract manufacturers, to ensure the highest quality and consistent manufacturing of our power solutions. We test all of our products under stress operating conditions per defined test procedures we developed as part of the production process. This approach ensures that our customers can use our power supplies right out of the box. Customer specific testing services are offered with custom designed test stands to simulate operation within our customer applications. 

&#160; 

Compliance with international safety agency standards is critical in every application, and power solutions play a major role in meeting these compliance requirements. Our safety engineers and quality assurance teams help ensure that our custom products are designed to meet all safety requirements and are appropriately documented to expedite safety approval processes. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

We and our contract manufacturing partners are required to meet applicable regulatory, environmental, emissions, safety and other requirements where specified by the customer and accepted by us or as required by local regulatory or legal requirements. The products that we market and sell in Europe may be subject to the 2003 European Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (&#8220;RoHS&#8221;), which restricts the use of six hazardous materials in the manufacture of certain electronic and electrical equipment, as well as the 2002 European Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (&#8220;WEEE&#8221;), which determines collection, recycling and recovery goals for electrical goods. In July 2006, our industry began phasing in RoHS and WEEE requirements in most geographical markets with specific emphasis on consumer-based products. We believe that RoHS and WEEE-compliant components may be subject to longer lead-times and higher prices as the industry transitions to these new requirements. 

&#160; 

Some of our products are subject to ITAR regulation and restrictions, which is administered by the U.S. Department of State. ITAR controls not only the export of certain products specifically designed, modified, configured or adapted for military systems, but also the export of related technical data and defense services and foreign production. We obtain required export licenses for any exports subject to ITAR. Compliance with ITAR may require a prolonged period of time; if the process of obtaining required export licenses for products subject to ITAR is delayed, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any future restrictions or charges may be imposed by the United States or any other foreign country . In addition, from time to time, we enter into defense contracts to supply technology and products to foreign countries for programs that are funded and governed by the e U.S. Foreign Military Financing program. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We market our products directly through our internal sales force as well as through our channel partners including independent manufacturer representatives (Reps) and distributors. Each manufacturing Rep promotes our products in a particular assigned geographic territory. Generally, the Rep has the opportunity to earn exclusive access to all potential customers in the assigned territory as a result of achieving its marketing and sales goals as defined in the representative agreement. Our manufacturer representative agreements provide for a commission equal to 5% of gross sales of new &#8220;design-in&#8221; and 1.75% of gross sales for retention, payable after products were shipped to the customer in the assigned territory. Typically, either we or the Reps are entitled to terminate the Rep agreement upon 30 days&#8217; written notice. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Historically, we have also sold products through multiple power focused distributors. Distributors are not assigned to a particular geographical territory. Each of these arrangements can be terminated by either party upon 30 days&#8217; written notice. 

&#160; 

We provide comprehensive collateral including product data sheets, participation in trade shows, and our website, www.digipwr.com. We use our website to emphasize our capabilities and marketing direction. All products specifications are uploaded onto our website and accessible to the marketplace. We will continue to enhance our website by adding more features and functionalities, such as e-commerce, that will allow our customers to make direct purchases through our website. Our future promotional activities will likely include advertising in industry-specific publications, as well as public relations for our new products. 

&#160; 

Engineering and Technology 

&#160; 

Our engineering and product development efforts are primarily directed toward developing new products in connection with custom product design and modification of our standard power systems to provide a broad array of individual models. 

&#160; 

Our new custom product solutions are driven by our ability to provide to our customers advanced technology that meets their product needs and supports special operation and environmental requirements, with a short turnaround time and a very competitive price point. We believe that we are successfully executing our strategic account focus, as evidenced by the award of second and third generation product development contracts from some of these customers. Our standard contract for custom power solutions includes a multi-year high-volume production forecast that could allow us to secure long-term production guarantees while providing an environment that promotes the development of our IP portfolio. 

&#160; 

We also outsource some of our product development projects to engineering partners in order to achieve the best technological and product design results for the targeted application customer requirements. When required, we also modify standard products to meet specific customer requirements, including, but not limited to, redesigning commercial products to meet MIL-STD requirements for military applications based on commercial off the shelf (&#8220;COTS&#8221;) products and for other customized product requirements, when applicable. We continually seek to improve our product power density, adaptability, and efficiency, while attempting to anticipate changing market demands for increased functionality, such as PFC controlled DSP, customized firmware and improved EMI (electromagnetic interference) filtering. We continue to attempt to differentiate all of our products from commodity-type products by enhancing, modifying and customizing our existing product portfolio, using our engineering integrating laboratory located in California. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The power system solutions industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition. Our competition includes hundreds of companies located throughout the world, some of which have advantages over us in terms of labor and component costs, and some of which may offer products comparable in quality to ours. Many of our competitors, including Bel Fuse), Artesyn Embedded Technologies, TDK-Lambda, Delta Electronics, Murata and Mean-Well Power Supplies, have substantially greater fiscal and marketing resources and geographic presence than we do. If we are successful in increasing our revenues, competitors may notice and increase competition efforts with our customers. We also face competition from current and prospective customers who may decide to internally design and manufacture power supplies needed for their products. Furthermore, certain larger OEMs tend to contract only with larger power supply manufacturers. 

&#160; 

We anticipate in the current economic situation, that additional competitors may enter into strategic alliances or even acquisitions. Competition could thus become more problematic if consolidation trends in the electronics industry continue and some of the OEMs to whom we sell our products are acquired by larger OEMs. To remain competitive, we must continue to compete favorably on the basis of value by providing reliable manufacturing, offering customer-driven engineering services including custom design and manufacturing, continuously improving quality and reliability levels, and offering flexible and reliable delivery schedules. 

&#160; 

We believe that our power system solutions and advanced technology is superior to our competitors&#8217; power supplies mainly because they use the latest power technology processing and controls which make these power supplies highly customized and efficient. The power-to-volume ratio, makes our power solutions more compact compared to what is offered by our competitors and is suitable in custom infrastructures to meet our customers&#8217; requirements. 

&#160; 

Another advantage of our power system solutions product line is based on the &#8220;Flexible&#8221; series that employs adjustable power range and a selectable number of output product design platforms. We believe we have a competitive position with our targeted customers who need a high-quality, compact product, which can be readily modified to meet the customer&#8217;s unique requirements. We have designed the base model power system platform so that it can be quickly and economically modified and adapted to the specific power needs of any hosting platform or OEM. This &#8220;flexibility&#8221; approach has allowed us to provide samples of modified power systems to OEM customers only a few days after initial consultation, an important capability given the emphasis placed by OEMs on &#8220;time to market.&#8221; It also results in very low non-recurring engineering (&#8220;NRE&#8221;) expenses. Because of reduced NRE expenses, we do not generally charge our OEM customers for NRE related to tailoring a power system to a customer&#8217;s specific requirements. We believe this gives us an advantage over our competitors, many of which charge their customers for NRE expenses. 

&#160; 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

The raw materials for power supplies principally consist of electronic components. These raw materials are available from a variety of sources, and thus we are not dependent on any one supplier. We generally allow our subcontractors to purchase components based on orders received or forecasts to minimize our risk of unusable inventory. To the extent necessary, we may allow them to procure materials prior to orders received to obtain shorter lead times and to achieve quantity discounts following a risk assessment. In addition, we have decided to directly procure certain long lead-time electronic components in an effort to reduce our lead-time. 

&#160; 

Many raw material vendors have reduced capacities, closed production lines and, in some cases, even discontinued their operations. As a result, some materials are no longer available to support some of our products, thereby requiring us to search for cross materials or, even worse, redesign some of our products to support currently-available materials. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, industry expertise, confidential procedures, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We believe that because our products are continually updated and revised, obtaining patents would be costly and not beneficial. However, in the future, as we continue to develop unique core technology, we may seek to obtain patents for some of the core technology. On July 10, 2012, our trademark, &#8220;DP Digital Power Flexible Power&#8221; was registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 26 employees located in the United States and the United Kingdom, of whom six were engaged in engineering and product development, seven in sales and marketing, seven in general operations and six in general administration and finance. All but two of these employees are employed on a full-time basis. None of our employees are currently represented by a trade union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good . 

&#160;
