Salon is an online news website committed to fearless journalism and to making the conversation smarter.

&#160; 

Salon was originally incorporated in July 1995 in the State of California and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1999. In 1999, we had our initial public offering. In 2001, we adopted the name Salon Media Group, Inc. Our common stock is traded in the over-the-counter market and our stock symbol is SLNM.PK. 

&#160; 

Highlights from Fiscal Year 2016 

&#160;

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 (&#8220;fiscal year 2016&#8221;), we continued to execute our business strategy (see &#8220;Salon Strategy&#8221; below) to broaden our editorial coverage in order to attract a larger audience, which in turn should attract more advertising, and increase our revenues. Our focus on high quality editorial attracted a continued robust audience to our Website in fiscal year 2016, and we regularly reached new traffic milestones throughout the year. However, we faced increased competition from both new and larger websites for online advertising campaigns, while industry trends shifted toward increased use of agency and software-based approaches to buying online advertising. As a result, our direct ad sales have declined, and we have increasingly relied on third-party agencies to sell ads on our Website through programmatic advertising open marketplaces. The highlights of our fiscal year 2016 are listed below: 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Total revenue in the fiscal year 2016 increased 41% to $7.0 million. We have been working on strategies to better monetize our Website and increase advertising revenues. The digital advertising landscape has shifted considerably over the past year, and as advertisers have increasingly focused their attention on video and programmatic selling, we have increased our efforts in those areas. In fiscal year 2016, 67% of our advertising revenue was generated by programmatic selling, and 33% by our direct sales team which continues to focus mostly on high impact and higher cost-per-thousand-impression (&#8220;CPM&#8221;) video advertising. With the recent launch of Facebook&#8217;s ad sharing program, we will begin to monetize Salon content that is posted away from our website. We believe these strategies should help us to increase our revenues in fiscal year 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Net loss for the fiscal year 2016 was $2.0 million, a 50% decrease from $3.9 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 (&#8220;fiscal year 2015&#8221;). The decrease in losses resulted from an increase in revenues and relatively stable operating expenses of $8.9 million for the corresponding periods. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

The launch of our editorial video production department was a highlight of fiscal year 2016. In September 2015, we launched original video content focused on news, politics and entertainment. Our goal is to add high quality diversified content to our Website, and to attract premium video advertising that commands higher CPMs as compared to display advertising. More than 250 original videos were produced during the March quarter. A number of original videos went viral on Facebook: Patrice Waite&#8217;s story about Donald Trump contradicting himself about violence at his rallies garnered more than 14 million views on Facebook, Asha Parker&#8217;s mash up of Donald Trump and scenes from the Big Lebowski has been viewed more than 16 million times, and Janet Upadhye&#8217;s story about the political apathy of American youth got more than 40 million views. In total, more than 10 videos were viewed in excess of 1 million times, and many more were viewed more than 100,000 times. We will continue to assess and refine the video product based on user adoption. These videos complement Salon&#8217;s brand of fearless journalism that makes the conversation smarter, and are designed for maximum share-ability on social media sites. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

We reached several new traffic milestones. Our peak monthly users for Salon.com (or, the &#8220;Website&#8221;) traffic in fiscal year 2016 was in June 2015 when we recorded 19.6 million users, as measured by Google Analytics. In total, the average number of monthly users in fiscal year 2016 was 16.6 million, compared to 16.9 million in fiscal year 2015, a decrease of 2%. Unique visitors as measured by comScore (U.S. desktop) reached a high of 5.2 million in June 2015 and for the fiscal year ended March 2016 averaged 4.1 million, a decrease of 8% compared to 4.5 million average in fiscal year 2015. The difference between the two sources is that comScore uses a panel-centric method for counting unique visitors in the U.S. market rather than the tagging technology used by Google to measure global users. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

In August, Salon recognized the Writers Guild of America, East, Inc. (&#8220;WGAE&#8221;) as the collective bargaining representative of our non-supervisory editorial staff. We commenced collective bargaining with the WGAE in November 2015. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

We were proud to be honored for our excellence in journalism during the fiscal year. Salon was an honoree for the 2016 Webby Awards for its Online Film &#38; Video, Video Remixes and Mashups category, for our Donald Trump/Big Lebowski mashup. Lindsay Abrams was honored by the Audubon Society as one of its "Women Greening Journalism" at their annual Women in Conservation luncheon. Columnist Brittney Cooper was identified as part of the "emerging black intelligentsia" by The New Republic in September. Damon Tweedy&#39;s "Being Black Can Be Bad for Your Health" named as part of "The 13 Biggest Health Stories of 2015" by Healthline. We were also proud that Chauncey DeVega&#39;s piece on race, terrorism and the Planned Parenthood shooting was named among most essential writing by a person of color in 2015 by the HuffingtonPost. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Mobile users accounted for 61.8% of all users in March 2016, which is up slightly from 59.4% in December 2015 and 58.7% in March 2015. We continue to have a company-wide focus on our users&#8217; mobile needs, especially quick and easy access to fast-loading content optimized for better readability on smaller screens. In the 2015 fiscal year, we redesigned our mobile applications (&#8220;apps&#8221;) and iteratively integrated native advertising solutions to better monetize them. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Social media continues to be a major source of referral traffic, at approximately 38.5% of Website visitors as of March 31, 2016, and a significant focus across the Company. We make regular updates to the Website to optimize content to be shared on social media with a special focus on our mobile platforms. In March 2016, we had approximately 881,000 Facebook &#8220;likes,&#8221; and 576,000 Twitter followers. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Our direct advertising team continued to focus on high value campaigns that incorporated custom creative applications, pre-roll video advertising and seamless video integrations. More than 75% of our advertising campaigns fell in two categories: branded consumer and entertainment. Major advertising clients in fiscal year 2016 included Amazon, Panera, Ally Bank, Cadillac, PBS, Audible, and Hulu, for which we created an interactive crossword and advent calendar to promote &#8220;Seinfeld.&#8221; which won an OMMA award for best integrated entertainment online campaign. 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

We continually work toward leaner, more efficient technological systems through automation, improved architecture and adoption of emerging best practices. Throughout the year, we made technological updates to our browser, tablet, mobile, app and watch platforms with a focus on video, mobile and advertising and ad blocking. 

&#160; 

Salon Strategy 

&#160; 

In May 2016, we adopted a new strategy alongside the appointment of Jordan Hoffner as Chief Executive Officer. Our strategy focuses on improving monetization of our user base by innovating our ad technology in order to better match our highly educated and affluent users with advertisers. In the past few years, we have successfully grown our user base, which in fiscal year 2016 averaged 16.6 million users per month, and reached an all-time high of 19.6 million unique users in June 2015. Our number of users translates to our number of viewer impressions that can be sold to our advertisers, and offers opportunities to develop business relationships with companies that want access to our attractive user base. We currently sell our impressions to advertisers programmatically based on Run of Site private marketplaces, or at times, based on editorial content that falls in a particular vertical such as &#8220;Movies&#8221; or &#8220;Innovation.&#8221; The CPM is driven by market demand for our content, and the general demographics of our audience. Going forward, the CPM that we can charge our advertisers will increasingly be based on our ability to deliver highly targeted and defined users to our advertiser, and we expect to achieve higher CPMs as we can deliver more detailed information about our users. 

&#160; 

Our strategy is predicated on the following core principles: (1) create high quality diversified content that meets our users&#8217; and advertisers&#8217; interests; (2) hire the best possible talent to create centers of excellence and (3) innovate to bring great products to our users and advertisers. Our focus on these core principals underpins our goal to continue to grow our user base, and to develop new strategies around Website monetization that will provide opportunity for future growth. 

&#160; 

In fiscal year 2017, our goal is to continue our mission of creating fearless journalism and making the conversation smarter, while anticipating continued shifts in the online advertising market to better monetize our Website. To reach our goals, and to achieve profitability, we will push ahead in the following areas: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; 

Develop a broader mix of provocative content in addition to the core areas of news and politics, building off the original definition of a &#8220;salon&#8221; as a center of intellectual discussion 

&#160; &#9679; 

Deepen our editorial coverage by adopting a broader array of story telling methods, such as expanding our video content, and adding audio and other visual products, with a unwavering commitment to high quality content and fearless journalism 

&#160; &#9679; 

Integrate into our advertising approach a deeper focus on new advertising products that match our high quality user with appropriate advertisers using data and innovative ad products 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Develop a Broader Mix of Provocative Content 

&#160; 

We target an educated, culturally engaged audience interested in original thinking and smart commentary. We pursue that audience by featuring a diverse array of voices and perspectives, and covering a wide range of topics including News, Politics, Business, Technology, Life, Entertainment, Sustainability and Innovation. Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days per year, Salon invites users to immerse themselves in thought-provoking content that impassions and empowers them to be the intellectual and cultural leaders of our time . 

&#160; 

In fiscal year 2016, we continued to expand our breaking news coverage with a focus on politics ahead of the 2016 Presidential Election. Using data analytics in real-time, we can assess where our users&#8217; interests are shifting, and respond by determining content, site layout and structure to best suit their needs in the moment. In fiscal year 2017, we intend to respond to users&#8217; interests by hosting more dynamic content, such as video, slideshows and images, as well as by expanding into content areas such as business and lifestyle. We will expand into new content areas by reallocating internal resources, as well as continue to have content partnerships to diversify our content offerings across various verticals. 

&#160; 

As we continue to focus our editorial to our users&#8217; needs, we seek to grow unique visitors to our Website since the resulting page views serve as a platform for advertising impressions, a key driver of our revenue growth. 

&#160; 

Develop Innovative, User-Oriented Products 

&#160; 

We continually need fresh content and new ideas to attract readers to our Website. We plan to continue to focus on developing our audience through a combination of editorial enhancements, increased dynamic content and new user-focused functionalities and products. We are continually evaluating the needs of our users and trying to adjust and create new solutions to meet their needs. &#160; 

&#160; 

Video is popular with our users, and as a result in fiscal year 2016 we launched Salon branded video content. The success of this launch has led us to explore ways to offer more video and integrate it more seamlessly into our Website. In fiscal year 2017, in order to achieve widespread video integration, we are expanding our video editorial team, exploring additional partnerships to gain access to premium video content, and implementing new technology to improve viewability. Video is in high demand with our advertisers. In fiscal year 2016, 85% of our direct advertisers incorporated video into their campaigns. We plan to monetize video through sale of advertising pre-roll via direct and programmatic advertising partnerships, and through syndication of our video content. 

&#160; 

Web browsers and applications on mobile platforms are a significant area of audience growth and ad revenue in the online news industry, in particular as social media users have increasingly adopted usage on their mobile phones. Our users continue to move to mobile at record rates, and as of March 2016, mobile browsers accounted for 61.8%, of our unique visitors. Social media has also become a key driver of users for us, consistent with trends for other online news sites. Traffic from Facebook alone grew by over 32% since March 2014. The increase in Website traffic from social media was underpinned by the significant increases in the number of Facebook &#8220;likes&#8221; to more than 881,000, and monthly reach of more than 80 million (defined as a user who viewed or interacted with our content) on the Facebook platform in March 2016. In fiscal year 2017, we plan to continue our efforts to build our audience on social media, and place more emphasis on other emerging platforms, through a continuation of the strategies we have employed in the past two years. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In fiscal year 2017, we are working on a Website and advertising architecture redesign aimed at improving the user experience. As part of this effort, we will continue exploring new products that meet the immediate needs of our mobile users, building out new advertising products for video and mobile and improving our security and scaling capabilities. 

&#160; 

A Deeper Focus on New Advertising Products that Match our User with Appropriate Advertisers 

&#160; 

In order to expand our base of advertisers and increase our advertising revenues, we plan to integrate into our advertising approach a deeper focus on new advertising products that match our high quality user with appropriate advertisers using data and innovative ad products . This includes adding software and data capabilities to better understand our users and match their interests with advertisers more closely. 

&#160; 

Path to Profitability 

&#160; 

Although we reduced our losses in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015, we did not achieve our goal of profitability so will continue to make adjustments to our revenue model in order to increase advertising revenues. We have taken advantage of the shift in online advertising to programmatic marketplaces that are driven by software to purchase digital advertising space. In fiscal year 2016, our programmatic advertising revenues increased 59% compared to fiscal year 2015, and accounted for 67% of our advertising revenues as compared to 56% in fiscal year 2015. We will be re-architecting our programmatic platform to improve the match between advertisers and users, and will invest greater resources into this business area to optimize further our advertising capabilities. We believe the adjustments we are making to our advertising sales approach will allow further growth in programmatic advertising revenues in fiscal year 2017. 

&#160; 

We continue to believe that our focus on excellence in our core editorial product can attract a high demographic audience and deliver value to our advertising clients. Our users consist of a global community that is demanding and engaged. They are considered influencers in public policy, culture, art, technology and fashion. Advertisers evaluate a website based on its scale (number of impressions), and the type of ads that are offered (high impact, such as video, sponsored content and content that may be otherwise tied to nearby ads, versus display only.) Advertisers typically seek to attract a specified demographic age, gender, socio-economic background, and education. We believe that improved information and targeting of our user profile will make our Website a more valuable media property for advertisers and retailers who are allocating marketing resources to target consumers online who have our demographic profile. 

&#160; 

We work with our advertising clients to reach this attractive audience and tailor advertising to their needs. Through our direct sales team, we have increasingly focused our ad implementations on customized editorial content, mostly in a combination of written editorial, video and slideshows, that promote an advertiser&#8217;s brand and are shown on our Website as &#8220;sponsored.&#8221; As a result, nearly 90 % of our advertising campaigns in fiscal year 2016 included high-impact rich media and sponsored content. In fiscal year 2017, we plan to continue to expand our custom ad integration, and broaden our sponsored content offerings, with a special focus on video and mobile products. 

&#160; 

Due to an industry shift in advertising dollars toward programmatic and video advertising, our direct advertising declined 2% and programmatic advertising increased 59% leading to total advertising revenues increasing 33% in fiscal year 2016. At the same time, our production costs remained constant from a year ago, leading to decreased losses. To maintain this trend, we will continue to drive revenue growth as described above, while closely monitoring our operating expenses, and re-evaluate costs where we do not see clear productivity gains. As a result, we have discontinued spending in marketing that we felt was not generating sufficient revenue opportunity, streamlined our editorial workforce and made changes to the structure of our sales team. Given these changes, we anticipate that fiscal year 2017 will better align production costs with our revenue potential in an effort to reach profitability.

OUR BUSINESS 

&#160;

We pursue that audience by featuring a diverse array of voices and perspectives, and covering a wide range of topics including politics, race, religion, culture, entertainment, sustainability, innovation, technology and business. 

&#160;

Salon.com Website 

&#160; 

News 

&#160; Breaking news fast &#8211; and what it means. Whether it&#39;s Charlie Hebdo, Ferguson, the Josh Duggar and Bill Cosby scandals, or debates over important foreign policy issues, we surround stories people want to talk about as they happen &#8211; with dedicated bloggers, extensive videos, and smart columnists who put important news into immediate context. 

Politics 

&#160; Fearless, independent and sophisticated coverage of the most important stories from Washington and around the world, delivered by big-name veterans like Amanda Marcotte and Andrew O&#8217;Hehir, and the brightest new analysts on the Web (Heather Digby Parton, Simon Maloy, Ben Norton and more). Our political coverage starts early in the morning with our Opening Shot columns, and is updated all day with new pieces, all designed to drive the conversation &#8211; and keep our readers ahead of it. 

Arts &#38; 

Culture 

&#160; Our writers and critics are just as obsessed with "The Americans," "Girls,&#8221; &#8220;Game of Thrones," and the coolest and hottest new books and movies as our readers are. Our entertainment coverage is edgy, exhaustive and fast, and we are just as determined to get to the latest viral video first as we are to mine the intersections between culture and politics. Our writers include Andrew O&#8217;Hehir (film), Sonia Saraiya (TV), and Mary Beth Williams, Scott Timberg (pop culture). 

Life 

&#160; Our popular life essays go in-depth on the most complicated and deeply personal topics &#8211; sex, parenting, family, relationships, religion, work and so many more &#8211; and are written both by famous writers like Anne Lamott and Jennifer Egan, as well as daring and interesting new voices. 

Sustainability 

and Innovation 

&#160; We launched these verticals in 2013 and it immediately became one of our most well-read sections. Our sustainability and innovation verticals combine the personal and the political &#8211; issues of climate change, the future of energy, organic food, and the politicization of science all receive authoritative. The section also includes the &#8220;Dream City&#8221; column, about how we design cities of the future to meet the values of today, written by Henry Grabar. 

Tech 

&#160; Salon Tech goes beyond just gadgets and gee-whiz stories to get at how technology is changing our lives and workplaces &#8211; in increasingly complicated ways. In addition to the staff writers and book excerpts from the hottest and newest titles, the section includes content from sites like The Daily Dot, staff aggregation and AP wires. 

Business 

&#160; Combines coverage of labor and income inequality issues from our politics writers with high-quality regular contributors (Robert Reich, Jared Bernstein) and book excerpts, content partners (International Business Times, NewDeal 2.0), staff aggregation and AP wires. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Revenue Sources 

&#160; 

Advertising is our primary source of revenue. Internet advertising revenues accounted for 86% of revenues in fiscal year 2016. From June 2001 until June 2012, our other main source of revenue was from subscriptions. Due to a tepid response from users, new subscriptions and renewals were no longer accepted as of June 2012, and the wind down of our subscription service was completed in fiscal year 2015. Revenue from referring users to third party websites primarily accounted for the remainder 14% of revenues in fiscal year 2016. 

&#160; 

Internet advertising is affected by broad economic conditions, like other forms of advertising, but overall it has continued its upward trend even through the Great Recession. According to the 2015 IAB Internet Advertising Revenue Report (the &#8220;IAB Study&#8221;) conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the compound annual growth rate (&#8220;CAGR&#8221;) over the past ten years for Internet advertising in the United States was 17%, which has significantly outpaced the U.S. current dollar GDP growth of 3% over the same period. Furthermore, since 2010, Internet advertising growth was fueled by a 100% CAGR in mobile, compared to a 9% growth in non-mobile revenues. Internet advertising revenue in the United States totaled $59.6 billion in 2015, a 20.4% increase from $49.5 billion 2014. In the quarter ended December 2015, the sources for advertising revenues were non-mobile search (32%), mobile (including search, display and video formats) (40%), non-mobile display advertising (22%), classifieds ( 4%) and lead generation ( 2%). Notably, mobile advertising grew 77% in 2015, jumping to the largest ad format. Within the non-mobile display advertising segment, which accounts for a significant part of our revenues, banner ads accounted for 12%, digital video for 7%, rich media for 2% and sponsorship for 1% of advertising revenues. 

&#160; 

The bulk of online advertising remains concentrated in a relatively small number of dominant Internet companies, with the top ten companies accounting for 75% of online advertising in the December 2015 quarter, and another 9% captured by the next tier of companies ranked 11 th through 25 th . Therefore, we believe our market opportunity falls roughly at 16% of the online advertising market, or $9.5 billion. 

&#160; 

The primary factor in our ability to increase our advertising revenues in future periods is growth in our audience. Attracting more unique visitors to our Website is important because these users generate additional page views, and each page view becomes a potential platform for advertisements. Advertising comprises video, banners, rich media, and other interactive ads across our desktop, tablet, mobile browser and apps platforms. Advertisers pay for advertising based on a cost-per-thousand-impression (&#8220;CPM&#8221;), and different platforms attract different CPMs. CPMs for mobile have been less than for desktop. Videos and sponsored content on mobile devices continue to grow in popularity and can demand a higher CPM. We believe that continuing to add videos and sponsored content to our mobile platform and improving and optimizing the platform&#8217;s design will help increase revenues from our mobile platform. 

&#160;

Overall, monthly unique visitors to our Website have grown from 6.3 million in March 31, 2011, to 17.7 million in March 31, 2016, a cumulative growth rate of 181% over the past six fiscal years. Our full year average monthly unique visitors was 5.4 million, 6.4 million, 10.6 million, 11.2 million, 16.9 million and 16.6 million in fiscal years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. This growth reflects an increase in content areas on our Website over the same period, as well as improved search engine optimization and social media outreach. The table below reflects unique monthly visitors to our Website from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2016. Unique visitors in the period from March 2011 to May 2013 included traffic to an affiliated website that has since been shut down.

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

As a media Website that competes against much larger websites, we have sought to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace by offering customized, innovative and integrated advertising products that appeal to users and seamlessly and organically incorporate our advertising clients and their objectives into our Website. Our content rich environment offers advertisers the opportunity to develop custom content programs, including video-rich implementations. Using a dedicated team of content producers, we collaborate closely with the advertiser to create original series, slideshows, infographics and more to bring brand content to users in an organic way. To ensure engagement, all content is available cross-platform and supported by our promotional platforms and social profiles. 

&#160; 

We have also built a suite of ad products that includes, among others: our &#8220;homepage spotlight&#8221; that features custom content in-stream in our editorial news feed, advertiser-sponsored articles and content verticals, custom Website &#8220;skins&#8221; that can overlay an advertisement onto the background of our Website, &#8220;pushdowns&#8221; that temporarily move the editorial content below an ad while it is being served, video overlays and in-stream video modules, a multi-media content module and a social feed module. This variety of products has given our advertisers multiple options to speak to and engage with our influential audience. 

&#160; 

Our sales office is located in New York, with six advertising sales and operations employees as of March 31, 2016, of which four actively solicit orders. 

&#160; 

Product Development 

&#160; 

We recognize that users come to the site for online news, reporting, opinion and an engaging, active community of writers, users and commenters. Users engage with the site through desktop computers, mobile phones and social networking platforms and other referral partners. To meet users&#8217; rapidly evolving online media needs, we are continually innovating and developing our Website, mobile Website and social media presence &#8211; by adding new features, design updates and technologies that improve the user experience, speed and search engine optimization. We have developed an internal culture of innovation where the Edit, Technology and Sales teams collaborate on product development. In fiscal year 2013, Salon implemented its mobile application strategy with the launch of its responsive mobile browser site and release of Apple and Android mobile applications. In fiscal year 2014, we continued to optimize the mobile browser experience, deploying updates to improve load time, design and layout for small screens. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In fiscal year 2015 we continued to make technological updates to our browser, tablet and mobile platforms with a focus on video presentation, mobile, advertising technologies and analytics integrations. We continued to make updates to our site recirculation and integrated with messaging app platforms such as Whatsapp and Tango. We optimized the site content for social media platforms, mobile and search engine optimization. &#160; We increased our site security and stability, by adding internal tools that provide powerful new techniques for site management, troubleshooting, and internal analytics. We began the process of shifting our browser site to utilize an API that provides comprehensive data source for all platforms. For the debut of the Salon App for Apple Watch, we launched a user notification system that allows editors to send breaking news alerts to users on our Apple Watch, iPhone and Android apps, and other emerging platforms. 

&#160; 

In fiscal year 2016, we worked on a Website redesign aimed at improving our users&#8217; experience. As part of this effort, we continued building out new advertising products for video and mobile, expanding our social media integration, improving our security and scaling capabilities, and exploring new products that meet the immediate needs of our mobile users. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The bulk of online advertising remains concentrated in a relatively small number of dominant Internet companies, with the top ten companies accounting for 75% of online advertising in the December 2015 quarter, and another 9% captured by the next tier of companies ranked 11 th through 25 th . Therefore, we believe our market opportunity falls roughly at 16% of the online advertising market, or $9.5 billion. We compete for advertising revenues with numerous websites, including major portals such as Yahoo and AOL, major search engines such as Google and Bing, major social networks such as Facebook and Twitter, and other online large media publications such as Buzzfeed, The Huffington Post, New York Times, Washington Post, MSNBC and CNN.com. We also compete with many smaller news and politics-oriented Websites, such as Slate, Gawker, The Daily Beast, The Atlantic, Talking Points Memo, Politico and Mother Jones for staff, audience and advertising sales. 

&#160; 

Infrastructure and Operations 

&#160; 

We have created a flexible publishing structure that enables us to develop our content while responding quickly to news events and to take advantage of the ease of distribution provided by the Internet. Our content is deployed on our proprietary software platform and captured in a database for reuse in Web and other formats. The content on our Website has been structured to facilitate being found by search engines, a key driver in increasing traffic to our Website, and optimized for sharing on social networks. During the past three years, we have improved the look and feel of our Website to increase appeal to our audience and we will continue to ongoing changes to our Website. 

&#160; 

Our Website is hosted on cloud-based virtual servers running open-source Linux operating systems and various open-source web and network software packages. Our top technical priority is the fast and reliable delivery of pages to our users. Our systems are designed to handle traffic growth and network failures by balancing the requests among several pools of servers across the globe that automatically scale to match traffic demands. We rely on multiple tiers of redundancy/failover and third-party Content Delivery Network to achieve our goal of 24 hours, seven-days-a-week Website uptime. Regular automated backups protect the integrity of our data. Our servers are continuously monitored by numerous third-party and open-source monitoring and alerting tools.

Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

Our success and ability to compete is dependent in part on the goodwill associated with our trademarks, trade names, service marks and other proprietary rights and on our ability to use U.S. laws to protect our intellectual property, including our original content, content provided by third parties, and content provided by columnists. We have a registered trademark on our Salon name and logo.

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 31, 2016, Salon has 50 full-time employees, and 3 part-time employees. We believe our relations with our employees are good. We started collective bargaining with our non-supervisory editorial employees in November 2015, and the results of this process are uncertain. Our future success is highly dependent on our ability to attract, hire, retain and motivate talented personnel.
