OUR COMPANY 

&#160; 

Unless the context otherwise indicates, the terms &#8220;Comstock,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;our Company&#8221; or &#8220;the Company&#8221; mean Comstock Mining Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

&#160; 

The Company is a producing, Nevada-based, gold and silver mining company with extensive, contiguous property in the historic Comstock and Silver City mining districts (collectively, the &#8220;Comstock District&#8221;). The Comstock District is located within the western portion of the Basin and Range Province of Nevada, between Reno and Carson City. The Company began acquiring properties and developing projects in the Comstock District in 2003. Since then, the Company has consolidated a substantial portion of the historic Comstock District, secured permits, built an infrastructure and brought exploration projects into production. The Company also received the 2015 Nevada Excellence in Mine Reclamation award, voted on unanimously by five participating Federal and State of Nevada agencies. 

&#160; 

Because of the Comstock District&#8217;s historical significance, the geology is well known and has been extensively studied by the Company, our advisors and many independent researchers. We have expanded our understanding of the geology of the project area through vigorous surface mapping and drill hole logging. The volume of geologic data is immense, and thus far the reliability has been excellent, particularly in the various Lucerne Mine areas. We have amassed a large library of historic data and detailed surface mapping of Comstock District properties and continue to obtain historic information from private and public sources. We use such data in conjunction with information obtained from our current mining operations, to target geological prospective exploration areas and plan exploratory drilling programs, including expanded surface and underground drilling. 

Our Lucerne Resource area is located in Storey County, Nevada, approximately three miles south of Virginia City and 30 miles southeast of Reno. Our Dayton Resource area is located in Lyon County, Nevada, approximately six miles south of Virginia City. Access to the properties is by State Route 341/342, a paved road. 

Our business plan is to deliver stockholder value by validating qualified resources (measured and indicated) and reserves (proven and probable) from our first two resource areas, Lucerne and Dayton, and significantly grow the commercial development of our operations through coordinated district wide plans that are economically feasible, socially responsible and operated in a lean and low cost manner. The plans are focused on expanding both the Lucerne and Dayton Mine plans, both with surface and underground development opportunities. The Company also plans on developing longer-term exploration plans for the remaining areas, which include the Spring Valley, Northern Extension, Northern Targets, and Occidental Target areas, subsequent to the exploration and development of Lucerne and Dayton. 

The Company achieved initial production and held its first pour of gold and silver on September 29, 2012. The Company produced approximately 22,925 &#32;gold equivalent ounces in 2014 , the Company&#8217;s second full year in production and 18,455 &#32;gold equivalent ounces in 2015 . That is, the Company produced 19,601 &#32;ounces of gold and 222,416 &#32;ounces of silver in 2014 &#32;and 15,451 &#32;ounces of gold and 221,723 &#32;ounces of silver in 2015 . 

The Company continues acquiring additional properties in the Comstock District, expanding its footprint and creating opportunities for further exploration, development and mining. The Company now owns or controls approximately 8,546 &#32;acres of mining claims and parcels in the Comstock and Silver City Districts. The acreage is comprised of approximately 2,245 &#32;acres of patented claims (private lands), surface parcels (private lands), and approximately 6,301 &#32;acres of unpatented Lode, Placer and Mill site mining claims, which the Bureau of Land Management (&#8220;BLM&#8221;) administers. 

The Company&#8217;s real estate segment owns significant non-mining properties, including Daney Ranch, the Gold Hill Hotel and related homes and cottages. The real estate segment consists of land, real estate rental properties and the Gold Hill Hotel consisting of a hotel, restaurant and a bar. On March 20, 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to lease the Gold Hill Hotel to independent operators while retaining ownership. The initial term of the lease agreement was effective on April 1, 2015, and ends in March 2020. The tenant may renew the lease for two extended terms of five years each. Lease payments are due in monthly installments. 

&#160; 

Financial information for each of our segments is disclosed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements. 

&#160; 

Current Projects 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s headquarters, mine operations and heap leach processing facility are in Storey County, Nevada, at 1200 American Flat Road and 117 American Flat Road, approximately three miles south of Virginia City, Nevada and 30 miles southeast of Reno, Nevada. The Company has identified six distinct target areas on its land holdings and has focused, to date, on the Lucerne Resource area (including surface and underground) and the Dayton Resource area. We anticipate developing exploration plans for the remaining areas, which include the Spring Valley, Northern Extension, Northern Targets, and Occidental Target areas, subsequent to the exploration and development of Lucerne and Dayton. The Company&#8217;s existing heap leach processing facility for gold and silver was redesigned and expanded in late 2013 and again in the fourth quarter of 2014, to accommodate production plans. 

&#160; 

The Lucerne Resource area has been the primary focus of the Company&#8217;s exploration and development efforts since 2007. It includes the previously mined Billie the Kid, Hartford and Lucerne mining claims, and extends east and northeasterly to the area of the historic Woodville bonanza, and north to the historic Justice and Keystone mines. The Company has the key mining permits required for mining this area. The Lucerne Resource area is approximately 5,000 feet long, with an average width of 600 feet, representing less than three percent of the land holdings controlled by the Company and is the site of our current production activities and ongoing exploration and development program. 

&#160; 

The Dayton Resource area is southwest of Silver City in Lyon County, Nevada. It generally includes the Dayton, Kossuth and Alhambra claims, including the old Dayton Consolidated mine workings, south to where the Kossuth claim crosses State Route 341. The historic Dayton mine was the last major underground mining operation in the Comstock District, before being closed after the War Production Board promulgated Limitation Order L-208, 7 F. R. 7992 on October 8, 1942, that closed down all gold mining operations in the United States and its territories. The Dayton Resource area ranks as one of the Company&#8217;s top exploration and potential mine production targets. In January 2014, the Lyon County Board of Commissioners approved a strategic master plan and zoning changes on the Dayton, Kossuth and Alhambra mining claims and other properties located in the Dayton Resource Area, enabling a more practical, comprehensive feasibility study for mining. Geological studies and development planning are currently underway utilizing data from the 30,818 feet of drilling completed in 2015, and data from prior drill programs. 

The Spring Valley exploration target lies at the southern end of the Comstock District, where the mineralized structures lie mostly concealed beneath a veneer of sediment gravels. The area includes the Kossuth patented claim south of State Route 341, the Dondero patented property, the Daney patented claim, the New Daney lode mining claims, and the Company&#8217;s placer mining claims in Spring Valley and Gold Canyon. 

&#160; 

The Northern Extension, Northern Targets and Occidental areas represent exploration target areas that contain many historic mining operations, including the Overman, Con Imperial, Caledonia, and Yellow Jacket mines, among others. Previous operators have explored the various mines in this area, some of which have led to mineralized material inventories. We believe that our consolidation of the Comstock District has provided us with opportunities to utilize the historical information available to identify drilling targets with significant potential.

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, and local laws and regulations in the United States, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances, and other matters. We have obtained or have pending applications for substantially all of those licenses, permits, and other authorizations currently required for our mining, exploration and other development programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations. Capital expenditures relating to compliance with laws and regulations that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, comprise a substantial part of our historical capital expenditures and our anticipated future capital expenditures. For example, we incur certain expenses and liabilities associated with our reclamation obligations. See &#8220;Reclamation&#8221; section below. 

&#160; 

Reclamation 

&#160; 

We are generally required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping, and re-vegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with plans reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. 

&#160; 

The Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS) 519A to 519A.280 and Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 519A.010 to 519A.415 promulgated by the Nevada State Environmental Commission and the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (&#8220;NDEP&#8221;), Bureau of Mining and Reclamation (&#8220;BMRR&#8221;) require a surety bond to be posted for mining projects so that after completion of the work on such mining projects, the sites are left safe, stable and capable of providing for a productive post-mining use. Over the past four years, the Company has provided a reclamation surety bond, through the Lexon Surety Group (&#8220;Lexon&#8221;), with the BMRR. The BMRR, with concurrence from Storey County, has approved our most recent reclamation plan, as revised, and our estimated total costs related thereto of approximately $11.6 million , that is, $7.1 million for BMRR and an additional $4.5 million reclamation surety bond, including $3.0 million with Storey County related to the move of State Route 342 and a $1.5 million surety bond with Storey County related to reclamation. For the years ended December 31, 2014 , and 2013 , the Company had provided estimates and surety bonds in the amounts of $8.6 million and $5.2 million, respectively. 

As part of the surety agreement, the Company agreed to pay a 2.0% &#32;annual bonding fee and has signed a corporate guarantee. The cash collateral percentage due to Lexon is approximately 25.0% &#32;or less of the current bond amount. The current bond amount with the State and County is $11.6 million . At December 31, 2015 , $2.5 million &#32;of the required collateral has been deposited. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete with other mineral exploration and mining companies in connection with the acquisition of gold and other mineral properties and the attraction and retention of human capital. Such competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than we do. 

History 

&#160; 

The Company began acquiring properties and developing projects in the Comstock District in 2003. The Company produced over 12,000 ounces of gold and over 53,000 ounces of silver from 2004-2006 from our existing Lucerne mine and American Flat heap leach processing facilities. Our test mining activities were concluded in January 2007, when based on our longer-term production plans, we prioritized land consolidation and mine planning. The Company restarted mining operations in the third quarter of 2012 and resumed pouring dor&#233; bars of silver and gold in September 2012. In 2014, the Company produced 22,925 &#32;gold equivalent ounces. In 2015 , the Company&#8217;s third full year in production, the Company produced 18,455 &#32;gold equivalent ounces, that is, 15,451 &#32;ounces of gold and 221,723 &#32;ounces of silver. 

&#160; 

Customers 

&#160; 

All accounts receivable amounts related to mining are due from a single customer. Substantially all mining revenues recorded to date relate to the same customer. As gold can be sold through numerous gold market traders worldwide, the Company is not economically dependent on a limited number of customers for the sale of its product. The real estate segment has numerous customers and is not dependent on any one customer. 

&#160; 

Financing Events 

&#160; 

During 2015 , the Company completed one equity financing transaction of $6.0 million &#32;(approximately $5.9 million, net of issuance costs) to be used to accelerate the drilling and development of the Lucerne underground program, accelerate planning and prerequisites for the next phase of Dayton drilling and development, and general corporate purposes. 

On March 6, 2015, the Company reached an agreement to draw on its $10 million revolving credit facility (the &#8220;Revolving Credit Facility&#8221;) with Auramet International, LLC (&#8220;Auramet&#8221;), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to $10 million, subject to satisfying certain conditions and obtaining certain consents. The proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility were used to accelerate the construction schedule for rerouting State Route 342, located in the Company&#8217;s Lucerne Resource Area, the first phase of which was completed in early June 2015, and the second phase was completed in November 2015. On March 6, 2015, the Company drew $5 million representing cash proceeds of approximately $4.4 million, net of prepaid interest of approximately $0.4 million, and other fees of approximately $0.2 million. On December 28, 2015, the Company and Auramet agreed to a re-advance under the Revolving Credit Facility evidenced by the Note and to extend up to $10 million of availability thereunder for the period from and after April 2016 to April 28, 2018. 

On May 12, 2015, the Company entered into a master lease agreement with Varilease Finance Inc. pursuant to which the Company obtained capital financing under a sale-leaseback transaction in the amount of $5 million. Due to certain types of continuing involvement, the Company was precluded from applying sale-leaseback accounting and has accounted for the transaction under the financing method. The Company&#8217;s obligations under the Varilease agreement are secured by an interest in the Company&#8217;s mining equipment in exchange for 24 &#32;monthly payments. Current payments are $247,830 &#32;per month. The total monthly payments will total the cash proceeds of $5 million &#32;and applicable interest and taxes.
