 Item 1. BUSINESS 

United States Steel Corporation (U. S. Steel) is an integrated steel producer of flat-rolled and tubular products with major production operations in North America and Europe. An integrated steel producer uses iron ore and coke as primary raw materials for steel production. U. S. Steel has annual raw steel production capability of 22.0 million net tons (17.0 million tons in the United States and 5.0 million tons in Europe), which reflects a reduction of 2.4 million tons as a result of the permanent shutdown of the blast furnace and associated steelmaking operations, along with most of the flat-rolled finishing operations at Fairfield Works, during the third quarter of 2015. According to worldsteel Association&#8217;s latest published statistics, U. S. Steel was the fifteenth largest steel producer in the world in 2014. U. S. Steel is also engaged in other business activities consisting primarily of railroad services and real estate operations. 

During 2015, we continued to transform U. S. Steel through the two phases of a focused execution on our stockholder value creation strategy: (1) earn the right to grow, and (2) drive and sustain profitable growth. Through a disciplined approach we refer to as &#8220;The Carnegie Way,&#8221; we continue working toward strengthening our balance sheet, with a strong focus on cash flow, liquidity, and financial flexibility. Based on this philosophy, we have launched a series of initiatives that we believe will enable us to add value, re-shape the Company, and improve our performance across our core business processes, including commercial, supply chain, manufacturing, procurement, innovation, and operational and functional support. We are on a mission to become an iconic industry leader, as we create a sustainable competitive advantage with a relentless focus on economic profit, our customers, cost structure and innovation. In pursuing our financial goals, we will not sacrifice our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship. We recognize that achieving this goal requires exemplary leadership and collaboration of all employees, and we are committed to attracting, developing and retaining a workforce with the talent and skills needed for our long-term success. 

The Company had a net loss of $1.6 billion in 2015, and faced significant price and volume headwinds, particularly in the second half of the year, but finished 2015 with adjusted EBITDA of $202 million despite a nearly $6 billion decrease in revenues from 2014. 

We made several difficult decisions in 2015 in response to the conditions in the markets we serve, including the permanent shut down of our steelmaking operations at Fairfield Works and the temporary idling of Granite City Works and our Keetac mining operations. We also had a significant number of lay-offs at other facilities that are operating at reduced rates. 

We continued to generate cash flow throughout 2015, finishing the year with $359 million of operating cash flow and repaid $379 million of debt in 2015. 

Our structured approach, using the Carnegie Way value creation methodology, gives us the confidence that we can continue to make progress and create value for our customers, and when we create value for our customers, we create value for all of our stakeholders - our stockholders, our suppliers, our employees and the communities where we do business. 

Segments 

U. S. Steel has three reportable operating segments: Flat-Rolled Products (Flat-Rolled), U. S. Steel Europe (USSE) and Tubular Products (Tubular). The results of our railroad and real estate businesses that do not constitute reportable segments are combined and disclosed in the Other Businesses category. 

The Flat-Rolled segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel&#8217;s integrated steel plants and equity investees in the United States involved in the production of slabs, rounds, strip mill plates, sheets and tin mill products, as well as all iron ore and coke production facilities in the United States. These operations primarily serve North American customers in the service center, conversion, transportation (including automotive), construction, container, and appliance and electrical markets. Flat-Rolled also supplies steel rounds and hot-rolled bands to Tubular. In the third quarter of 2015, the blast furnace and associated steelmaking operations along with most of the flat-rolled finishing operations at Fairfield Works were shutdown. Therefore, Flat-Rolled is currently not supplying rounds to Tubular. 

On September 16, 2014, U. S. Steel Canada, Inc. (USSC), a wholly owned subsidiary of U. S. Steel, applied for relief from its creditors pursuant to Canada&#8217;s Companies&#8217; Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA). As a result of USSC filing for CCAA protection (CCAA filing), U. S. Steel determined that USSC and its subsidiaries would be deconsolidated from U. S. Steel&#8217;s financial statements on a prospective basis effective as of the date of the CCAA filing. We recorded total non-cash charges of $392 million related to the write down of our retained interest and other charges in 2015 and $416 million &#32;in 2014 related to the deconsolidation of USSC. Subsequent to USSC's CCAA filing on September 16, 2014, the Flat-Rolled segment information does not include USSC, but transactions between U. S. Steel and USSC are considered related party transactions. 

Effective January 1, 2015, the Flat-Rolled segment was realigned to better service customer needs through the creation of five commercial entities to specifically address customers in the automotive, consumer, industrial, service center and mining market sectors. 

Beginning January 1, 2016, the Flat-Rolled segment has been further streamlined and consolidated to consist of three commercial entities: automotive, consumer, which includes the packaging, appliance and construction industries, and the combined industrial, service center and mining commercial entities. This realignment will not affect the Company's reportable segments as they currently exist. For further information, see Item 1. "Business Strategy." 

Flat-Rolled has annual raw steel production capability of 17.0 million tons. Prior to the permanent shut down of the Fairfield Flat-Rolled operations beginning in August 2015, the CCAA filing and the deconsolidation of USSC in September 2014, and the permanent shut down of the iron and steelmaking facilities at Hamilton Works in December 2013, annual raw steel production capability for Flat-Rolled was 19.4 million tons, 22.0 million tons and 24.3 million tons, respectively. Raw steel production was 11.3 million tons in 2015, 17.0 million tons in 2014 and 17.9 million tons in 2013. Raw steel production averaged 60 percent of capability in 2015, 80 percent of capability in 2014 and 74 percent of capability in 2013. 

The USSE segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel Ko&#353;ice (USSK), U. S. Steel&#8217;s integrated steel plant and coke production facilities in Slovakia. USSE primarily serves customers in the European construction, service center, conversion, container, transportation (including automotive), appliance and electrical, and oil, gas and petrochemical markets. USSE produces and sells slabs, sheet, strip mill plate, tin mill products and spiral welded pipe, as well as heating radiators and refractory ceramic materials. 

USSE has annual raw steel production capability of 5.0 million tons. USSE&#8217;s raw steel production was 4.7 million tons in 2015, 4.8 million tons in 2014, and 4.6 million tons in 2013. USSE&#8217;s raw steel production averaged 93 percent of capability in 2015, 96 percent of capability in 2014 and 92 percent of capability in 2013. 

The Tubular segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel&#8217;s tubular production facilities, primarily in the United States, and equity investees in the United States and Brazil. These operations produce and sell seamless and electric resistance welded (ERW) steel casing and tubing (commonly known as oil country tubular goods or OCTG), standard and line pipe and mechanical tubing and primarily serve customers in the oil, gas and petrochemical markets. Tubular&#8217;s annual production capability is 2.8 million tons and U. S. Steel is the largest domestic supplier of OCTG. U. S. Steel Tubular Products, Inc. (USSTP) is designing and developing a range of premium and semi-premium connections to address the growing needs for technical solutions to our end users' well site production challenges. USSTP also offers rig site services, which provides the technical expertise for proper installation of our tubular products and proprietary connections at the well site.

Business Strategy 

During 2015, we have continued to transform U. S. Steel through the two phases of a focused execution on our stockholder value creation strategy: (1) earn the right to grow, and (2) drive and sustain profitable growth. Through a disciplined approach we refer to as &#8220;The Carnegie Way,&#8221; we continue working toward strengthening our balance sheet, with a strong focus on cash flow, liquidity, and financial flexibility and have launched a series of initiatives that we believe will enable us to add value, re-shape the Company, and improve our performance across our core business processes, including commercial, supply chain, manufacturing, procurement, innovation, and operational and functional support. We are on a mission to become an iconic industry leader, as we create a sustainable competitive advantage with a relentless focus on economic profit, customers, cost structure and innovation. In pursuing our financial goals, we will not sacrifice our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship. We recognize that achieving this goal requires exemplary leadership and collaboration of all employees, and we are committed to attracting, developing and retaining a workforce with the talent and skills needed for our long-term success. 

As part of the Carnegie Way transformation process, during 2015, the Company's Flat-Rolled, USSE and Tubular reportable segments were realigned to target achieving the following strategic goals: 

&#8226; 

collaborate better with our customers to create and deliver smarter, more innovative relationships in order to be a more customer-centric global solutions provider; 

&#8226; 

provide focus to Carnegie Way projects within the operating units including reliability centered maintenance and quality, with a continued commitment to safety; and 

&#8226; 

continue earning the right to grow by creating clearer and more focused and effective accountability. 

&#160; 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a strategic review of our business. As a result of that review, we realigned certain portions of our business to strengthen customer intimacy, operational excellence, and personal and professional accountability, streamlining our executive management team, reducing costs, and integrating innovation within our accountable commercial entity structure. U. S. Steel continuously evaluates potential strategic and organizational opportunities, which may include the acquisition, divestiture or consolidation of assets. The Company will pursue opportunities based on the financial condition of the Company, its long-term strategy, and what the Board of Directors determines to be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders. 

Beginning January 1, 2016, the Company's Flat-Rolled facilities report through three streamlined and consolidated commercial entities: automotive, consumer, and the combined industrial, service center and mining commercial entities. 

The commercial entities have worked, and continue to work, to position the Company to be best-in-class in innovation, quality and providing customer service and solutions to our customers. The strategic move to position operations within the streamlined commercial entities enhances our ability to better hear the voice of the customer, ensuring that we deliver superior value and drive results in the markets we serve. 

&#160; 

This realignment will not affect the Company's reportable segments as they currently exist. 

Automotive Solutions is based at the Company's Automotive Center in Troy, Michigan, where the Company works jointly with customers to develop solutions using its expertise as well as the next generation of advanced high-strength steel to address challenges facing the automotive industry, including increased fuel economy standards and enhanced safety requirements. 

Consumer Solutions partners with customers in the appliance, packaging, container and construction markets. Consumer Solutions has a robust presence with our tin customers, who represent more than one quarter of this market category. Additional product lines within the market category include the Company's COR-TEN AZP&#174;, ACRYLUME&#174;, GALVALUME&#174; and Weathered Metals Series&#174;. 

Industrial, Service Center and Mining Solutions focuses on the Company's customers in the pipe and tube manufacturing market, the agricultural and industrial equipment markets, as well as operations relating to the Company's Minnesota Ore Operations facilities - Minntac in Mt. Iron, MN, and Keetac in Keewatin, MN, and the Company's iron ore equity joint ventures. U. S. Steel's integrated steel plants are the primary customers of Mining Solutions. 

USSE's customer focus has accelerated to further conform with the Company's Carnegie Way transformation efforts. 

The Tubular segment's commercial and manufacturing operations have been aligned to include customer solutions for the oil and gas industry, focusing on the end user customer from the Company's production facilities to rig well sites.

Environmental Stewardship 

Throughout its history, U. S. Steel has either led the industry or used methods consistent with prevailing industry practices in its commitment to environmental stewardship. We have implemented and continue to develop business practices that are environmentally efficient. We believe part of being a good corporate citizen requires a dedicated focus on how our industry affects the environment, and have taken the actions described below in furtherance of that goal. 

The Executive Environmental Committee, which is comprised of U. S. Steel officers and other key leaders, meets regularly to review environmental issues and compliance. Also, U. S. Steel, largely through the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI), the worldsteel Association and the European Confederation of Iron and Steel Industries (Eurofer), is involved in the promotion of cost effective environmental strategies through the development of appropriate air, water, waste and climate change laws and regulations at the local, state, national and international levels. 

We are committed to reducing emissions as well as our carbon footprint. We have investigated, created and implemented innovative, best practice solutions throughout U. S. Steel to manage and reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) &#32; emissions. We are also committed to investing in technologies to further improve the environmental performance of our steelmaking process. In addition, we continue to focus on implementing energy reduction strategies, use of efficient energy sources, waste reduction management and the utilization of by-product fuels. 

According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, relative to competing materials, steel has approximately one-fifth the carbon footprint of aluminum, one-twelfth the footprint of magnesium, and about one-ninth the footprint of carbon fiber composites. Our Advanced High Strength Steels used in today&#8217;s vehicles affords significant light-weighting opportunities. When comparing steel to aluminum in terms of sustainability, steel has a smaller carbon footprint and costs less. 

U. S. Steel has historically recycled between 4 and 5 million tons of purchased and produced steel scrap every year. Because of steel&#8217;s physical properties, our products can be recycled at the end of their useful life without loss of quality, contributing to steel&#8217;s high recycling rate and affordability. Comparatively, due to limitations in aluminum processing, very little recycled aluminum is included in aluminum sheet goods used for automotive or aircraft applications. This means that any increased use of aluminum sheet for high-end applications must come from greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive primary aluminum, which generates significantly more GHG emissions than steel. 

All of our major production facilities have Environmental Management Systems that are certified to the ISO 14001 Standard. This standard, published by the International Organization for Standardization, provides the framework for the measurement and improvement of environmental impacts of the certified facility. 

Commercial Strategy 

Our commercial strategy is focused on providing customer focused solutions with value-added steel products, including advanced high strength steels and coated sheets for the automotive and appliance industries, electrical steel sheets for the manufacture of motors and electrical equipment, galvanized and Galvalume &#174; &#32;sheets for construction, tin mill products for the container industry and OCTG and premium connections for the oil and gas industry, including steel for the North American shale oil and gas markets. 

We are committed to anticipating our customers' changing needs by developing new steel products and uses for steel that meet the evolving regulatory requirements imposed on them. In connection with this commitment, we have research centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Ko&#353;ice, Slovakia, an automotive center in Troy, Michigan and an innovation and technology center for Tubular products in Houston, Texas. The focus of these centers is to develop new products and work with our customers to better serve their needs. Examples of our customer focused product innovation include the development of advanced high strength steels, including Dual-Ten &#174; &#32;and Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steels, that provide high strength to meet automobile passenger safety requirements while significantly reducing weight to meet vehicle fuel efficiency requirements; and a line of premium and semi-premium tubular connections to meet our customers&#8217; increasingly complex needs for offshore and horizontal drilling. Designed and developed at the Innovation and Technology Center in Houston, USS- Liberty TC&#8482; is the first domestically made threaded and coupled premium connection with a metal-to-metal seal that has been tested to the 2014 version of API 5C5 CAL IV. USS- Liberty TC&#8482; was successfully installed by a subsidiary of Range Resources Corporation and is available to other energy producers. This work in premium connection development is supported by our investment in a new full scale 

tubular connection test frame located at Offshore Operations in Houston, Texas. Please refer to Item I. Business Strategy for further details of our commercial entities and related strategies. 

Capital Projects and Other Investments 

We are currently developing projects within our Flat-Rolled, USSE and Tubular segments, such as facility enhancements, advanced high strength steels and additional premium connections, that will further improve our ability to support our customers&#8217; evolving needs and increase our value-added product capabilities. We are nearing the completion of our efforts to implement an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to replace our existing information technology systems, which will enable us to operate more efficiently, and we anticipate this implementation will be completed in 2016. The completion of the ERP system is expected to provide further opportunities to streamline, standardize and centralize business processes in order to maximize cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations. 

With reduced pricing for iron ore, management is considering its options with respect to the Company's iron ore position in the United States. The Company is also exploring opportunities related to the availability of reasonably priced natural gas as an alternative to coke in the iron reduction process to improve our cost competitiveness, while reducing our dependence on coal and coke. After receiving the necessary authorizations from the Jefferson County Department of Health and the Alabama Department of Environmental Management for the Fairfield electric arc furnace (EAF) project, construction began in the second quarter of 2015, but due to challenging market conditions resulting from depressed oil prices and reduced oil rig counts, the construction of the Fairfield EAF has been delayed until market conditions improve. 

Workforce 

At U. S. Steel, we are committed to attracting, developing, and retaining a workforce of talented, diverse people &#8212; all working together to deliver superior results for our Company, stockholders, customers and communities. We regularly review our human capital needs and focus on the selection, development and retention of employees in order to sustain and enhance our competitive position in the markets we serve. 

Capital Structure and Liquidity 

Our primary financial goal is to enhance our capital structure, liquidity, and financial flexibility by deploying cash strategically as we earn the right to grow. Our cash deployment strategy includes maintaining a healthy pension plan; delivering operational excellence with a focus on safety, quality and reliability; and improving the outcomes of capital investments. In 2015, we implemented a program called "Quick Wins," to focus on low complexity, low dollar, high return capital projects, while at the same time, putting more focus and discipline around the business outcomes of larger, strategic projects. 

&#160; 

During 2015, U. S. Steel repaid $379 million of debt. We ended 2015 with $755 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and total liquidity of approximately $2.4 billion. 

Steel Industry Background and Competition 

U. S. Steel's competitive position may be affected by, among other things, differences among U. S. Steel's and its competitors' cost structure, labor costs, environmental remediation and compliance costs and the existence and magnitude of government subsidies. 

U. S. Steel competes with many North American and international steel producers. Competitors include integrated producers, which, like U. S. Steel, use iron ore and coke as the primary raw materials for steel production, as well as electric arc furnace (EAF) producers, which primarily use steel scrap and other iron-bearing feedstocks as raw materials. Global steel capacity has continued to increase, with some published sources estimating that steel capacity in China alone is at or is nearing one billion metric tons per year. In addition, other products, such as aluminum, plastics and composites, compete with steel in some applications. 

EAF producers typically require lower capital expenditures for construction of facilities and may have lower total employment costs; however, these competitive advantages may be minimized or eliminated by the cost of scrap when scrap prices are high. Some mini-mills utilize thin slab casting technology to produce flat-rolled products and are increasingly able to compete directly with integrated producers in a number of flat-rolled product applications previously produced only by integrated steelmakers. 

U. S. Steel provides defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefits to approximately 105,000 current employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Most of our other competitors do not have comparable retiree obligations. Effective December 31, 2015, the Company froze the defined benefit pension plans for non-union participants. 

The global steel industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity. 

U. S. Steel believes that our major North American and many European integrated steel competitors are confronted with substantially similar environmental regulatory conditions and thus does not believe that its relative position with regard to such competitors will be materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations. However, if the final regulations do not recognize the fact that the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create CO 2 &#32; emissions, our competitive position relative to mini-mills will be adversely impacted. Our competitive position compared to producers in developing nations such as China, Russia, Ukraine and India, will be harmed unless such nations require commensurate reductions in CO 2 &#32; emissions. Competing materials such as plastics may not be similarly impacted. The specific impact on each competitor will vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods. U. S. Steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to former and present operating locations and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Many of our competitors, including North American producers, or their successors, that have been the subject of bankruptcy relief have no or substantially lower liabilities for such environmental remediation matters. &#32; 

U. S. Steel faces competition from foreign steel producers, many of which are heavily subsidized by their governments and dump steel into the U.S. market. Trade-distorting policies and practices, coupled with global steel overcapacity, impact pricing in the U.S. market and influence the Company's ability to compete on a level playing field. For a detailed discussion of international trade issues impacting the Company and the actions the Company has taken to address them see Part II, "Item 7. - Management's Discussion and Analysis" for further details regarding U.S. Steel's international trade and global public policy. 

Facilities and Locations 

Flat-Rolled 

During 2015, U. S. Steel adjusted its operating levels at several of its Flat-Rolled operations as a result of unfavorable market conditions, primarily driven by dramatically lower oil prices, lower steel prices, and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, global overcapacity and imports on our operations. Customer order rates will determine the size and duration of any adjustments that we make at our Flat-Rolled operations during 2016.

In addition, U. S. Steel holds ownership interests in joint ventures that are developing real estate projects in Alabama, Maryland and Illinois. In 2014, U. S. Steel sold land and mineral rights in Alabama for approximately $55 million. 

&#32;Raw Materials and Energy 

As an integrated producer, U. S. Steel&#8217;s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore pellets and sinter ore, carbon units in the form of coal and coke (which is produced from coking coal) and steel scrap. U. S. Steel&#8217;s raw materials supply strategy consists of acquiring and expanding captive sources of certain primary raw materials and entering into flexible supply contracts for certain other raw materials at competitive market prices which are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions at the time. 

The amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products, the quality of raw materials and, to a lesser extent, differences among steel producing equipment. In broad terms, U. S. Steel consumes approximately 1.4 tons of coal to produce one ton of coke and then it consumes approximately 0.4 tons of coke, 0.3 tons of steel scrap (40 percent of which is internally generated) and 1.3 tons of iron ore pellets to produce one ton of raw steel. At normal operating levels, we also consume approximately 6 mmbtu&#8217;s of natural gas per ton produced. While we believe that these estimated consumption amounts are useful for planning purposes, and are presented to give a general sense of raw material and energy consumption related to steel production, substantial variations may occur. 

Iron Ore 

Iron Ore Production (a) &#160; 

(a) &#32;Includes our share of production from Hibbing and Tilden. The decrease in iron ore 

&#32;production from 2014 is primarily related to the temporary idling of our Keetac facility. 

The iron ore facilities at Minntac and Keetac contain an estimated 897 million short tons of recoverable reserves and our share of recoverable reserves at the Hibbing and Tilden joint ventures is 35 million short tons. Recoverable reserves are defined as the tons of product that can be used internally or delivered to a customer after considering mining and beneficiation or preparation losses. Minntac and Keetac&#8217;s annual capability and our share of annual capability for the Hibbing and Tilden joint ventures total approximately 25 million tons. Through our wholly owned operations and our share of joint ventures, we have iron ore pellet production capability that exceeds our steelmaking capability in the U.S. 

We sold iron ore pellets in 2015, 2014 and 2013 to third parties. Depending on our production requirements, inventory levels and other factors we may sell additional pellets in the future. 

Substantially all of USSE&#8217;s iron ore requirements are purchased from outside sources, primarily Russian and Ukrainian mining companies. However, in 2014, 2013 and prior years, USSE also received iron ore from U. S. Steel&#8217;s iron ore facilities in North America. We believe that supplies of iron ore adequate to meet USSE&#8217;s needs are available at competitive market prices. 

Coking Coal 

All of U. S. Steel&#8217;s coal requirements for our cokemaking facilities are purchased from outside sources. U. S. Steel has entered into multi-year contracts for a portion of Flat-Rolled&#8217;s coking coal requirements. Prices for these North American contracts for 2016 are set at what we believe are competitive market prices. Prices in subsequent years will be negotiated in accordance with contractual provisions on an annual basis at prevailing market prices or have fixed prices for a set time frame. 

Prices for European contracts are negotiated at defined intervals, usually quarterly. 

We believe that supplies of coking coal adequate to meet our needs are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. The main source of coking coal for Flat-Rolled is the United States, and sources for USSE include Poland, the Czech Republic, the United States, Russia, and Ukraine. 

Coke 

Coke Production (a) &#160; 

(a) &#32;The decrease in 2015 coke production from 2014 is due to the permanent shutdown of coke operations 

&#32;at Gary Works and Granite City Works. The decrease in 2014 coke production from 2013 is primarily due 

to the deconsolidation of USSC and the permanent shut down of two coke batteries at Gary Works. 

In North America, the Flat-Rolled segment operates a cokemaking facility at the Clairton Plant of Mon Valley Works. In May 2015, U. S. Steel closed the coke making operations at Gary Works and Granite City Works. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. At our Granite City Works, we also have a 15-year coke supply agreement with Gateway which began in 2009. North American coke production also included USSC prior to the CCAA filing on September 16, 2014. Effective December 4, 2014, the Company entered into an arrangement with USSC for the conversion of U. S. Steel's coal into coke at USSC's Hamilton coke battery. This arrangement was terminated as of December 31, 2015. In Europe, the USSE segment operates cokemaking facilities at USSK. Blast furnace injection of coal, natural gas and self-generated coke oven gas is also used to reduce coke usage. 

With Flat-Rolled&#8217;s cokemaking facilities and the Gateway long-term supply agreement, it has the capability to be self-sufficient with respect to its annual coke requirements at normal operating levels. Coke is purchased from, sold to, or swapped with suppliers and other end-users to adjust for production needs and reduce transportation costs. 

USSE is self-sufficient for coke at normal operating levels. 

Steel Scrap and Other Materials 

We believe supplies of steel scrap and other alloy and coating materials required to fulfill the requirements for Flat-Rolled and USSE are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. Generally, approximately 40 percent of our steel scrap requirements are internally generated through normal operations. 

Limestone 

All of Flat-Rolled&#8217;s and USSE's limestone requirements are purchased from outside sources. We believe that supplies of limestone adequate to meet our needs are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices. 

Zinc and Tin 

We believe that supplies of zinc and tin required to fulfill the requirements for Flat-Rolled and USSE are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. We routinely execute fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts for a portion of our expected business needs in order to partially manage our exposure to the volatility of the zinc and tin markets. 

Natural Gas 

All of U. S. Steel&#8217;s natural gas requirements are purchased from outside sources. 

We believe that adequate supplies to meet Flat-Rolled&#8217;s and Tubular's needs are available at competitive market prices. We routinely execute fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts for natural gas to partially manage our exposure to natural gas price increases. During 2015, approximately 78 percent of our natural gas purchases in Flat-Rolled were based on bids solicited on a monthly basis from various vendors; the remainder was made daily or with term agreements or with fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts. 

We believe that adequate natural gas supplies to meet USSE&#8217;s needs are available at competitive market prices. 

Both Flat-Rolled and USSE use self-generated coke oven and blast furnace gas to reduce consumption of natural gas. USSE also captures and consumes converter gas from its four steelmaking vessels. 

Industrial Gases 

U. S. Steel, with the exception of USSE, purchases industrial gas under long-term contracts with various suppliers. USSE owns and operates its own industrial gas facilities, but also may purchase industrial gases from time to time. 

Commercial Sales of Product 

U. S. Steel characterizes sales as contract sales if sold pursuant to an agreement with a defined volume and pricing and a duration of longer than three months, and as spot if sold without a defined volume and pricing agreement. In 2015, approximately 74 percent, 62 percent and 49 percent of sales by Flat-Rolled, USSE and Tubular, respectively, were contract sales. Some contract pricing agreements include fixed prices while others are adjusted periodically based upon published prices of steel products or cost components. 

Environmental Matters 

U. S. Steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating, and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations, related to release of hazardous materials, which in recent years have been mainly for process changes to meet Clean Air Act (CAA) obligations and similar obligations in Europe. 

Future compliance with carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) &#32;emission requirements may include substantial costs for emission allowances, restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal, natural gas and electricity generated by carbon based systems. Because we cannot predict what requirements ultimately will be imposed in the U.S. and Europe, it is difficult to estimate the likely impact on U. S. Steel, but it could be substantial. To the extent these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of U. S. Steel's products and services, operating results will be reduced. 

Our U.S. facilities are subject to environmental laws applicable in the U.S., including the CAA, the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as state and local laws and regulations. 

Air 

The CAA imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and civil and criminal enforcement sanctions. The CAA requires, among other things, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Standards. The EPA has developed various industry-specific MACT standards pursuant to this requirement. The CAA requires the EPA to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category of Hazardous Air Pollutants. The EPA also must conduct risk assessments on each source category that is already subject to MACT standards and determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks. 

While our operations are subject to several different categories of NESHAP and MACT standards, the principal impact of these standards on U. S. Steel operations includes those that are specific to cokemaking, ironmaking, steelmaking and iron ore processing. 

In September 2011, the EPA sent domestic integrated steel facilities, including U. S. Steel, an Information Collection Request for future rulemaking activities pursuant to the CAA. U. S. Steel responded to the request, and the EPA, as part of a voluntary remand that was granted by the D.C. Court of Appeals, is currently performing a review of the 

existing Iron and Steel MACT regulations. U. S. Steel and other integrated steel companies are in communication with the EPA on the review. 

Additionally, the EPA is required, pursuant to the CAA, to conduct a risk and technology review of the Coke Pushing, Quenching, and Battery Stack MACT. The EPA is currently working on developing an Information Collection Request to determine whether additional emissions reductions are necessary. Since the EPA has yet to determine if any changes to these MACTs are required, the impact, if any, on U. S. Steel cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 

The CAA also requires the EPA to develop and implement National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria pollutants, which include, among others, particulate matter (PM) - consisting of PM 10 &#32;and PM 2.5 , lead, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and ozone. Sulfur dioxide is the NAAQS criteria pollutant of most concern to the Company at this time. 

In June 2010, the EPA significantly lowered the primary NAAQS for sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) from 140 parts per billion (ppb) on a 24-hour basis to an hourly standard of 75 ppb. Subsequently, the EPA designated the areas in which Great Lakes Works and Mon Valley Works facilities are located as nonattainment with the 2010 for the SO 2 &#32;NAAQS. The non-attainment designation will require the facilities to implement operational and/or capital requirements to demonstrate attainment with the 2010 standard. In addition, the EPA is currently evaluating the attainment status for all other areas as required by a Consent Decree that the EPA entered with the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Counsel in March 2015 pursuant to a lawsuit filed by the non-governmental organizations. U. S. Steel is working with the affected regulatory agencies in completing the evaluation process as required by the Consent Decree. While U. S. Steel could face increased capital, operating and compliance costs, the operational and financial impact of the SO 2 &#32;NAAQS cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 

In October 2015, the EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. It is likely that EPA will designate some areas in which we operate as nonattainment with the 2015 standard, which could require reductions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from our operations in such designated areas. In April 2012, the EPA designated certain areas in which we operate as nonattainment with the 2008 ozone NAAQS of 75 pbb. The EPA is expected to publish an ozone implementation rule in 2016 that will address the effect of the 2008 standard and area designations in light of the lowering of the NAAQS in 2015. At this time, the operational and financial impact of the ozone NAAQSs cannot be reasonably estimated. 

On December 14, 2012, the EPA lowered the annual standard for PM 2.5 &#32;from 15 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) to 12 ug/m3, and retained the PM 2.5 &#32;24-hour and PM 10 &#32;NAAQS rules. In December 2014, the EPA designated some areas in which U. S. Steel operates as nonattainment with the 2012 annual PM2.5 standard. Because it is early in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) development stages, any impacts to U. S. Steel are not estimable at this time. 

In 2010, the EPA retained the annual nitrogen dioxide NAAQS standard, but created a new 1-hour NAAQS and established new data reduction and monitoring requirements. While the EPA has classified all areas as being in attainment or unclassifiable, it is requiring implementation of a network of monitoring stations to assess air quality. Until the network is implemented and further designations are made, the impact on operations at U. S. Steel facilities cannot be estimated at this time.

Legal Proceedings - Environmental Proceedings&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.&#8221; 

Water 

U. S. Steel maintains water discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program of the CWA, and under equivalent state laws, and conducts operations in compliance with such permits. For information regarding enforcement actions, capital expenditures and costs of compliance, see &#8220;Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Environmental Proceedings&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.&#8221; 

Solid Waste 

U. S. Steel facilities generate solid and hazardous wastes regulated by RCRA. In addition, each state and some local jurisdictions regulate solid and hazardous waste activities. In addition to regulating waste handling and disposal 

practices, these laws and regulations also govern the environmental remediation of some prior waste disposal operations (i.e., corrective actions), the recycling of wastes and the operation and maintenance of waste storage tanks. Corrective actions under these laws, are discussed below under &#8220;Remediation.&#8221; For additional information regarding significant remediation costs, enforcement actions, capital expenditures and costs of compliance, see &#8220;Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Environmental Proceedings&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.&#8221; 

Remediation 

U. S. Steel is involved in a number of environmental remediation projects under CERCLA, RCRA and other federal and state statutes, related to former and present locations as well as third party waste sites where material generated by U. S. Steel was discarded. A number of these locations either never were, or are no longer, owned or operated by U. S. Steel and are subject to cost sharing and remediation provisions. Projects include remediation of the former Geneva Works, the former Duluth Works, ground water issues at Gary Works and the closure of hazardous and non-hazardous waste landfills. It is possible that additional sites will be identified that require remediation. For additional information regarding remedial actions, capital expenditures and costs of compliance, see &#8220;Item 3. Legal Proceedings - Environmental Proceedings&#8221; and &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.&#8221; 

United States Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulation 

The current and potential regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions remains a significant issue for the steel industry, particularly for integrated steel producers such as U. S. Steel, but also increasingly for electric arc furnace (EAF) producers due to regulatory actions impacting the power generation sector. The EPA has classified GHGs, such as CO 2, as harmful gases. Under this premise, it has implemented a GHG emission monitoring and reporting requirement for all facilities emitting 25,000 metric tons or more per year of CO 2 , as well as equivalent CO 2 quantities of methane and nitrous oxide. 

On August 3, 2015, the EPA issued three separate actions to address GHG emissions from fossil fuel fired power plants: 1) final rules for new, modified or reconstructed sources, 2) final rules for existing sources, and 3) a proposed Federal Implementation Plan. The rules for new, modified, or reconstructed sources impose separate intensity-based GHG limits for new coal fired and new natural gas fired power plants. The rules for existing fossil fuel fired power plants imposes a two-part goal structure for existing power generation in each state. The structure is composed of an interim goal for states to meet on average over the ten-year period from 2020-2029, and a final goal that a state must meet at the end of that period in 2030 and thereafter. The final goal is to achieve a 32 percent reduction of GHG emissions by 2030 from 2005 levels. States will be given flexibility in terms of how to achieve their goal and what measures to implement, but must submit plans no later than September 6, 2016. The proposed Federal Implementation Plan would apply to any state that does not submit an EPA approved plan. The impact these rules will have on the supply and cost of electricity to industrial consumers, especially energy intensive industries like ours, is being evaluated. We believe there will be increased operating costs, such as increased energy and maintenance costs, but we are currently unable to reliably estimate them.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Environmental Matters" and Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, "Contingencies and Commitments - Environmental Matters - CO 2 &#32;Emissions." 

Slovak Operations 

USSK is subject to the environmental laws of Slovakia and the European Union (EU). An EU law commonly known as Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, Regulation 1907/2006 (REACH) requires the registration of certain substances produced in or imported into the EU, and applying for authorization to continue use where replacement of certain substances is not possible or feasible. In some cases replacements for substances currently used in our operations will have to be implemented. We are also beginning the process of seeking authorization for continued use of these substances until viable alternatives can be proved and implemented. March 21, 2016, is the deadline for filing an Application for Authorization to be permitted to continue using hexavalent chromium substances until suitable alternatives can be identified. The authorization will be for four years, after which time replacement substances must be employed. Efforts are ongoing to identify, test and prove the feasibility of replacement substances. Although USSK is currently compliant with REACH, efforts to remain compliant will require capital investment and 

increased operational costs. We cannot reliably estimate the potential cost of complying with these measures at this time. For further discussion of laws applicable in Slovakia and the EU and their impact on USSK, see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, &#8220;Contingencies and Commitments - Environmental Matters, EU Environmental Requirements.&#8221; 

A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed in March of 2013 between U. S. Steel and the government of Slovakia. The MOU outlines areas in which the government and U. S. Steel will work together to help create a more competitive environment and conditions for USSK. Incentives the government of Slovakia agreed to provide include potential participation in a renewable energy program that provides the opportunity to reduce electricity costs, as well as the potential for government grants and other support concerning investments in environmental control technology. Although there are many conditions and uncertainties regarding the grants, including matters controlled by the EU, the value of these incentives as stated in the MOU could be as much as &#8364;75 million (approximately $82 million). U. S. Steel also agreed to pay the government of Slovakia specified declining amounts should U. S. Steel sell USSK within five years of the date of the MOU. We continue to work closely with the government of Slovakia to monitor the progress of the respective commitments and to achieve the incentives described in the MOU. 

Slovakia adopted a new waste code in March 2015 that became effective January 1, 2016. This legislation implements the EU Waste Framework Directive that strictly regulates waste disposal and encourages recycling, among other provisions, by increasing fees for waste disposed of in landfills, including privately owned landfills. We are currently analyzing the legislation in order to estimate the potential financial impact on USSK's operations. 

The EU&#8217;s Industry Emission Directive will require implementation of EU determined best available techniques (BAT) to reduce environmental impacts as well as compliance with BAT associated emission levels. This directive includes operational requirements for air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid waste disposal and energy conservation, dictates certain operating practices and imposes stricter emission limits. Producers will be required to be in compliance with the iron and steel BAT by March 8, 2016, unless specific exceptions or extensions are granted by the Slovak environmental authority. We are currently updating our existing operating permits for different facilities involved in producing iron and steel in the plant in accordance with the new BAT requirements. Through this process for some facilities, we are applying for extensions from the 2016 compliance deadline in order to meet or exceed the BAT requirements. Compliance with stricter emission limits going beyond BAT requirements makes us eligible for EU funding support and prepares us for any further tightening of environmental protection standards. Our most recent broad estimate of likely capital expenditures for projects to comply with or go beyond the BAT requirements is approximately &#8364;165 million (approximately $180 million). 

The EU has various programs under which funds are allocated to member states to implement broad public policies which are then awarded by the member states to public and private entities on a competitive basis. The funding intensity under these programs currently ranges from 55 percent of defined eligible costs on a project under the standard state scheme to 90 percent on a recently approved ad hoc scheme to improve the air quality in the Ko&#353;ice region of Slovakia. Based on our list of projects that comprise the approximate &#8364;165 million (approximately $180 million) of spending noted, we currently believe we will be eligible to receive up to &#8364;115 million (approximately $125 million) of incentive grants. This could potentially reduce our net cash expenditures to approximately &#8364;50 million (approximately $55 million). The actual amount of capital spending will be dependent upon, among other things, the actual amount of incentive grants received. 

We also believe there will be increased operating costs associated with these projects, such as increased energy and maintenance costs. We are currently unable to reliably estimate what the increase in operating costs will be as many projects are still in the development stage.

European Greenhouse Gas Emission Regulations 

The European Commission (EC) has created an Emissions Trading System (ETS) and starting in 2013, the ETS began to employ centralized allocation, rather than national allocation plans, that are more stringent than the previous requirements. The ETS also includes a cap designed to achieve an overall reduction of GHGs for the ETS sectors of 21% in 2020 compared to 2005 emissions and auctioning as the basic principle for allocating emissions allowances, with some transitional free allocation provided on the basis of benchmarks for manufacturing industries under risk of 

transferring their production to other countries with lesser constraints on GHG emissions, commonly referred to as carbon leakage. Manufacturing of sinter, coke oven products, basic iron and steel, ferro-alloys and cast iron tubes have all been recognized as exposing companies to a significant risk of carbon leakage, but the ETS is still expected to lead to additional costs for steel companies in Europe. The EU has imposed limitations under the ETS for the period 2013-2020 (Phase III) that are more stringent than those in the 2008 - 2012 period (NAP II), reducing the number of free allowances granted to companies to cover their CO 2 &#32;emissions. 

The EU has established GHG regulations for the EU member states. International negotiations to supplement and eventually replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol are ongoing. In December 2015, Paris held the Conference of Parties (COP21) summit on global warming. The summit proposed goals and protocols for global CO 2 &#32;reduction. To be binding, the proposal must be ratified and adopted by individual governments. The Paris agreement shall be open for signature at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York City beginning on August 22, 2016. In October 2014, the European Council approved 2030 goals in the areas of GHG reduction, energy efficiency and the use of renewable resources. Those targets are expected to transfer into legislation by 2020. Until the full details of the program are made known through specific enacting legislation, we cannot reasonably forecast the costs and benefits which might result from the program.

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, U. S. Steel had approximately 21,000 employees in North America and approximately 12,200 in Europe. 

Most hourly employees of U. S. Steel&#8217;s flat-rolled, tubular, cokemaking and iron ore pellet facilities in the United States are covered by collective bargaining agreements with the United Steelworkers (USW) that were entered into effective September 1, 2015 and expire on September 1, 2018. Our North American collective bargaining agreements contain no-strike provisions which are applicable during the term of the respective agreements. 

In Europe, most employees at USSK are represented by the OZ Metalurg union and are covered by an agreement that expires at the end of March 2016. 

A small number of workers at some of our North American facilities and at our transportation operations are covered by agreements with the USW or other unions that have varying expiration dates.
