 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

Mesa Laboratories, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on March 26, 1982. The terms &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; the &#8220;Company&#8221; or &#8220;Mesa&#8221; are used in this report to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which our various businesses are actually conducted. We pursue a strategy of focusing primarily on quality control products and services, which are sold into niche markets that are driven by regulatory requirements. We prefer markets that have limited competition where we can establish a commanding presence and achieve high gross margins. We are organized into four divisions across eight physical locations. Our Instruments Division designs, manufactures and markets quality control instruments and disposable products utilized in connection with the healthcare, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, medical device, industrial hygiene, environmental air sampling and semiconductor industries. Our Biological Indicators Division provides testing services, along with the manufacturing and marketing of biological indicators and distribution of chemical indicators used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization processes, including steam, hydrogen peroxide, ethylene oxide and radiation, in the hospital, dental, medical device and pharmaceutical industries. Our Continuous Monitoring Division designs, develops and markets systems which are used to monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and differential pressure to ensure that critical storage and processing conditions are maintained in hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, blood banks, pharmacies and a number of other laboratory and industrial environments. Our Cold Chain Division provides parameter (primarily temperature) monitoring of products in a cold chain, consulting services such as compliance monitoring, packaging development and validation or mapping of transport and storage containers, and thermal packaging products such as coolers, boxes, insulation materials and phase-change products to control temperature during transport.

The information contained or connected to our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this report. 

&#160; 

Instruments Division 

&#160; 

Our Instruments Division designs, manufactures and markets quality control instruments and disposable products utilized in the healthcare, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, medical device, industrial hygiene, environmental air sampling and semiconductor industries. Generally, our instrument products are used for testing, quality control, safety, validation and regulatory compliance. Our Instruments Division products include: 1) Data loggers, which are used in critical manufacturing and quality control processes in the food, pharmaceutical and medical device industries; 2) Medical meters and calibration solutions, which are used for quality control in dialysis clinics and dialysis machine manufacturing operations; 3) Gas flow calibration and air sampling equipment, which are used for industrial hygiene assessments, calibration of gas metering equipment and environmental air monitoring by a variety of organizations, including metrology labs, manufacturing companies and government agencies; and 4) torque testing systems, which are used to measure bottle cap tightness in the beverage and pharmaceutical industries. 

&#160; 

Data Loggers 

&#160; 

Our data logger products are self-contained, wireless, high precision instruments that are used in critical manufacturing, quality control and validation applications. They are used to measure temperature, humidity and pressure inside a process or a product during manufacturing. In addition, data loggers can be used to validate the proper operation of laboratory or manufacturing equipment, either during its installation or for annual re-certifications. The products consist of individual data loggers, a personal computer (&#8220;PC&#8221;) interface, software and various accessories. A customer typically purchases a large number of data loggers along with a single PC interface and the software package. In practice, using the PC interface, the user programs the loggers to collect environmental data at a pre-determined interval, places the data loggers in the product or process, and then collects stored process data from the data logger either through the PC interface or wirelessly via a radio link. The user can then prepare tabular and graphical reports using the software. Unique aspects of our data loggers are their ability to operate at elevated temperatures and in explosive environments &#8211; important differentiating factors in the marketplace and, consequently, they are used by companies to control their most critical processes, such as sterilization. Industries utilizing the data loggers include food processors, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and contract sterilization providers.

&#160; 

Medical Meters and Calibration Solutions 

&#160; 

Our medical meters are used to test various parameters of the dialysis fluid (dialysate), and the proper calibration and operation of the dialysis machine. Each measures some combination of temperature, pressure, pH and conductivity to ensure that the dialysate has the proper composition to promote the transfer of waste products from the blood to the dialysate. The meters provide a digital readout that the patient, physician or technician uses to verify that the dialysis machine is working within prescribed limits and delivering properly prepared dialysate. We manufacture two styles of medical meters; those designed for use by dialysis machine manufacturers and biomedical technicians, and those used primarily by dialysis nurses. The meters for technicians are characterized by exceptional accuracy, stability and flexibility, and are used by the industry as the primary standard for the calibration of dialysis machines. The meters designed for use by dialysis nurses are known primarily for their ease of use and incorporate a patented, built-in syringe sampling system. These meters are used as the final quality control check on the dialysate just prior to starting a treatment. In addition to the dialysate meters, we market a line of standard solutions for use in dialysis clinics for calibration of our meters. These standard solutions are regularly consumed by the dialysis clinics; thus, along with calibration services, are less impacted by general economic conditions than instrument sales. Customers that utilize these products include dialysis facilities, medical device manufacturers and biomedical service companies. 

&#160; 

Gas Flow Calibration and Air Sampling Equipment 

&#160; 

We manufacture a variety of instruments and equipment for gas flow calibration and environmental air sampling. In the air sampling area, our technology is used primarily for the determination of particulate concentrations in air as a measure of urban or industrial air pollution, and for industrial hygiene assessments. The primary products include air samplers, particle separators and pumps. In the environmental area, our particle samplers were some of the first on the market and they were recognized early-on as &#8220;reference samplers&#8221; by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 

&#160; 

We also manufacture gas flow calibration instruments to support the use of our air sampling equipment, and for broader industrial applications. Our gas flow calibration instruments provide the precise standards required by laboratories and industry in the design, development, manufacture, installation and calibration of various gas flow meters and air sampling devices. Our flow calibrators are used in many industries where professionals require the superior accuracy, reliability and ease of operation that they provide, including 1) industrial hygienists, 2) calibration and research laboratories, 3) manufacturers who design, develop and manufacture gas flow metering devices, and 4) industrial engineering and manufacturing companies that utilize gas flow metering devices. 

&#160; 

Torque Testing Systems 

&#160; 

Our automated torque testing systems are durable and reliable motorized cap torque analyzers used throughout the packaging industry. The primary advantages of our torque instruments are their high accuracy and long term consistency of measurement. Unlike manual torque testing instruments, our motorized torque systems eliminate the effects on the measurement results of different operators and different cap removal speeds. With a motorized torque testing system, the force applied to a cap is precisely the same in each testing cycle, regardless of who may be operating the machine, or how strong they may be. Our torque systems provide the information that helps the packaging operation track events, and potential problems during the manufacturing process so that corrections can be performed in a timely fashion. Industries utilizing these instruments include food processors, beverage companies, pharmaceutical, and consumer product manufacturers. 

&#160; 

Biological Indicators Division 

&#160; 

Our Biological Indicators Division provides testing services, along with the manufacture and marketing of biological indicators and distribution of chemical indicators used to assess the effectiveness of sterilization processes, including steam, hydrogen peroxide, ethylene oxide and radiation, in the hospital, dental, medical device and pharmaceutical industries. Our biological indicators are registered medical devices manufactured under International Standards Organization (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) 13485 controlled processes. They are developed and used according to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (&#8220;AAMI&#8221;) guidelines, which are often adopted as the worldwide standard under ISO. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Biological indicators consist of resistant spores of certain microorganisms that are applied on a convenient substrate, such as a small piece of filter paper. The spores are well characterized in terms of numbers and resistance to sterilization. In use, the biological indicator is exposed to a sterilization process and then tested to determine the presence of surviving organisms. Our biological indicators include a) spore strips, which require post-processing transfer to a growth media, b) self-contained products, which have the growth media already pre-packaged in crushable ampoules, c) culture media, and d) process challenge devices (&#8220;PCD&#8217;s&#8221;) which increase the resistance of biological indicators, mimicking the packaging or other unique characteristics of a product being sterilized. Chemical indicators are similar to biological indicators, except that a chemical change (generally determined by color) is used to assess the exposure to sterilization conditions. Biological indicators and chemical indicators are often used together to monitor processes. Biological indicators are used to validate equipment and monitor the effectiveness of a process in any industrial or healthcare setting which uses sterilization. Key markets include healthcare, such as dental offices and hospitals, and industrial, such as medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers. 

&#160; 

Our biological indicators are distinguished in the marketplace by their high level of quality, consistency and flexibility. A variety of different formats allows our biological indicators to be used in many different types of processes and products. For example, the simple spore strips are used most often in the small table-top steam sterilizers in dental offices, while a more complex self-contained biological indicator, either with or without a PCD, may be used by a medical device manufacturer to assure the sterility in a complex ethylene oxide sterilization process. In either case, the number of spores contained on the carrier and the resistance of the spores to the sterilization process must be well characterized in order to accurately assess the effectiveness of sterilization. During manufacturing, extensive quality control steps are used to insure that the microorganism spores are well characterized and their resistance is known following placement on the target carrier. 

&#160; 

Continuous Monitoring Division 

&#160; 

Our Continuous Monitoring Division designs, develops and markets systems which are used to monitor various environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity and differential pressure to ensure that critical storage and processing conditions are maintained. Continuous monitoring systems are used in controlled environments such as refrigerators, freezers, warehouses, laboratory incubators, clean rooms and a number of other settings. The continuous monitoring systems consist of wireless sensors that are placed in controlled environments, hardware modules to receive the wireless data, and various software programs to collect, store and process the data. Our systems are designed to operate continuously, providing data around the clock, 365 days per year. A critical function of our systems is the ability to provide local alarms and notifications via e-mail, text or telephone, in the case where established environmental conditions are exceeded. Key markets for our continuous monitoring systems are hospitals, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, blood banks, pharmacies and a number of other laboratory and industrial environments. 

&#160; 

Among the important competitive differentiators for our continuous monitoring systems are 1) their high degree of reliability and up-time; 2) a large variety of sensor types to meet the needs of most applications; 3) a large, distributed installation and service team; and 4) a full-featured and validated software program, providing extensive reporting and alarm capability. An important aspect of our continuous monitoring business is the ability to provide post-installation service and support. For most systems, annual re-calibration of each sensor is required, and we provide this service through our large, dedicated service organization. 

&#160; 

Cold Chain Division 

&#160; 

Our Cold Chain Division provides parameter (primarily temperature) monitoring of products in a cold chain, consulting services such as compliance monitoring, packaging development and validation or mapping of transport and storage containers, and thermal packaging products such as coolers, boxes, insulation materials and phase-change products to control temperature during transport. We provide a full suite of products and services to help our customers meet the requirements of their Good Distribution Practices (&#8220;GDP&#8221;) regulations. Our compliance services help customers validate the effectiveness of their cold chain, high efficiency packaging products are used to control temperature of materials during shipping and our monitoring systems record temperature during shipment and provide alarms in case of temperature excursions. 

&#160; 

The competitive advantages of our Cold Chain Division include 1) our in-depth knowledge of cold chain characteristics and requirements, 2) packaging materials that are very durable and can control temperatures for up to 168 hours during transport, 3) extensive package development and testing capability to help in the design and validation of custom packaging solutions, and 4) web-based monitoring products that allow for measurement of parameters (primarily temperature) throughout a cold chain, from point of manufacture or collection, all the way to point of use. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Market Factors 

&#160; 

Product sales are dependent on several factors, including general economic conditions, both domestic and international, customer capital spending trends, competition, introduction of new products and acquisitions. Biological indicators and many of the packaging products of our Cold Chain Division are disposable and are used on a routine basis, thus product sales are less sensitive to general economic conditions. Instrument products, continuous monitoring systems, and cold chain monitoring products have a longer life, and their purchase by our customers is somewhat discretionary, so sales are more sensitive to general economic conditions. Service demand is driven by our customers&#8217; quality control and regulatory environments, which require periodic repair and recalibration or certification of our instrument products and continuous monitoring systems. We typically evaluate costs and pricing annually. Our policy is to price our products competitively and, where possible, we pass along cost increases in order to maintain our margins. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We conduct research, manufacturing and support of our Instruments Division products from our facilities in Lakewood, Colorado and Butler, New Jersey. Our instrument products are manufactured primarily by assembling the products from purchased components and calibrating the final products prior to release. The manufacture and support of our Continuous Monitoring Division systems are conducted from our facility in Lakewood, Colorado. Our continuous monitoring systems are manufactured primarily by assembling the systems from purchased components and calibrating the sensors, either at the factory or at the point of installation at the customer&#8217;s facility. Facilities in Bozeman, Montana, Omaha, Nebraska and Traverse City, Michigan are used for the Biological Indicators Division. Our biological indicator products are manufactured by growing microbiological spores from raw materials, forming the finished products and testing the finished biological indicators using established quality control tests. Our dental sterilizer testing products are assembled into kits containing BI spore strips and our microbiological laboratory tests these kits when they are returned to us to determine the effectiveness of our customer&#8217;s sterilization process. Our Cold Chain Division monitoring products are manufactured in our Markham, Canada facility primarily by assembling the systems from purchased components and calibrating the sensors, while the packaging products are manufactured by third party suppliers. 

&#160; 

Most of the materials and components used in our product lines are available from a number of different suppliers. We generally maintain multiple sources of supply, but are dependent on a single source for certain items. We believe that alternative sources could be developed, if required, for present single supply sources. Although our dependence on these single supply sources may involve a degree of risk, to date we have been able to acquire sufficient stock to meet our production requirements. 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

Domestically, we generate sales to end users through our sales and marketing staff and distributors. We use approximately 266 distributors throughout Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, Australia, Canada and Central America for international sales and distribution.

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We are committed to an active research and development program dedicated to innovating new products and improving the quality and performance of our existing products. We spent $4,976,000, $3,800,000 and $2,320,000 for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, on research and development activities, including amounts capitalized as intangible assets and construction-in-progress. Amounts capitalized, which relate primarily to the development of Continuous Monitoring product were $1,044,000, $506,000 and $0 for the years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

While our quality system and manufacturing processes are generally the same throughout the Instruments Division, specific products are compliant under ISO 13485, ISO 17025, ISO 9001 and certain U.S. Federal regulations. Compliance requires us to obtain third party certification for certain products. 

&#160; 

Several products in both the Instruments and Biological Indicators Divisions are medical devices subject to the provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 (hereinafter referred to as the "Act"). The Act requires any company proposing to market a medical device to notify the Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) of its intention at least ninety days before doing so and in such notification must advise the FDA as to whether the device is substantially equivalent to a device marketed prior to May 28, 1976. We have received permission from the FDA to market all of our products requiring such permission. 

&#160; 

Some of our facilities are subject to FDA regulations and inspections, which may be time-consuming and costly. This includes on-going compliance with the FDA&#39;s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations that require, among other things, the systematic control of manufacture, packaging and storage of products intended for human use. Failure to comply with these practices renders the product adulterated and could subject us to an interruption of manufacturing and selling these products, and possible regulatory action by the FDA. 

&#160; 

The manufacture and sale of medical devices is also regulated by some states. Although there is substantial overlap between state regulations and the regulations of the FDA, some state laws may apply. We do not anticipate that complying with state regulations, however, will create any significant problems. Foreign countries also have laws regulating medical devices sold in those countries, which may cause us to expend additional resources on compliance.
