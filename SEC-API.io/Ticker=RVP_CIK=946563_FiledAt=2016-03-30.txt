 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General Development of Business 

&#160; 

On May 9, 1994, our company was incorporated in Texas to design, develop, manufacture, and market innovative patented safety medical products for the healthcare industry. Our goal is to become a leading provider of safety medical products. Advantages of our safety products include protection from needlestick injuries, prevention of cross contamination through reuse, and reduction of disposal and other associated costs. 

&#160; 

We have designed, developed, and currently market the VanishPoint &#174; and Patient Safe &#174; products. The VanishPoint &#174; products are designed specifically to prevent needlestick injuries and to prevent reuse. The patented designs permit the automated retraction of the needle directly from the patient after completion of the procedure.

&#160; 

Our VanishPoint &#174; safety products currently consist of tuberculin, insulin, and allergy antigen VanishPoint &#174; &#160; syringes; 0.5mL, 1 mL, 2mL, 3mL, 5mL, and 10mL VanishPoint &#174; syringes; and the VanishPoint &#174; autodisable syringe.

&#160; 

We also sell the VanishPoint &#174; IV catheter; the VanishPoint &#174; blood collection tube holder; and the VanishPoint &#174; blood collection set.

&#160; 

The Patient Safe &#174; syringe embodies a unique patented design and protects patients by reducing the risk of bloodstream infections resulting from catheter hub contamination. Our Patient Safe &#174; products currently consist of 3mL, 5mL, 10mL, 20mL, 30mL, 60mL syringes and the Patient Safe &#174; Luer cap.

&#160; 

On June 17, 2014, we received notice of substantial equivalence from the Food and Drug Administration for the EasyPoint &#153; needle. The EasyPoint &#153; is a retractable needle that can be used with Luer lock syringes, Luer slip syringes, and prefill syringes to give injections. The EasyPoint &#153; needle can also be used to aspirate fluids and blood collection. We have completed installation and validation of the equipment. We are currently building stock for product release.

&#160; 

We currently have under development additional safety products that add to or build upon or current product line offering. These products include: retractable needles and syringes, glass syringes, dental syringes, IV catheter introducers, and blood collection sets. 

&#160; 

Our products have been and continue to be distributed nationally through numerous distributors. However, we have been blocked from access to the market by the marketing practices engaged in by BD which dominates our 

&#160; 

&#160; 

market. We initiated a lawsuit in 2007 against BD. As previously reported, the District Court granted us a final judgment for $352 million plus post-judgment interest as well as some injunctive relief. We have not received any payments pursuant to this judgment. BD has appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Oral argument was heard on February 29, 2016 and we are still waiting for the appellate decision. An earlier portion of the same case dealt with patent infringement charges against BD. In that portion of the case, the Federal Circuit determined that BD&#146;s 1mL Integra syringe violated our patents but that BD&#146;s 3mL Integra did not infringe our patents. The District Court had awarded us $5 million plus prejudgment and post-judgment interest based on the finding of infringement by the jury. We received payment of $7,724,826 (the &#147;Judgment Amount&#148;) from BD in connection with such award. The Judgment Amount was recognized on the income statement in the second quarter of 2015 as the case was concluded with no change to the damages that were awarded. 

&#160; 

We continue to attempt to gain access to the market through our sales efforts, our innovative technology, introduction of new products, and, when necessary, litigation. 

&#160; 

Section 4191 of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 in conjunction with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (&#147;PPACA&#148;), provides for an excise tax of 2.3% on medical devices. The impact of this tax was $360,000 in 2015, $856,000 in 2014, and $758,000 in 2013, and is net of expected refunds attributable to rebate credits. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), signed into law on December 18, 2015, includes a two year moratorium on the medical device excise tax imposed by Internal Revenue Code section 4191. Thus, the medical device excise tax does not apply to the sale of a taxable medical device by the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the device during the period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017. 

&#160; 

In 2014, we took steps to decrease our non-litigation legal costs by approximately $1.1 million. Additionally, effective May 9, 2014, we reduced our workforce by 13.7% in an effort to cut costs. In 2015, we further reduced our workforce. The net effect of the lower non-litigation costs and the reduced workforce, offset by a payment to a former executive, was approximately $450,000 in 2015. 

&#160; 

We exchanged 728,000 shares of Common Stock for 200,000 shares of our Series IV Class B Convertible Preferred Stock as of November 30, 2015 pursuant to an agreement with a shareholder. Such shareholder agreed to waive all unpaid dividends in arrears associated with the tendered preferred stock, equaling $3,094,795. Future dividend requirements of $200,000 per year are avoided as a result of this transaction. 

&#160; 

Financial Information 

&#160; 

Please see the financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information about our revenues, profits, and losses for the last three years and total assets, liabilities, and stockholder equity for the last two years. 

&#160; 

Principal Products 

&#160; 

Our products with Notice of Substantial Equivalence to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) and which are currently sold include the 1mL tuberculin; insulin syringes; allergy antigen VanishPoint &#174; syringes; 0.5mL, 2mL, 3mL, 5mL, and 10mL VanishPoint &#174; syringes; the VanishPoint &#174; blood collection tube holder; the VanishPoint &#174; IV safety catheter; small diameter tube adapter; the allergy tray; the Patient Safe &#174; syringes; the Patient Safe &#174; Luer Cap; and the VanishPoint &#174; Blood Collection Set. We are also selling VanishPoint &#174; autodisable syringes in the international market in addition to our other products.

&#160; 

Syringe sales comprised 98.6%, 97.3%, and 98.2% of revenues in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively. 

&#160; 

Principal Markets 

&#160; 

Our products are sold to and used by healthcare providers primarily in the U.S. (with 22.1% of revenues in 2015 generated from sales outside the U.S.) which include, but are not limited to, acute care hospitals, alternate care facilities, doctors&#146; offices, clinics, emergency centers, surgical centers, long-term care facilities, Veterans Administration facilities, military organizations, public health facilities, and prisons. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The need to change to safety devices is due to the risk that is carried with each needlestick injury which includes the potential transmission of over 20 bloodborne pathogens, including the human immunodeficiency virus (&#147;HIV,&#148; which causes AIDS), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Because of the occupational and public health hazards posed by conventional disposable syringes, public health policy makers, domestic organizations, and government agencies have been involved in the effort to get more effective safety needle products to healthcare workers. Federal legislation was signed into law on November 6, 2000, by former President William Jefferson Clinton. This legislation, which became effective for most states on April 12, 2001, requires safety needle products be used for the vast majority of procedures. However, even with this requirement, some hospitals are neglecting to follow the law intended to protect healthcare workers. 

&#160; 

Methods of Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

Under the current supply chain system in the U.S. acute care market, the vast majority of decisions relating to the contracting for and purchasing of medical supplies are made by the representatives of group purchasing organizations (&#147;GPOs&#148;) and purchasing representatives rather than the end-users of the product (nurses, doctors, and testing personnel). The GPOs and larger manufacturers often enter into contracts which can prohibit or limit entry in the marketplace by competitors. 

&#160; 

We distribute our products throughout the U.S. through general line and specialty distributors. We also use international distributors. We have developed a national direct marketing network in order to market our products to health care customers and their purchaser representatives. Our marketers make contact with all of the departments that affect the decision-making process for safety products, including the purchasing agents. They call on acute care and alternate care sites and speak directly with the decision-makers of these facilities. We employ trained sales representatives and clinicians, including nurses and/or medical technologists that educate healthcare providers and healthcare workers on the use of safety devices through on-site clinical training, exhibits at related tradeshows, and publications of relevant articles in trade journals and magazines. These employees provide clinical support to customers. In addition to marketing our products, the network demonstrates the safety and cost effectiveness of the VanishPoint &#174; automated retraction products to customers.

&#160; 

In the needle and syringe market, the market share leader, BD, has utilized, among other things, product disparagement, patent infringement, false advertising, and other deceptive conduct which have restricted the entry of VanishPoint &#174; syringes into the market. Other products manufactured by us that are being denied market access as a result of BD&#146;s anticompetitive actions include the IV safety catheters and Patient Safe &#174; syringes.

&#160; 

We have numerous agreements with organizations for the distribution of our products in foreign markets. In Canada, the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and Saskatchewan have passed laws or regulations regarding healthcare worker safety and the use of safe needle products. The European Union has issued Directive 2010/32/EU regarding safe procedures and the use of safe needle products to prevent needlestick injuries. Brazil is the only country in Latin America that has initiated a regulation requiring the use of safe needle products to prevent needlestick injuries. The Australian states of New South Wales, Queensland, and Victoria have guidelines or directives regarding the prevention of needlestick injuries. 

&#160; 

Key components of our strategy to increase our market share are to: (a) defeat anticompetitive practices through litigation; (b) focus on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to enable us to reduce costs and improve profit margins; (c) continue marketing emphasis in the U.S.; (d) continue to add Veterans Administration facilities, health departments, emergency medical services, federal prisons, long-term care, home healthcare facilities, and retail pharmacies as customers; (e) educate healthcare providers, insurers, healthcare workers, government agencies, government officials, and the general public on the reduction of risk and the cost effectiveness afforded by our products; (f) market product through GPO contracts and supply Integrated Delivery Networks where possible; (g) consider possibilities for future licensing agreements and joint venture agreements for the manufacture and distribution of safety products in the U.S. and abroad; (h) introduce new products; and (i) increase international sales. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Status of Publicly Announced New Products 

&#160; 

We have applied for patent protection and are in the process of developing additional safety medical products. 

&#160; 

On June 17, 2014, we received notice of substantial equivalence from the Food and Drug Administration for the EasyPoint &#153; needle. The EasyPoint &#153; is a retractable needle that can be used with Luer lock syringes, Luer slip syringes, and prefill syringes to give injections. The EasyPoint &#153; needle can also be used to aspirate fluids and blood collection. We have completed installation and validation of the equipment. We are currently building stock for product release.

&#160; 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

&#160; 

We purchase most of our product components from single suppliers, including needle adhesives and packaging materials. There are multiple sources of these materials. We own the molds that are used to manufacture the plastic components of our products in the U.S. Our current suppliers include Channel Prime Alliance, PolyOne Corporation, Sterigenics, Amcor Flexibles, Bemis Healthcare Packaging, and Kovacmed. 

&#160; 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, and Proprietary Rights 

&#160; 

Soon after the Company was formed in May 1994, in recognition of the preexisting technology, intellectual property rights, products, inventive knowhow and ongoing research and development projects (the &#147;Core Technology&#148;) that were brought into the Company by Thomas J. Shaw as its founder and CEO, the Company and Mr. Shaw entered into a Technology License Agreement dated June 23, 1995, which was subsequently amended July 3, 2008, and again to its present form September 7, 2012. 

&#160; 

As amended, the Technology License Agreement encompasses the Core Technology, all technology and knowhow arising out of the Core Technology that has been developed since its inception, all related future improvements, and all the related domestic and foreign patents and patent applications naming Mr. Shaw as an inventor. The knowhow component is broadly defined to include both technical and valuable proprietary business information. Under the Technology License Agreement, Mr. Shaw has granted the Company an exclusive worldwide license in the inventions and under his related patent rights to manufacture, market, sell and distribute the licensed technology and improvements that perform the same function in a better or more economical way. The Company has the right to grant sublicenses and assign the Technology License Agreement subject to Mr. Shaw&#146;s approval. The term of the Technology License Agreement is coextensive with the life of the patent rights that are subject to it. 

&#160; 

In return for the rights granted, the Company paid Mr. Shaw an initial licensing fee and pays a continuing 5% royalty on gross sales, as well as the costs of obtaining and maintaining the patents subject to the license. The Company has reserved the right to control patent prosecution and the right not to pursue or maintain any patent or patent application, in which case the rights in any non-elected technology revert to Mr. Shaw and are excluded from the license. The Technology License Agreement also acknowledges a march-in right held by the U.S. government as a result of federal funding that was provided under Small Business Innovation Research grants made during the early development of what later became the Company&#146;s VanishPoint &#174; product line.

&#160; 

The Company holds exclusive rights under domestic and foreign patents and has pending applications related to the technology embodied in products that are currently marketed. The Company also holds rights related to new products under development. The patents exclusively licensed by the Company have varying remaining terms and expiration dates. While patents covering some features of the VanishPoint &#174; syringes have recently expired or will expire during 2016, another patent with a later expiration date will continue to provide patent coverage for VanishPoint &#174; syringes until 2020.

&#160; 

The Company has also registered the following trade names and trademarks: VanishPoint &#174; , Easy Point&#153;, Patient Safe &#174; , VanishPoint &#174; logos, RT with a circle mark, the Spiral Logo used in packaging VanishPoint &#174; products, the color coded spots on the ends of our VanishPoint &#174; syringes and others. The Company has also obtained federal trademark protection for the slogan &#147;The New Standard for Safety.&#148;

&#160; 

&#160; 

We are involved in patent litigation detailed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings . We have decided, on the advice of patent counsel, not to purchase patent insurance because it would require inappropriate disclosure of information that is currently proprietary and confidential. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Historically, unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due, in part, to the demand for syringes during the flu season. 

&#160; 

Working Capital Practices 

&#160; 

Cash and cash equivalents include unrestricted cash, restricted cash, money market accounts, and investments with original maturities of three months or less. Restricted cash consisted of a demand deposit used to collateralize a Letter of Credit issued by us for the purchase of manufacturing equipment. The Letter of Credit was utilized in 2015. 

&#160; 

We record trade receivables when revenue is recognized. No product has been consigned to customers. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily determined by review of specific trade receivables. Those accounts that are doubtful of collection are included in the allowance. This provision is reviewed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. Trade receivables are charged off when there is certainty as to their being uncollectible. Trade receivables are considered delinquent when payment has not been made within contract terms. 

&#160; 

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using actual average cost. The Company compares the average cost to the market price and records the lower value. Management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel, estimated time to sell such inventory, the shelf life of inventory, and current market conditions when determining excess or obsolete inventories. A reserve is established for any excess or obsolete inventories or they may be written off. 

&#160; 

Receivables are established for federal and state taxes where we have determined we are entitled to a refund for overpayments of estimated taxes or loss carrybacks. 

&#160; 

Accounts payable and other short-term liabilities include amounts that we believe we have an obligation for at the end of year. These included charges for goods or services received in 2015 but not billed to us at the end of the year. It also included estimates of potential liabilities such as rebates and other fees. 

&#160; 

Our domestic return policy is set forth in our standard Distribution Agreement. This policy provides that a customer may return incorrect shipments within 10 days following arrival at the distributor&#146;s facility. In all such cases the distributor must obtain an authorization code from us and affix the code to the returned product. We will not accept returned goods without a returned goods authorization number. We may refund the customer&#146;s money or replace the product. 

&#160; 

Our domestic return policy also generally provides that a customer may return product that is overstocked. Overstocking returns are limited to two times in each 12 month period up to 1% of distributor&#146;s total purchase of products for the prior 12 month period upon the following terms: i) an &#147;overstocked&#148; product is that portion of distributor&#146;s inventory of the product which exceeds distributor&#146;s sales volume for the product during the preceding four months; ii) distributor must not have taken delivery of the product which is overstocked during the preceding four months; iii) overstocked product held by distributor in excess of 12 months from the date of original invoice will not be eligible for return; iv) the product must have an expiration date of at least 24 months from the date of return; v) the overstocked product must be returned to us in our saleable case cartons which are unopened and untampered, with no broken or re-taped seals; vi) distributor will be granted a credit which may be used only to purchase other products from us, the credit to be in the amount of the invoice price of the returned product less a 10% restocking fee which will be assessed against distributor&#146;s subsequent purchase of product; vii) distributor must obtain an authorization code from our distribution department and affix the code to the returned product; and viii) distributor shall bear the cost of shipping the returned products to us. All product overstocks and returns are subject to inspection and acceptance by us. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our international contracts generally do not provide for any returns. 

&#160; 

Dependence on Major Customers 

&#160; 

Two customers accounted for an aggregate of 45.7% of our revenue in 2015. We have numerous other customers and distributors that sell our products in the U.S. and internationally. 

&#160; 

Backlog Orders 

&#160; 

Order backlog is not material to our business inasmuch as orders for our products generally are received and filled on a current basis, except for items temporarily out of stock. 

&#160; 

Government Funding of Research and Right to License 

&#160; 

Thomas J. Shaw received grants from the federal government for his initial 1991 version of a safety syringe, which may give the federal government the right to allow others to manufacture that syringe. However, we believe the government has no right to allow others to manufacture the current version of the VanishPoint &#174; syringe.

&#160; 

Government Approval and Government Regulations 

&#160; 

For all products manufactured for sale in the domestic market we have given notice of intent to market to the FDA and the devices were shown to be substantially equivalent to the predicate devices for the stated intended use. 

&#160; 

For all products manufactured for sale in the foreign market, we hold a certificate of Quality System compliance with ISO 13485. We also have approval to label products for sale into European Union countries with a CE Mark. We will continue to comply with applicable regulations of all countries in which our products are registered for sale. 

&#160; 

Competitive Conditions 

&#160; 

Our products are sold to and used by healthcare providers primarily in the U.S. (with 22.1% of revenues in 2015 generated from sales outside the U.S.) which include, but are not limited to, acute care hospitals, alternate care facilities, doctors&#146; offices, clinics, emergency centers, surgical centers, long-term care facilities, Veterans Administration facilities, military organizations, public health facilities, and prisons. 

&#160; 

We compete primarily on the basis of product performance and quality. We believe our competitive advantages include, but are not limited to, our leadership in quality and innovation. We believe our products continue to be the most effective safety devices in today&#146;s market. Our syringe products include passive safety activation, require less disposal space, and are activated while in the patient, reducing exposure to the contaminated needle. Our price per unit is competitive or even lower than the competition once all the costs incurred during the life cycle of a syringe are considered. Such life cycle costs include disposal costs, testing and treatment costs for needlestick injuries, and treatment for contracted illnesses resulting from needlestick injuries. 

&#160; 

Major domestic competitors include BD and Medtronic Minimally Invasive Therapies (&#147;Medtronic,&#148; formerly known as Covidien). Terumo Medical Corp., Smiths Medical, and B Braun are additional competitors with smaller market shares. 

&#160; 

Founded in 1897, BD is headquartered in New Jersey. BD&#146;s safety-engineered device sales accounted for approximately 25.3% of BD&#146;s total 2015 sales. BD&#146;s classification of safety-engineered devices include the SafetyLok&#153; syringe, which features a tubular plastic sheath that must be manually slid over the needle after removal from the patient, and the SafetyGlide&#153; hypodermic needle which utilizes a manually activated hinged lever to cover the needle tip after removal from the patient. BD markets the SafetyGlide&#153; blood collection set that has a manually activated cover designed to extend over the needle after use. The BD Eclipse&#153; safety blood collection needle and hypodermic needle is also designed to manually cover the needle after removal from the patient. BD 

&#160; 

&#160; 

manufactures the Integra&#153; 3mL retracting needle and syringe product, as well as a spring activated Vacutainer &#174; Passive Shielding Blood Collection Needle and spring activated retracting Vacutainer &#174; blood collection set. BD&#146;s &#147;Vacutainer &#174; &#148; brand name is commonly used as industry jargon to refer to blood collection products in general.

&#160; 

Medtronic offers the Monoject &#174; safety syringe, which, like the BD SafetyLok&#153;, requires the use of two hands to manually extend the tubular plastic shield to cover the needle after removal from the patient. Medtronic also markets the Magellan&#153; needle, similar to BD&#146;s SafetyGlide&#153; needle, which has a manually activated hinged lever to cover the needle tip after removal from the patient.

&#160; 

Many of BD&#146;s and Medtronic&#146;s products result in exposure to the contaminated needle or allow for needle removal and potential syringe reuse. 

&#160; 

In contrast, VanishPoint &#174; syringes can be used without significant changes in injection technique. The automated needle retraction is activated when the plunger handle is fully depressed, in conjunction with the delivery of the complete medication dose, while the needle is still in the patient. This pre-removal activation virtually eliminates exposure to the contaminated needle, reducing the risk of needlestick injuries. Activation is easily accomplished in one step, using one hand. Upon activation of the retraction mechanism, VanishPoint &#174; syringes are rendered unusable, reducing the risk of disposal-related injuries or reuse.

&#160; 

Our safety needle products have several advantages over non-retracting safety needles, including, but not limited to: pre-removal activation; automated needle retraction; integrated safety mechanism; reuse prevention; ease of use; and minimal training. 

&#160; 

BD and Medtronic have controlling U.S. market share; greater financial resources; larger and more established sales, marketing, and distribution organizations; and greater market influence, including long-term and/or exclusive contracts. Additionally, BD may be able to use its resources to improve its products through research or acquisitions or develop new products, which may compete with our products. 

&#160; 

Several factors could materially and beneficially affect the marketability of our products. Demand could be increased by existing legislation and other legislative and investigative efforts. Licensing agreements could provide entry into new markets and generate additional revenue. Further, outsourcing arrangements could increase our manufacturing capacity with little or no capital outlay and provide a competitive cost. 

&#160; 

Litigation could also provide more access to the market. For example, if upheld on appeal, the injunctive relief we obtained in litigation means that BD would have to notify end use customers such as nurses, hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes that it had misrepresented information about our products and its own products with regard to sharpness and medication waste and that such statements were false and misleading, and, in part, based on false and inaccurate measurements of the VanishPoint &#174; products. BD has already taken some measures to advise its employees, distributors, and GPOs of its actions in accordance with injunctive provisions that were not stayed pending appeal.

&#160; 

Our competitive position is weakened by the method that providers use for making purchasing decisions and the fact that our initial price per unit for our safety needle products may be higher than some of the less effective safety needle products that are on the market. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We spent $608,000; $617,000; and $837,000 in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, on research and development. Costs in 2015 were primarily for compensation and related benefits, along with engineering samples and testing. Our ongoing research and development activities are performed by an internal research and development staff and includes developing process improvements for current and future automated machines. Our limited access to the market has slowed the introduction of products. 

&#160; 

Possible future products include safety medical devices and other needle devices to which automated retraction can be applied. We have additional safety product designs that add to or build upon our current product line offering. These product designs include: retractable needle syringe designs, retractable needle designs, glass 

&#160; 

&#160; 

syringe designs, retractable needle dental syringe designs, retractable needle IV catheter designs, and retractable needle blood collection product designs. While these product designs are in various stages of development, we have recently focused on the design and manufacture of our next generation of needle products which are needle-based retractable safety products intended for use with devices to inject fluids, aspirate fluids, and obtain blood collection. These retractable needle-based products are designed to offer effective sharps injury prevention by: being easily operated using one-handed activation; keeping the user&#146;s hands behind the needle at all times; having a low manufacturing cost; and having new applications and uses that expand into markets in addition to those already addressed by VanishPoint &#174; and Patient Safe &#174; products, such as prefilled syringes, fluid aspiration, partial injection, blood collection, and dental injections.

&#160; 

Environmental Compliance 

&#160; 

We believe that we do not incur material costs in connection with compliance with environmental laws. We are considered a Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generator because we generate less than 100 kilograms (220 lbs.) of hazardous waste per month. Therefore, we are exempt from the reporting requirements set forth by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The waste that is generated at our facility is primarily made up of flammable liquids and paint-related waste and is sent for fuel blending by Safety Kleen. This fuel blending process completely destroys our waste and satisfies our &#147;cradle-to-grave&#148; responsibility. 

&#160; 

Other nonhazardous production waste includes clean polypropylene regrind, paper, and corrugated material that is recycled. All other nonhazardous waste produced is considered municipal solid waste and sent to a sanitary landfill by CWD. 

&#160; 

We also produce small amounts of regulated biohazardous waste from contaminated sharps and laboratory wastes. This waste is sent for incineration by Stericycle. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 1, 2016, we had 136 employees. 134 of such employees were full time employees. 

&#160; 

Financial Information About Geographic Areas 

&#160; 

We have minimal long-lived assets in foreign countries. Shipments to international customers generally require a prepayment either by wire transfer or an irrevocable confirmed letter of credit. We do extend credit to international customers on some occasions depending upon certain criteria, including, but not limited to, the credit worthiness of the customer, the stability of the country, banking restrictions, and the size of the order. All transactions are in U.S. currency. If customers designate a specific destination for its order, we attribute sales to countries based on the destination of shipment.

Most large international sales of VanishPoint &#174; syringes are filled by production from a Chinese manufacturer. In the event that we become unable to purchase such product from our Chinese manufacturer, we would need to find an alternate manufacturer for the 0.5mL insulin syringe, the 0.5mL autodisable syringe, and the 2mL, 5mL, and 10mL syringes and we would increase domestic production for the 1mL and 3mL syringes.

We do not maintain patent or trademark protection in all foreign countries, but, where possible, have taken steps to protect our patents and trademarks in those countries where we routinely conduct a material amount of business. Our lack of patent and trademark protection, particularly in certain foreign countries, heightens the risk that our designs may be copied by a competitor.
