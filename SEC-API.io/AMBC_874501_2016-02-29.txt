 Item 1. Business 

INTRODUCTION 

Ambac Financial Group, Inc. (&#8220;Ambac&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), headquartered in New York City, is a financial services holding company incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 29, 1991. 

Following its emergence from bankruptcy in 2013, Ambac&#8217;s primary goal is to maximize shareholder value through executing the following key strategies: 

&#8226; 

Increasing the value of its investment in Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance") by actively managing its assets and liabilities with a focus on maximizing risk-adjusted investment portfolio returns and mitigating or remediating losses on poorly performing insured transactions through executing policy commutations, repurchasing liabilities at a discount, pursuing recoveries of losses through litigation and the exercise of contractual and legal rights, restructuring transactions, and other means; and 

&#8226; 

Selectively growing and diversifying Ambac, through the development or acquisition of financial services businesses such as advisory, asset servicing, asset management, and/or insurance.

Ambac Assurance is evaluating possibilities for successfully concluding the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings (as defined below). In pursuing this objective, Ambac Assurance is considering the possibility of entering into transactions whereby it would monetize certain assets and/or purchase, restructure or exchange certain outstanding debt and insurance obligations. Ambac Assurance is also discussing with OCI (as defined below)potential options for addressing outstanding Deferred Amounts (as defined below), including accrued interest and surplus notes (other than junior surplus notes). From time to time Ambac Assurance has also discussed with several counterparty creditors a potential exchange pursuant to which outstanding Deferred Amounts, including accrued interest, and surplus notes (other than junior surplus notes) would be exchanged for new securities and/or cash. As of the date of this filing, Ambac Assurance has not reached any agreement on the terms of a potential transaction, and we cannot provide assurance that any such transaction will be entered into by Ambac Assurance in the future, or if it is, as to the timing, terms or conditions of any such transaction. Any such transaction would remain subject to the prior approval of the board of Ambac Assurance, OCI and potentially the Rehabilitation Court (as defined below). 

The execution of Ambac&#8217;s strategy to increase the value of its investment in Ambac Assurance is subject to the authority of the Rehabilitator (as defined below) to control the management of the Segregated Account. In exercising such authority, the Rehabilitator will act for the benefit of policyholders, and will not take into account the interests of Ambac. Similarly, by operation of the contracts executed in connection with the establishment, and subsequent rehabilitation, of the Segregated Account, the Rehabilitator retains rights to oversee and approve certain actions taken by or in respect of Ambac Assurance. Opportunities for remediating losses on poorly performing insured transactions also depend on market conditions, including the perception of Ambac Assurance&#8217;s creditworthiness, the structure of the underlying risk and associated policy, as well as other counterparty specific factors. Oversight by the Rehabilitator could impair Ambac&#8217;s ability to execute certain of its strategies. Ambac Assurance's ability to commute policies or purchase certain investments may also be limited by available liquidity. 

In October 2015, Ambac Assurance introduced a new program to invest in residential real estate owned properties sourced from Ambac Assurance insured transactions. We are working with third-party vendors for necessary expertise and infrastructure related to this initiative. This program will be rolled out gradually to validate out internal investment thesis. While this program was initiated in order to help remediate losses in the insured portfolio, it has the potential to evolve into a new business opportunity for Ambac. 

Although we are exploring new business opportunities for Ambac, no assurance can be given that we will be able to execute the acquisition or development of any new business. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financial and other resources that may be required to finance the acquisition or development of new businesses. Due to these factors, as well as uncertainties relating to the ability of Ambac Assurance to deliver value to Ambac, the value of our securities is speculative. For additional risks and uncertainties, please refer to Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K. 

&#160;

Ambac has two reportable business segments: Financial Guarantee and Financial Services. 

Ambac&#8217;s Financial Guarantee business segment is conducted through its primary operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance and its wholly owned subsidiary Ambac Assurance UK Limited (&#8220;Ambac UK&#8221;), both of which have been in runoff since 2008. Insurance policies insured by Ambac Assurance and Ambac UK generally guarantee payment when due of the principal and interest on the obligations guaranteed. Ambac Assurance also has another wholly-owned financial guarantee subsidiary, Everspan Financial Guarantee Corp. (&#8220;Everspan&#8221;), which has been in runoff since its acquisition in 1997. The deterioration of the financial condition of Ambac Assurance and Ambac UK has prevented these companies from being able to write new business. An inability to write new business has and will continue to negatively impact Ambac&#8217;s future operations and financial results. Ambac Assurance&#8217;s ability to pay dividends and, as a result, Ambac&#8217;s liquidity, have been significantly restricted by the deterioration of Ambac Assurance&#8217;s financial condition, by the rehabilitation of the Segregated Account (defined below) and by the terms of the Settlement Agreement, dated as of June 7, 2010 (the "Settlement Agreement"), by and among Ambac Assurance, Ambac Credit Products LLC (&#8220;ACP&#8221;), Ambac and certain counterparties to credit default swaps with ACP that were guaranteed by Ambac Assurance. Ambac Assurance is also restricted in its ability to pay dividends pursuant to the terms of its Auction Market Preferred Shares. It is highly unlikely that Ambac Assurance will be able to make dividend payments to Ambac for the foreseeable future. Refer to "Dividend Restrictions, Including Contractual Restrictions" below and Note 9. Insurance Regulatory Restrictions &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K, for more information on dividend payment restrictions. 

In March 2010, Ambac Assurance established a segregated account pursuant to Wisconsin Stat. &#167;611.24(2) (the &#8220;Segregated Account&#8221;) to segregate certain segments of Ambac Assurance&#8217;s liabilities. The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Wisconsin (&#8220;OCI&#8221; (which term shall be understood to refer to such office as regulator of Ambac Assurance and to refer to the Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Wisconsin as rehabilitator of the Segregated Account (the &#8220;Rehabilitator&#8221;), as the context requires)) commenced rehabilitation proceedings in the Wisconsin Circuit Court for Dane County (the &#8220;Rehabilitation Court&#8221;) with respect to the Segregated Account (the &#8220;Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings&#8221;) in order to permit the OCI to facilitate an orderly run-off and/or settlement of the liabilities allocated to the Segregated Account pursuant to the provisions of the Wisconsin Insurers Rehabilitation and Liquidation Act. Ambac Assurance is not, itself, in rehabilitation proceedings. Refer to Note 1. Background and Business Description &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K, for more information on the Segregated Account. 

Ambac&#8217;s Financial Services business segment is operated by subsidiaries of Ambac Assurance. This segment provides financial and investment products, including investment agreements, funding conduits and interest rate swaps, principally to the clients of its financial guarantee business. Ambac Assurance insured all of the obligations of its financial services subsidiaries. The financial services businesses are in runoff, which is being effectuated by transaction terminations, settlements, assignments and scheduled 

| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 2 &#32;&#32;&#32;2015 FORM 10-K | 

amortization of contracts. The Financial Services business also maintains interest rate derivatives to mitigate exposure to floating rate insured obligations in the Financial Guarantee segment. 

Common Stock Restrictions 

There are substantial restrictions on the ability to transfer Ambac&#8217;s common stock set forth in Article XII of Ambac&#8217;s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. In order to preserve certain tax benefits, subject to limited exceptions, any attempted transfer of common stock shall be prohibited and void to the extent that, as a result of such transfer (or any series of transfers of which such transfer is a part), either (i) any person or group of persons shall become a holder of 5% or more of the Company&#8217;s common stock or (ii) the percentage stock ownership interest in Ambac of any holder of 5% or more of the Company&#8217;s common stock shall be increased (a &#8220;Prohibited Transfer&#8221;). These restrictions shall not apply to an attempted transfer if the transferor or the transferee obtains the written approval of Ambac&#8217;s Board of Directors to such transfer. A purported transferee of a Prohibited Transfer shall not be recognized as a stockholder of Ambac for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the securities which are the subject of the Prohibited Transfer (the &#8220;Excess Securities&#8221;). Until the Excess Securities are acquired by another person in a transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the purported transferee of a Prohibited Transfer shall not be entitled with respect to such Excess Securities to any rights of stockholders of Ambac, including, without limitation, the right to vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any. Once the Excess Securities have been acquired in a transfer that is not a Prohibited Transfer, the securities shall cease to be Excess Securities. If the Board determines that a transfer of securities constitutes a Prohibited Transfer then, upon written demand by Ambac, the purported transferee shall transfer or cause to be transferred any certificate or other evidence of ownership of the Excess Securities within the purported transferee&#8217;s possession or control, together with any distributions paid by Ambac with respect to such Excess Securities, to an agent designated by Ambac. Such agent shall thereafter sell such Excess Securities and the proceeds of such sale shall be distributed as set forth in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. If the purported transferee of a Prohibited Transfer has resold the Excess Securities before receiving such demand, such person shall be deemed to have sold the Excess Securities to Ambac&#8217;s agent and shall be required to transfer to such agent the proceeds of such sale, which shall be distributed as set forth in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

SEC, and the information contained on our website is not part of this document. 

Financial information concerning our business segments for each of 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;is set forth in &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,&#8221; &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,&#8221; and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

FINANCIAL GUARANTEE SEGMENT 

The Financial Guarantee segment includes insurance policies and credit derivative contracts. Generally, financial guarantees provide an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee which protects the holder of a debt obligation against non-payment when due. Pursuant to such guarantees, Ambac Assurance and its subsidiaries make payments if the obligor responsible for making payments fails to do so when scheduled. Credit derivatives permit certain counterparties to assert mark-to-market termination claims; however, the assertion of such mark-to-market claims has been enjoined by the Rehabilitation Court. See discussion of &#8220;Ambac Assurance Liquidity&#8221; in Part II, Item 7 included in this Form 10-K for further information. 

Ambac&#8217;s financial guarantee insurance policies and credit derivative contracts expose the Company to the direct credit risk of the assets and/or obligor supporting the guaranteed obligation. In addition, insured transactions expose Ambac to indirect risks that may increase our overall risk, such as credit risk separate from, but correlated with, our direct credit risk, market, model, economic, natural disaster and mortality or other non-credit type risks. 

Ambac Assurance derives financial guarantee revenues from: (i) premiums earned from insurance contracts, net of reinsurance; (ii) net investment income; (iii) fees from credit derivative transactions; (iv) net realized gains and losses from sales of investment securities; and (v) amendment and consent fees. Financial guarantee expenditures include (i) loss and commutation payments for credit exposures; (ii) loss-related expenses, including those relating to the remediation of problem credits, and (iii) operating expenses. Premiums for financial guarantees were received either upfront (typical of public finance obligations) or on an installment basis from the cash flows generated by the underlying assets (typical of structured finance obligations). Despite not underwriting new business, Ambac continues to collect premiums on its existing portfolio of guarantees that pay premiums on an installment basis. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; included in Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for further information. 

Risk Management 

As part of Ambac's enterprise risk management framework, Ambac has an Asset Liability Management Committee (&#8220;ALCO&#8221;). ALCO is a multidisciplinary committee with the objective to implement and foster an enterprise wide culture and approach to liquidity management, asset valuation, hedging, and risk remediation. Members of ALCO include the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and senior managers from investment management, capital markets and risk management. ALCO has scheduled monthly meetings and will also meet on an ad hoc basis to consider, for example, the commutation of distressed financial 

| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 3 &#32;&#32;&#32;2015 FORM 10-K | 

guarantee exposures. See &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; included in Part II, Item 7 in this Form 10-K for further information on Ambac's enterprise risk management framework. 

The Risk Management group is primarily responsible for the development, implementation and oversight of loss mitigation strategies, surveillance and remediation of the insured financial guarantee portfolio (including through the pursuit of recoveries in respect of paid claims and commutations of policies). These activities are integral to Ambac&#8217;s strategy of mitigating losses on poorly performing transactions. As a consequence of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings, the Rehabilitator retains operational control and decision-making authority with respect to all matters related to the Segregated Account, including surveillance, remediation and loss mitigation. The Rehabilitator operates the Segregated Account through a management services contract executed between Ambac Assurance and the Segregated Account pursuant to which the Risk Management group and other personnel provide surveillance, remediation and loss mitigation services to the Segregated Account. Furthermore, by virtue of the contracts executed between Ambac Assurance and the Segregated Account, the Rehabilitator retains the discretion to oversee and approve certain actions taken by Ambac Assurance in respect of assets and liabilities that have not been allocated to the Segregated Account. Refer to Note 1. Background and Business Description &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K, for more information on the contracts between Ambac Assurance and the Segregated Account. As such, the following discussion of Ambac&#8217;s risk management practices is qualified by reference to the Rehabilitator&#8217;s exercise of any of its rights to alter or eliminate any of these risk management practices. 

Ambac&#8217;s Risk Management group has an organizational structure designed around the three areas of focus: Portfolio Risk Management and Analysis, Risk Restructuring and Credit Risk Management. The senior managers responsible for these groups report directly to Ambac Assurance's Chief Executive Officer and regularly informs and updates the Audit Committees of the Board of Directors of Ambac and Ambac Assurance with respect to risk-related topics in the insured portfolio. 

Portfolio Risk Management and Analysis ("PRM") 

This group&#8217;s focus is on remediation, loss mitigation, risk reduction and surveillance. Proactive credit remediation can help to reduce exposure and/or reduce risk in the insured portfolio by securing rights and remedies, both of which help to mitigate losses in the event of default. The emphasis on reducing risk is centered on reducing enterprise-wide exposure on a prioritized basis. 

PRM personnel perform periodic surveillance reviews of exposures according to a schedule based on the risk profile of the guaranteed obligations or as necessitated by specific credit events or other macro-economic variables. Risk-adjusted surveillance strategies have been developed for each bond type with review periods and scope of review based upon each bond type&#8217;s risk profile. The risk profile is assessed regularly in response to our own experience and judgments or external factors such as the economic environment and industry trends. Monitoring activities are designed to detect deterioration in credit quality or changes in the economic, regulatory or political environment which could adversely impact the portfolio. Active surveillance enables PRM to track single credit migration and industry credit and performance trends. The focus of the surveillance review is to assess performance, identify credit trends and recommend appropriate credit classifications, ratings and 

&#160;

changes to a transaction or bond type&#8217;s review period and surveillance requirements. If a problem is detected, the group focuses on loss mitigation by recommending appropriate action and working with the issuer, trustee, bond counsel, servicer and other interested parties in an attempt to remediate the problem and minimize Ambac Assurance&#8217;s exposure to potential loss. Those credits that are either in default or have developed problems that eventually may lead to a default or claim payment are tracked closely by the appropriate surveillance team and senior risk managers and discussed at regularly scheduled meetings with Credit Risk Management (see discussion following in &#8220;Credit Risk Management&#8221;). In some cases, PRM will engage workout experts or attorneys and other consultants with appropriate expertise in the targeted loss mitigation area to assist management in examining the underlying contracts or collateral, providing industry specific advice and/or executing strategies. 

In structured transactions, including structured public finance transactions, Ambac Assurance often is the control party as a result of insuring the transaction&#8217;s senior class or tranche. The control party may direct specified parties, usually the trustee, to take or not take certain actions following contractual defaults or trigger events. Control rights and the scope of direction and remedies vary considerably among our insured transactions. Because Ambac Assurance is party to and/or has certain rights in documents supporting transactions in the insured portfolio, Ambac Assurance frequently receives requests for amendments, waivers and consents (&#8220;AWCs&#8221;). As discussed below under &#8220;Credit Risk Management,&#8221; Ambac Assurance&#8217;s risk management personnel review, analyze and process all requests for AWCs. As a part of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings, the Rehabilitation Court enjoined certain actions by other parties to preserve Ambac Assurance&#8217;s control rights that could otherwise have lapsed or been compromised. 

Surveillance for collateral dependent transactions, including, but not limited to, residential mortgage-backed securities (&#8220;RMBS&#8221;), asset-backed securities (&#8220;ABS&#8221;) and student loan transactions, focuses on review of the underlying asset cash flows and, if applicable, the performance of servicers or collateral managers. Ambac Assurance generally receives periodic reporting of transaction performance from issuers or trustees. Risk analysts review these reports to monitor performance and, if necessary, seek legal or accounting advice to ensure that reporting and application of cash flows comply with transaction requirements. 

Cross-functional teams have been established, either within PRM or including PRM and others as appropriate given the targeted strategy, to promote the active mitigation and/or remediation of credits or sectors in the insured portfolio. Examples of such teams include teams of professionals focused on (i) the review and enforcement of contractual representations and warranties in RMBS policies, (ii) RMBS servicing oversight and (iii) the analysis and prioritization of policies to target and execute risk reduction and commutation strategies. The establishment and purview of cross-functional teams is targeted to address our highest risk exposures. Members of such teams work with both internal and external experts in the pursuit of risk reduction on all fronts. 

The RMBS servicing oversight team focuses on servicer oversight and remediation. Analysts monitor the performance of servicers through a combination of (i) regular reviews of servicer performance; (ii) compliance certificates received from servicer management; (iii) independent rating agency information; (iv) reviews of servicer financial information; and (v) onsite servicing 

| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 4 &#32;&#32;&#32;2015 FORM 10-K | 

diligence. Servicer performance reviews typically include a review of collateral performance, including comparisons against benchmarks, as well as the processes of collection, default management, and loss mitigation. Ambac Assurance may require a back-up servicer or require &#8220;term-to-term&#8221; servicing which provides for limited, renewable servicing terms in order to provide greater flexibility regarding the servicing arrangements of a particular transaction. 

In some transactions, Ambac Assurance has the right to direct a transfer of RMBS and other servicing to an alternative servicer, upon certain events and subject to certain conditions. The decision to exercise this right is made based on various factors, including an assessment of the performance of the existing servicer as outlined above, and an assessment of whether a transfer of servicing may improve the performance of the collateral and reduce risk to Ambac Assurance. In the case of RMBS, Ambac Assurance has developed relationships with preferred servicers. Preferred servicers are selected through a formalized servicer review process that determines, among other key factors, the servicer&#8217;s ability and willingness to actively manage intense and proven loss mitigation activities on RMBS. Ambac Assurance may decide to exercise its rights to direct the transfer of servicing to a preferred servicer where such rights are available. The transfer of servicing is done with the objectives of (i) minimizing losses and distress levels by deploying targeted and enhanced loss mitigation programs; (ii) increasing visibility to Ambac Assurance of all servicing activities that impact overall deal performance; (iii) better aligning the servicer&#8217;s financial interest to the performance of the underlying deal through the utilization of performance based incentives; and (iv) reducing the risk of servicer underperformance due to servicer financial difficulty. 

Ambac Assurance believes that the improved loss mitigation activities, alignment of interests and close monitoring of servicers constitute credible means of minimizing risks and losses related to insured RMBS. 

A team of professionals is focused on recoveries from sponsors where Ambac Assurance believes material breaches of representations and warranties has occurred with respect to certain RMBS policies. The team engages with experienced consultants to perform the re-underwriting of loan files and consults with internal and external legal counsel with regard to loan putbacks as well as settlement and litigation strategies (refer to Note 8. Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further discussion on this topic). 

Risk Restructuring Group ("RRG") 

RRG focuses on the analysis, implementation and execution of commutation and related claims reduction or defeasance strategies primarily for policies allocated to the Segregated Account. Analysts evaluate the estimated timing and severity of projected policy claims as well as the potential impact of other loss mitigation strategies in order to target and prioritize policies, or portions thereof, for commutation, bond purchase, refinancing or other claims reduction or defeasance strategies. For targeted policies, analysts will engage with bondholders, issuers and other economic stakeholders to negotiate, structure, and execute such strategies. 

Credit Risk Management ("CRM") 

CRM manages the decision process for all material matters that affect credit exposures within the insured portfolio. While PRM and RRG are responsible for the credit analysis and the recommendation 

&#160;

and execution of credit remediation strategies, CRM provides a forum for independent assessments and approvals and drives consistency and timeliness. Strategic level credit and restructuring issues may also involve the CEO and other executive management to augment the CRM process in the interest of achieving best outcomes. The scope of credit matters under the purview of CRM includes material amendments, waivers and consents, remediation plans, credit review scheduling, adverse credit classification and below investment grade rating designations, adversely classified credit reviews, sector reviews and overall portfolio review. The CRM decision process may involve a review of structural, legal, political and credit issues and also includes determining the proper level of approval, which varies based on the nature and materiality of the matter. Decisions that also have material asset, liability, and liquidity implications, such as commutations, bond purchases and refinancing's may also require ALCO approval. Please refer to Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the various credit classifications. 

Adversely Classified Credit Review 

Credits that are either in default or have developed problems that eventually may lead to a default are tracked closely by the appropriate PRM surveillance team and discussed at meetings with CRM. Adversely classified credit meetings include members of CRM, PRM and legal, as necessary. As part of the review, relevant information, along with the plan for corrective actions and a reassessment of the credit&#8217;s rating and credit classification is considered. Internal and/or external counsel generally review the documents underlying any problem credit and, if applicable, an analysis is prepared outlining Ambac Assurance&#8217;s rights and potential remedies, the duties of all parties involved and recommendations for corrective actions. Ambac Assurance also meets with relevant parties to the transaction as necessary. The review schedule for adversely classified credits is tailored to the remediation plan to track and prompt timely action and proper internal and external resourcing. A summary of developments regarding adversely classified credits and credit trends is also provided to Ambac&#8217;s and Ambac Assurance&#8217;s Board of Directors no less than on a quarterly basis. 

The insured portfolio contains exposures that are correlated and/or concentrated. Ambac&#8217;s surveillance includes identifying these types of exposures and identifying the risks that would or could trigger credit deterioration across the related exposures. When such risks occur, adverse credit classification may be warranted across many of the correlated and/or concentrated exposures. This is the case with student loans and RMBS, for example, which have several correlations including those associated with consumer lending, unemployment, and home prices. In the past, our not-for-profit healthcare and our leveraged lease exposures experienced periods of stress arising from their concentrated and/or correlated risks, when there were major changes to healthcare reimbursement programs especially Medicaid, or significant weakness in consumer and business travel, in the case of the former and the latter, respectively. In the future, Ambac&#8217;s portfolio may be subject to similar credit deterioration arising from concentrated and/or correlated risks. Examples of other such risks that could impact our portfolio, and that our surveillance is designed to monitor include the impact of potential municipal bankruptcy contagion or the impact of large scale domestic military cutbacks on our military housing portfolio or event risk such as natural disasters or other regional stresses. Most such risks cannot be predicted, and may materialize unexpectedly or develop rapidly. Although our 

| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 5 &#32;&#32;&#32;2015 FORM 10-K | 

surveillance allows us to connect the event and stress to the related exposures and assign an adverse credit classification and estimate losses across the affected credits, when necessary, we may not have adequate resources or contractual rights and remedies to mitigate loss arising from such risks. 

Amendment, Waiver and Consent Review / Approval 

The decision to approve or reject AWCs is based upon certain credit factors, such as the issuer&#8217;s ability to repay the bonds and the bond&#8217;s security features and structure. Members of Ambac Assurance&#8217;s PRM group review, analyze and process all requests for AWCs. All AWCs are initially screened for materiality in the surveillance groups. Non-material AWCs require the approval of at least a PRM surveillance analyst and a portfolio risk manager. Material AWCs are within the purview of CRM, as noted above. For material AWCs, CRM has established minimum requirements that may be modified to require more or varied approvals depending upon the matter&#8217;s complexity, size or other characteristics. 

Ambac Assurance assigns internal credit ratings to individual exposures as part of the AWC process and at surveillance reviews. These internal credit ratings, which represent Ambac Assurance&#8217;s independent judgments, are based upon underlying credit parameters consistent with the exposure type. 

Financial Guarantees in Force 

Financial guarantee products were sold in three principal markets: U.S. public finance, U.S. structured finance and international finance. The following table provides a breakdown of guaranteed net par outstanding by market sector at December 31, 2015 and 2014 . Net par exposures within the U.S. public finance market include capital appreciation bonds which are reported at the par amount at the time of issuance of the insurance policy. Guaranteed net par outstanding includes the exposures of policies that insure variable interest entities (&#8220;VIEs&#8221;) consolidated in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. Guaranteed net par outstanding excludes the exposures of policies that insure bonds which have been refunded or pre-refunded:

Included in the above net par exposures at December 31, 2015 and 2014 &#32;are $971 &#32;and $1,530 , respectively, of exposures that were executed in the form of credit derivatives, primarily collateralized loan exposures. See Part II, Item 7, &#8220;Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and Item 8, &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for further discussion of credit derivative exposures. 

U.S. Public Finance Insured Portfolio 

Ambac&#8217;s portfolio of U.S. public finance exposures is $65,436 million , representing 60% of Ambac&#8217;s net par outstanding as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and a 30% &#32; reduction &#32;from the amount outstanding at December 31, 2014 . This reduction &#32;in exposure was mainly due to normal exposure runoff in addition to early terminations, primarily related to lease and tax-backed exposures. While Ambac&#8217;s U.S. public finance portfolio consists predominantly of municipal bonds such as general and revenue obligations and lease and tax-backed obligations of state and local 

&#160;

government entities, the portfolio also comprises a wide array of non-municipal types of bonds, including financings for not-for-profit entities and transactions with public and private elements, which generally finance infrastructure, housing and other public interests. See Note 7. Financial Guarantees in Force &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for exposures by bond type. 

Municipal bonds are generally supported directly or indirectly by the issuer&#8217;s taxing authority or by public sector fees and assessments which may or may not be specifically pledged. Risk factors in these transactions derive from the municipal issuer, including its fiscal management, politics, and economic position, as well as its ability and willingness to continue to pay its debt service while undergoing severe stress. Municipal bankruptcies, while still relatively uncommon, have occurred, exposing Ambac to the risk of liquidity claims and ultimate losses if issuers cannot successfully adjust their liabilities without impairing creditors. 

Not-for-profit transactions are generally supported by the not-for-profit entities&#8217; net revenues and may also include specific pledges, liens and/or mortgages. The entity typically serves a well-defined market and promulgates a public purpose mission. These transactions may afford Ambac contractual protections such as financial covenants and control rights in the event of issuer breaches and defaults. Risk factors in these transactions derive from the creditworthiness of the issuer, including but not limited to its financial condition, leverage, management, business mix, competitive position, industry and socioeconomic trends, government programs, etc. Examples of these types of transactions include not-for-profit hospitals, universities, associations and charities. 

Certain issuers in our public finance portfolio have issued floating rate debt, which may introduce interest rate risk to Ambac Assurance. Refer to Auction Rate Securities and Variable Rate Demand Obligation Exposures below for further discussion. 

Public/private transactions are generally structured to achieve their targeted public interest objective without direct support from the public sector. Some examples of this type of financing include affordable housing, private education, and privatized military and student housing. Protections within these financings provided to Ambac usually include the strength of the financed asset&#8217;s essentiality and public purpose and may include financial covenants, collateral and control rights. Risk factors include financial underperformance, event risk and a shift in the asset&#8217;s mission or essentiality. One example of this type of financing is U.S. military housing. Ambac insures approximately $6.0 billion of privatized military housing debt. The debt was issued to finance the construction and/or renovation of housing units for military personnel and their families on domestic U.S. military bases. Debt service is not directly paid or guaranteed by the U.S. Government. Rather, the bonds are serviced from the cash flow generated by rental payments deposited by the military directly into lockbox accounts as part of each service personnel&#8217;s Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH). Collateral for these transactions includes the BAH payments as well as an interest in the ground lease. Risk factors affecting these transactions include the ongoing base essentiality, military deployments, the U.S. government&#8217;s commitment to fund the BAH, the marketability/attractiveness of the on-base housing units versus off base housing, construction completion, environmental remediation, utility and other operating costs, and housing management.

Puerto Rico 

Ambac has exposure to Puerto Rico across several different issuing entities. Each has its own credit risk profile attributable to discreet revenue sources, direct general obligation pledges and general obligation guarantees. The following table shows Ambac's insured exposure to each issuer segregated by whether such debt obligation is subject to the Priority Debt Provision or "clawback." Ambac has initiated litigation around the application of the "clawback" announced by Puerto Rico's Governor Padilla on December 1, 2015. A description of Ambac's legal challenge is provided in Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies &#32;in the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K. 

&#160;

For most Puerto Rico bonds insured by Ambac Assurance, such bonds are not subject to acceleration. For the Ambac-insured Puerto Rico Convention Center District Authority (Hotel Occupancy Tax) bonds, such bonds may be accelerated only with the consent of, or at the direction of, Ambac Assurance. For the Ambac-insured Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation - Senior Sales Tax Revenue bonds, such bonds may not be accelerated without the consent of Ambac Assurance, subject to the Ambac financial guaranty insurance policy being in full force and effe ct.

U.S. Structured Finance Portfolio 

Ambac&#8217;s portfolio of U.S. structured finance exposures is $21,814 million , representing 20% &#32;of Ambac&#8217;s net par outstanding as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and a 17% &#32; reduction &#32;from the amount outstanding at December 31, 2014 . This reduction in exposure was the result of normal exposure runoff, primarily related to residential mortgage-backed policies, in addition to terminations and commutations of student loan and asset backed policies. Insured exposures include securitizations of mortgage loans, home equity loans, student loans, leases, operating assets, collateralized debt obligations ("CDO"), collateralized loan obligations (&#8220;CLO&#8221;), and other asset-backed financings, in each case where the majority of the underlying collateral risk is situated in the United States. Included within the lease securitization sector are pooled aircraft and railcar transactions. Additionally, Ambac&#8217;s structured finance insured portfolio includes secured and unsecured debt issued by investor-owned utilities, structured insurance transactions and aircraft equipment trust certificates. See Note 7. Financial Guarantees in Force &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 included in this Form 10-K, for exposures by bond type as of December 31, 2015 . 

Structured finance exposures generally entail three forms of risks: (i) asset risk, which relates to the amount and quality of the underlying assets; (ii) structural risk, which relates to the extent to which the transaction&#8217;s legal structure and credit support provide protection from loss; and (iii) servicer risk, which is the risk that poor performance at the servicer or manager level contributes to a decline in cash flow available to the transaction. Ambac Assurance seeks to mitigate and manage these risks through its risk management practices. 

&#160;

Structured securities are usually designed to help protect the investors and, therefore, the guarantor from the bankruptcy or insolvency of the entity that originated the underlying assets as well as from the bankruptcy or insolvency of the servicer of those assets. The servicer of the assets is typically responsible for collecting cash payments on the underlying assets and forwarding such payments, net of servicing fees, to a trustee for the benefit of the issuer. One potential issue is whether the sale of the assets by the originator to the issuer would be upheld in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the originator and whether the servicer of the assets may be permitted or stayed from remitting to investors cash collections held by it or received by it after the servicer or the originator becomes subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. Another potential issue is whether the originator sold ineligible assets to the securitization transaction that subsequently deteriorated, and, if so, whether the originator has the willingness or financial wherewithal to meet its contractual obligations to repurchase those assets out of the transaction. Structural protection in a transaction, such as control rights that are typically held by the senior note holders, or guarantor in insured transactions, will determine the extent to which underlying asset performance can be influenced upon non-performance to improve the revenues available to cover debt service.

International Finance Insured Portfolio 

Ambac&#8217;s portfolio of international finance insured exposures is $21,049 million , representing 20% &#32;of Ambac&#8217;s net par outstanding as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and a 16% &#32; reduction &#32;from the amount outstanding at December 31, 2014 . This reduction in exposure was primarily the result of terminations of asset-backed and transportation policies, exposure runoff and the impact of the strengthening of the US dollar. Ambac&#8217;s international finance insured exposures include a wide array of obligations in the international markets, including infrastructure financings, asset-securitizations, CDOs, utility obligations, and whole business securitizations (e.g. securitizations of substantially all of the operating assets of a corporation). Ambac no longer has insured exposure related to emerging markets. See Note 7. Financial Guarantees in Force &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part II, Item 8 included in this Form 10-K, for exposures by bond type as of December 31, 2015 . 

When underwriting transactions in the international markets, Ambac considered the specific risks related to the particular country and region that could impact the credit of the issuer. These risks include the legal and political environment, capital markets 

&#160;

dynamics, foreign exchange issues and the degree of governmental support. Ambac continues to assess these risks through its ongoing risk management. 

Ambac UK, which is regulated in the United Kingdom (&#8220;UK&#8221;), had been Ambac Assurance&#8217;s primary vehicle for directly issuing financial guarantee policies in the UK and the European Union with $17,847 million net par outstanding at December 31, 2015 . Geographically, Ambac UK&#8217;s exposures are principally in the UK and continental Europe. The portfolio of insured exposures underwritten by Ambac UK is financially supported exclusively by the assets of Ambac UK and no capital support arrangements are in place with any other Ambac affiliate. See &#32;Additional Insured Portfolio Information - European Union for further details of non-UK exposures. 

The table below shows our ten largest international finance transactions as a percentage of total financial guarantee net par outstanding at December 31, 2015 . Except where noted, all international finance transactions included in the table below are insured by Ambac UK:

Additional Insured Portfolio Information &#32; 

Average Life of Insured Portfolio 

Ambac Assurance underwrote and priced financial guarantees based on the assumption that the guarantees would remain in force until the maturity of the underlying bonds. Ambac Assurance estimates that the average life of its guarantees on par in force at December 31, 2015 &#32;is approximately 11 years. The average life is determined by applying a weighted average calculation, using the remaining years to expected maturity of each guaranteed bond, and weighting them on the basis of the remaining net par guaranteed. Except for RMBS policies, no assumptions are made for non-contractual reductions, 

&#160;

refundings or terminations of insured issues. RMBS policies incorporate assumptions on expected voluntary and involuntary prepayments over the remaining life of the insured obligation. 

Issue Size 

Ambac Assurance&#8217;s financial guarantee exposure in the U.S. public finance market reflects the historical participation across the whole range of deal sizes. U.S. structured finance and international finance transactions generally involved larger transaction sizes. The following table sets forth the distribution of Ambac&#8217;s guaranteed portfolio as of December 31, 2015 &#32;with respect to the current size of each guaranteed issue:

Other European Union Exposures (&#8220;EU&#8221;) 

Ambac's international exposures are principally in the United Kingdom; however, we also have exposures with credit risk based in various other EU member states, including Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Spain. The company also has limited indirect exposures to these countries through its CDO and CLO debt obligations. These obligations were structured to limit exposures 

&#160;

to any given obligor and any given non-US country or region. Several of these countries have experienced significant economic, fiscal and/or political strains such that the likelihood of default on such obligations is higher than when the policies were underwritten. The Company&#8217;s exposures, net of reinsurance, to these countries are shown in the following table:

Ambac does not guarantee any sovereign bonds of the above EU countries. However, the exposures classified as sub sovereign may be impacted should there be adverse financial developments in the EU. Those exposures classified as infrastructure/operating asset backed are concession based where the underlying assets independently generate cash flow without operational reliance on the sovereign. Of the below investment grade exposures, the 

&#160;

investor-owned utilities (wind farm and mini hydro-electric plant) are undergoing restructuring processes designed to address their performance issues. The other below investment grade exposure is a road transaction, where performance has been poorer than anticipated due to lower than forecast traffic volumes, however performance is improving. Below investment grade is defined as those exposures with a credit rating below BBB-.

Includes $125 and $609 of military housing net par at December 31, 2015 and 2014 , respectively. 

The decrease in below investment grade exposures is primarily due to (i) ratings upgrades and commutations of student loan policies, (ii) reductions to residential mortgage-backed securities during the year as a result of both prepayments by issuers and claims presented to Ambac Assurance and (iii) upgrades of housing credits to investment grade. 

&#160;

U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities exposure 

Ambac has exposure to the U.S. mortgage market primarily through direct financial guarantees of RMBS, including transactions that contain risks to first and second liens. 

Ambac classifies its insured first-lien RMBS exposure principally into two broad credit risk classes: mid-prime (including Alt-A, interest only, and negative amortization) and sub-prime. Mid-prime loans were typically made to borrowers who had stronger credit 

| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 12 &#32;&#32;&#32;2015 FORM 10-K | 

profiles relative to sub-prime loans, but weaker than prime loans. Compared with mid-prime loans, sub-prime loans typically had higher loan-to-value ratios, reflecting the greater difficulty that sub-prime borrowers have in making down payments and the propensity of these borrowers to extract equity during refinancing. The mid-prime category includes: 

&#8226; 

Loans with specific payment features that afforded borrowers the option to have lower payments in the early years with potential resets after several years. For example, so-called interest only loans have monthly payments comprised of interest but no principal. So called negative amortization loans permit borrowers to defer interest and principal in the early years and then make higher payments in the period after the reset. Both types may also have lower interest rates in the early years. Increases in monthly payments, commonly called payment shock, raise the probability of delinquencies and defaults given the decline in house prices that has caused many borrowers&#8217; loan balances to exceed their homes&#8217; market value. 

&#8226; 

Loans backed by borrowers who typically did not meet standard agency guidelines for documentation requirement, 

&#160;

property type or loan-to-value ratio. These are typically higher-balance loans made to individuals who might have past credit problems that were not severe enough to warrant &#8220;sub-prime&#8221; classification, or borrowers who chose not to obtain a prime mortgage due to documentation requirements. 

Ambac's second lien insured RMBS transactions are collateralized predominantly by second-lien mortgage loans such as closed-end seconds and home equity lines of credit. A second-lien mortgage loan is a type of loan in which the borrower uses the equity in their home as collateral and the second-lien loan is subordinate to the first-lien loan outstanding on the home. The borrower is obligated to make monthly payments on both their first and second-lien loans. If the borrower defaults on the payments due under these loans and the property is subsequently liquidated, the liquidation proceeds are first utilized to pay off the first-lien loan (as well as costs due the servicer) and any remaining funds are applied to pay off the second-lien loan. As a result of this subordinate position to the first-lien loan, second-lien loans carry a significantly higher severity in the event of a loss, typically at or above 100% in the current housing market.

Ambac&#8217;s below investment grade internal ratings reflect bonds which are of speculative grade credit quality with the adequacy of future margin levels for payment of interest and repayment of principal potentially adversely affected by major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse conditions. Ambac Assurance&#8217;s below investment grade category includes transactions on which claims have been submitted. 

Student Loans 

Ambac Assurance&#8217;s student loan portfolio consists primarily of securitized private student loans in addition to a minimal amount of federally guaranteed loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (&#8220;FFELP&#8221;). Whereas FFELP loans are guaranteed for a minimum of 97% of defaulted principal and interest, private loans have no government guarantee and, therefore, are subject to credit risk as with other types of unguaranteed credits. Higher than expected defaults of private student loans have contributed to the significant deterioration in the performance of some of our transactions. Additionally, due to the failure of the auction rate 

&#160;

markets, the interest rates on some student loan securities have increased significantly to punitive levels pursuant to the transaction terms. Such increases have contributed to the collateralization ratio in these transactions deteriorating on an accelerated basis due to negative excess spread and/or the use of principal receipts to pay current interest. The combined increase in defaults and the penalty rate on the auction rate securities continue to erode the collateralization levels in many of the trusts we insure. This impact has been offset modestly by the current low interest rate environment. 

| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 13 &#32;&#32;&#32;2015 FORM 10-K | 

New private student loan capital market transactions require a significant amount of equity which makes the refinancing of Ambac insured transactions backed by private loans difficult for issuers. As such, we do not expect that our student loan exposure will be significantly reduced via refinancing in the near term.

All of the Auction Rate debt is paying interest at the maximum auction rate or the &#8220;penalty rate&#8221; pursuant to the transaction documents, reflecting both the failure of the auction rate market as well as the below investment grade credit ratings of the deals. 

Auction Rate Securities (&#8220;ARS&#8221;) and Variable Rate Demand Obligations (&#8220;VRDO&#8221;): 

Ambac insures variable rate obligations including ARS and VRDOs, both of which have rate resets and may have experienced liquidity and / or credit stress during the financial crisis. While market conditions have improved and most of Ambac&#8217;s exposures have stabilized or been refinanced away, there are still some issuers paying higher rates, and in the case of some VRDOs, both higher rates and faster amortization than expected due to failed remarketings. Many of Ambac&#8217;s ARS exposures are paying at failed auction rates that are relatively low in the current market and remain attractive to issuers. The following table sets forth Ambac Assurance&#8217;s financial guarantee net par exposure outstanding, by bond type, relating to such variable rate exposures at December 31, 2015 and 2014 :

Reinsurance 

Ceded Reinsurance: 

Ambac Assurance has reinsurance in place pursuant to surplus share treaties and facultative agreements. As a primary financial guarantor, Ambac Assurance is required to honor its obligations to its policyholders whether or not its reinsurers perform their obligations under these reinsurance agreements. For exposures reinsured, Ambac Assurance withholds a ceding commission to defray its underwriting and operating expenses. To minimize its exposure to losses from reinsurers, Ambac Assurance (i) monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers; (ii) is entitled to receive collateral from its reinsurance counterparties in certain reinsurance contracts; and (iii) has certain cancellation rights that can be exercised by Ambac Assurance in the event of rating agency 

&#160;

downgrades of a reinsurer (among other events and circumstances). Ambac Assurance held letters of credit and collateral amounting to $136.2 million &#32;from its reinsurers at December 31, 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , the aggregate amount of insured par ceded by Ambac Assurance to reinsurers under reinsurance agreements was $10,936 million , with the largest reinsurer accounting for $9,711 million &#32;or 8.1% &#32;of gross par outstanding at December 31, 2015 .

Insurance Regulatory Matters 

United States 

Ambac Assurance and Everspan are domiciled in the State of Wisconsin and, as such, are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the State of Wisconsin (the &#8220;Wisconsin Insurance Laws&#8221;) and are regulated by the OCI. In addition, Ambac Assurance and Everspan are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the other jurisdictions in which they are licensed. Under Wisconsin insurance law, the Segregated Account is a separate insurer for purposes of the Segregated Account Rehabilitation Proceedings. The Segregated Account is separately licensed in the State of Wisconsin but not elsewhere, and is under the control of, and is overseen by, the Rehabilitator. 

Insurance laws and regulations applicable to financial guarantee insurers vary by jurisdiction. The laws and regulations generally require financial guarantors to maintain minimum standards of business conduct and solvency; to meet certain financial tests; and to file policy forms, premium rate schedules and certain reports with regulatory authorities, including information concerning capital structure, ownership and financial condition. Regulated insurance companies are also required to file quarterly and annual statutory financial statements with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (&#8220;NAIC&#8221;), and in each jurisdiction in which they are licensed. The level of supervisory authority that may be exercised by non-domiciliary insurance regulators varies by jurisdiction. Generally, however, non-domiciliary regulators are authorized to suspend or revoke insurance licenses and to impose license restrictions in the event that laws or regulations are breached by a regulated insurance company or in the event that continued or unrestricted licensure of the regulated insurance company constitutes a &#8220;hazardous condition&#8221; in the opinion of the regulator. As a result of losses from its insured portfolio, Ambac Assurance is no longer able to write new business. 

As the principal, or domiciliary, regulator of Ambac Assurance, the Segregated Account and Everspan, OCI has primary regulatory authority, including with respect to the initiation and administration of rehabilitation or liquidation proceedings. Additionally, the accounts and operations of Ambac Assurance and Everspan are subject to periodic comprehensive examinations by the OCI. Wisconsin Insurance Laws require regulated insurance companies to maintain minimum standards of business conduct, maintain minimum surplus to policyholders, meet certain financial tests, and file certain reports, including information concerning their capital structure, ownership and financial condition. Ambac Assurance, the Segregated Account, and Everspan are not subject to risk-based capital requirements, since they are financial guarantee insurers. Ambac Assurance, the Segregated Account and Everspan are in compliance with minimum surplus levels. Wisconsin Insurance Laws also require prior approval by OCI of certain transactions between Ambac Assurance or Everspan and their respective affiliates. As described in Note 1. Background and Business Description &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in 

&#160;

Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K, the Rehabilitator of the Segregated Account has imposed certain constraints upon Ambac Assurance through contractual covenants made for the benefit of the Segregated Account and has assumed the authority to control the management of the Segregated Account. 

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Ambac Assurance must seek prior approval by OCI of certain corporate actions. The Settlement Agreement includes covenants which generally restrict the operations of Ambac Assurance and remain in force until the surplus notes that were issued to the counterparties by Ambac Assurance pursuant to the Settlement Agreement have been redeemed, repurchased or repaid in full. Certain of these restrictions may be waived with the approval of a majority of Unaffiliated Qualified Directors (described below) and/or the OCI. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Ambac Assurance amended its articles of incorporation to require that at least one-third (and, in any event, not less than three members) of the board of directors of Ambac Assurance must be Unaffiliated Qualified Directors (as defined in the Settlement Agreement). If at any time Ambac Assurance does not have the requisite number of Unaffiliated Qualified Directors to authorize an action that is otherwise restricted by the Settlement Agreement, it will need to seek the approval of OCI to take such action. 

New York&#8217;s comprehensive financial guarantee insurance law defines the scope of permitted financial guarantee insurance and governs the conduct of business of all financial guarantors licensed to do business in New York, including Ambac Assurance and Everspan. The New York financial guarantee insurance law also establishes single risk and aggregate limits with respect to insured obligations insured by financial guarantee insurers. Such single risk limits are specific to the type of insured obligation (for example, municipal or asset-backed). Under the aggregate limits, policyholders&#8217; surplus and contingency reserves must at least equal a percentage of aggregate net liability that is equal to the sum of various percentages of aggregate net liability for various categories of specified obligations. Wisconsin laws and regulations applicable to financial guarantors, as well as the laws of several other states, are less comprehensive than New York law and relate primarily to single and aggregate risk limits. As a result of the increased statutory capital at December 31, 2015 , Ambac Assurance is in compliance with applicable aggregate risk limits but not in compliance with applicable single risk limits. Through run-off of the portfolio, Ambac Assurance will continue to seek the reduction in its exposure to maintain its compliance with applicable single and aggregate risk limits, but may not be able to do so. Everspan is in compliance with all of such limits. 

United Kingdom 

The Prudential Regulatory Authority ("PRA") and Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") (and their predecessor regulator the Financial Services Authority (&#8220;FSA&#8221;)) have exercised significant oversight of Ambac UK since 2008, after Ambac, Ambac Assurance and Ambac UK began experiencing financial stress. In 2009, Ambac UK&#8217;s license to write new business was curtailed by the FSA and the insurance license was limited to undertaking only run-off related activity. As such, Ambac UK is authorized to run-off its insurance portfolio in the United Kingdom, and to do the same through a branch in Milan, Italy, and a number of other EU countries. EU legislation has allowed Ambac UK to conduct business in EU states other than the United Kingdom through a &#8220;passporting&#8221; arrangement, which eliminates the necessity of additional licensing or authorization in those other EU jurisdictions. 

| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 15 &#32;&#32;&#32;2015 FORM 10-K | 

Ambac UK remains subject to regulation by the PRA and FCA in the conduct of its business. The PRA and FCA are the dual statutory regulators responsible for regulating the financial services industry in the United Kingdom, with the purpose of maintaining confidence in the U.K. financial system, providing public understanding of the system, securing the proper degree of protection for consumers and helping to reduce financial crime. In addition, the regulatory regime in the United Kingdom must comply with certain EU legislation binding on all EU member states. 

Applicable rules require that non-life insurance companies such as Ambac UK maintain a margin of solvency at all times in respect of the liabilities of the insurance company, the calculation of which depends on the type and amount of insurance business a company writes. These solvency requirements have been amended in order to implement the European Union&#8217;s &#8220;Solvency II&#8221; directive on risk-based capital. The requirements of the Solvency II directive became effective on January 1, 2016 and, during the course of 2015, Ambac UK has been required to make certain transitional Solvency II-compliant regulatory filings with the PRA, which it has done. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Ambac UK is deficient in terms of compliance with the applicable regulatory capital requirements as of December 31, 2015, and as at January 1, 2016 remains deficient in applicable regulatory requirements under the Solvency II directive effective from that date. The PRA and FCA are aware of the same, and dialogue between Ambac UK management and its regulators remains ongoing with respect to options for addressing the shortcoming, although such options remain few. 

Regulations over change in control 

Under Wisconsin law applicable to insurance holding companies, any acquisition of control of Ambac, and any other direct or indirect control of Ambac Assurance and Everspan, requires the prior approval of the OCI. &#8220;Control&#8221; is defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person. Any purchaser of more than 10% of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation is presumed to have acquired control of that corporation and its subsidiaries unless the OCI, upon application, determines otherwise. For purposes of this test, Ambac believes that a holder of common stock having the right to cast more than 10% of the votes which may be cast by the holders of all shares of common stock of Ambac would be deemed to have control of Ambac Assurance and Everspan within the meaning of the Wisconsin Insurance Laws. The United Kingdom has similar requirements applicable in respect of Ambac, as the ultimate holding company of Ambac UK. 

Dividend Restrictions, Including Contractual Restrictions 

Due to losses experienced by Ambac Assurance, Ambac Assurance has been unable to pay common dividends to Ambac since 2008 and will be unable to pay common dividends in 2016 &#32;without the prior consent of the OCI, which is unlikely. See Note 9. Insurance Regulatory Restrictions &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further information on dividends. 

Ambac Assurance&#8217;s ability to pay dividends is further restricted by the Settlement Agreement and by certain covenants made for the benefit of the Segregated Account. See Note 1. Background and Business Description &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further information. 

&#160;

As a result of these restrictions, Ambac Assurance is not expected to pay dividends to Ambac for the foreseeable future. 

Ambac UK is not expected to pay any dividends to Ambac Assurance for the foreseeable future. While the UK insurance regulatory laws impose no statutory restrictions on a general insurer&#8217;s ability to declare a dividend, the PRA&#8217;s and FCA&#8217;s capital requirements in practice act as a restriction on the payment of dividends, where a firm has a lower level of regulatory capital than its regulatory capital requirement as is the case for Ambac UK. Further, the FSA amended Ambac UK&#8217;s license in 2010 such that the PRA must specifically approve (&#8220;non-objection&#8221;) any transfer of value and/or assets from Ambac UK to Ambac Assurance or any other Ambac group company, other than in respect of certain disclosed contracts between the two parties (such as in respect of a management services agreement between Ambac Assurance and Ambac UK). 

Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement Ambac Assurance may not make any &#8220;Restricted Payment&#8221; (which includes dividends from Ambac Assurance to Ambac) in excess of $5 million in the aggregate per annum, other than Restricted Payments from Ambac Assurance to Ambac in an amount up to $7.5 million per annum solely to pay operating expenses of Ambac. Concurrent with making any such Restricted Payment, a pro-rata amount of the surplus notes issued by Ambac Assurance under the Settlement Agreement would also need to be redeemed at par. 

Under the terms of Ambac Assurance&#8217;s Auction Market Preferred Shares (&#8220;AMPS&#8221;), dividends may not be paid on the common stock of Ambac Assurance unless all accrued and unpaid dividends on the AMPS for the then current dividend period have been paid, provided, that dividends on the common stock may be made at all times for the purpose of, and only in such amounts as are necessary for, enabling Ambac (i) to service its indebtedness for borrowed money as such payments become due or (ii) to pay its operating expenses. If dividends are paid on the common stock as provided in the prior sentence, dividends on the AMPS become cumulative until the date that all accumulated and unpaid dividends have been paid on the AMPS. 

FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT 

Ambac&#8217;s Financial Services business segment is conducted through subsidiaries of Ambac Assurance, which provide financial and investment products, including investment agreements, funding conduits and interest rate swaps, principally to the clients of its financial guarantee business. Ambac Assurance insures all of the obligations of its financial services subsidiaries. These businesses are in active runoff, which is being effectuated by transaction terminations, settlements, and scheduled amortization of contracts. The Financial Services business also maintains interest rate derivatives to mitigate exposure to floating rate insured obligations in the Financial Guarantee segment. 

The principal factors that may affect the Financial Services Segment results include: (1) availability of counterparties for hedging transactions; (2) investment returns; (3) the value of future contract terminations or settlements which may differ from carrying value of the those contracts; (4) collateral posting requirements; (5) the availability of liquidity from Ambac Assurance; (6) changes in the fair value of the derivatives portfolio resulting from interest rate fluctuations; (7) timing of investment agreement withdrawals; and (8) restrictions imposed upon Ambac Assurance by the contracts executed with the Segregated Account and the Settlement 

| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 16 &#32;&#32;&#32;2015 FORM 10-K | 

Agreement, and, to the extent that policies allocated to the Segregated Account are implicated, the authority of the Rehabilitator of the Segregated Account to control the management of the Segregated Account. 

Investment Agreements 

Ambac&#8217;s investment agreements were issued to structured finance and municipal issuers through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Ambac Capital Funding. Investment agreements were customized for each investor to provide guaranteed interest and return of principal in accordance with their requirements. Each investment agreement was insured by Ambac Assurance through a financial guarantee insurance policy. 

Liquidity risk exists in the business due to contract provisions which require collateral posting and allow for early termination of investment agreements. As of December 31, 2015 , all investment agreement principal and accrued interest outstanding of $100.4 million was collateralized. Funding for the collateral and previous early terminations was supported in part through loans between Ambac Capital Funding and Ambac Assurance. At December 31, 2015 , Ambac Capital Funding was indebted to Ambac Assurance in the amount of $195.1 million. 

See &#8220;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#8221; of the Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; included in Part II, Item 7 and Note 15. Obligations Under Investment Agreements &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further information on investment agreements. 

Derivative Products 

The primary activities in the derivative products business are to manage the runoff of derivatives with financial guarantee clients and to facilitate the mitigation of interest rate exposure for the Financial Guarantee segment via swaps and exchange traded U.S. treasury futures. Derivative transactions are executed through Ambac Financial Services (&#8220;AFS&#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ambac Assurance. The derivative products portfolio is positioned to benefit from rising rates as an economic hedge against interest rate exposure in the financial guarantee insurance portfolio. This hedge position may have a significant impact on the results of the Financial Services segment. Under the agreements governing the derivative positions, AFS generally must post collateral or margin in excess of the market value of the swaps and futures contracts. In addition, most of AFS&#8217;s counterparties currently possess the right to terminate their transactions with AFS and in the event of a full rehabilitation of Ambac Assurance, some of AFS&#8217;s swaps could automatically terminate. A sudden termination of AFS&#8217;s derivatives, whether voluntarily or automatically, could result in losses. AFS has borrowed cash and securities from Ambac Assurance, to help support its incremental collateral and margin posting requirements, previous termination payments and other cash needs. At December 31, 2015 , AFS was indebted to Ambac Assurance in the amounts of $680.6 million in cash loans and $64.6 million in borrowed securities. 

Credit risks relating to derivative positions primarily concern the default of a counterparty. Counterparty default exposure is mitigated through the use of industry standard collateral posting agreements. For counterparties subject to such collateral posting agreements, collateral is posted when a derivative counterparty&#8217;s credit exposure 

&#160;

exceeds contractual limits. Derivative contracts entered into with financial guarantee customers are not subject to collateral posting agreements. Credit risk associated with such customer derivatives, including credit derivatives, is managed through the financial guarantee portfolio risk management processes described in the Financial Guarantee Segment noted above. In some cases, derivatives between Ambac and financial guarantee customers are placed through a third party financial intermediary and similarly do not require collateral posting. 

AFS manages a variety of market risks inherent in its businesses, including credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal. These risks are identified, measured, and monitored through a variety of control mechanisms, which are in place at different levels throughout the organization. See &#8220;Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk&#8221; included in Part II, Item 7A in this Form 10-K for further information. 

Funding Conduits 

A subsidiary of Ambac has previously transferred financial assets to two special purpose entities. The business purpose of these entities was to provide certain financial guarantee clients with funding for their debt obligations. The activities of the special purpose entities are contractually limited to purchasing assets from Ambac, issuing medium-term notes (&#8220;MTNs&#8221;) to fund such purchases, executing derivative hedges and obtaining financial guarantee policies with respect to indebtedness incurred. As of December 31, 2015 , Ambac Assurance had financial guarantee insurance policies issued for all assets, MTNs and derivative contracts owned and outstanding by the entities. Ambac does not consolidate these entities under the relevant accounting guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies &#32;and Note 4. Special Purpose Entities, Including Variable Interest Entities &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for further information. 

INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENT POLICY 

As of December 31, 2015 , the consolidated non-VIE investments of Ambac had an aggregate fair value of approximately $5.6 billion . Investments are managed internally by officers of Ambac, who are experienced investment managers, and by external investment managers. All investments are made in accordance with the general objectives and guidelines for investments reviewed or overseen by Ambac Assurance and Ambac UK&#8217;s respective Boards of Directors. These guidelines include liquidity, credit quality, diversification and duration objectives, and are periodically reviewed and revised as appropriate. Additionally, senior credit personnel monitor the portfolio on a continuous basis. Credit monitoring of the investment portfolio includes procedures on residential mortgage-backed securities consistent with those utilized to assess the risk of our insured RMBS exposures. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the Ambac Assurance and Everspan non-VIE investment portfolio had an aggregate fair value of approximately $4.7 billion. Ambac Assurance&#8217;s and Everspan&#8217;s investment objectives are to achieve the highest risk-adjusted after-tax return on a diversified portfolio consistent with Ambac Assurance&#8217;s and Everspan&#8217;s risk tolerance while employing active asset/liability management practices to satisfy all operating and strategic liquidity needs. Ambac Assurance&#8217;s investment portfolio is subject to internal investment guidelines and is subject to limits 

| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 17 &#32;&#32;&#32;2015 FORM 10-K | 

on types and quality of investments imposed by applicable insurance laws and regulations. Ambac Assurance purchases Ambac Assurance insured securities given their relative risk/reward characteristics. Ambac Assurance financial guarantee policies related to most of these securities have been allocated to the Segregated Account. As described in Note 1. Background and Business Description &#32;to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K, Ambac Assurance&#8217;s investment policies are subject to certain covenants made for the benefit of the Segregated Account and, therefore, such policies may be subject to restrictions outside the control of management. Such covenants could adversely impact the performance of the investment portfolio. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the non-VIE Ambac UK investment portfolio had an aggregate fair value of approximately $0.6 billion. Ambac UK&#8217;s investment policy is designed with the primary objective of ensuring that Ambac UK is able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, in particular with respect to policy holders and meeting their claims. Ambac UK&#8217;s investment portfolio is subject to internal investment guidelines and may be subject to limits on types and quality of investments imposed by its regulator. The Board of Directors of Ambac UK approves any changes or exceptions to Ambac UK&#8217;s investment policy. 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015 , the non-VIE Financial Services investment portfolio had an aggregate fair value of approximately $0.1 billion. The primary investment objective is to invest in a diversified portfolio of high-grade securities that produce sufficient cash flow to satisfy all investment agreement liabilities while meeting the related collateral requirements. The investment portfolio is subject to internal investment guidelines. Such guidelines set forth minimum credit rating requirements and credit risk concentration limits. 

As of December 31, 2015 , the non-VIE Corporate investment portfolio had an aggregate fair value of approximately $0.2 billion. The primary investment objective is to preserve capital for strategic uses while maximizing income. The investment portfolio is subject to internal investment guidelines. Such guidelines set forth minimum credit rating requirements and credit risk concentration limits.
