&#160;

Corporate Structure 

&#160;

We were incorporated as Cetrone Energy Company on January 28, 2008 in the State of Nevada. From inception until we completed our reverse acquisition of FSP, the principal business of the Company originally was to develop "green" renewable fuel sources for agricultural operations, specifically biodiesel. On July 26, 2010, we filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation changing our name to Fresh Start Private Management, Inc. During that time, we had no revenue and our operations were limited to capital formation, organization, and development of our business plan and target customer market. As a result of the reverse acquisition of FSP, on October 31, 2011, we ceased our prior operations and we are now a holding company and our wholly owned subsidiary engages in alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment through our BioCorRx &#210; Recovery Program. 

&#160;

On October 31, 2011, we completed a reverse acquisition transaction through a share exchange with FSP whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of FSP in exchange for 37,000,000 shares of our common stock, which represented approximately 31.3% of our total shares outstanding immediately following the closing of the Share Exchange. As a result of the Share Exchange, FSP became our wholly-owned subsidiary. 

&#160;

The share exchange transaction with FSP was treated as a reverse acquisition, with FSP as the acquirer and the Company as the acquired party. Unless the context suggests otherwise, when we refer in this Report to business and financial information for periods prior to the consummation of the reverse acquisition, we are referring to the business and financial information of FSP. &#160; On January 7, 2014, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation changing our name to BioCorRx &#210; Inc.

Business Overview 

&#160;

Through our wholly owned subsidiary, we distribute and license the BioCorRx &#210; Recovery Program for alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment headquartered in Santa Ana, California. We were established in January 2010 and are currently operating in Santa Ana, California. We developed the BioCorRx &#210; Recovery Program for the treatment of alcoholism and opioid addiction consisting of a Naltrexone implant that is placed under the skin in the lower abdomen coupled with a counseling/life coaching program including sessions (16 sessions on average but not limited to) from specialized life coaches and/or counselors. 

&#160;

We operate within the Specialty Hospitals, Expert Psychiatric industry, specifically within the industry subsets of Alcoholism Rehabilitation Hospital . 

&#160;

The BioCorRx &#210; Recovery Program 

&#160;

We have developed and own the rights to an innovative alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment program, called BioCorRx &#210; Recovery Program, that empowers patients to succeed in their overall recovery. We offer a comprehensive medication-assisted treatment (MAT) program that combines non-addictive medication coupled with psycho-social counseling. We have been operating for approximately 60 months and over 700 patients have been treated with our program since we began operating. Currently, about 2 to 3 patients per month are being treated with our program. This number fluctuates depending on provider(s) current advertising. The addiction treatment services reported cost from provider to patient is an average of $17,500 per patient and a portion is sometimes covered by insurance. This amount varies due to many factors, the major ones being, type of insurance policy and patients out of network deductibles. In addition, there are the service provider expenses, and surgery center costs (if not done in the medical provider's office). Services may also be provided to cash patients, by licensed providers, at discounted rates due to financial difficulties. 

&#160;

The BioCorRx &#210; Recovery Program is a comprehensive addiction program which includes life coaching and/or counseling (16 sessions on average but not limited to), coupled with a Naltrexone Implant. The implant is specifically compounded with a prescription from a medical doctor for each individual and is designed to release naltrexone into the body over several months. The Naltrexone Implant means a single administration, long acting Naltrexone pellet(s) that consists of a naltrexone formulation in a biodegradable form that is suitable for subcutaneous implantation in a particular patient. 

&#160;

Treatment Philosophy 

&#160;

Our alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment program empowers patients to succeed. A detailed description of our treatment philosophy is as follows: 

&#160;

Medical Intervention: It is essential to significantly reduce a patient's cravings for alcohol and opioids in order to fully break the cycle of addiction. We have built our BioCorRx &#210; Recovery Program around a state-of-the-art, minimally invasive, biodegradable implant of Naltrexone. Naltrexone is an FDA-approved pharmaceutical used for the treatment of alcoholism and opioid addiction. A licensed physician surgically inserts a marble-sized pellet(s) under the skin in the lower abdomen. The pellet is absorbed into the body and dissolves within several months following the procedure in most patients depending on their metabolism and other factors. 

&#160;

Focus on Treatment: Unlike many other addiction treatment programs, we focus entirely on the treatment of alcohol and opioid addiction. It is our belief that alcohol and opioid addiction should be treated differently from most addictions to other substances. &#160;

&#160; 4 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Comprehensive Approach: Alcoholism and opioid addiction is a complex disease that needs a program specifically designed to treat the body, the mind, and the spirit of an addict. We have created a comprehensive recovery program that includes state-of-the-art medical intervention, individually tailored coaching and/or counseling program sessions, rebuilding of the networks of family and friends, and post-treatment continuing care. Our program typically lasts for up to 6 months from the initial surgical procedure of inserting the Naltrexone pellet(s). We believe that through our comprehensive treatment method, clients will have the highest possible chances of full recovery from alcohol and opioid dependency. 

&#160;

Focus on Family and Friends: We believe that the attention from family and friends are the most important elements in the treatment of alcohol and opioid addiction. The program makes family and friends an essential element of the patients' recovery and asks that they play an important role in both the initial treatment phase and in the long-term recovery process. 

&#160;

Program Description 

&#160;

We offer a comprehensive and highly effective alcohol and opioid addiction treatment program. Our proprietary program is designed to offer treatment and healing to both the body and the mind of an addict. Our alcoholism and opioid addiction treatment program is a two-part program that includes: (i) the insertion of a Naltrexone Implant that is believed to reduce physical cravings of alcohol and opioids by a trained physician; and (ii) life coaching and/or counseling that focuses on the mental addiction of alcoholism and opioid addiction. The following is a detailed description of our alcohol treatment program. 

&#160;

Naltrexone Implant: Our unique program has reduced physical cravings for numerous patients suffering from alcoholism and opioid addiction. Our implant is believed to reduce cravings over the period of several months in most patients depending on their metabolism and other factors. During this time, the program focuses on addressing the mental dependence on alcohol and opioids. The implant is a Naltrexone pellet(s) that is the size of a marble and inserted via an outpatient surgical procedure into the lower abdomen of the patient. The Naltrexone pellet will be absorbed by the body over several months and will automatically dissolve and not need to be removed. 

&#160;

All procedures to place the Naltrexone pellets into patients are performed at several independently owned and licensed provider locations. There are over 15 licensed providers throughout California, Arizona, Connecticut, Atlanta, Illinois, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Tennessee, Nevada, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that offer the BioCorRx &#210; Recovery Program. Addresses of all independently owned provider locations offering our program are available on our website www.beataddiction.com. The procedures are performed by a licensed medical physician. 

&#160;

The Naltrexone implant is produced by select compounding pharmacies contracted by Trinity Compound Solutions, Inc. We entered into an exclusive license dated September 7, 2010 (the "License Agreement") with Trinity Compound Solutions, Inc. (formerly known as Trinity Rx Solutions, LLC) ("Trinity"). In accordance with the terms and provisions of the License Agreement, Trinity shall provide to us access to the Naltrexone implant that has been designed for alcoholism and opioid addiction. As consideration for the License Agreement, the Company has issued 5,672,250 shares of our common stock (which was equal to 7.5% of the total shares outstanding at the time of the execution of the agreement) and a payment of $600 for each prescription requested by us. 

&#160;

A copy of the License Agreement with Trinity is incorporated herein by reference and was filed as Exhibit 10.3 to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 4, 2011. The description of the transaction contemplated by such License Agreement set forth herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the exhibit filed therewith and incorporated herein by reference. &#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The Naltrexone implant is two small pellets that are inserted beneath the skin in the subcutaneous fat located in the lower abdomen. The implant procedure is an outpatient procedure that takes approximately 30 minutes. A local anesthetic is administered when the pellets are implanted and the patient is free to leave the clinic and return to normal activities within a few hours of the procedure in most cases. The pellets are biodegradable and will gradually dissolve in the human body. The pellets contain a medicine called Naltrexone, which has been shown to block receptors in the brain that crave alcohol and opioids. Naltrexone is an FDA approved medication and all patients are required to obtain a prescription for the drug from a medical doctor. The doctors employed by the licensed providers are responsible for evaluating the patients, determining if the patient is a candidate and, if so, writing the prescription. The prescription is then presented to compounding pharmacies contracted by Trinity that produce the pellets using Naltrexone as the core ingredient. 

&#160;

Once the pellet is implanted in the patient, they are usually free to return to work on the next business day and will be contacted by a life coach and/or counselor within the next 2 to 3 days to begin coaching and/or counseling sessions, if not sooner. 

&#160;

BioCorRx &#210; Recovery Program Counseling: We developed a counseling program to assist patients in treating their dependence on alcohol and opioids. Prior to, or upon receiving the Naltrexone implant, each patient will meet with a counselor. This counselor will counsel the patient for the next 6 months following the implant to help them cope with and address their dependence on alcohol and/or opioids. Each patient receives approximately 16 1-hour sessions with a counselor. 

&#160;

As part of the life coaching and/or counseling service, life coaches/counselors focus on bringing family and friends into the recovery process. This provides emotional support for patients and allows them to understand that they have people that care for them and want them to remain sober. 

&#160;

The final part of the life coaching and/or counseling is remaining in contact with patients after the 6 month period of direct coaching and/or counseling is over. Contact with patients is encouraged after the procedure and life coaching and/or counseling is completed to ensure that clients maintain their sobriety and remain fully committed to sober living. 

&#160;

Marketing Strategy 

&#160;

We have and will continue to use a variety of advertising and marketing channels to increase our exposure and awareness to prospective patients about our BioCorRx &#210; Recovery Program. In addition to word of mouth from patients, we are focusing advertising and public relations on the radio, television and digital. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We offer a unique, proprietary treatment plan for alcoholism and opioid addiction. However, there are many services and clinics that already provide support for addiction. There are rehabilitation and treatment centers within close proximity to our licensed providers that provide alcohol and opioid addiction treatment and detoxification services. We hope to distinguish ourselves from our competition by proving that our program is successful and our success rate is much higher than our competitors. We intend to continue our expansion of the number of licensed providers throughout the United States using our program on their patients. 

&#160;

The following is a detailed description of leading rehabilitation service providers in and around our current area of operations: 

&#160;

Passages: a treatment center for people with addiction problems. Located in Malibu, California, Passages is run by a father-son team of treatment specialists. It offers a unique philosophy and treatment method, utilizing one-on-one therapy sessions. Passages provides clients with over 100 hours of attention by the end of their month long stay. However, Passages has received scrutiny for its unconventional methods. Portions of Passages philosophy run counter to the majority of scientific research into addiction. These aspects of Passages' philosophy include denial of addiction as a disease, and an elimination of the 12-step method. &#160;

&#160; 6 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Cliffside: a personalized alcohol and drug rehabilitation provider located in Malibu, California. It employs a range of traditional and alternative treatments including personal, group, and family counseling, herbology, massage, yoga, and acupuncture. Cliffside offers treatment for alcohol, cocaine, heroin, pharmaceuticals, and methamphetamine addiction along with interventions, drug rehab, opiates detox, and treatment for depression and eating disorders. On the other hand, Cliffside is one of the "luxury" addiction treatment centers located in Malibu, and charges large fees for its services. 

&#160;

Growth Strategy 

&#160;

We have developed a program that we believe helps patients battle their mental and physical addiction to alcohol and opioids. We are currently operating in Santa Ana, California and market nationally. We are currently considering distributing to additional locations in the United States and expect to use proceeds from the sale of stock as well as operating income to expand to these locations once we deem them viable. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

On June 30, 2015, we acquired the complete rights, title and interest in the Naltrexone Implant Formulation used specifically in the BioCorRx Recovery Program for an aggregate purchase price of $1,132,000 comprised of an obligation to pay $1,000,000 over 14 months starting October 1, 2015 and 3,000,000 of the Company's common stock at the market value of $0.044 per share as of the date of the agreement. 

&#160; &#160;

Government Regulation and Approvals 

&#160;

All surgical procedures need to be completed by a licensed physician. 

&#160;

The Naltrexone implant does not need any approval because Naltrexone is already an FDA approved medication. Once the physician writes a prescription for Naltrexone, a pharmacist can put it into a compounded form under U.S. Compounding laws and then administer the medication. 

&#160;

Other than the necessary approvals described above, we are not aware of any other governmental regulations or approvals for any of our products. 

&#160;
