 Item 1. Business 

General 

References to &#8220;Easterly,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our company&#8221; refer to Easterly Government Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries including Easterly Government Properties LP, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to herein as our operating partnership. 

We are an internally managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, focused primarily on the acquisition, development and management of Class A commercial properties that are leased to U.S. Government agencies that serve essential functions. We generate substantially all of our revenue by leasing our properties to such agencies through the U.S. General Services Administration, or GSA. Our objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long term through dividends and capital appreciation. 

As of December 31, 2015, we wholly owned 36 properties in the United States, including 33 properties that are leased primarily to U.S. Government tenant agencies and three properties that are entirely leased to private tenants, encompassing approximately 2.6 million square feet in the aggregate. We focus on acquiring, developing and managing GSA-leased properties that are essential to supporting the mission of the tenant agency and strive to be a partner of choice for the U.S. Government, working closely with the GSA to meet the needs and objectives of the tenant agency. 

We were incorporated in Maryland as a corporation on October 9, 2014 and did not have any meaningful operations until the completion of the formation transactions and our initial public offering on February 11, 2015. In connection with our initial public offering, we engaged in certain formation transactions, or the formation transactions, pursuant to which our operating partnership acquired (i) 15 properties previously owned by the Easterly Funds (as defined below), (ii) 14 properties previously owned by Western Devcon, Inc., a private real estate company, and a series of related entities beneficially owned by Michael P. Ibe, which we refer to collectively as Western Devcon and (iii) all of the ownership interests i n the management entities (as defined below). After our initial public offering, we acquired two properties in the second quarter of 2015, one property in the third quarter of 2015 and four properties in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Our predecessor means Easterly Partners, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries, including (i) all entities or interests in U.S. Government Properties Income and Growth Fund L.P., U.S. Government Properties Income and Growth Fund REIT, Inc. and the related feeder and subsidiary entities, which we refer to, collectively, as Easterly Fund I, (ii) all entities or interests in U.S. Government Properties Income and Growth Fund II, LP, USGP II REIT LP, USGP II (Parallel) Fund, LP and their related feeders and subsidiary entities, which w e refer to, collectively, as Easterly Fund II and, together with Easterly Fund I, we refer to as the Easterly Funds and (iii) the entities that managed the Easterly Funds, which we refer to as the management entities. 

Our operating partnership holds substantially all of our assets and conducts substantially all of our business. We own approximately 60.9% of the aggregate operating partnership units in our operating partnership. We intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT and operate in a manner that we believ e allows us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015.

Since our initial public offering and the formation transactions occurred on February 11, 2015, the results of operations and financial condition for the entities acquired by us in connection with our initial public offering and related formation transactions are not included in certain historical financial statements. More specifically, our results of operations and financial condition for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflect the results of operations and financial condition for our predecessor. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflect the results of operation and financial condition for our predecessor together with the entities we acquired at and after the time of our initial public offering. The results of operations for each of these acquisitions are included in our consolidated statements of operations only from the date of acquisition. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe that we distinguish ourselves from other owners and operators of office and other commercial properties, including properties leased to the U.S. Government, through the following competitive strengths: 

&#160;

&#183; 

High Quality Portfolio Leased to Mission-Critical U.S. Government Agencies . We are the only internally managed public REIT that focuses primarily on the acquisition, development and management of Class A commercial properties that are leased to U.S. Government agencies, primarily through the GSA. We wholly own 36 high quality properties in the United States that are currently 100% leased, including 33 properties leased primarily to U.S. Government tenant 

&#160;

&#160;

agencies. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average age of our propertie s was approximately twelve years, and the weighted average remaining lease term was approximately 7 years. A majority of our properties are leased to U.S. Government agencies that serve mission-critical functions and are of high importance within the hiera rchy of these agencies. These properties generally meet our investment criteria, which target major federal buildings of Class A construction that are less than 20 years old, are at least 85% leased to a single U.S. Government agency, are in excess of 40,0 00 rentable square feet with expansion potential, are in strategic locations to facilitate the tenant agency&#8217;s mission, include build-to-suit features and are focused on environmental sustainability. &#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

U.S. Government Tenant Base with Strong History of Renewal . Our GSA leases are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, are paid for through the Federal Buildings Fund and are not subject to direct federal appropriations. Furthermore, the GSA has never experienced a financial default. In addition to stable rent payments, our GSA leases typically have initial total terms of ten to 20 years with renewal leases having terms of five to ten years. GSA leases governing properties similar to the properties that we target have historically had high r enewal rates, which limit operational risk. We believe that the strong credit quality of our U.S. Government tenant base, our long-term leases, the likelihood of lease renewal and the high tenant recovery rate for our property-related operating expenses contribute to the stability of our operating cash flows and expected distributions. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Experienced and Aligned Management Team . Our senior management team has a proven track record of sourcing, acquiring, developing and managing properties leased to U.S. Government agencies, primarily through the GSA. Our multidisciplinary team possesses complementary skills and experience that we expect will drive our business and growth strategies and includes the co-founders of our predecessor and the founder and president of a company specializing in the development of build-to-suit properties for the GSA. Collectively, our senior management team has been responsible for the acquisition of an aggregate of approximately 2.0 million square feet of GSA-leased properties and the development of approximately 1.1 million aggregate square feet of such properties. We believe that our management expertise provides us with a significant advantage over our competitors when pursuing acquisition opportunities and engaging the GSA in property development opportunities and by providing us with superior property management and tenant service capabilities. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Access to Acquisition Opportunities with an Active Pipeline . Our senior management team has an extensive network of longstanding relationships with owners, specialized developers, leasing brokers, lenders and other participants in the GSA-leased property market. Our team has been able to leverage these relationships to access a wide variety of sourcing opportunities, frequently resulting in the acquisition of properties that were not broadly marketed. In addition, we maintain a proprietary database that tracks approximately 8,500 leases totaling approximately 200 million rentable square feet and includes substantially every major U.S. Government-leased property that meets our investment criteria as well as information about the ownership of such properties. We believe that our longstanding industry relationships, coupled with our proprietary database, improve our ability to source and execute attractive acquisition opportunities. Further, these factors enable us to effectively initiate transactions with property owners who may not currently be seeking to sell their property, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage over others bidding in broadly marketed transactions. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Extensive Development Experience with U.S. Government-Leased Properties . Our senior management team has developed projects comprising approximately 4.2 million square feet, including 37 build-to-suit projects for the GSA as well as other corporate and government tenants. In the aggregate, our senior management team has developed 20 projects for the GSA. Development of government projects, particularly build-to-suit projects, requires expertise in GSA requirements and the needs of tenant agencies. Since 1994, members of our senior management team have developed an average of approximately 49,000 square feet per year of GSA-leased build-to-suit properties. We believe that our thorough understanding of the U.S. Government&#8217;s procurement processes and standards, our longstanding relationships with the GSA and other agencies of the U.S. Government, and our differentiated capabilities enables us to continue to compete effectively for U.S. Government development opportunities. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Value-Enhancing Asset Management . Our management team focuses on the efficient management of our properties and on improvements to our properties that enhance their value for a tenant agency and improve the likelihood of lease renewal. We work in close partnership with the GSA and tenant agencies to manage the construction of specialized, agency-specific design enhancements. These highly tailored build-outs substantially increase the likelihood of the tenant agency&#8217;s renewal and also typically generate a construction management fee paid by the tenant agency to us in the amount of approximately 15% of the actual cost of construction. We also seek to reduce operating costs at all of our properties, often by implementing energy efficiency programs that help the U.S. Government achieve its conservation and efficiency goals. Our asset management team also conducts frequent audits of each of our properties in concert with the GSA and the tenant agency so as to keep each facility in optimal condition, allowing the tenant agency to better perform its stated mission and helping to position us as a GSA partner of choice. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Growth-Oriented Capital Structure . As of December 31 , 2015, we had approximately $83.8 million of mortgage indebtedness and $154.4 million outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility for a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 26.1%. None of our outstanding indebtedness is scheduled to mature until 2019. &#160;

Business &#38; Growth Strategies 

Our objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long term through dividends and capital appreciation. We pursue the following strategies to achieve these goals: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Pursue attractive acquisition opportunities. We plan to engage in strategic and disciplined acquisitions of properties that we believe are essential to the mission of select U.S. Government agencies and that, in many cases, contain agency-specific design enhancements that allow each tenant agency to better satisfy its mission. We expect to target for acquisition primarily major federal buildings of Class A construction that are less than 20 years old, are at least 85% leased to a single U.S. Government agency, are in excess of 40,000 rentable square feet with expansion potential, are in strategic locations to facilitate the tenant agency&#8217;s mission, include build-to-suit features and are focused on environmental sustainability. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Develop Build-to-Suit U.S. Government Properties. We intend to pursue attractive opportunities to develop build-to-suit properties for use by certain U.S. Government agencies. As U.S. Government agencies expand, they often require additional space tailored specifically to their needs, which may not be available in the agency&#8217;s target market and therefore require new construction. The GSA typically solicits proposals from private companies to develop and lease such properties to the agency, rather than developing and owning the property itself. We expect to bid for those property development opportunities published by the GSA that suit our investment criteria. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Renew Existing Leases at Positive Spreads . We intend to renew leases at our GSA-leased properties at positive spreads upon expiration. Upon lease renewal, GSA rental rates are typically reset based on a number of factors, including inflation, the replacement cost of the building at the time of renewal and enhancements to the property since the date of the prior lease. During the term of a GSA lease, we work in close partnership with the GSA to implement improvements at our properties to enhance the U.S. Government tenant agency&#8217;s ability to perform its stated mission, thereby increasing the importance of the building to the tenant agency and the probability of an increase in rent upon lease renewal. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Reduce Property-Level Operating Expenses . We intend to manage our properties to increase our income by continuing to reduce property-level operating costs. We manage our properties in a cost efficient manner so as to eliminate any excess spending and streamline our operating costs. When we acquire a property, we review all property-level operating expenditures to determine whether and how the property can be managed more efficiently. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 we had 25 employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. 

Financial Information about Industry Segments 

Our principal business is the ownership and operation of Class A commercial properties that are leased to U.S. Government agencies. We do not distinguish or group our operations on a geographical basis when measuring performance. Accordingly, we believe we have a single reportable segment for disclosure purposes in accordance with GAAP. 

Significant Tenants 

Substantially all of our current rents come from U.S. Government tenant agencies, including rents paid through the GSA. As of December 31, 2015, our U.S. Government tenant agencies accounted for 96.2% of our annualized lease income. For further information on the composition of our tenant base, see &#8220;Item 2: Properties.&#8221; 

Insurance 

We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on all of our properties, with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement-cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. The majority of our property policies include coverage for the perils of flood and earthquake shock with limits and deductibles customary in the industry and specific to the property. We also generally obtain title insurance policies when 

&#160;

acquiring new properties, which insure fee title to our real properties. We curre ntly have coverage for losses incurred in connection with both domestic and foreign terrorist-related activities. While we do carry commercial general liability insurance, property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our properties, these pol icies include limits and terms we consider commercially reasonable. There are certain losses that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in our belief, economically impractical to maintai n such coverage. Should an uninsured loss arise against us, we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue, including litigation costs. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate given the relative risk of loss, th e cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of our management, the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured. 

Competition 

We compete with numerous developers, real estate companies and other owners of commercial properties for acquisitions and pursuing buyers for dispositions. We expect that other real estate investors, including insurance companies, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, other REITs and other well-capitalized investors will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. In addition, U.S. Government tenants are viewed as desirable tenants by other landlords because of their strong credit profile, and properties leased to U.S. Government tenant agencies often attract many potential buyers. This competition could increase prices for properties of the type we may pursue and adversely affect our profitability and impede our growth. In addition, substantially all of our properties face competition for tenants. Some competing properties may be newer, better located or more attractive to tenants. Competing properties may have lower rates of occupancy than our properties, which may result in competing owners offering available space at lower rents than we offer at our properties. This competition may affect our ability to attract and retain tenants, may reduce the rents we are able to charge and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Regulation 

Environmental and Related Matters 

Under various federal, state or local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous substances, waste, or petroleum products at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation or remediation, natural resource damages, or third-party liability for personal injury or property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence or release of such materials, and the liability may be joint and several. Some of our properties may be impacted by contamination arising from current or prior uses of the property or adjacent properties for commercial, industrial or other purposes. Such contamination may arise from spills of petroleum or hazardous substances or releases from tanks used to store such materials. We also may be liable for the costs of remediating contamination at off-site disposal or treatment facilities when we arrange for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances at such facilities, without regard to whether we comply with environmental laws in doing so. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination on our properties may adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants and our ability to develop or sell or borrow against those properties. 

In addition to potential liability for cleanup costs, private plaintiffs may bring claims for personal injury, property damage or for similar reasons. Environmental laws also may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the U.S. Government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which that property may be used or how businesses may be operated on that property. 

Some of our properties are, and may be adjacent to or near other properties, used for industrial or commercial purposes. These properties may have contained or currently contain underground storage tanks used to store petroleum products or other hazardous or toxic substances. Releases from these properties could impact our properties. While certain properties contain or contained uses that could have or have impacted our properties, we are not aware of any liabilities related to environmental contamination that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

In addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Noncompliance with these environmental and health and safety laws and regulations could subject us or our tenants to liability. These liabilities could affect a tenant&#8217;s ability to make rental payments to us. Moreover, changes in laws could increase the potential costs of compliance with such laws and regulations or increase liability for noncompliance. This may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise materially and adversely affect our operations, or those of our tenants, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on us. We sometimes require our private tenants to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities in our leases with them. But in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of any of our tenants to satisfy such obligations, we may be required to satisfy such obligations. We are not presently aware of any instances of material noncompliance with environmental or health and safety laws or regulations at our properties, and we 

&#160;

believe that we and/or our tenants have all material permits and approvals necessary u nder current laws and regulations to operate our properties. 

In recent years, in reaction to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the U.S. Government has instituted &#8220;green lease&#8221; policies that include the &#8220;Promotion of Energy Efficiency and Use of Renewable Energy&#8221; as one of the factors it considers when leasing property. In accordance with the U.S. Government&#8217;s general policy of preferring energy efficient buildings, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 allows the GSA to prefer buildings for lease that have received an &#8220;Energy Star&#8221; label. This label is received by buildings that reach a specified level of energy efficiency. There are currently four properties in our portfolio that have received the &#8220;Energy Star&#8221; label. 

The U.S. Government&#8217;s &#8220;green lease&#8221; initiative also permits U.S. Government tenants to require LEED-CI certification in selecting new premises or renewing leases at existing premises. Obtaining such certification may be costly and time consuming. There are currently ten properties in our portfolio that have achieved a total of 11 LEED certifications. For more information, see &#8220;Item 1.A Risk Factors.&#8221; 

With respect to properties we may develop, we may be subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning requirements. In addition, we will be subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with these developments in certain states and localities in which we operate even if all necessary U.S. Government approvals have been obtained. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing properties due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in certain states in which we intend to operate. 

Americans with Disabilities Act 

Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or ADA to the extent that such properties are &#8220;public accommodations&#8221; as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. We believe the existing properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect. 

Emerging Growth Company Status 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company,&#8221; as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies,&#8221; including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We take advantage of certain of these exemptions, including the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 

In addition, the JOBS Act also provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we have chosen to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of this extended transition period, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for all public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable. 

We will remain an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; until the earliest to occur of the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenue equals or exceeds $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation); the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering; the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt or the date on which we are deemed to be a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; under the Exchange Act. 

&#160;

REIT Qualification 

We intend to elect to be taxed as a REIT, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015. So long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on net taxable income that we distribute annually to our stockholders. In order to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the real estate qualification of sources of our income, the composition and values of our assets, the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the diversity of ownership of our stock. In order to comply with REIT requirements, we may need to forego otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities and the manner in which we conduct our operations. See &#8220;Item 1.A Risk Factors.&#8221;
