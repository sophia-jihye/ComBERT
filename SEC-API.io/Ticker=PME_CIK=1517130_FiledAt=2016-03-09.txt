 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Our Business 

&#160;

We are a marine enterprises group primarily engaging in ocean fishing through our wholly-owned PRC operating subsidiary and VIE, Fujian Provincial Pingtan County Ocean Fishing Group Co., Ltd., or Pingtan Fishing. We harvest a variety of fish species with our owned and licensed vessels operating within the Indian Exclusive Economic Zone and the Arafura Sea of Indonesia. We provide high quality seafood to a diverse group of customers including distributors, restaurant owners and exporters in the PRC.

&#160;

In June 2013, we expanded our fleet from 40 to 86 through a purchase of 46 fishing trawlers from a related party for a total consideration of $410.1 million. We began operating the vessels in the third quarter of 2013 and since then we have been entitled to their operations and net profits. Each vessel carries crew of 10 to 15 persons. These vessels have resulted in additional carrying capacity of approximately 45,000 to 50,000 tons for us.

&#160;

In September 2013, we further increased our fleet to 106 vessels with the addition of 20 newly-built fishing trawlers, which were initially ordered in September 2012. These vessels have an expected run-in period of 3 - 6 months, during which each is placed into the sea for testing prior to full operation. At full operation, each vessel is capable of harvesting 900 to 1,000 tons of fish.

&#160;

Subsequent to our fleet expansions, in September 2013, the Ministry of Agriculture of the People&#8217;s Republic of China (&#8220;MOA&#8221;) issued a notification that it would suspend accepting shipbuilding applications for tuna harvesting vessels, squid harvesting vessels, Pacific saury harvesting vessels, trawlers operating on international waters, seine on international waters, and trawlers operating on the Arafura Sea, Indonesia. We believe the announcement is a positive indicator for long-term stability and balance in China&#8217;s fishing industry.

&#160;

On December 4, 2013, in connection with the sale of China Dredging Group Co., Ltd (&#8220;CDGC&#8221;) to Hong Long, a related party, we acquired 25-year operating license rights in connection with the lease of 20 fishing drifters for the appraised fair market value of approximately $216.1 million, whereby we are entitled to 100% of the operations and net profits (losses) from the vessels for the term of the lease.

&#160;

In September 2014, we further expanded our fleet to 129 vessels with the addition of 3 newly-built fishing trawlers. At full operation, each vessel is capable of harvesting 2,000 tons of fish.

&#160;

In June 2015, we purchased 4 longline fishing vessels and 2 squid jigging vessels for the appraised fair market value of approximately $56.2 million. These vessels are primarily focused on catching tuna and squid.

&#160;

In addition to acquisitions of new vessels, we also seek to strengthen our fleet by continuously upgrading and renovating our existing vessels. In 2015, 13 aged fishing vessels were dismantled and replaced by 13 newly-built fishing vessels.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we own 107 trawlers, 4 longline fishing vessels, 2 squid jigging vessels and 2 drifters and have exclusive operating license rights to 20 drifters. We are the second largest China based fishery company operating its vessels outside of China waters and our fleet has an average remaining useful life of approximately 14 years. These vessels are fully licensed to fish in Indonesian, Indian, or Western and Central Pacific Ocean of the international waters. Among the 135 fishing vessels, 117 of these vessels are licensed to operate in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia but temporarily not operating due to the moratorium discussed below, 12 vessels are operating in the Bay of Bengal in India, and the remaining 6 are licensed to operate in international waters and will be replaced by 6 new vessels which are in construction.

&#160;

Currently we catch nearly 30 different species of fish including ribbon fish, Indian white shrimp, croaker fish, pomfret, Spanish mackerel, conger eel, squid and red snapper. All of our catch is shipped back to China. Our fishing vessels transport frozen catch to cold storage warehouse at nearby onshore fishing bases. We then arrange periodic charted transportation ships to deliver frozen stocks to our nine cold storage warehouses located in one of China&#8217;s largest seafood trading centers, Mawei Seafood Market in Fujian Province.

&#160;

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

We derive our revenue primarily from the sales of frozen seafood products. We sell our products directly to customers including distributors, restaurant owners and exporters Our operating results are subject to seasonal variations. Harvest volume is the highest in the fourth quarter of the year and harvest volumes in the second and third quarters are relatively low due to the spawning season of certain fish species, including ribbon fish, cuttlefish, butterfish, and calamari. Based on past experiences, demand for seafood products is the highest from December to January during Chinese New Year. We believe that our profitability and growth are dependent on our ability to expand our customer base.

&#160; 

Government Permits and Approvals 

&#160; 

We are required to go through series of procedures to obtain all approvals necessary to fish in the dedicated fishing areas.

&#160;

Step one : Obtaining Vessel Building Permits

&#160;

First, we have to file a vessel building application to the relevant governmental authorities in Fujian to obtain the Fishing Vessel and Net Tools Building Permits. Governmental authorities in Fujian verify Pingtan Fishing&#8217;s qualifications for pelagic fishing and pass on the verified and approved application documents to affiliates of the Ministry of Agriculture for further confirmation. Once confirmed, the certificates are issued to Pingtan Fishing.

&#160;

Step two : Vessels Building and Inspection

&#160;

After obtaining the Fishing Vessel and Net Tools Building Permits, we start building the new vessels through contracting with third party vessel manufacturers. During the period of construction, inspection of the vessels is performed several times by the relevant governmental authorities. Once the construction is completed, a Vessel Inspection Certificate is issued, after which we can apply for certificates of ownership and certificates of nationality for new vessels.

&#160;

Step three : Fishing Project Application

&#160;

After obtaining all certificates in step two, we file applications to the relevant governmental authorities to obtain approvals for pelagic fishing projects in the specified fishing areas. Meanwhile, we start the application process for obtaining fishing permits from the relevant governmental authorities in the applicable fishing destination countries.

&#160;

Step four : Preparations Before Departure

&#160;

Once the approval for pelagic fishing projects is issued, we can complete all relevant departure procedures within six months from the time the notification of approval is issued. Departure procedures include obtaining visas for fishing vessels and crew members, submitting required certificates to the PRC customs in Fujian, and obtaining other relevant documents from governmental authorities, such as Vessel Departure Certificates.

&#160;

Step five : Fishing Project Approval and Departure to Fishing Areas

&#160;

After we have submitted all required documents to the relevant governmental authorities and completed all procedures required for departure, we receive confirmation of pelagic fishing project approval from affiliates of the Ministry of Agriculture. Once we obtain such confirmation, our vessels can departure to the applicable fishing destination country. Fish caught at the destination may then be shipped back and be declared at the PRC customs.

&#160;

In early December 2014, the Indonesian government introduced a six-month moratorium on issuing new fishing licenses and renewals so that the country&#8217;s Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (&#8220;MMAF&#8221;) could monitor the operations of existing fleets and to fight illegal fishing activities. As a result, all licensed fishing vessels operating in Indonesian waters have been informed by the Indonesian government to operate within strict guidelines in order to avoid potential enforcement actions, such as boat seizures, by the Indonesian Navy. We currently operate 135 fishing vessels and have a license to operate 117 of these vessels operate in the Arafura Sea of Indonesia. To cooperate and remain in compliance with the Indonesian government&#8217;s fishing license check procedures, in January 2015, we lowered our operation to approximately half of our normal level. From February 2015, we have temporarily ceased operations in the Indonesian waters. Since we derive a majority of our revenue from this area, this temporary ban has caused a significant drop in our production. As a result, our sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased significantly as compared to that of 2014. In November 2015, the Indonesian government announced that the moratorium had concluded. Our expectation is that the MMAF will implement new fishing policies and resume the license renewal process although this has not yet occurred. In the interim, our financial results will continue to be materially adversely affected by this moratorium.

Operations 

&#160; 

Harvesting Operations 

&#160; 

The fishing vessels can carry up to one-month of supplies. The captains of the vessels utilize sophisticated technology to identify, among other things, fishing areas, time to cast and draw in the nets, vessel speed and sailing direction allowing the vessels to optimize the catch and resource value. Nearby fishing groups share real-time fishing information through wireless radio equipment. The catch is separated based on species and sizes, and is frozen immediately.

&#160;

Once the storage of a fishing vessel is at capacity, it returns to the fishing base and transfers the catch to a transportation vessels docked at the fishing base port. We have entered into a contract with Avona Mina Lestari (&#8220;Avona&#8221;), which operates a fishing base owned by Mr. Xinrong Zhuo, our founder and chairman, to obtain access to the base and secure certain services including custom declaration and fishing permits registrations. We also use the fishing base to repair our vessels, if necessary.

&#160;

Transportation 

&#160; 

Transportation vessels are responsible for the shipment of fishing supplies and fish between the fishing areas and China. Pingtan Fishing ships its goods by contracting with three affiliate marine transportation firms and Avona. The transportation cycle typically takes no more than 30 days, depending mainly on the fishing seasons.

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160; 

The peak season for the fishing industry in Indonesia is from October to January, which is when harvesting is most productive. During the low season, from May to July, there are fewer fish as they migrate to different areas. There is no off season for fishing in Pingtan Fishing&#8217;s dedicated fishing zone in Indonesia.

&#160;

In addition to seasonality, our annual catches are affected by a number of unpredictable factors, such as weather patterns and fish migration, which are likely to vary from year to year.

&#160;

Cold Storage 

&#160;

Fish are stored separately according to different species and sizes for best practices of cold storage management, goods selectivity and delivery. When Pingtan Fishing unloads the fish, it places the fish on a wood pallet according to fishing vessel number, species and size. The cold storage administrator counts the number of bags on each pallet and weighs each pallet to record the weight. Pallets with bags of fish are then placed in specified positions within the cold storage facilities.

&#160;

We have secured several cold storages located in one of China&#8217;s largest seafood trading center, MaWei seafood market. The monthly rent for the cold storage is RMB80 (US$13) per square meter and the leases are renewable annually. The following table sets forth information regarding the cold storages we currently rent as of December 31, 2015:

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

We market, sell and distribute products all over China, including the Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces. Croaker fish, ribbon fish and pomfret were the main types of seafood sold for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing 80.5% of the sales.

&#160;

We have established long-term relationships with a number of customers, who send purchasing representatives to our cold storage facilities to select goods to purchase. The customer indicates the type, size and quantity as well as price and delivery schedules before the fish is moved into our cold storage facilities. Handling and transportation fees are borne by the customer when the goods are delivered. The proportion of these sales depends on the season and the nature of the catch including species, size and quality. Remaining products are sold out of cold storage within three months of landing.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we sold our fish to over 200 distributors and retailers by acting as a wholesaler. We serve a wide customer base and no customer accounted for more than 10% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2015.

&#160; 

Vessels 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we owned 107 trawlers, 4 longline fishing vessels, 2 squid jigging vessels and 2 drifters and have exclusive operating license rights to 20 drifters. Our fleet has an average useful life of approximately 14 years. These vessels are fully licensed to fish in Indonesian or Indian waters or Western and Central Pacific Ocean of the international waters. Among the 135 fishing vessels, 117 of these vessels are licensed to operate in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia but temporarily not operating due to the moratorium discussed below, 12 vessels are operating in the Bay of Bengal in India, and the remaining 6 are licensed to operate in international waters and will be replaced by 6 new vessels which are in construction.

&#160;

Single trawling vessels drag pocket-shaped nets and therefore force the fish into the nets. The trawl net on a trawling vessel is drawn by a winch on the deck of the vessel. Fish are sorted and stored in the cold storage on board the vessel. Single trawling vessels can catch species living in the upper layer of water. It has the advantage of catching multiple species of fish, which leads to a varied catch. Single trawling vessels are the majority of fishing vessels we currently use. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 107 trawling vessels. 95 of the trawling vessels were in operation in Indonesian waters and the others were in Indian waters.

&#160;

Drifter vessels, as known as drifter netter vessels, have a gill net that is tied to the drift netter floats with weights attached to the net to keep it vertical, so that fish crossing the path of a drift net gets caught in it. Operations are generally carried out at night and the position of gill nets can be adjusted according to the water depth in which the fish move at any time. Drifter netter vessels are mainly used to catch dispersed fish or fish swimming in the upper layer of water. We operate 2 drifter vessels which are owned and 20 which we hold operating license rights to those vessels as of December 31, 2015.

&#160;

Business Strategy 

&#160;

We are committed to developing our business to become a global, integrated seafood company. We plan to enlarge our fishing fleet in the next few years through organic growth and acquisition opportunities of potential targets, domestically and abroad.

&#160;

We are actively seeking opportunities to expand to other fishing grounds worldwide including North America, South America and the High Sea, which will further diversify the fish types we harvest as well as decrease our dependence on Indonesia. We are also planning to extend to fish processing business. If we operate fish processing plants, our goal is to market processed food products throughout China and in international markets while achieving forward integration of the industrial chain.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We engage in the fishing business in the Arafura Sea in Indonesia, the Bay of Bengal in India, and the Western and Central Pacific Ocean of the international waters. We believe that competition within our dedicated fishing areas is not significant, as we believe the region is not currently overfished.

&#160;

Competition in the consumer market in China is high as fish compete with other sources of protein. We compete with other fishing companies which offer similar and varied products. There is significant demand for fish in the Chinese market. Our catch appeals to a wide segment of consumers because of the low price points of our products. We have generally been able to sell our catch at market prices.

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 1,650 employees. The following table sets forth the number of employees by function as of December 31, 2015:

&#160;

&#160; &#160; Number of Employees &#160; &#160; % of Total &#160; Management and administrative staff &#160; &#160; 68 &#160; &#160; &#160; 4.1 % Crew members &#160; &#160; 1,582 &#160; &#160; &#160; 95.9 % Total &#160; &#160; 1,650 &#160; &#160; &#160; 100.0 % &#160;

We also use local Indonesian contract labor to supplement the Chinese crew, which varies based on seasons. In addition, we engage Avona as our agent to contract with third party labor companies to hire local crew members and we pay the hiring costs based on the actual fees incurred. Our company and Avona settle this payment on a quarterly basis. Welfare and benefit payments for such personnel are covered by the company supplying the crew members.
