Our Company 

Mueller Water Products, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was incorporated on September 22, 2005 under the name Mueller Holding Company, Inc. It is the surviving corporation of the merger of Mueller Water Products, LLC and Mueller Water Products Co-Issuer, Inc. with and into Mueller Holding Company, Inc. on February 2, 2006, when we changed our name to Mueller Water Products, Inc. On June 1, 2006, we completed an initial public offering of 28,750,000 shares of Series A common stock. 

On December 14, 2006, Walter Industries, Inc., our parent company at that time,distributed to its shareholders 85,844,920 shares of our Series B common stock (the &#8220;Spin-off&#8221;). Walter Industries subsequently changed its name to Walter Energy, Inc. (&#8220;Walter Energy&#8221;). On January 28, 2009, each share of Series B common stock was converted into one share of Series A common stock and the Series A designation was discontinued. 

On September 23, 2009, we completed a public offering of 37,122,000 shares of common stock. 

On April 1, 2012 , we sold U.S. Pipe. 

We are a leading manufacturer and marketer of products and services used in the transmission, distribution and measurement of water in North America. Our products and services are used by municipalities and the residential and non-residential construction industries.

Description of Products and Services 

We offer a broad line of water infrastructure, flow control and piping component system products and services primarily in the United States and Canada. Mueller Co. sells water and gas valves and fire hydrants. Anvil sells a broad range of pipe fittings, couplings and hangers. Mueller Technologies companies sell water metering products and systems and leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services. Our products are designed, manufactured and tested in compliance with industry standards, where applicable. 

Mueller Co. 

Mueller Co.&#8217;s water distribution products are manufactured to meet or exceed American Water Works Association (&#8220;AWWA&#8221;) Standards and, where applicable, certified to NSF/ANSI Standard 61 for potable water conveyance. In addition, Underwriters Laboratory (&#8220;UL&#8221;) and FM Approvals (&#8220;FM&#8221;) have approved many of these products. These products are typically specified by a water utility for use in its system. 

Water and Gas Valves and Related Products. &#160; Mueller Co. manufactures valves for water and gas systems, including iron gate, butterfly, tapping, check, knife, plug and ball valves, and sells these products under a variety of brand names, including Mueller and U.S. Pipe Valve and Hydrant. Water and gas valves and related products, generally made of iron or brass, accounted for $504.8 million , $495.7 million &#32;and $474.2 million &#32;of our gross sales in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. These valve products are used to control transmission of potable water, non-potable water or gas. Water valve products typically range in size from &#190; inch to 36 inches in diameter. Mueller Co. also manufactures significantly larger valves as custom order work through its Henry Pratt business unit. Most of these valves are used in water transmission or distribution, water treatment facilities or industrial applications. 

Mueller Co. also produces small valves, meter bars and line stopper fittings for use in gas systems, as well as machines and tools for tapping, drilling, extracting, installing and stopping-off, which are designed to work with its water and gas fittings and valves as an integrated system. 

&#32;2 

Index to Financial Statements 

Fire Hydrants. &#160; Mueller Co. manufactures dry-barrel and wet-barrel fire hydrants. Sales of fire hydrants and fire hydrant parts accounted for $184.9 million , $177.4 million &#32;and $175.0 million &#32;of our gross sales in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Mueller Co. sells fire hydrants for new water infrastructure development, fire protection systems and water infrastructure repair and replacement projects. 

These fire hydrants consist of an upper barrel and nozzle section and a lower barrel and valve section that connects to a water main. In dry-barrel hydrants, the valve connecting the barrel of the hydrant to the water main is located below ground at or below the frost line, which keeps the upper barrel dry. Mueller Co. sells dry-barrel fire hydrants under the Mueller and U.S. Pipe Valve and Hydrant brand names in the United States and the Canada Valve brand name in Canada. Mueller Co. also makes wet-barrel hydrants, where the valves are located in the hydrant nozzles and the barrel contains water at all times. Wet-barrel hydrants are made for warm weather climates, such as in California and Hawaii, and are sold under the Jones brand name. 

Most municipalities have approved a limited number of fire hydrant brands for installation within their systems due to their desire to use the same tools and operating instructions across their systems and to minimize inventories of spare parts. We believe Mueller Co.&#8217;s large installed base of fire hydrants throughout the United States and Canada, reputation for superior quality and performance and incumbent specification positions have contributed to the leading market positions of its fire hydrants. This large installed base also leads to recurring sales of replacement hydrants and hydrant parts. 

&#32; Other Products and Services. &#32;Mueller Co. also sells pipe repair products, such as clamps and couplings used to repair leaks, under the Mueller and Jones brand names. 

Anvil 

Anvil products include a variety of fittings, couplings, hangers, valves and related piping component system products for use in non-residential construction (including HVAC and fire protection applications), industrial, power and oil &#38; gas end markets. Anvil&#8217;s net sales were $338.3 million , $371.1 million &#32;and $401.4 million &#32;in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, of which $96.8 million , $98.0 million &#32;and $98.3 million , respectively, were of products manufactured by third parties. The oil &#38; gas end markets accounted for approximately 5% , 10% &#32;and 20% &#32;of Anvil&#8217;s gross sales in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Anvil&#8217;s sales into the oil &#38; gas markets decreased significantly during 2015 and 2016 as a result of a decline in oil &#38; gas drilling activity. 

The majority of Anvil&#8217;s products are not specified by an architect or an engineer, but are required to be manufactured to industry specifications, which may include material composition, tensile strength and various other requirements. Many products carry the UL, FM or other approval rating. 

Fittings and Couplings. Pipe fittings and couplings join pieces of pipe together. Anvil manufactures five primary categories of pipe fittings and couplings: 

&#8226; 

Cast Iron Fittings. Cast iron is an economical threaded-fitting material and is the standard used in the United States for low pressure applications, such as sprinkler systems and other fire protection systems. We believe the substantial majority of Anvil&#8217;s cast iron products are used in the fire protection industry, with the remainder used in steam and other HVAC applications. 

&#8226; 

Malleable Iron Fittings and Unions . Malleable iron is cast iron that is heat-treated to make it stronger, allowing a thinner wall and a lighter product. Threaded malleable iron products are used primarily to join pipe in oil &#38; gas and industrial applications. 

&#8226; 

Grooved Fittings, Couplings and Valves. Grooved ductile iron products, which use a threadless pipe-joining method that does not require welding, are used in all of Anvil&#8217;s end markets. 

&#8226; 

Threaded Steel Pipe Couplings. Threaded steel pipe couplings are used by plumbing and electrical end users to join pipe and conduit and by pipe mills as threaded-end protectors. 

&#8226; 

Nipples. Pipe nipples are used to expand or compress the flow between pipes of different diameters. Anvil&#8217;s steel pipe nipple product line is a complementary product offering that is packaged with cast iron fittings for fire protection products, malleable iron fittings for industrial applications and its forged steel products for oil &#38; gas and chemical applications. Pipe nipples are also general plumbing items. 

Hangers . Anvil manufactures a broad array of pipe hangers and supports. Standard pipe hangers and supports are used in fire protection sprinkler systems and HVAC applications where the objective is to provide rigid support from the building structure. Special order, or engineered, pipe supports are used in power and chemical plants to support piping systems that must withstand thermal, dynamic or seismic movement. 

&#32;3 

Index to Financial Statements 

Other Products. Anvil distributes other products, including forged steel pipe fittings, hammer unions, bull plugs and swage nipples used to connect pipe in oil &#38; gas applications. Anvil also sells pipe fabrication machines directly to customers in the fire protection industry. 

Mueller Technologies 

Mueller Technologies is comprised of companies that provide innovative solutions, products and services that actively diagnose, monitor and control the delivery of water. 

Water Metering Products and Systems . Mueller Systems manufactures and sources a variety of water technology products under the Mueller Systems and Hersey brand names that are designed to help water providers accurately measure and control water usage. Mueller Systems offers a complete line of residential, fire line and commercial metering solutions. Residential and commercial water meters are generally classified as either manually read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology. A manually read meter consists of a water meter and a register that gives a visual meter reading display. Meters equipped with radio transmitters (endpoints) use encoder registers to convert the measurement data from the meter (mechanical or static) into an encrypted digital format which is then transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for water utility billing systems. These remotely read, or mobile, systems are either automatic meter reading (&#8220;AMR&#8221;) systems, where equipment for meter reading purposes, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collects the data from utilities&#8217; meters; or fixed network advanced metering infrastructure (&#8220;AMI&#8221;) systems, where data is gathered utilizing a network of permanent data collectors or gateway receivers that are always active or listening for the radio transmission from the utilities&#8217; meters. AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to travel through service territories to collect meter reading data. These systems provide the utilities with more frequent and diverse data at specified intervals from the utilities&#8217; meters. Mueller Systems sells both AMR and AMI systems and related products. Mueller Systems&#8217; remote disconnect water meter enables the water flow to be stopped and started remotely via handheld devices or from a central operating facility. 

Sales of water metering products and systems accounted for 83% , 88% &#32;and 90% &#32;of Mueller Technologies&#8217; net sales in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Water Leak Detection and Pipe Condition Assessment Products and Services . Echologics develops technologies and offers products and services under the Echologics brand name that can non-invasively (without disrupting service or introducing a foreign object into the water system) detect underground leaks and assess the condition of water mains comprised of a variety of materials. Echologics leverages its proprietary acoustic technology to offer leak detection and condition assessment surveys. In 2014, Echologics began offering a fixed leak detection service that allows customers to continuously monitor and detect leaks on water transmission mains. We believe Echologics&#8217; ability to offer accurate leak detection and pipe condition assessment services non-invasively is a key competitive advantage. 

Manufacturing 

See &#8220;Item 2. PROPERTIES&#8221; for a description of our principal manufacturing facilities. 

We will continue to expand the use of Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma business improvement methodologies where appropriate to safely capture higher levels of quality, service and operational efficiency. 

Mueller Co. 

Mueller Co. operates nine &#32;manufacturing facilities located in the United States and China. These manufacturing operations include foundry, machining, fabrication, assembly, testing and painting operations. Not all facilities perform each of these operations. Mueller Co.&#8217;s existing manufacturing capacity is sufficient for anticipated near-term requirements and Mueller Co. has no current plans to expand capacity. 

Mueller Co. foundries use lost foam and green sand casting techniques. Mueller Co. uses the lost foam technique for fire hydrant production in its Albertville, Alabama facility and for iron gate valve production in its Chattanooga, Tennessee facility. The lost foam technique has several advantages over the green sand technique for high-volume products, including a reduction in the number of manual finishing operations, lower scrap levels and the ability to reuse some of the materials.

Anvil 

&#32;Anvil currently operates nine &#32;manufacturing facilities located in the United States. Anvil&#8217;s manufacturing operations include foundry, heat treating, machining, fabricating, assembling, testing and painting operations. Not all facilities perform each of these operations. These foundry operations employ automated vertical and horizontal green sand molding equipment. Anvil&#8217;s products are made in a high-volume production environment, with extensive use of high-speed computer controlled machines and other automated equipment. 

Mueller Technologies 

Mueller Systems operates one &#32;manufacturing facility in the United States and contracts with a manufacturing facility in Mexico. Mueller Systems designs, manufactures and assembles water metering products in Cleveland, North Carolina and designs and supports AMI systems in Middleborough, Massachusetts. Echologics designs leak detection and condition assessment products in Toronto, Ontario. 

Purchased Components and Raw Materials 

Our products are made using various purchased components and several basic raw materials, including scrap steel, sand, resin, brass ingot and steel pipe. Purchased parts and raw materials represented 44% &#32;and 10% , respectively, of cost of sales in 2016 . 

Patents, Licenses and Trademarks 

We have active patents relating to the design of our products and trademarks for our brands and products. We have filed and continue to file, when appropriate, patent applications used in connection with our business and products. Many of the patents for technology underlying the majority of our products have been in the public domain for many years, and we do not believe third-party patents individually or in the aggregate are material to our business. However, we consider the pool of proprietary information, consisting of expertise and trade secrets relating to the design, manufacture and operation of our products to be particularly important and valuable. We generally own the rights to the products that we manufacture and sell, and we are not dependent in any material way upon any license or franchise to operate. See &#8220;Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Any inability to protect our intellectual property or our failure to effectively defend against intellectual property infringement claims could adversely affect our competitive position.&#8221;

Sales, Marketing and Distribution 

We sell primarily to distributors. Our distributor relationships are generally non-exclusive, but we attempt to align ourselves with key distributors in the principal markets we serve. We believe Mueller is the most recognized brand in the U.S. water infrastructure industry. 

Mueller Co. 

Mueller Co. sells its products primarily through waterworks distributors to a wide variety of end user customers, including municipalities, water and wastewater utilities, gas utilities, and fire protection and construction contractors. Sales of our products are heavily influenced by the specifications for the underlying projects. Approximately 8% , 9% &#32;and 12% &#32;of Mueller Co.&#8217;s net sales were to Canadian customers in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

At September 30, 2016 , Mueller Co. had 90 &#32;sales representatives in the field and 91 &#32;inside marketing and sales professionals, as well as 113 &#32;independent manufacturer&#8217;s representatives. In addition to calling on distributors, these representatives call on municipalities, water companies and other end users to ensure the products specified for their projects are our products or comparable to our products. Municipalities often require contractors to use the same products that have been specified by that municipality. 

Mueller Co.&#8217;s extensive installed base, broad product range and well-known brands have led to many long-standing relationships with the key distributors in the principal markets we serve. Our distribution network covers all of the major locations for our principal products in the United States and Canada. Although we have long-standing relationships with most of our key distributors, we typically do not have long-term contracts with them, including our two largest distributors, which together accounted for approximately 35% , 34% &#32;and 34% &#32;of Mueller Co.&#8217;s gross sales in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The loss of either of these distributors would have a material adverse effect on our business. See &#8220;Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales.&#8221; 

Anvil 

Anvil sells its products primarily to distributors who then resell the products to a wide variety of end users, including commercial contractors. At September 30, 2016 , Anvil&#8217;s sales force consisted of 117 &#32;sales and customer service representatives and 27 &#32;independent sales representatives. Anvil ships products primarily from four regional distribution centers. Approximately 5% , 6% &#32;and 5% &#32;of Anvil&#8217;s net sales were to Canadian customers in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Anvil generally does not have long-term contracts with its distributors, although it has long-standing relationships with most of its key distributors. Anvil&#8217;s top five distributors together accounted for approximately 25% , 23% , and 23% &#32;of Anvil&#8217;s gross sales in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The loss of any one of these distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business. See &#8220;Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales.&#8221; 

Mueller Technologies 

Mueller Systems sells its water metering systems, products and services directly to municipalities and to waterworks distributors. Echologics sells water leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services primarily to end users. At September 30, 2016 , Mueller Technologies&#8217; companies had 37 &#32;sales representatives in the field and 2 &#32;independent manufacturer&#8217;s representatives. The Mueller Technologies businesses&#8217; five largest customers accounted for approximately 49% , 54% &#32;and 56% &#32;of segment gross sales in 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. See &#8220;Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Our business depends on a small group of key customers for a significant portion of our sales.&#8221;

Backlog 

We consider backlog to represent orders placed by customers for which goods or services have yet to be delivered. Backlog is a meaningful indicator for the Henry Pratt business unit of Mueller Co. and the Mueller Systems business unit of Mueller Technologies. Henry Pratt manufactures valves and other parts for large projects that typically require design and build specifications. The delivery lead time for parts used for these projects can be as long as nine months, and we expect approximately 10% &#32;of Henry Pratt&#8217;s backlog at the end of 2016 &#32;will not be shipped until beyond 2017 . Mueller Systems manufactures or sources water meter systems that are sometimes ordered in large quantities with delivery dates over several years, and we expect approximately 30% &#32;of Mueller Systems&#8217; backlog will not be shipped until beyond 2017 . Backlog for Henry Pratt and Mueller Systems is presented below.

Sales cycles for metering systems can span several years and it is common for customers to place orders throughout the contract period. Although we believe we have a common understanding with our customer as to the total value of a contract when it is awarded, we do not recognize backlog until customer orders are received. 

Competition 

The U.S. and Canadian markets for water infrastructure, flow control and piping component system products are very competitive. See &#8220;Item 1A. RISK FACTORS-Strong competition could adversely affect prices and demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our operating results.&#8221; There are only a few competitors for most of our product and service offerings. Many of our competitors are well-established companies with products that have strong brand recognition. We consider our installed base, product quality, customer service level, brand recognition, innovation, distribution and technical support to be competitive strengths. 

The competitive environment for most of Mueller Co.&#8217;s valve and hydrant products is mature and many end users are slow to transition to brands other than their historically preferred brand. It is difficult to increase market share in this environment. We believe Mueller Co. fire hydrants and valves enjoy strong competitive positions based primarily on the extent of their installed base, product quality, specified position and brand recognition. Its principal competitors for fire hydrants and iron gate valves are McWane, Inc. and American Cast Iron Pipe Company. The primary competitors for its brass products are The Ford Meter Box Company, Inc. and A.Y. McDonald Mfg. Co. Many brass valves are interchangeable among different manufacturers. 

The markets for Anvil&#8217;s products are highly competitive, price-sensitive and vulnerable to the increased acceptance of products produced in perceived lower-cost countries, such as China and India. Anvil competes primarily on the basis of availability, service, price and breadth of product offerings. Its primary competitors are Ward Manufacturing L.L.C. for cast iron and malleable iron fittings, Victaulic Company and Tyco International Ltd. for ductile grooved fittings and ERICO International Corporation, Cooper Industries plc and Carpenter &#38; &#32; Paterson, Inc. for pipe hangers. Historically, its mechanical and industrial customers have been slower to accept products manufactured outside the United States than its fire protection customers. 

The markets for products and services sold by the Mueller Technologies businesses are very competitive. Mueller Systems sells water metering products and systems in the United States. We believe a substantial portion of this market is in the process of transitioning from manually read meters to automatically read meters, but we also expect this transition to be relatively slow and that many end users will be reluctant to adopt brands other than their historically preferred brand. Although Mueller Systems&#8217; market position is relatively small, we believe its automatically read meters and associated technology are well positioned to gain a greater share of these markets. Its principal competitors are Sensus, Neptune Technology Group, Inc., Badger Meter, Inc., Aclara LLC and Itron, Inc. Echologics sells water leak detection and pipe condition assessment products and services in North America, the United Kingdom and select countries in Europe, Asia and the Middle East, with its primary markets being the United States and Canada. The worldwide market for leak detection and pipe condition assessment is highly fragmented with numerous competitors. Its more significant competitors are Pure Technologies Ltd., Gutermann AG, and Syrinix Ltd.

Research and Development 

Our primary research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;) facilities are located in Chattanooga, Tennessee for Mueller Co., in North Kingstown, Rhode Island for Anvil and in Middleborough, Massachusetts and Toronto, Ontario for Mueller Technologies. The primary focus of these operations is to develop new products, improve and refine existing products and obtain and assure compliance with industry approval certifications or standards (such as AWWA, UL, FM, NSF and The Public Health and Safety Company). At September 30, 2016 , we employed 93 &#32;people dedicated to R&#38;D activities. R&#38;D expenses were $12.9 million , $14.9 million &#32;and $14.4 million &#32;during 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. 

Regulatory and Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in areas such as: competition, government contracts, international trade, labor and employment, tax, licensing, consumer protection, environmental protection, workplace health and safety, and others. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221;) and similar state laws affect our operations by, among other things, imposing investigation and cleanup requirements for threatened or actual releases of hazardous substances. Under CERCLA, joint and several liability may be imposed on operators, generators, site owners, lessees and others regardless of fault or the legality of the original activity that caused or resulted in the release of the hazardous substances. Thus, we may be subject to liability under CERCLA and similar state laws for properties that (1) we currently own, lease or operate, (2) we, our predecessors, or former subsidiaries previously owned, leased or operated, (3) sites to which we, our predecessors or former subsidiaries sent waste materials, and (4) sites at which hazardous substances from our facilities&#8217; operations have otherwise come to be located. The purchaser of U.S. Pipe has been identified as a &#8220;potentially responsible party&#8221; (&#8220;PRP&#8221;) under CERCLA in connection with a former manufacturing facility operated by U.S. Pipe that was in the vicinity of a Superfund site located in North Birmingham, Alabama. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement relating to our sale of U.S. Pipe, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain environmental liabilities, including those arising out of the former manufacturing site in North Birmingham. Accordingly, the purchaser tendered the matter to us for indemnification, which we accepted. Ultimate liability for the site will depend on many factors that have not yet been determined, including the determination of EPA&#8217;s remediation costs, the number and financial viability of the other PRPs (there are four other PRPs currently) and the determination of the final allocation of the costs among the PRPs, if any. For more information regarding this matter as well as others that may affect our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, see &#8220;Item 1A. RISK FACTORS,&#8221; &#8220;Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS - Environmental,&#8221; &#8220;Item 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Contingencies&#8221; and Note 16. of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
