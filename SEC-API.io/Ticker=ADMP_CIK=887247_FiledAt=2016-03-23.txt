 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160;

Company Overview 

&#160;

Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corporation (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;Adamis&#8221; or the &#8220;company&#8221;) is a pharmaceutical company focused on combining specialty pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to provide innovative medicines for patients and physicians. We are currently primarily focused on our specialty pharmaceutical products. We are currently developing several products in the allergy and respiratory markets, including one utilizing a dry powder inhaler technology that we acquired from 3M Company, or 3M. Our goal is to create low cost therapeutic alternatives to existing treatments. Consistent across all specialty pharmaceuticals product lines, we intend to submit Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications, or NDAs, or Section 505(j) Abbreviated New Drug Applications, or ANDAs, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, whenever possible in order to potentially reduce the time to market and to save on costs, compared to those associated with Section 505(b)(1) NDAs for new drug products. We also have a number of biotechnology product candidates and technologies, including therapeutic vaccine and cancer product candidates and technologies intended to treat patients with unmet medical needs in the global cancer market. To achieve our goals and support our overall strategy, we will need to raise a substantial amount of funding and make significant investments in equipment, new product development and working capital.

&#160;

The current status of our development programs is as follows:

(1) Represents the next anticipated development or regulatory stage for the product candidate that we may pursue, assuming that we have the financial resources to pursue any of these opportunities. There are no assurances that we will pursue these opportunities, for financial or other reasons. (2) A single Phase 3 trial, without previous Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials, is the anticipated next product development stage. The Company intends to conduct additional trials, such as PK and/or dose escalation studies in connection with the Phase 3 trial. (3) Phase 1 of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial has commenced. No patients are currently being recruited for this study. &#160;

We have not received regulatory approval for any drugs or products. Since our fiscal 2010 year, we have not generated commercial revenues from marketing or selling any drugs or other products . 

&#160;

Anaphylaxis; Epinephrine Pre-Filled Syringe 

&#160;

Our most advanced product candidate, the Epinephrine Injection USP 1:1000 0.3mg Pre-filled Single Dose Syringe, or the Epinephrine PFS, is a pre-filled syringe designed to deliver a premeasured 0.3 mg dose of epinephrine for the treatment of anaphylaxis. The American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology, or AAAAI, defines anaphylaxis as a serious life-threatening allergic reaction. The most common anaphylactic reactions are to foods, insect stings, medications and latex. According to information published by AAAAI reporting on findings from a 2009-2010 study, up to 8% of U.S. children under the age of 18 had a food allergy, and approximately 38% of those with a food allergy had a history of severe reactions. Anaphylaxis requires immediate medical treatment, including an injection of epinephrine.

&#160;

1&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

We estimate that sales of prescription epinephrine products in 2015 were approximately $1.0 billion, based on industry data. We cannot provide any assurances concerning any possible future rates of annual growth or whether annual prescriptions will decline or grow.

&#160;

We believe that there is an opportunity for a simple, lower-cost, pre-filled syringe to compete in this market. Our Epinephrine PFS product will allow users to administer a pre-measured epinephrine dose quickly with a syringe that we believe will be familiar to many potential users. Auto-injectors are spring-loaded auto-injector devices. If not administered properly, there is a risk that they could misfire or be misused. We expect to introduce the Epinephrine PFS product at a price point reflecting a discount to the price of the leading products. We believe that a lower-priced option may be attractive to individuals that pay cash for their epinephrine products, professional users such as hospitals and first responders, and military and prison systems.

&#160;

We believe that the Epinephrine PFS product, if introduced, may acquire a share of the market based on the price differential between the expected price of the Epinephrine PFS product and the price at which the market-leading product is currently sold, which may motivate purchasers and reimbursing payors to choose the lower cost alternative. We believe that the Epinephrine PFS product has the potential to compete successfully, although there can be no assurance that this will be the case. If our product is approved and introduced, competitors may reduce or otherwise modify the pricing of their existing products. In addition, if additional competing products are introduced in the future, such as a generic or bioequivalent, or A/B rated, version of one or more existing spring-loaded auto-injector devices, at lower prices than the current market leading products, the competitive success of our product could be adversely affected.

&#160;

With the help of our contract manufacturer, on May 28, 2014, we submitted an NDA to the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2) of the Food, Drug &#38; Cosmetic Act, as amended, or FDCA, for approval of our Epinephrine PFS product. We received a complete response letter, or CRL, from FDA on March 27, 2015. The issues raised in the CRL related primarily to the Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls section, more specifically, the volume of dose delivered by the syringe, including the ability of the product to deliver volume within the levels contained in the labeling claim and as required by the FDA. We took a number of actions, including making changes to the performance, size and functionality of the product, we submitted the NDA on December 4, 2015. On January 14, 2016, we announced that the FDA had accepted the resubmitted NDA for review, and that the FDA indicated that it considered the resubmission to be a complete, class 2 response to the CRL and provided an agency target new action date of June 4, 2016, for reviewing and acting on to the resubmission. If the FDA approves the NDA, we hope to receive an approval in time to permit our first commercial sales to commence sometime in the third quarter of 2016, although there are no assurances that this will be the case. Under goals established in connection with the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA&#8217;s guidance for the review and acting on Class 2 NDA resubmissions is six months from the date of receipt of the resubmission. However, the FDA&#8217;s review processes can extend beyond, and in some cases significantly beyond, anticipated completion dates due to the timing of the FDA&#8217;s review process, FDA requests for additional data, information, materials or clarification, difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, FDA workload issues, extensions resulting from the submission of additional information or clarification regarding information already in the submission within the last three months of the target PDUFA date, or other reasons. As a result, the dates of regulatory approval, if obtained, and commercial introduction of our product could be delayed beyond our expectations.

&#160;

Asthma and COPD 

&#160;

According to the National Institute of Health, or NIH, asthma is a chronic lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways. Asthma causes recurring periods of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it most often starts during childhood. According to information published by Centers for Disease Control &#38; Prevention (CDC) reporting on findings from 2013, the number of people in the U.S. with asthma is approximately 22.6 million and growing.

&#160;

COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it difficult to breathe. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of mucus, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. According to the NIH, cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. However, long-term exposure to other lung irritants such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust may also contribute to COPD.

&#160;

We estimate that global sales of asthma and COPD prescription products were in excess of approximately $13.8 billion in 2014, based on industry data. Within the global asthma and COPD market, we estimate that one product in particular, Advair Diskus &#174; marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, generated more than $3.2 billion in U.S. sales and $7 billion in global sales in 2014, based on GSK&#8217;s publicly announced results.

&#160;

APC-5000 DPI . In December 2013, we acquired assets relating to 3M&#8217;s patented Taper dry powder inhaler, or DPI, technology under development by 3M for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Pursuant to our agreement with 3M, we made an initial payment of $3.0 million to 3M and acquired an exclusive license to the assets, and on December 27, 2013, we made a final payment to 3M of $7.0 million and the Taper DPI assets were transferred to us. The Taper DPI technology was under development by 3M as a device designed to efficiently deliver dry powder by utilizing a 3M proprietary microstructured carrier tape. We believe that, once developed, the device can be utilized to deliver a variety of different drug compounds. We intend to utilize the Taper DPI assets initially to develop a pre-metered inhaler device, referred to as APC-5000 DPI, for the treatment of asthma and COPD to deliver the same active ingredients as GlaxoSmithKline&#8217;s Advair Diskus &#174; . The Advair Diskus &#174; is a dry powder inhaler, or DPI, product that combines fluticasone propionate, or fluticasone and salmeterol xinafoate, or salmeterol. Fluticasone belongs to the family of medicines known as corticosteroids or steroids. It works by preventing certain cells in the lungs and breathing passages from releasing substances that cause asthma symptoms. Inhaled salmeterol is a long-acting bronchodilator. Bronchodilators are medicines that are breathed in through the mouth to open up the bronchial tubes (air passages) in the lungs. It relieves cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, and troubled breathing by increasing the flow of air through the bronchial tubes. The combination of the two medicines is used when a patient&#8217;s asthma has not been controlled sufficiently on other asthma medicines, or when a patient&#8217;s condition is so severe that more than one medicine is needed every day.

&#160;

2&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Upon completion of product development and clinical trials and if required regulatory approvals are obtained, we intend to commercially market the APC-5000 DPI product to compete for a share of the Advair Diskus market with a branded generic version utilizing the acquired technology. Pursuant to our agreement with 3M, the microstructured carrier tape will be supplied by 3M under a separate supply agreement to be negotiated with 3M.

&#160;

We believe that one advantage of the technology is that it can deliver drug particles without the need for lactose or formulation excipients. The majority of current dry powder products use lactose carrier excipients to enhance flowability; however, they have the disadvantage of increased bulk and require a mechanism for detaching the drug from the surface of the lactose. Lactose carrier formulations require a complicated blending process and delivery that is highly sensitive to excipient powder properties. There are currently no excipient-free dry powder inhalers in the U.S. market.

&#160;

On February 24, 2015, we announced the result of our Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study, or PK study, comparing the bioavailability of our APC-5000 DPI product to GlaxoSmithKline&#8217;s Advair&#174; Diskus&#174; DPI. This PK study was designed as an open-label, randomized, single-dose, 4 period (2 sequence, 2 treatment, fully replicated) crossover relative bioavailability study comparing APC-5000 (Fluticasone Propionate, or FP, 186 &#956;g and Salmeterol Xinafoate, or SX, 44.7 &#956;g; 3 inhalations; total dose 558/134.1 &#956;g FP/SX) and Advair&#174; Diskus&#174; 250/50 &#956;g (3 inhalations; total dose 750/150 &#956;g FP/SX). Sixteen healthy male and female subjects who met the study inclusion criteria were enrolled into the study. The study involved a screening period and four treatment periods separated by four days. After completion of screening procedures, subjects were randomized to receive two doses of each Test and Reference product in four treatment periods. All sixteen subjects completed the study. The study results confirmed that systemic exposure to the drugs FP and SX was reduced after treatment with APC-5000 as compared to Advair&#174; Diskus&#174;.

&#160;

We are currently preparing an investigational new drug application, or IND, to be submitted to the FDA to begin human testing of APC-5000 DPI. Assuming receipt of sufficient funding and if clinical trials are initiated and successfully completed, we intend to pursue an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) to seek approval for sale in the U.S. market. We also intend to seek to identify opportunities to market APC-5000 DPI based products outside of the U.S. We currently have no in-house manufacturing capabilities, so we intend to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture the materials needed to produce APC-5000 DPI.

&#160;

Additional Allergy Products; APC-1000 and APC-2000 . We have two additional product candidates in our allergy and respiratory product pipeline. Our APC-1000 product candidate is a steroid hydrofluoroalkane, or HFA, metered dose inhaler product, for asthma and COPD. Our product candidates, if developed and approved for marketing, will target a small niche within the larger market for respiratory products. To date, we have not made any regulatory filings with the FDA for these products. 

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we decided to terminate the development of our APC-3000 product candidate, for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis, because the current leading product in its category became available over-the-counter in the United States, and we concluded that it would be difficult for our prescription APC-3000 product candidate to compete with an over-the-counter product targeting the same ailment and patient population. 

&#160;

On February 24, 2015, we announced the result of our pharmacokinetic study, or PK study, comparing our beclomethasone dipropionate HFA, 80 mcg Inhalation Aerosol, product, APC-1000, with Teva Respiratory, LLC&#8217;s Qvar&#174; (Beclomethasone Dipropionate HFA, 80 mcg Inhalation Aerosol) product. The study was a Phase I open label, randomized, single-dose, four-way crossover PK study comparing APC-1000 to Qvar. Twenty-two healthy male and female subjects who met the study inclusion criteria were enrolled. The study involved a screening period before randomization and four treatment periods each separated by a minimum of three days. Both inhalation aerosols were administered to each subject for a total dose of 320 mcg BDP (4 inhalations). Twenty-one subjects completed the study. One subject was withdrawn due to non-compliance. The purpose of this PK study was to compare the bioavailability of APC-1000 to Qvar. The results showed the extent of absorption of APC-1000 to be equivalent to Qvar. Following discussions with the FDA and additional consideration of the development pathway for the product, we decided to conduct additional development work for APC-1000 during 2015. We intend, depending on the outcome of several factors including results of additional development work and obtaining additional funding that will be required to commence a trial, to file an investigational new drug application, or IND, and initiate a dose escalation and subsequent Phase 3 efficacy study during the second half of 2016.

&#160; 

Our second product candidate that is in development in our allergy and respiratory pipeline, APC-2000, is a HFA bronchodilator for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm. We have had previous discussions with the FDA regarding regulatory approval requirements and intend to have further discussions concerning, among other things, the appropriate regulatory pathway for the product under Section 505(j) relating to ANDAs, Section 505(b)(2) or otherwise.

&#160;

3&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Our development plans concerning our allergy and respiratory products, including APC-1000 and 2000, are affected by developments in the marketplace, including the introduction of potentially competing new products by our competitors. For example, certain products that previously have been available by prescription only have been approved by the FDA and introduced for sale over-the-counter without a prescription at a lower price than competing prescription products, and other new allergy or respiratory products have been or could in the future also be approved as &#8220;branded generic&#8221; products or as over-the-counter products. Such products could be sold at lower prices than prescription products, could adversely affect the willingness of health insurers or other third party payors to reimburse patients for the cost of prescription products, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market product candidates in our pipeline. As a result, our product development plans could be affected by such considerations. The anticipated dates for development and introduction of products in our allergy and respiratory product pipeline will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of adequate funding to support product development efforts. We believe that should we decide to pursue such applications, we would be required to submit data for an application for approval to market APC-1000 pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), and APC-2000 pursuant to Section 505(j) or 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, although there are no assurances that this will be the case. We believe that the next trial for APC-1000 and APC-2000 would be a Phase 3 pivotal trial, potentially preceded by dose escalation studies and do not believe that Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials would be required. Total time to develop the APC-1000 or APC-2000 product, including manufacture of the product, clinical trials and FDA review, is expected to be approximately 24-30 months from inception of full product development efforts, assuming that we are able to obtain adequate funding and that there are no unforeseen regulatory issues or other delays. Factors that could affect the actual launch date for our allergy and respiratory product candidates, as well as our other product candidates, include general market conditions, the outcome of discussions with the FDA concerning the number and kind of clinical trials that the FDA will require before the FDA will consider regulatory approval of the applicable product, the outcome of discussions with the FDA concerning the regulatory approval pathway of the applicable product, any unexpected difficulties in licensing or sublicensing intellectual property rights for other components of the product such as the inhaler, patent infringement lawsuits relating to Paragraph IV certifications as part of any Section 505(b)(2) or ANDA filings, see &#8220;Government Regulation&#8212;Regulation in the United States&#8212;Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications,&#8221; any unexpected difficulties in the ability of our suppliers to timely supply quantities for commercial launch of the product, any unexpected delays or difficulties in assembling and deploying an adequate sales force to market the product, and receipt of adequate funding to support product development and sales and marketing efforts.

&#160;

Subject to several factors including the availability of sufficient funding, the success of future clinical trials, obtaining required regulatory approvals and the absence of unexpected delays, we believe that up to four products, including Epinephrine PFS, could be ready for launch or launched before the end of 2018, although there can be no assurances that this will be the case.

&#160;

Cancer 

&#160;

Although we are currently primarily focused on our specialty pharmaceutical products, we believe that there is a significant need for new products and therapies for the treatment of prostate cancer and other forms of cancer.

&#160;

TeloB-VAX . In April 2011, we acquired exclusive rights to patented telomerase-based cancer vaccine technology from the Regents of the University of California, or UCSD, and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. The technology relates to what we believe may be a novel cell-based vaccine product candidate for cancer, tentatively named TeloB-VAX. The technology is intended to activate the body&#8217;s natural defense mechanism to stimulate an immune response against one of nature&#8217;s most common tumor markers, telomerase reverse transcriptase, or telomerase. We believe that a vaccine product, if developed, will utilize the patient&#8217;s own B cells to induce an immune response against telomerase. Telomerase is a marker found in approximately 85% of all cancers including prostate cancer. In a Phase 1 clinical trial completed at UCSD in castrate resistant prostate cancer patients, the vaccine product candidate was shown to be safe and well tolerated. We believe that this technology may represent an opportunity to program the immune system to mobilize killer lymphocytes to combat cancer cells.

&#160;

Prostate Cancer . According to the American Cancer Society, or ACS, and the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer in American men and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. The ACS estimated that for 2015 in the United States, approximately 220,800 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed and about 27,450 men will die of prostate cancer in 2015. In 2010, we licensed patents and related intellectual property relating to three cancer drug candidates developed at the University of Wisconsin. We believe these drug candidates, named APC-100, -200 and -300, may offer new treatment opportunities for prostate cancer.

&#160;

APC-100 is the most advanced of the three drug candidates. In animal studies conducted to date, APC-100 demonstrated anti-androgenic and anti-inflammatory activities against prostate tumors growing in animal models and showed a strong safety profile in preclinical safety studies. In 2006, APC-100 was awarded the NCI Rapid Award. The award is given by the National Cancer Institutes for promising new drugs for the treatment of cancer and resulted in significant funding for research and development of APC-100. APC-100 has demonstrated desirable pharmacological characteristics as an oral or injectable anti-inflammatory and anti-androgenic drug candidate with multiple mechanisms of action. In animal studies conducted to date, APC-100 decreased secretion of human PSA by human prostate cancer cells growing in mice and also increased the time-to-tumor progression and survival of mice with prostate sensitive and castrate resistant tumors. In August 2011, we announced the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase 1/2a prostate cancer clinical trial relating to the use of the APC-100 product to treat men with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The trial began at the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center and was extended to the Wayne State University Karmanos Cancer Institute. In the trial, each patient has been assessed for toxicity, biochemical responses (PSA), radiographic and clinical responses. No patients are currently being recruited.

&#160;

4&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

APC-200 is a drug candidate for both castrate-sensitive and castrate resistant prostate cancer. In 2007, APC-200 was awarded the NCI Rapid Award. APC-200 blocks androgen-induced hydrogen peroxide production and inflammation and inhibits mouse prostate cancer. In animal studies conducted to date, APC-200 was an excellent inhibitor of chronic inflammation. It also completely inhibited oxidase mediated high rates of hydrogen peroxide production in vivo and delayed prostate cancer progression and death in the standard mouse prostate cancer model. If we conclude preclinical development activities, such as GMP manufacturing of drug substance and drug product, as well as conclusion of the preclinical safety, pharmacology and toxicology studies, we anticipate that the next development stage would be to submit an Adamis-sponsored IND relating to the clinical investigation of oral APC-200 in prostate cancer patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer, assuming adequate funding and no unexpected delays, although there are no assurances that we will file or open such an IND.

&#160;

APC-300 is a multi-targeted small molecule therapeutic drug that we believe has the potential to demonstrate anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic anti-cancer activities for prostate cancer patients, including men with advanced metastatic castrate resistance prostate cancer. In preclinical in vitro studies conducted to date, APC-300 repeatedly demonstrated inhibition of human tumor cell growth and killed both castrate-sensitive and castrate-resistant human prostate cancer tumors. It also materially decreased tumor volumes and suppressed local metastasis in human to mouse xenograft models, where malignant human prostate, pancreas, or melanoma tumor tissue was grafted onto athymic immunosuppressed experimental mice. For several reasons including funding limitations, we have not yet developed a clinical protocol and other materials for submission of an IND.

&#160;

We are currently primarily focused on our specialty pharmaceutical products and do not currently intend to devote a material portion of our financial resources for research and development of our cancer and biotechnology product candidates and technologies. We may explore other alternatives for development of one or more of these product candidates and technologies including seeking strategic development arrangements or out-licensing or sale transactions.

&#160;

Other Technologies 

&#160;

STI Technology 

&#160;

In addition, we have licensed patented vaccine technology that we believe has the potential to provide protection against a number of different viral infectious agents. This novel vaccination strategy, which employs DNA plasmids, appears, based on preclinical studies conducted to date, to have the ability to &#8220;train&#8221; a person&#8217;s immune system to recognize and mount a defense against particular aspects of a virus&#8217;s structure. If successfully developed, we believe this technology could give physicians a new tool in generating immunity against a number of viral infections that have been difficult to target in the past.

&#160;

The licensed technology was developed by Dr. Maurizio Zanetti, M.D., a professor at the Department of Medicine at UCSD. Dr. Zanetti has developed and patented a method of DNA vaccination by somatic transgene immunization, or STI. STI, also sometimes called TLI, has already been tested in Phase I studies in humans for other vaccine applications. An immune response was elicited in the study, and the results suggested that the procedure was safe and well tolerated. We have previously conducted certain experiments in mice utilizing the STI technology, but our testing is at the preclinical stage.

&#160;

As among our cancer and vaccine technologies, our development efforts would focus initially on the development of one or more of the other licensed prostate cancer product candidates and technologies, and as a result the timing of development of this viral vaccine technology is subject to uncertainty.

&#160;

Savvy/C31G 

&#160;

We also have a microbicide product candidate, named Savvy (C31G). On December 7, 2010, we announced the successful completion of a Phase 3 contraceptive trial of C31G. The study met its primary endpoint and was conducted by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH), in the Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network at 14 sites in the United States. The clinical investigators found that C31G was not inferior in contraceptive efficacy to the comparator drug Conceptrol. Moreover, the gel was well-tolerated and had a high degree of acceptability in women who completed the study. No drug-related serious adverse events were observed with C31G. Currently, to our knowledge all spermicides commercially available in the U.S., including Conceptrol, contain the active ingredient nonoxynol-9, or N-9, in a carrier such as a gel, film, cream, foam, suppository, or tablet. N-9 has been reported in some studies to cause irritant and allergic reactions in some users. C31G does not contain N-9 and, if commercialized, may offer an alternative for women who seek a non-hormonal method of contraception. In addition, on September 9, 2013, we announced that a recently published study conducted by university researchers at Louisiana State University Health Science Center found that C31G was effective in treating Herpes Simplex Virus, or HSV, in an eye infection, ocular keratitis, and animal model using live rabbits. The rabbit eye model utilized for the study mimics the disease in humans. In the same study the researchers also reported that ocular administration of C31G was safe and well tolerated, confirming earlier clinical studies that established C31G safety and tolerability in other applications. HSV-1 is the same virus that causes cold sores and is common in humans. In the eye, it usually causes an infection of the cornea, and that infection is the most common cause of cornea-derived blindness. In previous animal studies, C31G was also active against HSV-2, the cause of genital herpes.

&#160;

5&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Before considering any actions to further develop or seek regulatory approval for a C31G product, further meetings with the FDA would likely be required to discuss the regulatory pathways for submitting an NDA for marketing approval, including whether any additional trials will be required before an NDA is submitted. In considering commercialization alternatives, we would likely seek to enter into an out-licensing or similar transaction with organizations that have a focus or business unit in the area of antimicrobials or contraception, or in other fields where C31G may have potential as a product candidate. The C31G product candidate is held by our Biosyn, Inc. subsidiary, which we acquired in 2004. Provisions in the agreement pursuant to which we acquired Biosyn, and/or in certain of the funding agreements and other agreements relating to the C31G product, provide for payments to the former Biosyn shareholders upon marketing approval by the FDA (or, in certain circumstances, certain foreign regulatory authorities) of C31G for one or more indications, for payments to certain other third parties in the event of sales or other revenues relating to C31G or certain other events, and include limitations on certain activities of Biosyn including payment of dividends. In addition, sale or out-licensing of the C31G product candidate may require the consent of one or more such third parties. As a result, commercialization of the product could require, among other things, renegotiation of the provisions relating to the former Biosyn shareholders and such third parties. Accordingly, there can be no assurances that we will pursue or be able to successfully conclude a transaction involving C31G or concerning the amounts that we might receive from any such transaction, or that any C31G product will be submitted for regulatory approval or will be approved or marketed.

&#160;

For the year ended December 31, 2015 and the nine-month transition period ended December 31, 2014, we estimate that we spent approximately $4.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively, on all research and development activities.

&#160;

Clinical Supplies and Manufacturing 

&#160;

We have no in-house manufacturing or distribution capabilities and have no current plans to establish manufacturing facilities for significant clinical or commercial production. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers to make the material used to support the development of our product candidates. Our third-party manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation. The FDA mandates that drugs be manufactured, packaged and labeled in conformity with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations. In complying with cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to ensure that their services and products meet applicable specifications and other requirements. We intend to continue to outsource the manufacture and distribution of our products for the foreseeable future, and we believe this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct our financial resources to commercialization without devoting the resources and capital required to build cGMP compliant manufacturing facilities. If the FDA approves our NDA relating to our Epinephrine PFS product, the Epinephrine PFS product will be manufactured by Catalent Pharma Solutions, a third party manufacturer, utilizing materials to complete the manufacturing process obtained from various companies and suppliers, and assembly and final packaging of the product will also be implemented by a third party entity. Although there are potential sources of supply other than our existing suppliers, any new supplier would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements.

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We are currently developing our sales and marketing infrastructure, including retaining employees and entering into arrangements with third parties for additional sales and marketing support, and undertaking other related activities in anticipation of obtaining FDA approval of our NDA relating to our Epinephrine PFS product for treating anaphylaxis.

&#160;

Customers and Distribution 

&#160; 

We do not currently sell or distribute pharmaceutical products. Since our fiscal 2010 year, we have not generated commercial revenues from marketing or selling any drugs or other products . If our Epinephrine PFS product is approved, we anticipate that marketing and distribution of the product could commence to initial customers including wholesalers, who in turn seek to distribute the products to retail pharmacies or other customers, specialty wholesalers or distributors, professional users such as hospitals and first responders, and the military and prison systems, as well as other potential customers. We have retained third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions related to the distribution of our products that may be approved, including logistics management and other distribution management and data reporting services in exchange for a fee.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive. Our potential competitors in the field are many in number and include major pharmaceutical and specialized biotechnology companies. Many of our potential competitors have significantly more financial, technical and other resources than we do, which may give them a competitive advantage. In addition, they may have substantially more experience in effecting strategic combinations, in-licensing technology, developing drugs, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products. We cannot give any assurances that we can compete effectively with these other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Our potential competitors in these markets may succeed in developing products that could render our products and those of our collaborators obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in the fields in which we compete.

&#160;

6&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Our allergy and respiratory products, if developed and launched, will compete with numerous prescription and non-prescription over-the-counter products targeting similar conditions, as well as prescription generic products. In addition, a number of large pharmaceuticals companies produce pharmaceutical products, such as antihistamines, corticosteroids and anti-leukotriene agents, which manage allergy and respiratory symptoms. Moreover, certain products that previously have been available by prescription only have been or could in the future be approved by the FDA for sale over-the-counter without a prescription at a lower price than competing prescription products, which could adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market a competing prescription product. The Epinephrine PFS product, if commercialized, will compete against other self-administered epinephrine products, including EpiPen, EpiPen Jr., Auvi-Q and Adrenaclick. In addition, additional competing products could be introduced in the future, such as a generic or bioequivalent, or A/B, version of existing spring-loaded auto-injector devices, at prices that could adversely affect competitive success of our Epinephrine PFS product. Our APC-5000 DPI product, if developed and commercialized, is expected to compete with allergy inhaler products offered by several companies, including GlaxoSmithKline. The development and commercialization of new drugs for cancer, and of vaccine products for viral infections, is highly competitive. Most of the larger pharmaceutical companies, and many smaller public and private companies, have products or are engaged in research and development activities in these fields.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Our success will depend in large part on our ability to:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; obtain and maintain international and domestic patent and other legal protections for the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business; &#9679; prosecute and defend our patents; &#9679; preserve our trade secrets; and &#9679; operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties. &#160;

We intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for product candidates in our research and development programs where applicable and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and other selected countries. We intend for these patent applications to cover, where possible, claims for composition of matter, medical uses, processes for preparation and formulations. As of February 5, 2016, the Company had: (i) 10 issued patents in the United States and 10 pending applications, one of which has been allowed; (ii) eight issued and 19 pending foreign patent applications relating to Epinephrine Injection, APC 5000 DPI and C31G. The issued patents and allowed patents applications expire between 2017 and 2035, not taking into account any potential patent-term extensions that may be available in the future. We are the licensees of other patents under our various licensing agreements relating to APC 100, APC 200, APC 300, Telomerase and STI.

&#160;

Although we believe that our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes, and may not be able to obtain patents from pending applications. Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us. Any patents or patent rights that we obtain may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors.

&#160;

We also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We seek protection of these trade secrets, proprietary know-how and any continuing innovation, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. However, these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for, or adequate remedies to protect, our technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of information. Furthermore, our trade secrets may otherwise become known to, or be independently developed by, our competitors.

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Pharmaceutical Regulation 

&#160;

If and when we market any pharmaceutical products in the United States, they will be subject to extensive government regulation. Likewise, if we seek to market and distribute any such products abroad, they would also be subject to extensive foreign government regulation.

&#160;

In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products. FDA regulations govern the testing, manufacturing, advertising, promotion, labeling, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and generally require a rigorous process for the approval of new drugs. We also may be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing clinical trials and drug product sales if products are tested or marketed abroad. The approval process outside the United States varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the time required may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

&#160;

7&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Regulation in the United States 

&#160;

The FDA testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and money. We cannot assure you that any of our products will ever obtain approval. Our potential products will be regulated either as biological products or as drugs. In the United States, drugs are subject to regulation under the FDCA. Biological products, in addition to being subject to provisions of the FDCA, are regulated under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA. Both statutes and related regulations govern, among other things, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, and other promotional practices. The FDA approval process for new drugs and biologics includes, without limitation:

&#160;

&#160; &#9679; preclinical studies; &#160; &#9679; submission of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for clinical trials; &#160; &#9679; adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of the product; &#160; &#9679; review of a New Drug Application, or NDA, or review of a Biologics License Application, or BLA; and &#160; &#9679; inspection of the facilities used in the manufacturing of the drug to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations. &#160;

Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and effectiveness of the product. Most of these studies must be performed according to good laboratory practices, a system of management controls for laboratories and research organizations to ensure the consistency and reliability of results. The results of the preclinical studies, existing clinical and/or human use data (if applicable), together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which we are required to file before we can commence any clinical trials for our product candidates in the United States. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after an IND is received, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trials. If concerns or questions are raised, an IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot assure you that submission of any additional IND for any of our preclinical product candidates will result in authorization to commence clinical trials.

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate that is the subject of the trial to volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each institution at which the study will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, ethical factors, safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution arising from the conduct of the proposed clinical trial. Also, clinical trials must be performed according to good clinical practices, which are enumerated in FDA regulations and guidance documents.

&#160;

Clinical trials typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2 and 3. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including if the FDA makes a finding that the subjects participating in the trial are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

&#160;

In Phase 1 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on patients to determine safety, any adverse effects, proper dosage, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects.

&#160;

In Phase 2 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a limited number of subjects to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific, targeted indications, determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.

&#160;

In Phase 3 clinical trials, a drug is usually tested on a larger number of subjects in an expanded patient population and at multiple clinical sites.

&#160;

We cannot assure you that any of our current or future clinical trials will result in approval to market our products.

&#160;

A NDA or BLA must include comprehensive and complete descriptions of the preclinical testing, clinical trials and the chemical, manufacturing and control requirements of a drug that enable the FDA to determine the drug&#8217;s or biologic&#8217;s safety and efficacy. A NDA or BLA must be submitted, filed and approved by the FDA before any product that we may successfully develop can be marketed commercially in the United States.

&#160;

The facilities, procedures and operations for any of our contract manufacturers must be determined to be adequate by the FDA before product approval. Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP, licensing specifications and other FDA regulations before and after an NDA or BLA has been approved. Foreign manufacturing facilities are also subject to periodic FDA inspections or inspections by foreign regulatory authorities. Among other things, the FDA may withhold approval of NDAs, BLAs or other product applications if deficiencies are found at the facility. Vendors that may supply us with finished products or components used to manufacture, package and label products are also subject to similar regulations and periodic inspections.

&#160;

8&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

In addition, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulatory requirements on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceuticals, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet.

&#160;

Failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA&#8217;s review of NDAs or BLAs, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us.

&#160;

Some of our cancer and vaccine product candidates may involve biological products, which are subject to regulation under the PHSA. In addition to the FDA requirements, the NIH has established guidelines for research involving human genetic materials, including recombinant DNA molecules. The FDA cooperates in the enforcement of these guidelines, which apply to all recombinant DNA research that is conducted at facilities supported by the NIH, including proposals to conduct clinical research involving gene therapies. The NIH review of clinical trial proposals and safety information is a public process and often involves review and approval by the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, of the NIH. Some of our cancer and vaccine product candidates may be subject to NIH RAC review.

&#160;

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA, requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees.

&#160;

Once the FDA receives an NDA or BLA, it has 60 days to review the application to determine if it is substantially complete and the data is readable, before it accepts the NDA or BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submission to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity.

&#160;

Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA agrees to specific goals for NDA review time through a two-tiered classification system, Priority Review and Standard Review. A Priority Review designation is given to drugs that offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For a Priority Review application, the FDA aims to complete the initial review cycle for New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, within six months of the 60 day filing date, and for non-NMEs within six months of the date of receipt. Standard Review applies to all applications that are not eligible for Priority Review. The FDA aims to complete Standard Review NDAs for NMEs within ten months of the 60 day filing date, and for Non-NMEs within ten months of the date of receipt. Such dates are often referred to as the PDUFA dates. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates for either Standard Reviews or Priority Reviews of NDAs or BLAs. The review process and the PDUFA date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA date. In addition, the FDA&#8217;s review processes can extend beyond, and in some cases significantly beyond, anticipated completion dates due to FDA requests for additional information or clarification, difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting, negotiations regarding any required risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, FDA workload issues or other reasons. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to the application&#8217;s approval. The amount of time taken for the approval process is a function of a number of variables, including whether the product has received priority review, the quality of the submission and studies presented, the potential contribution that the compound will make in improving the treatment of the disease in question, and the workload at the FDA.

&#160;

The FDA may, during its review of a NDA or BLA, ask for additional test data or the conducting of additional clinical trials. If the FDA does ultimately approve the product, it may require post-marketing testing to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the product. In addition, the FDA may in some circumstances impose restrictions on the use of the product, which may be difficult and expensive to administer and may require prior approval of promotional materials.

&#160;

Prior to regulatory approval, the FDA may elect to obtain advice from outside experts regarding scientific issues and/or marketing applications under FDA review. These outside experts are convened through the FDA&#8217;s Advisory Committee process. An Advisory Committee will report to the FDA and make recommendations. Views of the Advisory Committee may differ from those of the FDA, and the FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an Advisory Committee.

&#160;

Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA can inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the submission unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the processes and procedures used are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional clinical testing or information before an NDA or BLA can be approved. The FDA may also inspect one or more of the preclinical toxicology research sites to assure that the preclinical studies were conducted in compliance with GLP requirements. If the FDA determines that the studies were not performed in compliance with applicable GLP rules and regulations, the FDA may request additional preclinical testing or information before an NDA or BLA can be approved.

&#160;

9&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA. The complete response letter describes all of the specific deficiencies in the submission identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

&#160;

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, certain changes to the approved drug or biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, an NDA or BLA supplement must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to an NDA or BLA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new NDAs or BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.

&#160;

Following receipt of regulatory approval, any products that we market continue to be subject to extensive regulation including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product storage, sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product&#8217;s approved labeling, known as &#8220;off-label use, and requirements relating to industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. These regulations impact many aspects of our operations, including the manufacture, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, distribution, advertising, promotion and record keeping related to the products. The FDA also frequently requires post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or places conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

&#160;

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. If one or more of our products are approved by the FDA and we commence marketing operations, our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability.

&#160;

Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn are used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, exclusion of a manufacturer&#8217;s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment.

&#160;

10&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, enacted in 2010, imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. In addition, pharmaceutical and device manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. The reforms imposed by the PPACA will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry; however, the full effects of the new law cannot be known until these provisions are implemented. In addition, although the PPACA was recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, it is possible that the PPACA may be modified or repealed in the future.

&#160;

If not preempted by this federal law, several states require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in the states. Other states prohibit providing various other marketing related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, certain states require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Currently, several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors, once we commence marketing products it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

&#160;

In addition, as part of the sales and marketing process, pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians. This practice is regulated by the FDA and other governmental authorities, including, in particular, requirements concerning record keeping and control procedures. Any failure to comply with the regulations may result in significant criminal and civil penalties as well as damage to our credibility in the marketplace.

&#160;

The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs. While physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product&#8217;s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. These &#8220;off-label&#8221; uses are not unusual across certain medical specialties and may constitute an appropriate treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. Regulatory authorities in the U.S. generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, these authorities. In addition, our failure to follow FDA rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising may cause the FDA to delay its approval or refuse to approve a product, suspend or withdraw of an approved product from the market, and could result in other consequences such as recalls, fines, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions, injunctions, civil or criminal prosecution or penalties, or other possible legal or regulatory actions, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, or criminal penalties or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity. Any of these consequences could harm our business.

&#160;

We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Our collaborators may also utilize third-parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such collaborator. Manufacturers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

&#160;

Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Applications 

&#160;

Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to a Section 505(b)(1) NDA filing or an Abbreviated NDA, or ANDA. An alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA&#8217;s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA&#8217;s findings with respect to certain pre-clinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.

&#160;

11&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant&#8217;s product or a method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA&#8217;s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. For some drugs, the FDA may require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or restrictions on distribution and use, such as limitations on who may prescribe the drug or where it may be dispensed or administered.

&#160;

To the extent that a Section 505(b)(2) NDA relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved drug product or the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved drug product, the Section 505(b)(2) applicant must submit patent certifications in its Section 505(b)(2) application with respect to any patents for the previously approved product on which the applicant&#8217;s application relies that are listed in the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify for each listed patent that, in relevant part, (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is not sought until after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the proposed new product. A certification that the new product will not infringe the previously approved product&#8217;s listed patent or that such patent is invalid or unenforceable is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge one or more listed patents through a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA will not approve the Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. Further, the FDA will also not approve, as applicable, a Section 505(b)(2) NDA application until any non-patent exclusivity, such as, for example, five-year exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, three year exclusivity for an approval based on new clinical trials, or pediatric exclusivity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product, has expired.

&#160;

If the Section 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the owner of the referenced NDA for the previously approved product and relevant patent holders within 20 days after the Section 505(b)(2) NDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement suit against the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. Under the FDCA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of receipt of the notification regarding a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the Section 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest to occur of 30 months beginning on the date the patent holder receives notice, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or until a court deems the patent unenforceable, invalid or not infringed. Even if a patent infringement claim is not brought within the 45-day period, a patent infringement claim may be brought under traditional patent law, but it does not invoke the 30-month stay. Moreover, in cases where a Section 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted after the fourth year of a previously approved drug&#8217;s five year exclusivity period and the patent holder brings suit within 45 days of notice of certification, the 30-month period is automatically extended to prevent approval of the Section 505(b)(2) application until the date that is seven and one-half years after approval of the previously approved reference product. The court also has the ability to shorten or lengthen either the 30 month or the seven and one-half year period if either party is found not to be reasonably cooperating in expediting the litigation.

&#160;

As a result, we may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of a product and our Section 505(b)(2) applications only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before our product may be commercialized. Alternatively, if the prior NDA applicant or relevant patent holder does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the specified 45-day period, the FDA may approve the Section 505(b)(2) application at any time, assuming the application is otherwise approvable.

&#160;

Notwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to Section 505(b)(2), over the last few years, some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA&#8217;s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA changes its interpretation of Section 505(b)(2), or if the FDA&#8217;s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any Section 505(b)(2) NDA that we submit.

&#160;

We intend to pursue a Section 505(b)(2) regulatory filing in connection with our Epinephrine PFS product, APC-1000, APC-2000, and APC-5000 DPI products and product candidates. Accordingly, if we rely in our regulatory filing on clinical trials conducted, or the FDA&#8217;s prior findings of safety and effectiveness, for a previously approved drug product that involves patents referenced in the Orange Book, then we will need to make the patent certifications or the Paragraph IV certification described above. If we make a Paragraph IV certification and the holder of the previously approved product that we referenced in our application initiates patent litigation within the time periods described above, then we will be subject to the risks of patent litigation, with the accompanying delay described above and potentially material expense of patent litigation, before we could commercially market our product.

&#160;

In addition, even if we submit a 505(b)(2) application, such as we have submitted for the Epinephrine PFS product and as we may submit for other future products, that relies on clinical trials conducted for a previously approved product where there are no patents for such other product with respect to which we have to provide certifications, we are subject to the risk that the FDA could disagree with our reliance on the particular previously approved product that we chose to rely on, conclude that such previously approved product is not an acceptable reference product, and require us instead to reference another previously approved product that involves patents referenced in the Orange Book, requiring us to make the certifications described above and subjecting us to the risks of delay and expense described above.

&#160;

Abbreviated New Drug Applications 

&#160;

In contrast to the kind of clinical trial and other data that is required for an NDA submitted pursuant to Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA, an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, contains data that, when submitted to the FDA pursuant to Section 505(j) of the FDCA, provides for the review and ultimate approval of a product commonly referred to as a &#8220;generic equivalent&#8221; or a &#8220;generic&#8221; drug product. These kinds of drug applications are called &#8220;abbreviated&#8221; because ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct or submit preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and effectiveness of their product, other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing. Instead, a generic applicant must scientifically demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent, that is, that the product performs in the same manner as the listed drug. For locally acting inhaled products, we believe that demonstration of bioequivalency in most cases will require human clinical studies that demonstrate that the generic product performs in the same manner as the listed drug. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as &#8220;generic equivalents&#8221; to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.

&#160;

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#8217;s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA. The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA&#8217;s Orange Book, in a manner generally similar to the certifications that are required in connection with Section 505(b)(2) regulatory filings as described above. As with Section 505(b)(2) regulatory filings, if the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

&#160;

If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, then the procedures described above in connection with Section 505(b)(2) regulatory filings also apply, and the risks of the patent holder initiating a patent infringement lawsuit as described above also apply. The ANDA application also will not be approved until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. Federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active ingredients, during which ANDAs for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a Paragraph IV challenge to a listed patent, in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval. Federal law provides for a period of three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients, but is approved in a new dosage form, route of administration or combination, or for a new use, the approval of which was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor, during which FDA cannot grant effective approval of an ANDA based on that listed drug.

&#160;

Regulation Outside the United States 

&#160;

If we market our products in foreign countries, we also will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for pharmaceutical products. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before manufacturing or marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time required for such approvals may differ substantially from that required for FDA approval. There is no assurance that any future FDA approval of any of our clinical trials or drugs will result in similar foreign approvals or vice versa.

&#160;

Additional Regulation 

&#160;

Third-Party Reimbursement 

&#160;

In the United States, physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers that purchase pharmaceutical products generally rely on third-party payors, principally private health insurance plans, Medicare and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the product and procedure for which the product is being used. Even if a product is approved for marketing by the FDA, there is no assurance that third-party payors will cover the cost of the product and related medical procedures. If they do not, end-users of the drug would not be eligible for any reimbursement of the cost, and our ability to successfully market any such drug would be materially and adversely impacted.

&#160;

Reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. Reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country basis. In many foreign markets, including markets in which we hope to sell our products, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government pricing control. In these markets, once marketing approval is received, pricing negotiations could take significant additional time. As in the United States, the lack of satisfactory reimbursement or inadequate government pricing of any of our products would limit their widespread use and lower potential product revenues.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Fraud and Abuse Laws 

&#160;

Federal and state anti-kickback and anti-fraud and abuse laws, as well as the federal Civil False Claims Act may apply to certain drug and device research and marketing practices. The Civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the United States. Actions under the Civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or by a private individual acting as an informer or whistleblower in the name of the government. Violations of the Civil False Claims Act can result in significant monetary penalties. The federal government is using the Civil False Claims Act, and the threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers, suppliers and drug and device manufacturers throughout the country for a wide variety of drug and device marketing and research practices, and has obtained multi-million dollar settlements. The federal government may continue to devote substantial resources toward investigating healthcare providers&#8217;, suppliers&#8217; and drug and device manufacturers&#8217; compliance with the Civil False Claims Act and other fraud and abuse laws. We may have to expend significant financial resources and management attention if we ever become the focus of such an investigation, even if we are not guilty of any wrong doings.

&#160;

HIPAA 

&#160;

We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, addresses the privacy and transmission of individually identifiable health information and, among other things, requires the use of standard transactions, privacy and security standards and other administrative simplification provisions, by covered entities which include many healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. HIPAA instructs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to promulgate regulations implementing these standards in the United States. HITECH makes HIPAA&#8217;s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, such as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. Material monetary penalties and other remedies can result from violation of these laws and regulations. In addition, many state laws also address the privacy and security of health information, and many of these laws differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.

&#160;

Other Laws 

&#160;

We are also subject to other federal, state and local laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, and various federal, state and local environmental protection laws and regulations, including laws such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other similar federal and state laws regarding, among other things, occupational safety, the use and handling of radioisotopes, environmental protection and hazardous substance control. Although we believe that we have complied with these laws and regulations in all material respects and have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future. Our research and development activities may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals that cause cancer, volatile solvents, radioactive materials and biological materials that have the potential to transmit disease, and our operations may produce hazardous waste products. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations we could be subjected to criminal sanctions and substantial financial liability or be required to suspend or modify our operations. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply in all material respects with legally prescribed standards, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources.

&#160;

License Agreements 

&#160;

Agreement Relating to APC-5000 DPI 

&#160;

On August 1, 2013, we entered into an agreement with 3M Company to exclusively license and, upon final payment acquire, assets relating to 3M Company&#8217;s patented Taper dry powder inhaler, or DPI, technology under development by 3M for the treatment of asthma and COPD. Pursuant to the agreement, we made an initial payment of $3.0 million to 3M and acquired an exclusive license to the assets for all indications in the dry powder inhalation field through December 31, 2013, and on December 27, 2013, we made a final payment to 3M of $7.0 million and the assets were transferred to us, with Adamis granting back to 3M a license to the intellectual property assets outside of the dry powder inhalation field. The intellectual property includes patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relating to the assets. The agreement includes certain other customary provisions, including representations and warranties, warranty disclaimers and indemnification provisions. We intend to utilize the assets initially to develop a pre-metered inhaler device, referred to as APC-5000 DPI, for the treatment of asthma and COPD to deliver the same active ingredients as GlaxoSmithKline&#8217;s Advair Diskus.

&#160;

14&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

The design of the APC-5000 DPI uses proprietary 3M technology to store the active pharmaceutical ingredients on a microstructured carrier tape. Under the agreement, 3M and Adamis have agreed to work in good faith to negotiate and enter into a separate supply agreement providing for the supply of the drug delivery tape to be used with the product.

&#160;

License Agreements Relating to APC-100, APC-200 and APC-300 

&#160;

Pursuant to an agreement entered into in February 2010, a privately held company assigned to us all of its rights under exclusive license agreements relating to the APC-100, APC-200 and APC-300 product candidates, in return for consideration consisting of shares of our common stock. Under the license agreement, Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, or WARF, is the licensor of the patents, patent applications and related intellectual property relating to the compounds. Under each separate agreement, WARF grants to us, as the licensee, an exclusive license, with rights of sublicense, under the patents and patent applications identified in the agreement, for the fields of human nutraceuticals, preventatives, therapeutics and diagnostics and for all territories worldwide that are covered by any of the licensed patents.

&#160;

The license agreements include milestones that we, as the licensee, agree to meet by certain dates, relating to obtaining cumulative funding by certain dates, the filing of an IND relating to a covered product, enrollment of a first patient under a Phase II clinical trial by certain dates, and filing of an NDA with the FDA relating to a covered product by certain dates. WARF has the right to terminate the license agreement with advance notice if we fail to meet any of the funding milestones or commercialization milestones. Under each agreement, we agree to pay WARF a milestone payment of $25,000 upon the filing of the first IND or comparable regulatory filing for a covered product, and additional payments upon the achievement of the additional milestones, aggregating approximately $600,000.

&#160;

Under all of the agreements, we agree to pay product royalties to WARF based on net sales of covered products, at a rate of 5% of net sales. The agreements include customary stacking provisions providing for a reduction in royalties if we become obligated to pay royalties to other third parties on sales of covered products, but in all events the rate will be not less than 2.5% of net sales. In addition, if we receive any fees or other payments in consideration for any rights granted under a sublicense, and the fees or payments are not based directly on the amount or value of products sold by the sublicensee or provided as reimbursement for research and development costs incurred by us, then we are obligated to pay to WARF a percentage of such payments, ranging from 10% to 40% depending on what the stage of regulatory approval and clinical trial development at the time the payments are received. Each agreement provides that we will reimburse WARF for legal fees and other costs incurred in filing, prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents during the term of the agreement. These amounts will accrue for a period of four years after the date of the agreement, after which time the accrued amounts will be paid in four annual installments.

&#160;

The term of each agreement continues until the date that none of the licensed patents under the agreement remains an enforceable patent. We may terminate the agreement at any time with 90 days prior notice to WARF. WARF may terminate the agreement if the date of first commercial sale of a covered product does not occur by December 31, 2020 under the APC-100 and APC-200 agreements and December 31, 2021 under the APC-300 agreement. WARF may also terminate the agreement following our failure to meet a funding or commercialization milestone, or if we fail to pay amounts when due or deliver a development report or commits a material breach of the agreement and fail to cure the default within 90 days.

&#160;

Telomerase Vaccine Technology 

&#160;

Our telomerase vaccine technology was licensed pursuant to exclusive license agreements entered into in April 2011 with the Regents of the University of California and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc. Pursuant to the agreement with the University of California, we acquired a license to certain patents and related intellectual property rights relating to a telomerase-based cancer vaccine technology. We licensed a complementary patent based on technology from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc. Under the terms of the license agreement, we licensed the patents and related intellectual property for a field that includes therapeutic and preventive cancer vaccines in humans, and for a territory that includes the United States. The term of the license extends through the expiration date of the longest-lived patent rights covered by the agreement. Under the agreement, we paid to the universities a small upfront license issue fee in connection with the execution of the license agreement. We will pay the universities a small annual maintenance fee on the first three anniversaries of the date of the agreement, increasing in an immaterial amount thereafter, until we or a permitted sublicensee is commercially selling a licensed product.

&#160;

For the first indication of a licensed product, we will make payments upon reaching specified milestones in clinical development and obtaining U.S. regulatory approval for a licensed product, potentially aggregating approximately $1.87 million if all milestone payments are made, including obtaining U.S. regulatory approval for a licensed product. Similar payments apply to the second indication of a licensed product. The agreement also provides that we will pay the universities royalties, in the low single digits, payable on net sales of licensed products. The agreement includes customary provisions for adjusting the royalty rate in the case of a combination product that includes a licensed product and other products or product components. The agreement includes customary royalty stacking provisions providing for a reduction in the royalty rate if we are required to pay royalties to other third parties to acquire patent rights necessary to make, use or sell licensed products, up to one-half of the amounts otherwise due to the universities.

&#160;

15&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

If we enter into sublicenses of the licensed technology, then a portion of the sublicense fees received by us from the sublicensee is payable to the universities, with the exact percentage depending on the time during the product development, clinical trials and regulatory approval process that the sublicense is entered into. If we receive product royalty payments from sublicensees, we are obligated to pay a percentage of those fees to the universities, with the exact percentage depending on the status of product development and commercialization. Following commercial sales of a licensed product, the agreement provides for minimum annual royalties to the universities, with an increased amount starting with the third full year of sales. We are responsible for payment of patent costs relating to the licensed patents, including patent costs previously incurred by the universities. In the agreement, we agree to diligently proceed with the development, manufacture and sale of licensed products, and to satisfy certain development and regulatory submission milestones by certain dates. Failure to satisfy these obligations permits the universities to either terminate the license agreement or convert the license to a non-exclusive license. The universities may terminate the agreement if we fail to perform or violate any term of the agreement and do not cure the default within 60 days of notice. We may terminate the agreement upon 90 days&#8217; notice to the universities.

&#160;

License Agreement Relating to Vaccine Technologies 

&#160;

On July 28, 2006, for consideration consisting of shares of our common stock and a $55,000 initial license fee, we entered into a worldwide exclusive license agreement with Nevagen, LLC, an entity owned by Dr. Zanetti, to utilize technology held by Nevagen within the field of viral infectious agents. The licensed intellectual property includes the use of the technology known as &#8220;Transgenic Lymphocyte Technology&#8221; covered by certain U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. The license will terminate with the expiration of the U.S. patent for the intellectual property.

&#160;

For the first product, we will make payments upon reaching specified milestones in clinical development and submission of an application regulatory approval, potentially aggregating $900,000 if all milestone payments are made. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no milestones have been achieved and no milestone payments have been made. The agreement also provides that we will pay Nevagen royalties, in the low single digits, payable on net sales received by us of covered products. If additional technologies are required to be licensed to produce a functional product, the royalty rate will be reduced by the amount of the royalty paid to the other licensor, but not more than one-half the specified royalty rate. Royalties and incremental payments with respect to influenza will continue until reaching a cumulative total of $10.0 million.

&#160;

Adamis and Nevagen have the right to sublicense with written permission of the other party. In the event that Nevagen sublicenses or sells the improved technology to a third party, then a portion of the total payments, to be decided by mutual agreement, will be due to us. If we sublicense the intellectual property for use in influenza to a third party, Nevagen will be paid a fixed percentage of all license fees, royalties, and milestone payments, in addition to royalties due and payable based on net sales.

&#160;

If we grant a sublicense to another company for any indication in the field covered by the license agreement other than with respect to influenza, Nevagen will be paid a portion of all license fees, royalties and milestone payments, with the percentage declining over time based on the year in which the sublicense is granted. Certain incremental non-flu virus related sublicensing payments described in the license agreement are specifically excluded from the royalty cap.

&#160;

All improvements of the intellectual property conceived of, or reduced to practice by us, or made jointly by us and Nevagen, will be owned solely by us. We granted Nevagen a royalty-free nonexclusive license to use any improvements made on the existing technology for research purposes only, but not for any commercial purposes of any kind. We have agreed to grant to Nevagen a royalty-free license for any improvement needed for the commercialization of the intellectual property for Nevagen&#8217;s use outside the field licensed to us. If Nevagen sublicenses or sells the improved technology to a third party, then a portion of the total payments, to be decided by mutual agreement, will be due to us. We also have the right of first offer to license certain related technologies from Nevagen, if and when it becomes available.

&#160;

We have the right to terminate the agreement if it is determined that no viable product can come from the licensed technology. Upon such termination, we would be required to transfer and assign to Nevagen all filings, rights and other information in our control. We would retain the same royalty rights for license, or sublicense, agreements if the technology is later developed into a product. Either party may terminate the license agreement in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party that has not been cured or corrected within 90 days of notice of the breach.

&#160;

16&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we had 15 full-time employees and one part-time employee. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor or trade union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.

&#160;
