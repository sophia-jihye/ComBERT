 Item 1. Business &#160; 

Company Overview 

&#160;

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying and developing safe and effective broad spectrum therapeutics for the treatment of serious and life-threatening infections. We are developing a pipeline of product and development candidates, with an initial focus on serious fungal and bacterial infections. On January 29, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Aquarius Biotechnologies Inc., (referred to as the &#8220;Aquarius Merger&#8221; throughout this document), a New Jersey-based, early-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of differentiated and orally delivered therapeutics based on a proprietary, lipid crystal drug delivery platform called &#8220;cochleate delivery technology&#8221;.

&#160;

Our proprietary cochleate delivery technology platform, licensed from Rutgers University on an exclusive worldwide basis, is designed specifically for the targeted and safe delivery of pharmaceuticals directly to the site of infection or inflammation. This innovative technology utilizes lipid-crystal nano-particle cochleates to nano-encapsulate existing drugs, which is designed to make them safer, more tolerable, less toxic and orally bioavailable. We believe this platform represents a significant innovation that may result in meaningful improvements to currently available therapies to treat numerous life-threatening diseases, including serious fungal infections and multi-drug resistant, or MDR, gram-negative bacterial infections.

&#160;

Currently, we are focused on the anti-infectives market and on drug candidates which we believe demonstrate the value and innovation associated with our unique delivery platform technology. We believe initially focusing on the anti-infectives market has distinct advantages for the development of products which meet significant unmet medical need, including:

&#160;

&#183; a current regulatory environment which provides small development and clinical stage companies incentives and opportunities to reduce development cost and timeline to market for anti-infective drug candidates; &#160;

&#183; traditional high correlation between efficacy and safety data in preclinical animal models and the outcome of human clinical trials with these product candidates; &#160;

&#183; attractive commercial opportunities for a product differentiated in its safety profile, mode of action and oral bioavailability positioned against current therapies with significant side effects, limited efficacy and intravenous delivery resulting in lack of convenience, compliance and at a significant burden to the cost of healthcare; and &#160;

&#183; an ability to commercialize anti-infective products with a focused and cost-efficient sales and marketing organization &#160;

We currently have two clinical-stage products designed for the treatment of infectious disease. Our lead product candidate is MAT 2203, a novel oral formulation of a broad spectrum anti-fungal drug called amphotericin B which uses our cochleate delivery technology. We are initially developing MAT2203 for the treatment of Candida infections. A Phase 1a study has been completed and demonstrated that MAT2203 was generally well tolerated at all dosage levels with no serious adverse events reports and no laboratory or renal function abnormalities observed. We are currently screening and enrolling patient in a Phase 2a study of MAT2203 in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and, assuming the NIH meets the anticipated clinical timelines, we anticipate announcing results of this study during 2016. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted MAT2203 designations for Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, and Fast Track for the treatment of invasive candidiasis and invasive aspergillosis. The QIDP designation, provided under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act, offers certain incentives for the development of new antibacterial or antifungal drugs, including eligibility for Fast Track Designation, priority review and, if approved by the FDA, eligibility for an additional five years of marketing exclusivity. Fast Track designation enables more frequent interactions with the FDA to expedite drug development and review. Neither Fast Track designation nor QIDP designation change the standards for approval and we can provide no assurances that we can maintain QIDP or Fast Track designations for MAT2203 or that such designations will result in faster regulatory review. MAT2203 has also received designation from FDA as an Orphan Drug for the treatment of leishmaniasis and we expect to file for additional Orphan Drug designations for MAT2203. The orphan drug designation provides eligibility for seven years of market exclusivity in the United States upon FDA approval, a waiver from payment of user fees, an exemption from performing clinical studies in pediatric patients and tax credits for the cost of clinical research, if we maintain orphan drug designation. The seven-year period of marketing exclusivity provided through orphan designation combined with an additional 5 years of marketing exclusivity by the QIDP designations would position MAT2203 for eligibility of a total of 12 years of marketing exclusivity to potentially be granted at the time of FDA approval.

&#160;

&#160; - 3 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our second clinical stage product candidate is MAT2501, an orally administered, encochleated formulation of the broad spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic amikacin which may be used to treat different types of multidrug-resistant bacteria, including non-tubercular mycobacterial infections (NTM), as well as various multidrug-resistant gram negative and intracellular bacterial infections. Currently, amikacin cannot be absorbed enterally and must be given by intravenous, intramuscular or nebulization routes with the significant risk of nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, which makes it an impractical choice when treating serious infections which often require long courses of therapy, often 12 to 18 months or longer. MAT2501, taking advantage of its innovative, nano-encapsulation delivery technology, is being developed to be orally administered, and is designed to be a safer and targeted therapy for improved treatment of these serious and life-threatening bacterial infections in patients, including those who are severely immunocompromised. We are initially developing MAT2501 for the treatment of NTM. NTM causes many serious and life-threatening diseases, including pulmonary disease, skin and soft tissue disease, joint infections and, in immunocompromised individuals, disseminated infection. The most common clinical manifestation of NTM disease is pulmonary, or lung, disease. NTM lung infection occurs when a person inhales the organism from their environment. There are about 50,000 to 90,000 people with NTM pulmonary disease in the United States, with a much higher prevalence in older adults, and these numbers appear to be increasing. However, NTM can affect any age group. Without treatment, the progressive lung infection caused by NTM results in severe cough, fatigue, and often weight loss. In some people NTM infections can become chronic and require ongoing treatment. Treatment may be difficult because NTM bacteria may be resistant to many common types of antibiotics. Severe NTM lung disease can have a significant impact on quality of life and can be life-threatening. We are also exploring the development of MAT2501 for the treatment of a variety of serious and acute bacterial infections, including the treatment of gram negative bacterial infections, currently the most significant unmet medical need identified by infectious disease specialists. We recently filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) application with FDA and were clear to commence Phase 1 clinical studies in January 2016. We plan to initiate the first Phase 1 study of MAT2501 during 2016. The U.S. FDA has already granted MAT2501 designations for Orphan Drug and QIDP for the treatment of non-tuberculous mycobacteria. If we maintain orphan drug and QIDP designations, the seven-year period of marketing exclusivity provided through orphan designation combined with an additional 5 years of marketing exclusivity by the QIDP designations positions MAT2501 to be eligible for total of 12 years of marketing exclusivity which may be granted at the time of FDA approval.

&#160;

We are currently exploring strategic partnering options for our legacy cardiovascular drug, MAT9001, which has been developed and targeted to date for the treatment of very high triglycerides and MAT8800, our discovery program seeking to identify product candidates derived from omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

&#160; 

Strategy 

&#160;

Our goal is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes novel anti-infective medicines using our proprietary delivery platform technology. Key elements of our strategy include:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Focus on the continued development of our current clinical stage anti-infective product candidates, including commencing and completing the planned Phase2a clinical trial with MAT2203 conducted in cooperation with and funded by the NIH and advancing MAT2501 into Phase 1 clinical studies during 2016. We intend to target those indications which, if approved, would result in being able to take advantage of the 12 years of product exclusivity afforded through FDA designation as a QIDP and Orphan drug product;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Build a significant portfolio of pharmaceutical products using our proprietary cochleate delivery technology platform in conjunction with pharmacologically active compounds that currently have both regulatory approval and broad market adoption, and thereby, we believe, potentially reducing development risk, regulatory approval process time and market adoption risk for our products;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183;

&#160;

&#160;

Identify strategic collaborations with one or more pharmaceutical partners through which we can utilize our unique and proprietary platform delivery technology to improve the clinical profile of one or more active pharmaceutical ingredients either in development or currently marketed.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; - 4 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Identify one or more strategic or financial partners to continue the development of our legacy cardiovascular MAT9001 product; and

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Develop or find existing manufacturing space in order to grow our capabilities to manufacture product in a compliant, cGMP facility in order to supply products for clinical development and, ultimately, commercial production in an effort to retain exclusive knowledge of the process and intellectual property associated with our platform delivery technology; 

&#160; 

Our Anti-Infective Product Candidates 

&#160; 

MAT2203 

&#160;

Product Profile 

&#160;

MAT2203 is an orally-administered, encochleated formulation of amphotericin B (a broad spectrum fungicidal agent). Little to no clinical resistance has been reported to date with amphotericin B as compared to the rapidly emerging drug resistance seen in other antifungal therapies. Currently, IV-only administered amphotericin B is the only broad spectrum fungicidal available but its IV-delivery results in significant treatment-limiting side effects, including nephrotoxicity. The ability to provide amphotericin B orally using our proprietary and novel oral formulation may offer a new and promising alternative for patients and doctors. In a clinical Phase 1a single-dose, double-blind, dose-escalating, pharmacokinetic study of 48 healthy volunteers, oral MAT2203 demonstrated a positive safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events reported, including little or no nephrotoxicity as compared to placebo.

&#160;

Antifungal Market 

&#160;

According to a February 2012 article in Genetic Engineering &#38; Biotechnology News, the world market for systemic antifungal therapies was estimated to be in excess of $6 billion in 2011 and was expected to grow by as much as 4% a year. This market for serious fungal infections is currently served by only three major drug classes: triazoles, polyenes and echinocandins. Of these, the azole class is currently dominant with voriconazole as the market leading agent. The echinocandins are the latest class of agent to be introduced to the market but mortality remains high. Increasing resistance is being seen amongst Candida and Aspergillus species, particularly to azoles. The market for systemic antifungals is driven by annual increases in the susceptible immune compromised patient population.

&#160;

Azole antifungals are available in oral formulations and are typically well tolerated, but resistance has developed, and toxicities that occur with prolonged use include hepatotoxicity, fluoride toxicity, and photosensitivity (with voriconazole). Echinocandins (eg, caspofungin and micafungin) are very well tolerated but are only available as IV formulations and resistance has developed. Polyene derivatives, such as amphotericin B, are sometimes administered for topical treatment of oral and esophageal candida infections as an oral suspension though it is not widely available, is not very effective, and may irritate the oral and esophageal tissues.

&#160;

Our lead anti-infective product candidate, MAT2203, is an application of our cochleate delivery technology to a broad spectrum anti-fungal drug called amphotericin B. Amphotericin B is an IV administered drug used as a last resort for treatment of systemic fungal infections resistant to triazoles and echinocandins, including resistant candidiasis, cryptococcal meningoencephalitis, aspergillosis and leishmaniasis. To date, there have been no reports of clinically observed drug-resistance to amphotericin B, further bolstering the use of this compound as the most likely last resort treatment for fungal infections in the foreseeable future. However, the use of amphotericin B is relatively limited because it is currently only available as an IV-administered product and has significant side effects (including nephrotoxicity, or a poisonous effect on the kidneys). Encapsulating the amphotericin B drug with our cochleate delivery technology provides a potential opportunity for the drug to be taken orally with targeted delivery to infected cells, which we believe may have fewer side effects than the currently available IV-formulations of amphotericin B.

&#160; 

Development History of MAT2203 

&#160;

MAT2203 was extensively studied in animal model studies of various fungal infections including invasive candidiasis, aspergillosis, and visceral leichmaniasis.

&#160;

The data from animal studies for MAT 2203, our cochleate lipid-crystal nano-particle formulation of amphotericin B, indicate a significant side-effect advantage over amphotericin B formulations, which we believe is based on two phenomena:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; The lipid-crystal nano-particle is a solid particle, and does not significantly &#8220;leak&#8221; its drug content while circulating. The particle releases its medication pay-load only when inside the target cells, and thus protects the kidney and other sensitive tissues from many of the amphotericin B side effects. &#160; &#183; Because of this targeted approach, the required dose level is typically lower than other formulations. The lower dose further contributes to a more beneficial side-effect profile. &#160;

&#160; - 5 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition, in the vast majority of these animal studies the MAT2203 product was administered orally; in the remainder of these animal studies the MAT2203 product was administered via IV. If confirmed in our ongoing Phase 2a human efficacy study, the oral formulation is a second major differentiator of our technology which offers significant health-economic benefit since patients do not need to stay in the hospital to receive the therapy. Because of these strong differentiators brought by the cochleate lipid-crystal nano-particle technology, we believe that MAT2203, if eventually approved by the FDA, may be able to obtain a significant market share of the fungal infection treatment market.

&#160;

An IND application for MAT2203 was filed with the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in late 2006. In a clinical Phase 1a single-dose, double-blind, dose-escalating, pharmacokinetic (PK) study of 48 healthy volunteers MAT 2203 demonstrated a positive safety and tolerability profile with no serious adverse events reported.

&#160;

Development Plan for MAT2203 &#8211; Phase 2a 

&#160;

The NIH is currently enrolling, screening and preparing to dose patients in a Phase 2a study of encochleated amphotericin B (CAMB) in patients with mucocutaneous (esophageal, oropharyngeal, vulvovaginal) candidiasis who are refractory or intolerant to standard non-intravenous therapies. This is an open-label, dose-titration trial in up to 16 patients to study the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of oral CAMB in the treatment of mucocutaneous candidiasis. Initially, CAMB will be administered at 200 mg/day (100 mg twice daily, or BID) for 2-weeks. If a patient experiences a clinical response after 2 weeks, then treatment will be extended for 2 more weeks. If there is no clinical response but study drug is tolerated, then dosage will be escalated to 400 mg/day (200 mg BID). If after escalation there is a clinical response after 2 weeks, then treatment will be extended for 2 more weeks. If there is no clinical response and study drug is tolerated, then dosage can be escalated again to 800 mg/day (400 mg BID) for an additional 2 weeks. The primary objective of the trial is to assess the clinical response to treatment of mucocutaneous candidiasis infections in patients who are refractory or intolerant to standard non-intravenous therapies after treatment for 14-days with the highest titrated dosage of CAMB per patient. Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics, mycological response, and safety. Assuming that the NIH meets the proposed timeline for this study, we expect to release data later in 2016 following evaluation and discussion with the NIH.

&#160;

MAT2501 &#8211; Targeting Chronic and Acute Bacterial Infections 

&#160;

Product Profile 

&#160;

MAT2501, an orally-administered, encochleated formulation of the broad spectrum IV-only aminoglycoside antibiotic agent amikacin, utilizes the Company&#8217;s proprietary, lipid-crystal, nanoparticle delivery technology. Amikacin is currently used to treat different types of chronic and acute bacterial infections, including NTM infections and various multidrug-resistant gram negative bacterial infections. IV-administered amikacin is associated with major side effects including nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity (permanent loss of hearing). MAT2501 is specifically designed to provide targeted delivery of the potent antibiotic amikacin while providing a significantly improved safety and tolerability profile. In preclinical studies MAT2501 demonstrated oral bioavailability and targeted delivery of amikacin directly to the site of infection in both pulmonary (lung) and disseminated NTM infections. We recently received FDA clearance to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study of MAT2501 for the treatment of NTM infections. The FDA has also designated MAT2501 as a QIDP and an Orphan Drug for the treatment of NTM infections. We intend to initially develop MAT2501 for the treatment of NTM infections and will also explore the development of MAT2501 for the treatment of a variety of multi-drug resistant, gram negative bacterial infections. If approved, we believe MAT2501 would become the first orally bioavailable aminoglycoside and represent a significant improvement over existing therapies from a treatment and health economic perspective.

&#160; 

NTM Market Opportunity 

&#160; 

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are naturally occurring organisms found in water, soil, plants and animals. NTM causes many serious and life-threatening diseases, including pulmonary disease, skin and soft tissue disease, joint infections and, in immunocompromised individuals, disseminated infection. The most common clinical manifestation of NTM disease is pulmonary, or lung, disease. NTM lung infection occurs when a person inhales the organism from their environment. While most people do not become ill, some individuals develop a slow, progressive and destructive disease when NTM infects the airways and lung tissue leading to inflammation in the respiratory system. Individuals susceptible to the infection often have an unknown defect in their lung structure or immune system, lung damage from a pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as emphysema and bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, or an immune deficiency disorder, such as HIV or AIDS.

&#160;

&#160; - 6 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

There are about 50,000 to 90,000 people with NTM pulmonary disease in the United States, with a much higher prevalence in older adults, and these numbers appear to be increasing. However, NTM can affect any age group. Without treatment, the progressive lung infection caused by NTM results in severe cough, fatigue and weight loss and may ultimately lead to death. In some people NTM infections can become chronic and require ongoing and long term treatment. Treatment may be difficult because NTM bacteria may be resistant to many common types of antibiotics. Severe NTM lung disease can have a significant impact on quality of life and can be life-threatening. There are no products specifically indicated for the treatment of NTM disease in the U.S., Europe or Canada. Current guideline-based approaches involve multi-drug regimens that may cause severe side effects and treatments can be as long as two years or more.

&#160;

Drug-Resistant Antibiotic Market 

&#160;

Physicians commonly prescribe antibiotics to treat patients with infectious diseases that are either known, or presumed, to be caused by bacteria. According to IMS Health, in 2011 approximately $41 billion was spent on antibiotic drugs worldwide, of which almost $9 billion was spent in the United States. The widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in a rapid increase in bacterial infections that are resistant to multiple antibacterial agents.

&#160;

Bacterial infections are caused by a variety of different types of bacteria and the infections they cause can range from mild to serious, life-threatening infections requiring immediate treatment. Bacteria are broadly categorized as Gram-positive, Gram-negative, atypical or anaerobic. Gram-positive bacteria possess a single membrane and a thick cell wall and turn dark-blue or violet when subjected to a laboratory staining method known as Gram&#8217;s method. Common causes of Gram-positive bacterial infections include species of Staphylococcus , such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , or MRSA, Streptococcus and Enterococcus . Gram-negative bacteria have two membranes with a thin cell wall and, when subjected to Gram&#8217;s method of staining, lose the stain or are decolorized. According to The New England Journal of Medicine, the most common cause of Gram-negative infection is Escherichia coli , or E. coli . Less prevalent Gram-negative bacteria strains include species of Acinetobacter , Klebsiella, Salmonella and Pseudomonas . Atypical bacteria, such as Mycoplasma species, have modified cell walls and are neither Gram-positive nor Gram-negative. Anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides species, either cannot grow in the presence of oxygen or do not require oxygen to grow and are classified as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative.

&#160;

Antibiotics that treat bacterial infections can be classified as broad-spectrum or narrow-spectrum. Antibiotics that are active against a mixture of Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria are referred to as broad-spectrum. Antibiotics that are active only against a select subset of bacteria are referred to as narrow-spectrum. Because it usually takes from 24 to 72 hours from the time a specimen is received in the laboratory to definitively diagnose a particular bacterial infection, physicians may be required to prescribe antibiotics for serious infections without having identified the bacteria. As such, effective first-line treatment of serious infections requires the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against a broad range of bacteria at least until the bacterial infection can be diagnosed.

&#160;

Many strains of bacteria have mutated over time and have developed resistance to existing drugs, resulting in infections that are increasingly serious or more difficult to treat. These drug-resistant pathogens have become a growing menace to all people, regardless of age, gender or socioeconomic background. They endanger people in affluent, industrial societies like the United States, as well as in less-developed nations. Gram-positive bacteria that have developed resistance to existing drugs include:

&#160;

&#160; - 7 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Streptococcus pneumoniae that cause pneumonia, ear infections, bloodstream infections and meningitis; &#160; &#183; Staphylococcus aureus that cause skin, bone, lung and bloodstream infections; and &#160; &#183; Enterococci that are responsible for infections transmitted in healthcare settings. &#160; &#183; Gram-negative bacteria that have developed resistance to existing drugs include: &#160; &#183; Escherichia coli that cause urinary tract, skin and bloodstream infections; &#160; &#183; Salmonella and Escherichia coli that cause foodborne infections; and &#160; &#183; Acinetobacter baumannii , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella spp. that are responsible for infections transmitted in healthcare settings. &#160;

According to a September 2013 report of the CDC, each year in the United States, at least two million people acquire serious infections with bacteria that are resistant to one or more of the antibiotics designed to treat those infections. At least 23,000 people die each year as a direct result of these antibiotic-resistant infections, with many more dying from other conditions that are complicated by the occurrence of an antibiotic-resistant infection. These antibiotic-resistant infections add considerable and avoidable costs to the already overburdened U.S. healthcare system. In the same September 2013 report, the CDC noted that the total economic cost of antibiotic infections to the U.S. economy has been estimated to be as high as $20 billion in excess of direct healthcare costs. In addition, the CDC reported that, among all of the bacterial resistance problems, Gram-negative pathogens are particularly worrisome because they are becoming resistant to nearly all drugs that would be considered for treatment, with the most serious Gram-negative infections being healthcare associated and the most common pathogens being Enterobacteriaceae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter .

&#160;

As such, at present, there is an acute need for new drugs to treat multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Currently approved products, such as Merrem and Levaquin, are becoming increasingly ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria due to increasing resistance, limiting patients&#8217; treatment options, particularly for patients with multidrug-resistant infections, and few new therapeutic agents are in clinical development.

&#160;

A survey of infectious disease specialists published in the June 2012 edition of Clinical Infectious Disease rated multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections as the most important unmet clinical need in current practice. In the survey, 63% of physicians reported treating a patient in the past year whose bacterial infection was resistant to all available antibacterial agents. As a further example of the seriousness of the threat of Gram-negative bacteria resistant to all available antibacterial agents, in 2014, the national media including The Wall Street Journal , CBS and Fox News reported on an outbreak, primarily in one suburban Chicago, Illinois hospital, of CRE with more than 40 cases reported in 2013. Additionally, in February 2015, an outbreak of CRE occurred at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in which a total of seven people became infected and the infection was a contributing factor in the death of two patients. A similar report came from the Carolinas HealthCare System in February 2015, in which 18 people contracted CRE at a hospital in Charlotte, North Carolina and one person died. According to the CDC, CRE are a nightmare bacteria, are resistant to nearly all known antibiotics and kill up to 50% of people infected.

&#160;

The growing issue of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections has been widely recognized as an increasingly urgent public health threat, including by the World Health Organization, or WHO, the CDC and the Infectious Disease Society of America, or IDSA. In April 2014, the WHO issued an antimicrobial resistance global surveillance report stating that resistance to common bacteria has reached alarming levels worldwide indicating that many available treatment options are becoming ineffective, and leading to a negative impact in patient outcomes and health-care spending. The WHO warns that unless significant measures are taken, people will start to die from common, formerly treatable infections, and medical interventions such as surgery, chemotherapy, organ transplantation and care of premature infants will become increasingly risky. The important need for new treatment options for serious bacterial infections was further highlighted by the passage in the United States in July 2012 of the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now, or GAIN, Act, which provides regulatory incentives for the development of new antibacterial or antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections that are resistant to existing treatment. In September 2014, the United States&#8217; President&#8217;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology issued a report providing recommendations to combat the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria and advising that without rapid action, the United States risks losing the tremendous progress made in antibiotic development over the last century. Their recommendations focused on three areas: improving surveillance, increasing longevity of current antibiotics and increasing the rate at which new antibiotics are discovered and developed.

&#160;

&#160; - 8 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Additionally, legislative initiatives have recently been introduced as part of the 21st Century Cures discussion document, including the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment, or ADAPT, Act which would provide a pathway for approval of antibiotics in limited populations of patients with few or no suitable treatment options, the Developing an Innovating Strategy for Antimicrobial Resistant Microorganisms, or DISARM, Act which would designate certain novel antibiotics used to treat serious bacterial infections to receive higher Medicare reimbursement, and an amendment to the GAIN Act which would allow successful QIDP sponsors to transfer up to one year of exclusivity to another product, including products marketed by other companies.

&#160; 

Limitations of Available Treatment Options 

&#160;

When confronted with a new patient suffering from a serious infection caused by an unknown pathogen, a physician may be required to quickly initiate first-line empiric antibiotic treatment to stabilize the patient prior to definitively diagnosing the particular bacterial infection. However, current antibiotics for first-line empiric treatment of serious bacterial infections suffer from significant limitations, including one or more of the following:

&#160; 

Insufficient Coverage of Multidrug-resistant Bacteria. A physician cannot afford to be too limited in the spectrum of bacteria covered by antibiotics when initially treating a patient for a serious infection that has not yet been definitively identified. Frequently used products, such as Zyvox and Cubicin, are mostly limited to Gram-positive bacteria and thus are rarely used as a first-line empiric monotherapy if broad bacterial coverage is required. In addition, other popular antibiotics that have been used as first-line empiric monotherapies, such as Levaquin, piperacillin/tazobactam, which is marketed by Pfizer as Zosyn, carbapenems, such as Merrem, and imipenem/cilastatin, which is marketed by Merck as Primaxin, have seen their utility as first-line empiric monotherapies diminished as the number of bacterial strains resistant to these therapies has increased.

&#160; 

Safety and Tolerability Concerns. Concerns about antibiotic safety and tolerability are among the leading reasons why patients stop treatment and fail therapy. Antibiotics on the market have been associated with adverse effects such as myelosuppression, seizures, nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal disorders.

&#160; 

Lack of Oral Dosage Forms to Permit Transition Therapy. When a patient comes to the emergency room or hospital for treatment of a serious infection, the patient initially receives IV treatment, which allows the drug to be delivered more rapidly and in a larger dose than oral treatment. Once the infection begins to respond to treatment and the patient is stabilized, depending on the infection, hospitals and physicians generally seek to minimize in-hospital treatment and, if possible, discharge patients from the hospital in order to reduce costs, avoid hospital-acquired infections, and improve the patients&#8217; quality of life. Upon discharge, physicians typically prefer to prescribe transition therapy treatment with an oral formulation of the same antibiotic. A transition therapy to oral treatment allows for more convenient and cost-effective out-patient treatment, with the oral antibiotic providing enhanced patient comfort and mobility and avoiding the risk of infection from the IV catheter. In addition, the use of the same antibiotic allows the physician to avoid switching the patient from the antibiotic that has proven effective during IV administration to a different antibiotic that may be less effective and carries the risk of new or different side effects. Many of the antibiotics that are most commonly used as first-line empiric monotherapies are only available in an IV formulation. Very few, if any, of the antibiotics that cover or are focused on the treatment of Gram-negative bacteria, including NTM, have oral dosage forms.

&#160;

Given these limitations, there is an unmet medical need for a first-line empiric antibiotic treatment that has the following characteristics:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Potency and effectiveness against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including NTM, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative, Gram-positive, atypical and anaerobic bacteria; &#160; &#183; Capability of being used as a monotherapy in the majority of patients in the hospital with cIAI, cUTI and other multidrug-resistant infections; &#160; &#183; A convenient dosing regimen, such as once or twice-daily; &#160; &#183; A favorable safety and tolerability profile; and &#160;

&#160; &#183; Availability in an oral dosage form. &#160;

Our Cochleate Delivery Technology 

&#160;

Our core capabilities combine the use of lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and the use of lipids in &#8220;cochleate-shaped&#8221; lipid-crystal nano-particle drug delivery vehicles. Therapeutic applications of our proprietary delivery technology are focused on the delivery of several potent and highly efficacious anti-fungal and anti-bacterial agents which, unfortunately, are currently still associated with serious side effects, including irreversible toxic effects on kidney and hearing function. Our technology may allow for the safe and targeted delivery of these agents, which positions us to be at the forefront of dealing with these very serious problems.

&#160;

Our lipid-based delivery technology is currently being used to encapsulate potent but dangerous anti-infective drugs in tiny lipid-crystals which are selectively picked up by macrophage cells and transported to infected cells. These tiny lipid crystals are referred to as &#8220;cochleates.&#8221; Cochleates have a multilayer crystalline, spiral structure with no internal aqueous space. The structure is formed when a series of solid lipid sheets roll up and engulf drug molecules in between the sheets, a proprietary process referred to as &#8220;encochleation&#8221;. The result is a lipid-crystal encochleated drug formulation made up of nano-sized particles. We believe our cochleate delivery technology provides an effective delivery mechanism without chemically bonding or otherwise altering the drug. Because the medications are locked in the particles, the sensitive-organ exposure to these medications is believed to be drastically reduced, as well as the toxic side-effects. In summary, this unique technology offers (1) targeted delivery, (2) sensitive organ protection, and (3) oral formulation (even for IV-only medications).

&#160;

Our cochleate delivery technology is based upon components which are believed to be non-toxic. The primary chemical components of our cochleate delivery technology are soy-derived phosphatidylserine, or &#8220;PS&#8221;, and calcium, which are naturally occurring materials classified as generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, by the FDA. Our technology involves combining and mixing the soy-derived PS and calcium through a self-assembly process under carefully controlled conditions to envelop the subject drug into very small lipid-crystal particles. The result is a nano-size encochleated drug formulation. The unique cochleate structure protects the drug from degradation when it passes through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and into the blood stream. The strong structure of the cochleate protects the drug as it travels through the GI tract. Once the cochleate, with the drug inside, is absorbed through the GI tract, it is engulfed by the target cells in the bloodstream, including cells called macrophages, and taken to the infected cells. Once the encochleated drug is engulfed by the macrophage, the lower calcium levels inside the macrophage compared to the high level of calcium outside the macrophage triggers the cochleate to open, thus releasing the drug.

Multi-organ Protection: The key innovation of our cochleate delivery technology is our ability to package medication inside lipid-crystal particles without leaking. Because of their crystal nature, these particles are truly solid and hold on tightly to their medication pay-load. This is where the cochleate delivery technology differs markedly from other lipid-based delivery technology, such as liposomal delivery. Liposomes are liquid delivery systems which typically leak some of their drug content into our circulatory systems, thus still exposing our vulnerable organs and tissues to toxic effects of often potent medications. Keeping organ-toxic medications inside the lipid-crystal particles strongly differentiates our cochleate delivery technology from other drug delivery approaches.

&#160; 

Targeted Delivery: The size of our individual cochleate lipid-crystals is typically in the range of 50-500 nm. This is very small and by comparison close to the size of a large virus or a small bacteria. Our body produces several cell-types that are designed to remove viruses and bacteria from our system. These cell types, such as macrophages, are part of our immune system and &#8220;swallow&#8221; the bacteria and viruses they encounter in order to protect us from infections. Because of the size our lipid-crystal cochleate particles and the phospholipid surface structure (the cell membranes of bacteria are also made up from phospholipids), macrophages tend to absorb these cochleate particles very well.

&#160; 

Oral Formulation: Many drugs that are currently on the market are only effective in treating diseases when administered via IV. For example, many anti-infective drugs must be administered via IV in order to be effective. IV administration presents several challenges to care, such as risk of infection, patient discomfort from injections, and higher cost of care than anti-infective drugs that can be taken orally (IV delivery must be performed by a doctor or nurse, often within a very expensive hospital setting). Although several technologies have been used to attempt to convert IV drugs to orally delivered medications, success has been limited due to the difficulty in achieving adequate bioavailability (i.e., the amount of drug that is absorbed into the body) with oral formulation. We believe that the unique cochleate crystal-structure in our platform technology protects the drug from degradation when it passes through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and that its lipid surface features facilitate the particle to be absorbed into the blood stream. The potential application of our cochleate delivery technology for the delivery of injectable medications offers significant clinical and commercial value if successfully demonstrated in human clinical trials.

&#160;

Historical Development of Cochleate Delivery Technology 

&#160;

The cochleate delivery technology was originally developed by the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and Albany Medical College in collaboration with BioDelivery Sciences, Inc., a company founded in 1995 by Drs. Raphael Mannino, who joined our Scientific Advisory Board in connection with Aquarius acquisition, and Susan Gould-Fogerite, and others. BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (NASDAQ: BDSI) acquired BioDelivery Sciences, Inc. in 2002 and Drs. Mannino and Gould-Fogerite joined BDSI&#8217;s management team. BDSI continued the development of the cochleate delivery technology pursuant to an exclusive license with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and Albany Medical College and application of such drug delivery technology to an array of established pharmaceutics, including an application of cochleate delivery technology to a broad spectrum anti-fungal drug called amphotericin B, which has developed into our MAT 2203 product candidate. BDSI filed an IND for this product at the end of 2006, performed several animal toxicology studies and performed a single dose Phase 1 study. In the animal studies conducted by BDSI, doses used in toxicology studies were shown to produce measureable tissue concentrations and efficacy against the fungal infections candidiasis and aspergillosis. In 2009, BDSI reported preliminary results from its Phase 1 study, where BDSI indicated that plasma concentrations of amphotericin B were detected in the sample of patients tested suggesting oral absorption from the cochleate delivery system. Forty-eight healthy volunteers participated in the study, with sixteen recruited for each of three dose groups. In each dose group, twelve volunteers received a single dose of cochleate amphotericin B (MAT 2203) and four received a placebo. Amphotericin B plasma concentrations were measured over a period of fourteen days. The study identified doses that were well-tolerated with no meaningful changes in laboratory safety values including those associated with renal function. The preliminary pharmacokinetic evaluation, available in February 2009, revealed that plasma concentrations were comparable to those seen in prior animal toxicology studies using the same formulation. In previous animal studies conducted by BDSI, doses used in toxicology studies were shown to produce measureable tissue concentrations and efficacy against the fungal infections candidiasis and aspergillosis.

&#160;

Additional Pipeline Opportunities 

&#160;

We believe our cochleate delivery technology can be used to reformulate a wide variety of drugs which are currently only available in IV formulations. Leveraging our cochleate delivery technology, we believe we can develop a robust pipeline of product candidates. We have tested a range of pharmaceutical compounds reformulated by our cochleate delivery technology in proof-of-concept animal studies, including vaccines, curcumin, capreomycin, and atovaquone. By way of example, we recently received a patent issuance related to cochleate compositions directed against expressions of proteins. The allowed patent claims cover our proprietary methods related to the composition and the formation of encochleated siRNA for potential use as therapy for regulating gene expression. We intend to pursue opportunities to develop products, either alone or in partnership with other pharmaceutical or biotech companies, related to this technology.

&#160; 

Our Cardiovascular Therapeutic Candidates 

&#160; 

MAT9001 

&#160;

Our legacy cardiovascular product candidate, MAT9001, is a proprietary prescription-only omega-3 fatty acid composition, comprised of a complex mixture of omega-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA, docosapentaenoic acid, or DPA, several other omega-3 fatty acids, and relatively nominal amounts of docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, and non-omega-3 fatty acids. We believe that based upon MAT9001&#8217;s unique composition, which includes more DPA than other known omega-3 fatty acids, it will prove to be differentiated from other existing therapies for the treatment of very high triglycerides, or severe hypertriglyceridemia, and dyslipidemia.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; - 12 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

On October 20, 2014, we submitted an IND to FDA for MAT9001 with an initial indication for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG&#62;500 mg/dL). In the fourth quarter of 2014, we received feedback from FDA with respect to its IND submission for MAT9001. Although FDA did not raise any clinical hold issues, FDA provided recommendations for certain revisions to our planned four-week rat comparative bridging toxicity study as well as our planned 4-way crossover single dose Fed/Fast PK study of MAT9001 in comparison to another omega-3 product. Based on FDA&#8217;s comments, during the first quarter of 2015, we submitted modified protocols for the four-week rat comparative bridging toxicity study, as well as our 4-way crossover single dose Fed/Fast PK study.

&#160;

In June of 2015 we announced data from a PK/PD study that showed MAT9001 demonstrated superiority versus Vascepa &#174; (icosapent ethyl) in reducing lipids, triglycerides, apolipoproteins and PCSK9 levels. The data were based on a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics, open-label crossover study designed to compare the bioavailability and effects of MAT9001 versus Vascepa, ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2012 as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride (TG) levels in adult patients with severe (&#8805; 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia.

&#160;

Results and Trial Design 

&#160;

MAT9001 achieved a greater median percentage reduction from baseline to trial end in total cholesterol and a significantly greater median percentage reduction in four of six lipid measures, including total cholesterol, when compared to Vascepa:

&#160;

&#183; MAT9001 reduced median TG levels by 33.2 percent compared to 10.5 percent for Vascepa (P-Value &#60;0.001); &#183; MAT9001 reduced median VLDL-C (very low density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels by 32.5 percent compared to 8.1 percent for Vascepa (P-Value &#60;0.001); &#183; MAT9001 reduced median non-HDL-C (non-high-density cholesterol) levels by 8.8 percent compared to 4.6 percent for Vascepa (P-Value = 0.027); &#183; MAT9001 reduced median HDL-C (high-density cholesterol) levels by 11.3 percent compared to 11.1 percent for Vascepa (P-Value = 0.337); &#183; MAT9001 reduced median LDL (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels by 2.4 percent compared to 4.3 percent for Vascepa (P-Value = 0.116); &#183; MAT9001 reduced median total cholesterol levels by 9 percent compared to 6.2 percent for Vascepa (P-Value = 0.013). &#160;

MAT9001 also outperformed Vascepa in reductions in apolipoproteins (apo) and PCSK9 as compared to baseline:

&#160;

&#183; MAT9001 reduced median apolipoprotein B levels by 3.8 percent compared to 0.7 percent for Vascepa (P-Value = 0.058); &#183; MAT9001 reduced median apolipoprotein AI levels by 15.3 percent compared to 10.2 percent for Vascepa (P-value = 0.003); &#183; MAT9001 reduced median apolipoprotein CIII levels by 25.5 percent compared to 5 percent for Vascepa (P-Value = 0.006); &#183; MAT9001 reduced median PCSK9 levels by 12.3 percent compared to an 8.8 percent increase in PCSK9 levels for Vascepa (P-Value &#60;0.001). &#160;

The comparator study was conducted in 42 patients with high triglyceride levels. Study subjects had fasting TG levels of 200 to 400 mg/dL without lipid altering therapy, or fasting TG levels of 200 to 350 mg/dL if they were on a stable-dose statin monotherapy. Pre-treatment median values for lipids, triglycerides, apolipoproteins and PCSK9 levels were measured. Patients were randomized and put on MAT9001 or Vascepa for 14 days, then washed out over five weeks, and then crossed over to Vascepa or MAT9001 for 14 days. Forty patients completed the trial.

&#160;

MAT9001 met its primary endpoint in this study. Statistical analysis demonstrated superiority of MAT9001 over Vascepa for omega-3 bioavailability (baseline adjusted AUC and C max , approximately 6-fold higher with MAT9001 on day 14, with very high statistical significance). Vascepa is indicated for use with a lipid-lowering diet to reduce very high triglycerides in adult patients and is a trademark of Amarin Pharmaceuticals Ireland Ltd.

&#160;

Following our acquisition of Aquarius Biotechnologies, Inc. in 2015, we made a strategic decision to focus our resources on the further development of our cochleate lipid-crystal nanoparticle delivery platform and products based on that technology. As a result, we are currently exploring strategic opportunities and partnerships for the continued development of MAT9001, both in the U.S. and abroad.

Exclusive License Agreement with Rutgers University 

&#160;

Through our acquisition of Aquarius, we acquired a license from Rutgers University for the cochleate delivery technology. The Amended and Restated Exclusive License Agreement between Aquarius and Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (successor in interest to the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey) provides for, among other things, (1) a license issue fee of $25,000 paid upon execution, (2) an increased equity interest in the company from 5% to 7.5% of Aquarius (prior to our acquisition of Aquarius in the Aquarius Merger), (3) royalties on a tiered basis between low single digits and the mid-single digits of net sales of products using such licensed technology, (4) a one-time sales milestone fee of $100,000 when and if sales of products using the licensed technology reach the specified sales threshold and (5) an annual license fee of initially $10,000, increasing to $50,000 over the term of the license agreement. We also agreed to assume the responsibility to pay required patent prosecution and maintenance fees covering the technology.

&#160;

Unless otherwise terminated by either party, the term of the license, on a country by country basis, shall be the longer of 7-1/2 years from the date of first commercial sale of a product in a country using the licensed technology or until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent rights licensed under the agreement, whichever is longer. Rutgers has the right to terminate the license agreement if we have not commenced commercial sales of at least one product using the licensed technology within nine years of the effective date of the license agreement.

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates and our discovery programs, processes and know-how are important to our business. We will seek to protect our products and associated technologies for their manufacturing and development through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, FDA exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure. Our policy is to pursue, maintain and defend patent rights and to protect the technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. Our success will significantly depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology and inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely heavily on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

&#160; 

Exclusively Licensed Intellectual Property Relating to Our Proprietary Cochleate Delivery Technology Platform and MAT2203 and MAT2501 

&#160;

The patents and patent applications that we exclusively license from Rutgers University provide patent protection for the proprietary chemistry technology used in our process to make cochleates and formulate the active pharmaceutical ingredients delivered inside this delivery technology, as in MAT2203 and MAT2501. Pursuant to our license agreement, we have acquired rights to a portfolio of 18 issued and foreign patents, including 11 patents issued within the last 3 years, which extends patent protection until at least 2033. In addition, we have more than 20 pending patent applications filed both in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, including 16 national phase applications filed within the past 2 years. We have chosen to file these patent applications in selected foreign markets that we consider important for our product candidates. These international markets generally include Europe, China, India, Brazil, Russia, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia and Mexico. These pending patent applications can extend patent protection through at least 2033. The patent portfolio covering our cochleate delivery system covers a broad spectrum of technology, including amphotericin B cochleates, geodate cochleates, methods of delivering nutrients or biologically relevant molecules to a host using cochleates, cochleate vaccine compositions and protein-lipid vesicles, small interfering RNA cochleates, methods of enhancing the encochleation of hydrophilic molecules and cochleates made with low purity soy phosphatidylserine.

&#160;

We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Relating to Our Intellectual Property.&#8221;

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; - 15 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant aspects of our proprietary technology platform are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

&#160;

We also plan to seek trademark protection in the United States and outside of the United States where available and when appropriate. We intend to use these registered marks in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development as well as our product candidates.

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160;

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of these companies have far greater human and financial resources and may have product candidates in more advanced stages of development and many will reach the market before our product candidates. Competitors may also develop products that are more effective, safer or less expensive or that have better tolerability or convenience. Although we believe that our formulation delivery technology, experience and knowledge in our areas of focus provide us with competitive advantages, these potential competitors could reduce our commercial opportunities. For many of our product candidates, we anticipate facing competition from other products that are available on a generic basis and offered at low prices. Many of these generic products have been marketed by third parties for many years and are well accepted by physicians, patients and payors.

&#160; 

Competition for MAT2203 for treatment of severe fungal infections 

&#160;

We believe that our key competitors in the treatment of severe fungal infections, such as invasive candidiasis and aspergillosis, are as follows:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Pfizer, the manufacturer of Vfend (voriconazole) and Eraxis (anidulafungin), as well as the generic manufacturers of voriconazole; &#160; &#183; Merck, the manufacturer of Noxafil (posaconazole) and Cancidas (caspofungin); &#160; &#183; Astellas, the manufacturer of Mycamine (micafungin) and the marketer of Cresemba (isavuconazonium); and &#160; &#183; Gilead, the manufacturer of AmBisome B (liposomal amphotericin B). &#160;

&#160;

There are also a number of smaller companies working to develop new drugs and other therapies for fungal infections that are undergoing clinical trials. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and price.

&#160; 

Competition for MAT2501 for the treatment of multi-drug resistant gram negative bacteria 

&#160;

We intend to develop MAT2501 as a broad spectrum, oral antibiotic for the treatment of multi-drug resistant infections, including both chronic and acute bacterial infections, such as nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) and multi-drug resistant gram-negative infections. If approved, MAT2501 would compete with a number of drugs currently in development, including Arikayce&#174;, an inhaled version of amikacin being developed by Insmed Incorporated for the treatment of NTM; plazomycin, which is being developed by Achaogen, Inc.; eravacycline, which is being developed by Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Brilacidin&#174;, being developed as a broad spectrum anti-bacterial by Cellceutix Corporation and Raptor Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which has recently announced it intends to pursue development of an inhaled version of the antibiotic levofloxacin for the treatment of NTM.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Manufacturing 

&#160;

We currently lease and operate limited in-house manufacturing capabilities for our product candidates, including MAT2203 and MAT2501. While sufficient to produce the clinical supplies of product necessary to conduct our ongoing clinical trials, these are short term arrangements and we currently do not have sufficient manufacturing facilities on a long term basis for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. If we are not able to retain our current manufacturing facilities and if we do not develop an in-house manufacturing capability for cochleates needed for our MAT2203 and MAT2501 product candidates sufficient to produce product for continued development and then commercialization of these products, we will need to develop relationships with third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our product candidates which is likely to be time consuming and expensive.

&#160;

There are a number of potential third party suppliers for amphotericin B and amikacin, the generic active pharmaceutical ingredients in our lead clinical stage product candidates &#8211; MAT2203 and MAT2501, respectively. Although to date we have not entered into supply agreements to secure sufficient supply of amphotericin B and amikacin to support our clinical programs for MAT2203 and MAT2501, we believe we will be able to secure supply of amphotericin B and amikacin to support our clinical programs for MAT2203 and MAT2501 from one or more third-party suppliers. As we move through development for each of our product candidates, we expect to enter into long term supply arrangements for these key active pharmaceutical ingredients.

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160;

We currently do not have any sales and marketing infrastructure. We plan to retain U.S. marketing and sales rights or co-promotion rights for our product candidates for which we receive marketing approvals, particularly in situations where it is possible to access the market through a focused, specialized sales force. For situations in which a large sales force is required to access the market, and with respect to markets outside the United States, we generally plan to commercialize our product candidates through collaborative arrangements with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.

&#160; 

Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 

&#160;

In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice, or DOJ, or other governmental entities.

&#160;

Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, in the case of biologic product candidates, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice, or cGLP, regulations; &#160; &#183; submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin; &#160;

&#160; - 17 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; &#160; &#183; performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with current good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; &#160; &#183; preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; &#160; &#183; review of the product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable; &#160; &#183; satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product&#8217;s identity, strength, quality and purity; &#160; &#183; payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA or BLA; and &#160; &#183; compliance with any post-approval requirements, including a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, and post-approval studies required by the FDA. &#160; 

Nonclinical Studies 

&#160;

Nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of nonclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND.

&#160;

Companies usually must complete some long-term nonclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

&#160; 

Human Clinical Trials in Support of a Regulatory Approval 

&#160;

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.

&#160;

In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.

&#160;

&#160; - 18 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA or IND so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki and/or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial.

&#160;

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:

&#160; 

Phase 1 : The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease (e.g. cancer) or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.

&#160; 

Phase 2 : The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.

&#160; 

Phase 3 : These clinical trials are commonly referred to as &#8220;pivotal&#8221; studies, which typically denotes a study which presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. In Phase 3 clinical trials, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.

&#160;

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB&#8217;s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.

&#160;

Submission of an NDA to the FDA 

&#160;

Regulatory approval for most new drug or biologic products is based on two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials that provide evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the nonclinical and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product&#8217;s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.3 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $114,000 per product and $585,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually.

&#160;

The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA&#8217;s receipt of the submission whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for &#8220;priority review&#8221; products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for various reasons, including for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.

&#160;

Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (such as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.

&#160;

The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.

&#160;

Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 

&#160;

The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.

&#160;

Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product&#8217;s NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDA&#8217;s time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.

&#160;

Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Improvement Act, or FDASIA. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as &#8220;breakthrough therapies.&#8221; A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.

&#160;

Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA&#8217;s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.

&#160;

Under Section 524 of the FDCA, the FDA is authorized to award a priority review voucher to sponsors of certain tropical disease product applications that meet the criteria specified in the Act. A priority review voucher may be used by the sponsor who obtains it or it may be transferred to another sponsor who may use it to obtain priority review for a different application. Priority review vouchers can result in the acceleration of review and approval of a product candidate by up to four months. In order to be eligible for a tropical disease priority review voucher, the application must be: for a listed tropical disease; submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA or Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act after September 27, 2007; for a product that contains no active ingredient that has been approved in any other application under those statutory provisions; and must qualify for priority review. The FDA has identified in guidance those product applications for the prevention or treatment of tropical diseases that may qualify for a priority review voucher.

&#160; 

&#160; - 21 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Accelerated Approval Pathway 

&#160;

The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.

&#160;

For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug.

&#160;

The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor&#8217;s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug&#8217;s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for product candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.

&#160; 

The FDA&#8217;s Decision on an NDA 

&#160;

On the basis of the FDA&#8217;s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA&#8217;s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

&#160;

If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug&#8217;s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events and whether the product is a new molecular entity. REMS can include medication guides, physician communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use, which may include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The FDA may require a REMS before approval or post-approval if it becomes aware of a serious risk associated with use of the product. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of a product.

&#160;

&#160; - 22 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.

&#160; 

Post-Approval Requirements 

&#160;

Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.

&#160;

In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.

&#160;

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls; &#160; &#183; fines, warning or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials; &#160; &#183; refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals; &#160; &#183; product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or &#160; &#183; injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. &#160;

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

&#160;

In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.

&#160;

&#160; 

Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 

&#160;

In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the nonclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD.

&#160;

Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is &#8220;bioequivalent&#8221; to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if &#8220;the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug.&#8221;

&#160;

Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is &#8220;therapeutically equivalent&#8221; to the RLD in its publication &#8220;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#8221; also referred to as the &#8220;Orange Book.&#8221; Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutically equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA&#8217;s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in automatic substitution of the generic drug by the pharmacist without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.

&#160;

Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication.

&#160; 

Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30 Month Stay 

&#160;

Upon approval of an NDA or a supplement thereto, NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant&#8217;s product or an approved method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant submits its application to the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval.

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that: &#160; &#183; the required patent information has not been filed; &#160; &#183; the listed patent has expired; &#160; &#183; the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or &#160; &#183; the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product. &#160;

A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product&#8217;s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.

&#160;

&#160; - 24 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.

&#160; 

Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 

&#160;

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans prior to the assessment data. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA&#8217;s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.

&#160;

The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA.

&#160;

Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA&#8217;s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application.

&#160; 

Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 

&#160;

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an &#8220;orphan drug&#8221; if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting a NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

&#160;

If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product will be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.

Other Health Care Regulations 

&#160; 

Health Privacy Laws 

&#160;

The Administrative Simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (&#8220;HITECH Act&#8221;), require health care plans, health care providers and health care clearinghouses, collectively defined under HIPAA as &#8220;Covered Entities,&#8221; to comply with standards for the use and disclosure of health information within such organizations and with third parties. These include standards for:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; Common health care transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures; &#160; &#183; Unique identifiers for providers, employers, health plans and individuals; and &#160; &#183; Security and privacy of health information. &#160;

Although the obligations of HIPAA only apply directly to Covered Entities, any Covered Entity that uses third parties (referred to in HIPAA as &#8220;Business Associates&#8221;) to perform functions on its behalf involving the creation or use of certain patient health information is required to have a contract with the Business Associate that limits the use and disclosure of such information by the Business Associate.

&#160; 

Fraud and Abuse Laws 

&#160;

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes and false claims statutes. The federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal prosecution, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor.

&#160;

Federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback statute and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.

&#160; 

Affordable Care Act 

&#160;

In late March 2010, the Federal government enacted the comprehensive health care reform package, the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Among other provisions, the ACA imposes individual and employer health insurance requirements, provides certain insurance subsidies (e.g., premiums and cost sharing), mandates extensive insurance market reforms, creates new health insurance access points (e.g., State and federal-based health insurance exchanges), expands the Medicaid program, promotes research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures, and makes a number of changes to how products and services will be reimbursed by the Medicare program. Amendments to the Federal False Claims Act under the ACA have made it easier for private parties to bring &#8220;qui tam&#8221; (whistleblower) lawsuits against companies, under which the whistleblower may be entitled to receive a percentage of any money paid to the government.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Designation of and Exclusivity for Qualified Infectious Disease Products 

&#160;

In 2012, Congress passed legislation known as the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or GAIN Act. This legislation is designed to encourage the development of antibacterial and antifungal drug products that treat pathogens that cause serious and life-threatening infections. To that end, the new law grants an additional five years of marketing exclusivity upon the approval of an NDA for a drug product designated by FDA as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP. Thus, for a QIDP, the periods of five year new chemical entity exclusivity, three year new clinical investigation exclusivity and seven year orphan drug exclusivity, would become 10 years, eight years, and 12 years, respectively.

&#160;

A QIDP is defined in the GAIN Act to mean &#8220;an antibacterial or antifungal drug for human use intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections, including those caused by&#8212;(1) an antibacterial or antifungal resistant pathogen, including novel or emerging infectious pathogens;&#8221; or (2) certain &#8220;qualifying pathogens.&#8221; A &#8220;qualifying pathogen&#8221; is a pathogen that has the potential to pose a serious threat to public health (e.g., resistant gram positive pathogens, multi-drug resistant gram negative bacteria, multi-drug resistant tuberculosis and Clostridium difficile ) and that is included in a list established and maintained by the FDA. A drug sponsor may request the FDA to designate its product as a QIDP any time before the submission of an NDA. The FDA must make a QIDP determination within 60 days of the designation request. A product designated as a QIDP will be granted priority review by the FDA and can qualify for &#8220;fast track&#8221; status.

&#160;

The additional five years of market exclusivity under the GAIN Act for drug products designated by the FDA as QIDPs applies only to a drug that is first approved on or after July 9, 2012. Additionally, the five-year exclusivity extension does not apply to: a supplement to an application under Section 505(b) of the FDCA for any QIDP for which an extension is in effect or has expired; a subsequent application submitted with respect to a product approved by the FDA for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength; or a product that does not meet the definition of a QIDP under Section 505(g) based upon its approved uses.

&#160; 

Patent Term Restoration and Extension 

&#160;

A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and the ultimate approval date. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product&#8217;s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. A patent that covers multiple drugs for which approval is sought can only be extended in connection with one of the approvals. The USPTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.

&#160; 

Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union 

&#160;

In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.

&#160;

&#160; - 27 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.

&#160;

To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.

&#160;

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.

&#160;

Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing marketing authorization. Under the centralized procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.

&#160;

The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 210 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state&#8217;s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.

&#160;

If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 

&#160;

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results.

&#160;

&#160; - 28 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor&#8217;s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.

&#160;

In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.

&#160; 

Healthcare Law and Regulation 

&#160;

Healthcare providers, physicians and third party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid; &#160; &#183; the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government; &#160; &#183; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; &#160; &#183; HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; &#160;

&#160; - 29 - &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#183; the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; &#160; &#183; the federal transparency requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requires manufacturers of drugs to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests and the reported information will be made publicly available on a searchable website; and &#160; &#183; analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers. &#160;

Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry&#8217;s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Corporate and Available Information 

&#160;

We were incorporated in Delaware under the name Matinas BioPharma Holdings, Inc. in May 2013. We have two operating subsidiaries: Matinas BioPharma, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Aquarius Biotechnologies Inc., a Delaware corporation. Nereus BioPharma LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (and Matinas BioPharma&#8217;s predecessor) was formed on August 12, 2011. On February 29, 2012, Nereus BioPharma LLC converted from a limited liability company to a corporation and changed its name to Matinas BioPharma, Inc. In July 2013, Matinas BioPharma, Inc. entered into entered into a merger agreement (the &#8220;2013 Merger Agreement&#8221;) with Matinas Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub. Pursuant to the terms of the 2013 Merger Agreement, as a condition of and contemporaneously with the initial closing of the 2013 Private Placement, Merger Sub merged (the &#8220;2013 Merger&#8221;) with and into Matinas BioPharma and Matinas BioPharma became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. After consummation of the Merger transaction, the management of Matinas BioPharma became the management of Holdings and the board representatives consisted of four former Board members of Matinas BioPharma and Mr. Adam Stern as the Aegis Capital Corp. nominee. Because Holdings was formed solely to effect the 2013 Merger and the 2013 Private Placement, with no operations, and assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents, we accounted for the 2013 Merger as a reverse acquisition. The legal acquirer Matinas BioPharma becomes the successor entity, and its historical results became the historical results for Holdings (the legal acquirer and the registrant). On January 29, 2015, we acquired Aquarius Biotechnologies Inc.
