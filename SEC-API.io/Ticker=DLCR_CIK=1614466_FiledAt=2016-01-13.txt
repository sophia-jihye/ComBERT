 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. &#160; Kibush Capital Corporation ("we", "us", "our", the "Company" or the "Registrant") is a mineral and natural resources exploration company. We are currently undertaking mineral exploration activities in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Our business is comprised two subsidiaries Aqua Mining and Angel Jade. Our Aqua Mining subsidiary is active in mineral exploration in Papua New Guinea where we are exploring for gold. Our Angel Jade subsidiary is active in mineral exploration in New South Wales, Australia where we are exploring for jade. In addition, on June 12, 2015, the Company has taken over management of Paradise Gardens (PNG) Ltd., a timber logging and processing company in Papua New Guinea. 

&#160;

We are an exploration stage company as defined by the Security and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Industry Guide 7 as the Company has no established reserves as required under the Industry Guide 7. 

&#160;

History 

&#160;

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 5, 2005 under the name Premier Platform Holding Company, Inc. The Company changed its name to Paolo Nevada Enterprises, Inc. on February 4, 2005. On August 18, 2006, the Company completed a merger with Premier Platform Holding Company, Inc., a Colorado corporation, where Paolo Nevada Enterprises, Inc. was the surviving entity. On November 1, 2006, the Company changed its name to the David Loren Corporation. On July 5, 2013, More Superannuation Fund, an Australian entity ("More"), obtained control of the Company from Beachwood Capital, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company. On August 23, 2013, the Company changed its name to Kibush Capital Corporation. 

&#160;

On October 15, 2013, the Company completed the acquisition of 80% of the common stock of Instacash Pty Ltd., a micro-lender licensed in Australia ("Instacash"). For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, Instacash had no revenues, $396,493 in assets and $429,270 in liabilities. In order to focus solely on its mining investments, the Company disposed of Instacash during the quarter ended March 31, 2015. 

&#160;

On March 23, 2015, the Company increased its ownership in Aqua Mining Limited, a Papua New Guinea limited company ("Aqua Mining") from 49% to 90% in exchange for assignment of the Company's entire interest in the Koranga Joint Venture to Aqua Mining. Due to the increase in ownership and due to the fact that the additional interest in Aqua Mining was acquired from a related party we changed the ament accounting treatment for this asset and are now consolidating its financials with our own. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, Aqua Mining had no revenues, $18,565 in assets and $91,872 in liabilities. For the interim period ended March 31, 2015, Aqua Mining had no revenues, $46,755 in assets and $215,003 in liabilities. 

&#160;

The Company acquired control of Angel Jade Pty Ltd., an Australian limited company ("Angel Jade") through a series of transactions as follows: In October 2014, the Company negotiated the acquisition of a 50% interest in Angel Jade (which was 90,000,000 shares of common stock) from Five Arrows Limited in exchange for 14,000,000 shares of our common stock. However, this agreement was not formalized until December 10, 2014. On October 9, 2014, the Company acquired 3,673,470 shares of newly issued common stock of Angel Jade in exchange for $17,170 ($19,584 AUD). These two transactions combined were intended to provided Kibush Capital with exactly 51% of the common stock of Angel Jade and control of the that company. On November 6, 2014, the Company further increased its ownership of Angel Jade by purchasing an additional 45,918,300 shares of common stock directly from Angel Jade for $215,994 ($250,000 AUD) and by purchasing 18,367,350 share of common stock from Laima Trust for $86,398 ($100,000 AUD). Several minority shareholders have disputed the issuance of additional shares to the Company. See Item 3 for more detail. We now own approximately 69% share of the issued and outstanding shares of Angel Jade's common stock which totals 229,591,770 shares. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, Angel Jade had no revenues, $13,906 in assets and no liabilities. For the interim period ended March 31, 2015, Angel Jade had no revenues, $179,075 in assets and $397 in liabilities. Angel Jade's financials are consolidated with our own financials in this report. 

&#160;

The Company is an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ("JOBS Act"). 

&#160;

Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated any significant revenues from our current business. In addition, we have sustained losses for the past two years and have a negative working capital at September 30, 2015. We must raise cash from sources other than operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in our company. We must raise cash to continue our mining exploration activities and business development.

Our Business 

&#160;

Our business is comprised of mining exploration activities through our subsidiaries Aqua Mining and Angel Jade. Our primary office is located at 7 Sarah Crescent, Templestowe, Victoria 3106, Australia. The company is an exploration stage company and there is no assurance that a commercially viable mineral deposit exists on any of our properties. Further exploration will be required before a final evaluation as to the economic and legal feasibility is determined. 

&#160;

On February 14, 2014, we entered into an Assignment and Bill of Sale with Five Arrows Limited ("Five Arrows") pursuant to which Five Arrows agreed to assign to the Company all of its right, title and interest in two 50 ton per hour trammels, one 35 ton excavator, a warehouse/office, a concrete processing apron and four 35 ton per hour particle concentrators which may be utilized for alluvial mining, the assignment also conveyed Five Arrow's interest in a joint venture with the holders of mining leases ("Leaseholders") for gold exploration in Papua New Guinea, specifically Mining Leases ML296-301 and ML278 covering approximately 26 hectares located at Koranga in Wau, Morobe Province, Papua, New Guinea (the "Koranga Property"). In consideration therefor, the Company issued 40,000,000 shares of its common stock to Five Arrows. On February 28, 2014, we entered into a joint venture agreement with the Leaseholders (the "Joint Venture Agreement") for the exploration of minerals on the Koranga Property. The Joint Venture Agreement entitles the leaseholders to 30% and the Company to 70% of net profits from the joint venture. On May 23 rd 2015 this Joint Venture was sold to our subsidiary Aqua Mining (PNG) Ltd. Aqua Mining will manage and carry out the exploration at the site, including entering into contracts with third parties and subcontractors (giving priority to the Leaseholders and their relatives and the local community for employment opportunities and spin-off business) at its cost, and all assets, including equipment and structures built on the site, will be the property of the Company. The Leaseholders and Aqua Mining will each contribute 1% from their share of net profits to a trust account for landowner and government requirements. For the period ending September 30, 2014 we have incurred expenditure of $208,512 primarily spent on exploration. From October through to December there has been an expenditure of $56,526 on capital equipment and further exploration costs. 

&#160;

The joint venture involves a lease that, between 2008 and 2011, has produced a total of 55,300 cubic meters of mined material which was processed to extract 51,000 grams of gold - raw weight (approximately 31kg pure gold) over the three years of mining activities. Gold production in 2010 averaged 1.97kg per month and in 2011 averaged 2.26kg per month. The overall raw gold grade is 0.92g per cubic meter. Pure gold grade is 0.55g per cubic meter. The Company is currently in the exploration stage for this lease. If and when successful, the Company may endeavor to undertake additional joint ventures on neighboring leaseholds (8 leaseholds border the area) to capitalize on the infrastructure and equipment we may install at Koranga. 

&#160;

We entered into a memorandum of understanding, dated May 1, 2014 with New Guinea Gold Corporation, for the purchase of New Guinea Gold Ltd., which was terminated by us on May 24, 2014 prior to commencing any transactions contemplated in connection therewith. The Company has no continuing obligations as a result of such termination. 

&#160;

Aqua Mining 

&#160;

Aqua Mining is currently in the exploration stage. Aqua Mining was created to undertake certain opportunities that exist within the mining sector of the economy of Papua New Guinea. The Director Mr. Vincent Appo, has extensive experience and knowledge in this sector and has over the years assembled a vast network of contacts and contractors that will assist the company in their managerial and operational endeavors. From the outset the company is negotiating over 2 mine sites for further exploration. 

&#160;

Aqua Mining in the past six months has negotiated and finalized with landowners in the WAU area of PNG, Joint Ventures to conduct mineral exploration activities. These Joint Venture Agreements will form the basis of applications to the Mining Resource Authority in PNG for Mining Licenses. In addition, Aqua Mining has been accepted as a developer of AML 694-695. 

&#160;

On or about April 8, 2015, the Company commenced exploration of the Alluvial Mining Lease 694/695 via its Subsidiary Aqua Mining PNG Limited. Mr. Vincent Appo, PNG Operations Manager, is overseeing the construction of the required infrastructure which is required for the Company's exploration activities. 

&#160;

On or about April 16, 2015, the Company announced commencement of a Jorc/43-101 report on the Mining Lease 694/695 and pending Mining Lease 296/301 held by its subsidiary, Aqua Mining PNG Limited. 

&#160;

Ken Unamba, a member of the Advisory Committee has been nominated to oversee this report. Vincent Appo, PNG Operations Manager, has undertaken substantial testing over the past 12 months on both areas and has enough data as a basis for assessment and review. Mr. Unamba will undertake additional surveys and sampling where necessary to provide further data to finalize the report to Kibush Capital. 

&#160;

Angel Jade 

&#160;

The Company owns 70% of the ordinary shares of Angel Jade Pty Ltd, an Australian company. The assets of Angel Jade are comprised of Exploration License 8104, the area covered is 35 km SE of Tamworth, 300 sq. km in size, 250 km from the port of Newcastle, NSW and accessible by sealed road. Nephrite jade occurs in the New England Fold Belt, which extends from northeast New South Wales into southeast Queensland. The target mineral in this tenement is jade, but we will also explore for rhodonite. 

&#160;

&#160; 5 

&#160; &#160;

Angel Jade has identified a 3 tiered exploitation of jade. The First Tier, finely ground lower quality jade to nano particle sized powder, enabling the jade to release infra-red radiation. These particles can be added to paint, ceramic tiles and to cotton for use in fabrics. The Second Tier, exclusive works of art created by the renowned artist Xie Shen. These carved pieces are typically between 0.5 and 2 tons each, and would be showcased at major Asian Art Galleries. The Third Tier is to establish a premium high end Jade Brand for jewelry and art, to be sold and marketed through respected gallery and jewelry outlets. The current price of jade per kilogram has a spread of $5 to $50 depending on the grade. 

&#160;

Paradise Gardens Development 

&#160;

Kibush Capital Corporation had entered into a management agreement with Paradise Gardens Development (PNG) Ltd, a Timber Logging and Processing Company with operations in Papua New Guinea ("Paradise Gardens"). The Company has the right to Paradise Gardens operates a Timber Authority registered with the PNG Forest Authority which permits an annual timber harvest of 5000 cubic meters, the total area under the Timber Authority is 3300 hectares. Predominant species include Terminalia, Aglaia, White Cheesewood, Pink Satinwood, Erima, Taun, Rosewood, Kwila and other hardwoods. Paradise Gardens primarily sells its timber locally to retailers and wholesalers in Papua New Guinea. The Company is in negotiations with the owner of Paradise Gardens to acquire control of Paradise Gardens. During the negotiation period, the Company's management fee includes the profit earned by Paradise Gardens during such period. 

&#160;

The Market 

&#160;

Angel Jade 

&#160;

Nephrite jade is not a common mineral and occurs in nature very rarely and usually in remote locations, hence its prized status and value. It is currently mined in New Zealand, Pakistan, Canada, Russia and Australia. Climatic concerns limit the amount of mining that can be done in Canada and Russia and political extremism is a threat in Pakistan. New Zealand nephrite whilst generally high grade only occurs under the southern alps and glaciers and is usually only of the green variety and found in isolated small pods in small quantities. 

&#160;

In Australia, nephrite occurs in South Australia near Cowell, in Western Australia near Ninghan in the Murchison region outside of Perth and in New South Wales at the Angel Jade tenements near Tamworth. The Cowell and Ninghan nephrite deposits consist of 'black' nephrite mainly and are generally lower grade with small quantities of high-grade commercial saleable material. 

&#160;

The Angel Jade Tamworth occurrences are extensive, ranging along the great NS serpentinite belt of NSW that runs for over 200kms. The nephrite found there ranges in quality and varietal characteristics from classic imperial green, through to blue, black and the much prized 'mutton fat' coloration. Angel Jade is better placed than its competitors to be able to successfully continually supply quality and quantity of material to its selected markets. 

&#160;

Aqua Mining 

&#160;

The primary product is Gold and our market price based on the London Metals Exchange Daily Rate. This rate determines a market price for all material sold within the Refinery Market. Outside of that market competition dictates the price available, and that competition has effectively no difference in the quality of the material as it based on a gold percentage. A higher price can be obtained by selling to the spot traders who can distribute the material at lower volumes to industry consumers. 

&#160;

Marketing and Distribution : 

&#160;

Angel Jade 

&#160;

A four pronged distribution approach for our nephrite (jade) has been developed that target: wholesale building suppliers through industry groups and trade shows, wholesale jewelry suppliers in China and SE Asia, direct marketing to the high end art market in China and the Middle East via brokers and producing material suitable for high tech industrial usage such as substrates and insulators through an industry based online campaign targeting research universities, R&#38;D facilities and allied scientific suppliers. 

&#160;

Aqua Mining 

&#160;

As the principal material is gold, the options are to sell either to a refinery and be paid the daily spot rate, or to sell to the jewelry wholesale market. Both of these options exist internally within PNG however the wholesale market is quite small. There are several options when the material is exported from PNG, again it could be to any refinery within the region and that rate again would be the daily spot rate. The wholesale market outside the country would be significant and there are many opportunities within Australia to sell at a higher than spot rate to that market. There may also be parties that would take up the material on a contractual basis. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The mining industry is acutely competitive in all of its phases. We face strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of exploration stage properties or properties containing gold, jade and other mineral reserves. Many of these companies have greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities than us. It is our goal to find under valued properties and team up with local joint venture partners to streamline our time to market and costs. In PNG in particular we are finding a number of such properties, as the enforcement of the Mining Act has forced traditional landowners to comply with the relevant requirements of the act. Their ability to do so is limited as they do not have the financial, or management resources to comply. 

&#160;

Raw Materials, Principal Suppliers and Customers 

&#160;

Angel Jade 

&#160;

We are not dependent on any principal suppliers and our raw materials are produced principally through our own mining activities. Our principal customers for our mining activities are wholesale markers in China, SE Asia and the Middle East. A customer base is yet to be established but that will occur over the next 12 months. 

&#160;

Aqua Mining 

&#160;

We are not dependent on any principal suppliers and our raw materials are produced principally through our own mining activities. Our principal customers for our mining activities are Refineries based in PNG. A wholesale customer base is yet to be established but that will occur over the next 12 months, after the company received the appropriate export licenses from the PNG government. 

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

Intellectual property is not a large part of our current business model as we are selling non-unique materials through primarily conventional channels. One or more brands may yet be developed if we determine branding will benefit the Company. 

&#160;

Government Regulations 

&#160;

Our products and services are subject to foreign, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations concerning business activities in general, including the laws of Papua New Guinea and Australia. 

&#160;

Our operations will be affected from time to time in varying degrees by domestic and foreign political developments, foreign, federal and state laws. 

&#160;

Angel Jade 

&#160;

The mining industry in Australia is governed by Federal Government law but administered by the States. Angel Jade tenements are administered and regulated by the NSW Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Its principal field office for the mining sector is located in Maitland, approximately 250 kilometers from Tamworth. To maintain the company's tenements in good order and standing with the DTI, an Annual Report must be lodged every year detailing all works to date and monies expended toward same. An environmental bond is also held by the DTI to ensure compliance and remediation on vacation of the tenement. 

&#160;

Angel Jade currently holds an Exploration License, EL8104, which requires renewal every two years. Current date of renewal is June 30, 2015. Renewal is usually only withheld where there have been serious compliance issues. During the course of the exploration program, the company may elect to apply for one or more mining leases within the boundaries of its EL. This would be subject to satisfactory interpretation of geological data suggesting a commercial mining would be viable and could be established with some certainty. 

&#160;

Aqua Mining 

&#160;

As the 90% owner of Aqua Mining [PNG] Limited, a Papua, New Guinea company, we are required to obtain approval from the Investment Promotion Authority of Papua New Guinea to be recognized as a foreign investor for our mineral exploration joint venture with the Leaseholders of approximately 26 hectares located at Koranga in Wau, Morobe Province, Papua, New Guinea. 

&#160;

&#160; 7 

&#160; &#160;

On July 24, 2015, we received final approval from the Papua New Guinea Department of Environment and Conservation, the Papua New Guinea Mining Resources Authority and the Mining Advisory Committee. This approval allows for mechanized processing on on land controlled by the Koranga Joint Venture for a period of 20 years and Aqua Mining is the licensed contract miner for a period of 5 years. This AML license is limited to 50,000 tones of processing per year and to a maximum of 5-hectares of mining at any one time. We must report our exploration activities and sales monthly to the Mining Resource Authority and comply with the terms of the agreements with the landowners. The tribute agreement for this land requires contribution of 2% of gross sales over 3 grams of ton and 2% of gross sales when under 5 grams per ton. 

&#160;

Environmental Regulations : 

&#160;

Angel Jade 

&#160;

Environmental issues and compliance are administered by the NSW EPA. The proposed mining activity and processing by Angel Jade will not involve the use of any chemicals, hence the key areas of concern to the EPA will be in the areas of soil erosion, flora and fauna, water monitoring and effective remediation. The EPA can issue non compliance notices that in the case of serious breaches may jeopardize the tenement's standing. However, this is considered a low risk for this style of mining where no chemicals are utilized and the mining activity is near surface . 

&#160;

Aqua Mining 

&#160;

Under our Alluvial Mining Lease, we must comply with the provisions of the Mining Act pertaining to Environmental requirements. We are subject to applicable environmental legislation including specific site conditions attached to the mining tenements imposed by the PNG Government Department of Environment and Conservation ("DEC"), the terms and conditions of operating licenses issued by the PNG Mineral Resources Authority ("MRA") and DEC, and the environment permits for water extraction and waste discharge issued by DEC. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the PNG Parliament approved a name change for the Department of Environment and Conservation to the Conservation Environment Protection Authority and that change has become effective. 

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

As of January 10, 2015, the Company has 42 full time employees.
