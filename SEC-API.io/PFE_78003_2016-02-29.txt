 ITEM 1. 

BUSINESS 

GENERAL 

Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development and manufacture of healthcare products. Our global portfolio includes medicines, vaccines and medical devices, as well as many of the world&#8217;s best-known consumer healthcare products. We work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. We collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. Our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and, to a much lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered by other companies. The majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 2, 1942. 

On November 23, 2015, we announced that we have entered into a definitive merger agreement with Allergan, a global pharmaceutical company incorporated in Ireland, under which we have agreed to combine with Allergan in a stock transaction valued at $363.63 per Allergan share, for a total enterprise value of approximately $160 billion, based on the closing price of Pfizer common stock of $32.18 on November 20, 2015 (the last trading day prior to the announcement) and certain other assumptions. Allergan shareholders will receive 11.3 shares of the combined company for each of their Allergan shares by virtue of a share split, and Pfizer shareholders will have the option of receiving one share of the combined company for each of their Pfizer shares or receiving cash instead of shares of the combined company for some or all of their Pfizer shares, provided that the aggregate amount of cash to be paid in the merger will not be less than $6 billion or greater than $12 billion. In the event that elections to receive cash and shares in the merger would otherwise result in an aggregate of less than $6 billion or greater than $12 billion of cash being paid out in the merger, then the share elections and cash elections will be subject to proration. The completion of the transaction, which is expected in the second half of 2016, is subject to certain conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval in certain jurisdictions, including the U.S. and EU, the receipt of necessary approvals from both Pfizer and Allergan shareholders, and the completion of Allergan&#8217;s pending divestiture of its generics business to Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. Subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement, the businesses of Pfizer and Allergan will be combined under a single company and Pfizer would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allergan, which is organized under the laws of Ireland and which, subject to the approval by Allergan shareholders, will be renamed &#8220;Pfizer plc.&#8221; For further discussion on the pending Allergan combination, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook &#8212; Our Business section in our 2015 Financial Report . 

On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira, a leading provider of sterile injectable drugs and infusion technologies as well as a provider of biosimilars, for approximately $16.1 billion &#32;in cash ( $15.7 billion , net of cash acquired). Hospira is now a subsidiary of Pfizer. The combination of local Pfizer and Hospira entities may be pending in various jurisdictions and integration is subject to completion of various local legal and regulatory steps. For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212; Note 2A. Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements, Collaborative Arrangements, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment : Acquisitions &#32;in our 2015 Financial Report. 

On June 24, 2013, we completed the full disposition of our Animal Health business. For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212; Note 2D. Acquisitions, Licensing Agreements, Collaborative Arrangements, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Cost-Method Investment : Divestitures &#32;in our 2015 &#32;Financial Report. &#32; 

For a further discussion of our strategy and our business development initiatives, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook &#8212; Our Strategy and &#8212; Our Business Development Initiatives &#32;sections in our 2015 &#32;Financial Report. 

Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., the principal authority regulating our operations is the FDA. The FDA regulates the safety and efficacy of the products we offer and our research, quality, manufacturing processes, product promotion, advertising and product labeling. Similar regulations exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates our prices. In the EU, the EMA regulates the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of our products, and employs a centralized procedure for approval of drugs for the EU and EEA countries. In Japan, the PMDA is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety. Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority, such as the FDA or EMA, before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. For additional information, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints &#32;below.

COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS 

We manage our commercial operations through two distinct businesses: an Innovative Products business and an Established Products business. The Innovative Products business is composed of two operating segments, each of which has been led by a single manager in 2015 and 2014 &#8211;&#8211; the Global Innovative Pharmaceutical segment and the Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare segment. Effective February 8, 2016, the Innovative Products business is led by a single manager. The Established Products business consists of the Global Established Pharmaceutical segment, which is also led by a single manager. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities and for certain IPR&#38;D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products that generally have achieved proof of concept. Each business has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. 

Some additional information about each business and operating segment follows: 

Innovative Products Business 

&#160; 

Established Products Business 

Global Innovative Pharmaceutical segment: 

GIP focuses on developing and commercializing novel, value-creating medicines that significantly improve patients&#8217; lives. Key therapeutic areas include inflammation/immunology, cardiovascular/metabolic, neuroscience/pain and rare diseases and include leading brands, such as Xeljanz , Eliquis , Lyrica &#160;(U.S. and Japan), Enbrel &#160;(outside the U.S. and Canada) and Viagra &#160;(U.S. and Canada). 

Global Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare segment: 

VOC focuses on the development and commercialization of vaccines and products for oncology and consumer healthcare. Consumer Healthcare manufactures and markets several well-known, over-the-counter (OTC) products. Each of the three businesses in VOC operates as a separate, global business, with distinct specialization in terms of the science and market approach necessary to deliver value to consumers and patients. 

&#160; 

Global Established Pharmaceutical segment: 

GEP includes legacy brands that have lost or will soon lose market exclusivity in both developed and emerging markets, branded generics, generic sterile injectable products, biosimilars and infusion systems. 

We expect that the GIP and VOC biopharmaceutical portfolios of innovative, largely patent-protected, in-line and newly launched products will be sustained by ongoing investments to develop promising assets and targeted business development in areas of focus to ensure a pipeline of highly-differentiated product candidates in areas of unmet medical need. The assets managed by these groups are science-driven, highly differentiated and generally require a high level of engagement with healthcare providers and consumers. 

GEP is expected to generate strong consistent cash flow by providing patients around the world with access to effective, lower-cost, high-value treatments. GEP leverages our biologic development, regulatory and manufacturing expertise to seek to advance its biosimilar development portfolio. Additionally, GEP leverages capabilities in formulation development and manufacturing expertise to help advance its generic sterile injectables portfolio. In addition, GEP may also engage in targeted business development to further enable its commercial strategies. GEP has the knowledge and resources within R&#38;D to develop small molecules, including injectables, and biosimilars. On September 3, 2015, we acquired Hospira, and its commercial operations are now included within GEP. 

For a further discussion of these operating segments, see the Innovative Products and Established Products &#32;sections below and &#32; the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212; Note 18. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information , including the tables therein captioned Selected Income Statement Information , &#32;Geographic Information and Significant Product Revenues , the table captioned Revenues by Segment and Geographic Area in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income &#32;section, and the Analysis of Operating Segment Information &#32;section in our 2015 &#32;Financial Report, which are incorporated by reference. 

In addition, other business activities within Pfizer include Pfizer CentreSource, our contract manufacturing and bulk pharmaceutical chemical sales operation, which in 2015 includes revenues related to our manufacturing and supply agreements with Zoetis Inc. 

Following the closing of the pending combination with Allergan, the Vaccines and Oncology businesses are expected to be combined with the Global Innovative Pharmaceutical business and we expect to create a new global business, Global Specialty and Consumer Brands, that includes our Consumer Healthcare business and Allergan&#8217;s ophthalmology and aesthetics businesses, as well as Botox Therapeutic and Cosmetic. Allergan&#8217;s Anda distribution capabilities and brands in women&#8217;s health and anti-infectives are expected to be combined with the Global Established Pharmaceutical business.

ALLIANCE REVENUES 

We are party to collaboration and/or co-promotion agreements relating to certain biopharmaceutical products, such as Enbrel (in the U.S. and Canada), Spiriva &#32;and Rebif , each of which has expired or will expire in 2016 in certain markets. In addition, Eliquis &#32;was developed and is being commercialized in collaboration with BMS. In April 2015, we signed an agreement with BMS to transfer full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets to us, beginning in the third quarter of 2015. For additional information, including a description of certain of these collaboration and co-promotion agreements and their expiration dates, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income &#8211;&#8211; Revenues &#8211;&#8211; Selected Product Descriptions &#32;and the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook &#8211;&#8211; Our Operating Environment &#8211;&#8211; Industry-Specific Challenges &#8211;&#8211; Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights sections in our 2015 Financial Report and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8211;&#8211; Dependence on Key In-Line Products below. 

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 

Innovation by our R&#38;D organization is very important to our success. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative products that address major unmet medical needs. 

We conduct R&#38;D internally and also through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms. Our WRD organization is generally responsible for research projects until proof-of-concept is achieved and then for transitioning those projects to the appropriate business unit for possible clinical and commercial development. The WRD organization also has responsibility for certain science-based and other platform-services organizations, which provide technical expertise and other services to the various R&#38;D projects. WRD is also responsible for facilitating all regulatory submissions and interactions with regulatory agencies, including all safety-event activities. 

Pfizer Inc. &#32; | &#32;2015 Form 10-K | &#32; 6 

Our R&#38;D primarily focuses on six high-priority areas that have a mix of small molecules and large molecules&#8212;immunology and inflammation; cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; oncology; vaccines; neuroscience and pain; and rare diseases. Another area of focus is biosimilars. With the acquisition of Hospira, we have expanded our biosimilars pipeline and added R&#38;D capabilities for sterile injectables and infusion systems. 

We also seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines, by entering into collaborations and alliance and license agreements with other companies, as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity- or debt-based investments. These agreements enable us to co-develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies or capabilities. Collaboration, alliance and license agreements and equity- or debt-based investments allow us to share risk and cost, to access external scientific and technological expertise, and enable us to advance our own products as well as in-licensed or acquired products. 

Drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. According to the Pharmaceutical Benchmarking Forum, out of 20 compounds entering preclinical development, only one is approved by a regulatory authority in a major market (U.S., the EU or Japan). The process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research. 

As of February 2, 2016, we had the following number of projects in various stages of R&#38;D: 

Development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While these new candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval, new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&#38;D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness, enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications for them. 

Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing products, is set forth in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income&#8212;Product Developments &#8212; Biopharmaceutical &#32;section in our 2015 &#32;Financial Report, which is incorporated by reference. 

Our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to R&#38;D. We also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates. The extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&#38;D expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration. For additional information, see the Competition &#32;and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Competitive Products &#32;sections below. 

We continue to strengthen our global R&#38;D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&#38;D to achieve a sustainable pipeline that will deliver value in the near term and over time. Our R&#38;D priorities include delivering a pipeline of differentiated therapies with the greatest scientific and commercial promise, innovating new capabilities that can position Pfizer for long-term leadership and creating new models for biomedical collaboration that will expedite the pace of innovation and productivity. 

For additional information regarding our R&#38;D operations, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook&#8212;Our Strategy&#8212;Research Operations and &#32;Costs and Expenses&#8212;Research and Development (R&#38;D) Expenses &#8212; Description of Research and Development Operations sections in our 2015 &#32;Financial Report.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS 

We have significant operations outside the U.S. Since 2014, operations in developed and emerging markets have been managed through our three operating segments: GIP, GEP and VOC. Emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets. 

Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $27.1 billion &#32;accounted for 56% &#32;of our total revenues in 2015 . Japan is our largest national market outside the U.S. For a geographic breakdown of revenues, see the table captioned Geographic Information &#32;in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212; Note 18. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information &#32;in our 2015 &#32;Financial Report, and the table captioned Revenues by Segment and Geographic Area &#32;in our 2015 &#32;Financial Report. Those tables are incorporated by reference. 

Revenues by National Market 

Our international operations are subject, in varying degrees, to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries. These include, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange control regulations, expropriation and other restrictive government actions. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Affecting International Operations &#32;below. Our international businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints, including laws and regulations on pricing, reimbursement, and access to our products. See Government Regulation and Price Constraints &#8212; Outside the United States &#32;below for a discussion of these matters. 

Depending on the direction of change relative to the U.S. dollar, foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. While we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us, we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments, depending upon market conditions. For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212; Note 7E. Financial Instruments: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities &#32;in our 2015 &#32;Financial Report, as well as the &#32;Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results &#8212; Financial Risk Management &#32;section in our 2015 &#32;Financial Report. Those sections of our 2015 &#32;Financial Report are incorporated by reference. 

MARKETING 

In our global biopharmaceutical businesses, we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients. Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists; MCOs that provide insurance coverage, such as hospitals, Integrated Delivery Systems, PBMs and health plans; and employers and government agencies who hire MCOs to provide health benefits to their employees. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that communicates the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues, and our patient assistance programs. For our infusion systems business, we promote directly to nurses, physicians, pharmacists, biomedical engineers, and their respective representatives. 

Pfizer Inc. &#32; | &#32;2015 Form 10-K | &#32; 8 

Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies, and, in the case of our vaccines products in the U.S., we primarily sell directly to individual provider offices, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and wholesalers. We seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and MCO formularies, which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the MCOs. MCOs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary products, to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions. We also work with MCOs to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines. 

In 2015, our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 34% of our total revenues (and 74% of our total U.S. revenues).

Major Biopharmaceutical Wholesalers and Other Customers 

Our global Consumer Healthcare business uses its own sales and marketing organizations to promote its products, and occasionally uses distributors in smaller markets. The advertising and promotions for our Consumer Healthcare business are generally disseminated to consumers through television, print, digital and other media advertising, as well as through in-store promotion. Consumer Healthcare products are sold through a wide variety of channels, including distributors, pharmacies, retail chains and grocery and convenience stores. Our Consumer Healthcare business generates a significant portion of its sales from several large customers, the loss of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the Consumer Healthcare business. 

PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 

Our products are sold around the world under brand-name, logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to Pfizer. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms. 

We own or license a number of U.S. and foreign patents. These patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses, pharmaceutical formulations, product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing. 

Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Further, patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product. For additional information, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints &#8212; Intellectual Property &#32;below. 

In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the U.S. and most other countries. Based on current product sales, and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole, together with the year in which the basic product patent expires (including, where applicable, the additional six-month pediatric exclusivity period and/or the granted patent term extension), are those for the medicines set forth in the table below. Patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below, unless they have been granted by the issuing authority. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions, to methods of manufacturing, or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. However, in some cases, such patents may not protect our drug from generic or, as applicable, biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.

In addition to the basic product patent covering Viagra , which expired in 2012, Viagra &#32;is covered by a U.S. method-of-treatment patent which, including the six-month pediatric exclusivity period associated with Revatio (which has the same active ingredient as Viagra ), expires in 2020. However, as a result of a patent litigation settlement, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. will be allowed to launch a generic version of Viagra &#32;in the U.S. in December 2017, or earlier under certain circumstances. The corresponding method-of-treatment patent covering Viagra &#32;in Japan expired in May 2014.

A number of our current products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years. For additional information, including a description of certain of our co-promotion agreements and their expiration dates, and a further discussion of our products experiencing, or expected to experience in 2016, patent expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., Europe or Japan, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook &#8212; Our Operating Environment &#8212; Industry-Specific Challenges &#8212; Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights section in our 2015 Financial Report and Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Dependence on Key In-Line Products below. 

Companies have filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of products that we believe infringe our patents covering, among other products, Sutent , EpiPen , Toviaz , &#32;Tygacil &#32;extended-release capsules and Precedex Premix . &#32; For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212; Note 17A1.

The expiration of a basic product patent or loss of patent protection resulting from a legal challenge normally results in significant competition from generic products against the originally patented product and can result in a significant reduction in revenues for that product in a very short period of time. In some cases, however, we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets; patents on uses for products; patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients; patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms; and conversion of the active ingredient to OTC products.

Biotechnology Products 

Our biotechnology products, including BeneFIX , ReFacto , Xyntha &#32;and Enbrel &#32;(we market Enbrel &#32;outside the U.S. and Canada), may face competition in the future from biosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). In the U.S., such biosimilars would reference biotechnology products approved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act. Additionally, the FDA has approved a follow-on recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product, Genotropin , which was approved under the FFDCA. 

Biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and to have no clinically meaningful differences. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to biologic medicines. Abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage in 2010 of the ACA, a framework for such approval exists in the U.S. The regulatory implementation of these ACA provisions is ongoing, and the FDA has issued draft guidance on subjects such as nonproprietary naming of biologic products and reference product exclusivity, and final guidance on a number of subjects such as scientific considerations in demonstrating biosimilarity. Moreover, in 2015, the FDA approved the first biosimilar and currently has several other biosimilar applications under review. See Government Regulation and Price Constraints &#8212; Biosimilar Regulation &#32;below for additional information on the ACA&#8217;s approval framework for biosimilars. 

In Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In 2013, the EMA approved the first biosimilar of a monoclonal antibody. In Japan, the regulatory authority has granted marketing authorizations for certain biosimilars, including our monoclonal antibody infliximab, pursuant to a guideline for biosimilar approvals issued in 2009. 

If competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars that reference our biotechnology products, our products may become subject to competition from these biosimilars, with attendant competitive pressure, and price reductions could follow. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger this competition, assuming any relevant exclusivity period has expired. However, biosimilar manufacturing is complex. At least initially upon approval of a biosimilar competitor, biosimilar competition with respect to biologics may not be as significant as generic competition with respect to small molecule drugs. 

As part of our business strategy, we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing, as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths, to develop biosimilar medicines. As such, a better-defined biosimilars approval pathway will assist us in pursuing approval of our own biosimilar products in the U.S. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#8212; Biotechnology Products &#32;below. 

We may face litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our biotechnology products. Likewise, as we develop and manufacture biosimilars and seek to launch products, patents may be asserted against us. 

International 

One of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products. Under international and U.S. free trade agreements in recent years, global protection of intellectual property rights has been improving. For additional information, see Government Regulation and Price Constraints &#8212; Intellectual Property &#32;below. 

COMPETITION 

Our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. Though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups, demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses. 

Our competitors include other worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers and consumer healthcare manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products. 

This competition affects our core product business, which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&#38;D, as well as our business development transactions, both designed to result in a strong product pipeline. Our investment in research does not stop with drug approval; we continue to invest in further understanding the value of our products for the conditions they treat, as well as potential new applications. We seek to protect the health and well-being of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients, physicians and global health authorities. We also seek to continually 

Pfizer Inc. &#32; | &#32;2015 Form 10-K | &#32; 11 

enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions, including coordinating support for our salespersons&#8217; efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers. 

Operating conditions have become more challenging under mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to take measures to evaluate, adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we have taken an industry-leading role in evolving our approaches to U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising; interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals; and medical education grants. We also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions. 

Our Consumer Healthcare business faces competition from OTC business units in other major pharmaceutical and consumer packaged goods companies, and retailers who carry their own private label brands. Our competitive position is affected by several factors, including the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors&#8217; promotional resources; customer acceptance; product quality; our and our competitors&#8217; introduction of new products, ingredients, claims, dosage forms, or other forms of innovation; and pricing, regulatory and legislative matters (such as product labeling, patient access and prescription to OTC switches). 

Our vaccines business may face competition from the introduction of alternative or next generation vaccines. For example, Prevnar 13 may face competition in the form of alternative 13-valent or additional valent next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to the expiration of its patents, which may adversely affect our future results. 

Our generics and biosimilars businesses compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers. In the U.S., Pfizer&#8217;s Greenstone subsidiary and Pfizer Injectables team sell generic versions of Pfizer&#8217;s, as well as certain competitors&#8217;, solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products, respectively, upon loss of exclusivity, as appropriate. Additionally, as a result of the Hospira acquisition, Pfizer also sells generic versions of sterile injectable products as well as biosimilars globally. We seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a &#8220;first-to-market&#8221; or early market position for our generic injectable drugs and biosimilars, as a &#8220;first-to-market&#8221; position provides customers a lower-cost alternative immediately when available and also may provide us with a period of exclusivity as the only generic or biosimilar provider. 

Our infusion systems business faces competition from companies that manufacture and distribute similar products to our infusion systems. For our infusion systems business, we seek to differentiate our products through technological innovation and an integrated approach to drug delivery. 

Managed Care Organizations 

The evolution of managed care in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 283 million people in the U.S. now have some form of health insurance coverage. Due to the expansion of health insurance coverage (see Government Regulation and Price Constraints &#8212; In the United States &#32;below), the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in the U.S. continues to grow in importance. 

The influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same time, those organizations have been consolidating into fewer, even larger entities. This consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate, as well as their importance to Pfizer. 

The growth of MCOs has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues. One objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcare expenditures. MCOs typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the MCOs), clinical protocols (requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded medicines on higher-tier status in their formularies (leading to higher patient co-pays) or non-preferred tier status, MCOs transfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient, resulting in significant out-of-pocket expenses for the patient, especially for chronic treatments. This financial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. 

Due to their generally lower cost, generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of MCO formularies. The breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems. 

Exclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products. Unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects, are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies. However, lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. We have been generally, although not 

Pfizer Inc. &#32; | &#32;2015 Form 10-K | &#32; 12 

universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO formularies. However, increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status. 

MCOs also emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors&#8217; offices and clinics as another way to manage costs. Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed. Since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization, professional therapy, or even surgery, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases. 

The ACA has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across MCOs and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs, which creates pressure on MCOs to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes. 

Generic Products 

One of the biggest competitive challenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product, especially a small molecule product, we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. Several such competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration. Unlike us, generic competitors often operate without large R&#38;D expenses, as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product. Generic competitors do not generally need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less. 

In addition, our patent-protected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors&#8217; branded products that lose their market exclusivity. 

As noted above, MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute, for brand-name drugs, generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution. 

RAW MATERIALS 

Raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials are available from multiple sources. No serious shortages or delays of raw materials were encountered in 2015 , and none are expected in 2016 . We have successfully secured the materials necessary to meet our requirements where there have been short-term imbalances between supply and demand, but generally at higher prices than those historically paid. 

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS 

Pharmaceutical and medical device companies are subject to extensive laws and regulations by national, state and local agencies in the countries in which they do business. Certain laws and regulations that govern Pfizer&#8217;s business are discussed below. 

General . &#32;Our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, including those governing the manufacture and marketing of our products, could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmental bodies. For additional information on these proceedings and actions, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212; Note 17A. Commitments and Contingencies&#8212;Legal Proceedings &#32;in our 2015 Financial Report. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, warning letters and product recalls or seizures, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from such proceedings and actions. 

In the United States 

Drug Regulation . &#32;In the U.S., biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulations by the FDA, including regulations that govern the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling and storage of our products, record keeping, advertising and promotion. Our products are also subject to post-market surveillance under the FFDCA and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs, as well as the Public Health Service Act and its implementing regulations with respect to biologics. The FDA also regulates our Consumer Healthcare products. 

Other U.S. federal agencies, including the DEA, also regulate certain of our products. The FTC has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products, including OTC drugs and dietary supplements. Many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC. 

Pfizer Inc. &#32; | &#32;2015 Form 10-K | &#32; 13 

Before a new biopharmaceutical product may be marketed in the U.S., the FDA must approve an NDA for a new drug or a BLA for a biologic. The steps required before the FDA will approve an NDA or BLA generally include preclinical studies followed by multiple stages of clinical trials conducted by the study sponsor; sponsor submission of the application to the FDA for review; the FDA&#8217;s review of the data to assess the drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness; and the FDA&#8217;s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured. 

Before a generic drug may be marketed in the U.S., the FDA must approve an ANDA. The ANDA review process typically does not require new preclinical and clinical studies, because it relies on the studies establishing safety and efficacy conducted for the referenced drug previously approved through the NDA process. The ANDA process, however, does require the sponsor to conduct one or more bioequivalence studies to show that the ANDA drug is bioequivalent to the previously approved referenced brand drug, submission of an application to the FDA for review, and the FDA&#8217;s inspection of the facilities where the product will be manufactured. 

As a condition of product approval, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct post-marketing clinical studies, known as Phase 4 studies, and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of the approved product. The FDA may limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-market studies and programs. Any modifications to a drug or biologic, including new indications or changes to labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require the submission and approval of a new or supplemental NDA or BLA before the modification can be implemented, which may require that we develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Our ongoing manufacture and distribution of drugs and biologics is subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product, and adherence to cGMPs, which regulate all aspects of the manufacturing process. We are also subject to numerous regulatory requirements relating to the advertising and promotion of drugs and biologics, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements governing the manufacture and marketing of our products may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls or seizures, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. 

Biosimilar Regulation. &#32;The ACA created a framework for the approval of biosimilars (also known as follow-on biologics) following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic, with a potential six-month pediatric extension. Under the ACA, biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference, innovator biologic. 

The FDA is responsible for implementation of the legislation and, in 2015, approved the first biosimilar. Through that approval and the issuance of draft and final guidance, the FDA has begun to address open questions about the naming convention for biosimilars and the use of data from a non-U.S.-licensed comparator to demonstrate biosimilarity and/or interchangeability with a U.S.-licensed reference product. Over the next several years, the FDA is expected to issue additional draft and final guidance documents impacting biosimilars. 

Device Regulation . In the U.S., the FDA regulates medical devices under the authority of the FFDCA and its regulations. The FDA classifies U.S. medical devices into one of three classes (Class I, II or III) based on the statutory framework described in the FFDCA. Our medical device business includes Class I and II devices, which are reviewed by the FDA under the 510(k) process. 

During the 510(k) process, the FDA reviews a premarket notification and determines whether or not a proposed device is &#8220;substantially equivalent&#8221; to &#8220;predicate devices.&#8221; If the intended use and technological characteristics are comparable to a predicate device, the device may be cleared for marketing. If the device has the same intended use as a predicate device and different technological characteristics, but data is submitted to the FDA showing that the device is at least as safe and effective as the legally marketed device, it may also be cleared for marketing. In reviewing a premarket notification, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require Premarket Approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the agency can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer&#8217;s decision not to seek a new 510(k) clearance, the agency may retroactively require the manufacturer to seek 510(k) clearance or Premarket Approval. The FDA can also require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or Premarket Approval is obtained. Additionally, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 

Postmarket Device Regulation. &#32; The medical devices that we manufacture and distribute are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA reviews design, manufacturing, and distribution practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers&#8217; required reports of adverse experience and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. Among other FDA requirements, we must comply with FDA regulations relating to cGMPs. These regulations govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use. We must also comply with Medical Devices Reporting which requires us to report to the FDA any incident in any of our products that may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or required an unnecessary intervention for a patient, or in which any of our products malfunctioned and, if such malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Labeling, advertising, and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the FDA and, in certain circumstances, by the FTC. Current FDA enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved medical devices for unapproved uses. We are subject to routine inspection by the FDA 

Pfizer Inc. &#32; | &#32;2015 Form 10-K | &#32; 14 

and other regulatory authorities for compliance with Quality System Regulation and Medical Devices Reporting requirements, as well as other applicable regulations. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, and require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and restrain certain violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, and assess civil or criminal fines and penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. 

Sales and Marketing . &#32;The marketing practices of U.S. biopharmaceutical and medical device companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and protect the integrity of government healthcare programs. These laws include anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical or medical device company from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular product. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for reimbursed drugs or services to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent. Although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to any particular industry practices, including the marketing practices of pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). The federal government and various states have also enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical or medical device companies. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require disclosure to the federal or state government and public of such interactions; and/or require the adoption of compliance standards or programs. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations. 

Pricing and Reimbursement . &#32;Pricing for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation. Pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the &#8220;federal ceiling price&#8221; drug pricing program, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. Pfizer must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose Pfizer to penalties. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income &#8212; Revenues &#8212; Overview section in our 2015 Financial Report and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212; Note 1G. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable in our 2015 Financial Report, which are incorporated by reference. 

Government and private third-party payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. For example, the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under Medicaid. Restrictions exist for some Pfizer products in certain states. As another example, access to our products under the Medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans providing coverage for Medicaid recipients contracting for the provision of services in the state. Given certain states&#8217; current and potential ongoing fiscal crises, a growing number of states are considering a variety of cost-control strategies, including capitated managed care plans that typically contain cost by restricting access to certain treatments. 

Healthcare Reform. &#32;The U.S. and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to regulate the healthcare industry. In March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the ACA, which included changes that significantly affected the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, such as: 

&#8226; 

increasing drug rebates paid to state Medicaid programs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for brand name and generic prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care; 

&#8226; 

requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide discounts on brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause the beneficiaries to be subject to the Medicare Part D coverage gap; 

&#8226; 

imposing an annual fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and 

&#8226; 

imposing an annual excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices offered for sale in the U.S. 

The ACA included provisions designed to increase the number of Americans covered by health insurance. Specifically, since 2014, the ACA has required most individuals to maintain health insurance coverage or potentially to pay a penalty for noncompliance and has offered states the option of expanding Medicaid coverage to additional individuals. The implementation of the coverage expansion had a negligible impact on Pfizer&#8217;s 2015 revenues. 

Pfizer Inc. &#32; | &#32;2015 Form 10-K | &#32; 15 

Additionally, policy efforts designed specifically to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs for medicines could result in new mandatory rebates and discounts or other pricing restrictions. A number of the candidates for the 2016 U.S. presidential elections have introduced such policy proposals, and a November 2015 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services forum dedicated to drug pricing could lead to further proposals. We believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We continue to work with stakeholders in an effort to ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system. In addition, certain regulatory changes to be implemented in 2016 may affect Pfizer's obligations under the Medicaid drug rebate program, but the impact of those changes is not yet known. 

Adoption of other new legislation at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. 

Anti-Corruption. &#32; The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations. Individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws. 

Outside the United States 

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries. 

New Drug Approvals and Pharmacovigilance. &#32;In the EU, the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the Mutual Recognition Procedure, the Decentralized Procedure or the EU Centralized Procedure. These procedures apply in the EU member states, plus the EEA countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The use of these procedures generally provides a more rapid and consistent approval process across the Member States than was the case when the approval processes were operating independently within each country. 

In Japan, the PMDA is the point of entry for businesses looking to sell drugs and medical devices in the country. The PMDA, which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety, must approve an application before a new drug product may be marketed in Japan. The PMDA also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and medical devices and provides advice on product classifications and approvals. 

Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of the FDA or the EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. Many authorities also require local clinical data in the country&#8217;s population in order to receive final marketing approval. These requirements delay marketing authorization in those countries relative to the U.S. and Europe. 

China&#8217;s regulatory system is unique in many ways, and its drug development and registration requirements are not always consistent with U.S. or other international standards. It is common to see treatments entering the Chinese market two to five years behind first marketing in the U.S. and Europe, because China only issues import drug licenses to treatments approved by a foreign regulatory authority. In addition, to obtain marketing approvals for new drugs in China, a clinical trial authorization issued by the CFDA is required for the conduct of Phase I to III clinical trials. Foreign applicants of imported drugs, if including China-originated data in their Multi-Regional Clinical Trials and meeting the relevant technical review requirements, may receive case-by-case clinical trial waivers. Generics, on the other hand, only need to undergo bioequivalence studies upon a filing for record with the CFDA. A Chinese drug license will only be granted if, following review, the CFDA determines that the clinical data confirm the drug&#8217;s safety and effectiveness. 

In 2012, new pharmacovigilance legislation came into force in the EU. Key changes include the establishment of a new Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee within the EMA, with responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the EU authorities. It also introduces the possibility for regulators to require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization efficacy studies at the time of approval, or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments. There are also additional requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products. Outside developed markets such as the EU and Japan, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are typically less extensive. 

Medical Device Regulation. The EU has adopted the European Medical Device Directives as a common legal framework for all EU Member States. These directives require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system and safety requirements and obtain a &#8220;CE&#8221; marking (i.e., a mandatory conformity marking for certain products sold within the EEA) for their products. The applicable authorities of the EU countries, generally in the form of their ministries or departments of health, are responsible for market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. We are required to report device failures and injuries potentially related to product use to these authorities in a timely manner. Various penalties exist for non-compliance with the laws implementing the European Medical Device Directives. 

Pfizer Inc. &#32; | &#32;2015 Form 10-K | &#32; 16 

Medical device laws and regulations similar to those described above are also in effect in many of the other countries/regions in which we distribute our medical device products. 

Pricing and Reimbursement . In certain international markets, such as Europe, Japan, China, Canada, and South Korea, governments provide healthcare at low direct cost to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global economic pressures. Governments, including the different EU Member States, may use a variety of cost-containment measures for our pharmaceutical products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and international reference pricing (i.e., the practice of many countries linking their regulated medicine prices to those of other countries). This international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and assessments of value across countries has led to different prices in different countries and some third-party trade in our products between countries. 

In particular, international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation. Price variations also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations that are exacerbated by international reference pricing systems. The downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies, emergency measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some European countries and ongoing exchange rate fluctuations. 

China historically controlled prices of pharmaceutical products mainly by setting their maximum retail prices. Since June 1, 2015, government-set price caps have been lifted for the vast majority of drug products. However, the government will continue to exercise indirect price control by setting reasonable reimbursement standards determined by the social insurance administrations, through a negotiation mechanism between drug manufacturers and social insurance administrations. 

EU Regulatory Changes . &#32;The EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation in May 2014, which is expected to come into effect by December 2017. This new regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the governance of clinical trials in the EU and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results. 

In another effort to increase the public availability of clinical trial results, the EMA adopted a new policy on Publication of Clinical Data for Medicinal Products for Human Use, which became effective January 1, 2015. Under this policy, the EMA will proactively publish clinical trial data from application dossiers for new marketing authorizations, including data from trials taking place outside the EU, after the EMA has made a decision on the marketing authorization. The policy includes limited exceptions for commercially confidential information and the exclusion of any protected personal data. 

China Regulatory Changes . &#32;In an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce the existing drug approval backlogs, the CFDA unveiled several reform initiatives for China&#8217;s drug approval system. The regulator now divides drugs into new drugs and generics, with the definition for new drugs changed from &#8220;drugs never marketed in China&#8221; to &#8220;drugs that are neither marketed in or outside China.&#8221; This change in definition creates more incentives for China&#8217;s domestic drug manufacturers than for multinational firms, because imported drugs first marketed outside China are no longer considered new drugs. Another major initiative is the piloting of the &#8220;marketing authorization holder&#8221; system in ten provinces in China, where the market authorization/drug license holders are no longer required to be the actual manufacturers. The &#8220;marketing authorization holder&#8221; system will allow for more flexibilities in contract manufacturing arrangements and asset transfers, but it is not applicable to imported drugs. 

A number of other policy changes are expected to be able to streamline and accelerate domestic and imported drug approvals in China. These changes include introducing an umbrella clinical trial authorization for all three phases of registration studies (instead of the original phase-by-phase approvals), implementing a filing/recordation system for bioequivalence studies on generics (instead of the original review and approval system), and admitting more types of drugs as innovative drugs eligible for the fast track/green channel approval pathway. 

Healthcare Provider Transparency and Disclosures. &#32; A number of countries have implemented laws requiring (or their industry associations have recommended) disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical and medical device companies to healthcare providers. For example, in 2013, the EFPIA released its disclosure code of transfers of value to healthcare professionals and organizations. The code requires all members of EFPIA, including Pfizer, to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations beginning in 2016, covering the relevant transfers in 2015. 

Intellectual Property . &#32;The WTO-TRIPS required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005, with an extension until 2033 for least-developed countries. While we still face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world, a number of countries have made improvements. We include stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries. 

While the global intellectual property environment has improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection. In emerging market countries in particular, governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool for reducing the price of imported medicines, as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries. There is considerable political and economic pressure to weaken existing intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection, which has led to policies such 

Pfizer Inc. &#32; | &#32;2015 Form 10-K | &#32; 17 

as more restrictive standards and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions (e.g., new medical treatment methods), revocation of patents, issuance of compulsory licenses, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection. Our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers, as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries. 

Canada&#8217;s intellectual property regime for drugs provides some level of patent protection and data exclusivity (eight years plus six-month pediatric extension), but it lacks the predictability and stability that otherwise comparable countries provide. Through intense negotiations as part of the Canada/EU Comprehensive Economic &#38; Trade Agreement, Canadian authorities committed to introduce a right of appeal, a form of patent term restoration and to elevate the current data protection to a treaty obligation, further aligning its intellectual property regime to the EU. Canada is also signatory of the 2015 Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership (TPP), and Canada may enhance its intellectual property regime in line with its TPP obligations. The patent utility doctrine developed by the Canadian courts remains an important concern which is currently not being addressed by the Canadian government. 

In China, the intellectual property environment has improved, although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern. The government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with World Trade Organization provisions, and several companies, including Pfizer, have established R&#38;D centers in China due to increased confidence in China&#8217;s intellectual property environment. Despite this, China remained on the U.S. Trade Representative&#8217;s Priority Watch List for 2015. Further, the standards for patentability in China remain more restrictive than in other major markets, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. Also, while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years, enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent. For example, the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions, impractical evidentiary burdens, and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage. 

In Brazil and other Latin American countries, the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents (e.g., National Health Surveillance Agency in Brazil), restrictive patentability rules, ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products through patents. The lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions, such as new medical uses of drug products, may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products. 

In India, policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents, the increasing tendency of the Indian Patent Office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings, and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to protect many of our inventions. India maintains a system of pre-grant patent oppositions that delays the granting of patents and adds an additional challenge in our ability to protect our products through patents. Indian law includes special restrictions on the types of pharmaceutical inventions that may be patented which may limit our ability to protect our products. Recent use by the Indian government of compulsory licensing and patent revocation mechanisms heightens the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products, especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population, such as infectious diseases, cancer and diabetes. In September 2012, Pfizer&#8217;s patent covering Sutent was revoked by the Indian Patent Office and other challenges against Pfizer patents are ongoing. 

In South Korea, the laws and regulations for the patent-regulatory approval linkage system was implemented as part of the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement in 2012. The Korean patent-regulatory approval linkage system includes biologics. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

Most of our operations are affected by national, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212; Note 17A3. Commitments and Contingencies&#8212;Legal Proceedings&#8212;Commercial and Other Matters &#32;in our 2015 &#32;Financial Report. As a result, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2015 &#32;for environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows: 

&#8226; 

environment-related capital expenditures&#8212; $23 million; and 

&#8226; 

other environment-related expenses&#8212; $144 million. 

While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance, including compliance with laws related to climate change, cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position. 

Climate change presents risks to our operations, including potential physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to more frequent and severe weather events and water availability. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future; however, we have a robust program for reviewing our vulnerability to these potential risks and we update our assessments periodically. To date, we have concluded that, because of 

Pfizer Inc. &#32; | &#32;2015 Form 10-K | &#32; 18 

our facility locations, our existing distribution networks and our controls, we do not anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on Pfizer in the near term. 

TAX MATTERS 

The discussion of tax-related matters in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements&#8212; Note 5. Tax Matters &#32;in our 2015 &#32;Financial Report, is incorporated by reference. 

EMPLOYEES 

In our innovation-intensive business, our employees are vital to our success. We believe we have good relationships with our employees. As of December 31, 2015 , we employed approximately 97,900 people in our operations throughout the world. 

DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT OF 2012 

Section 219 of ITRSHRA requires disclosure by public companies of certain transactions involving the Government of Iran, as well as entities and individuals designated under Executive Order 13382 and Executive Order 13224 (the Executive Orders). In some instances, ITRSHRA requires companies to disclose these types of transactions, even if they were permissible under U.S. law or were conducted by a non-U.S. affiliate in accordance with the local law under which such entity operates. 

As a global biopharmaceutical company, we conduct business in multiple jurisdictions throughout the world. During 2015 , our activities included supplying life-saving medicines, medical products and consumer products (Pfizer products) for patient and consumer use in Iran. We ship Pfizer products to Iran, and conduct related activities, in accordance with licenses issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities, and in line with our corporate policies. We will continue our global activities to improve the health and well-being of patients and consumers in a manner consistent with applicable laws and our corporate policies. To our knowledge, none of our activities during 2015 &#32;are required to be disclosed pursuant to ITRSHRA.
