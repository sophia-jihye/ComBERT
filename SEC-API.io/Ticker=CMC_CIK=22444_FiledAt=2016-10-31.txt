GENERAL 

Commercial Metals Company ("CMC") together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company," "we," "our" or "us") manufacture, recycle and market steel and metal products, related materials and services through a network including steel mills, commonly referred to as "minimills" or "micro-mills," steel fabrication and processing facilities, construction-related product warehouses, metal recycling facilities and marketing and distribution offices in the United States ("U.S.") and in strategic international markets. 

We were incorporated in 1946 in the State of Delaware. Our predecessor company, a metals recycling business, has existed since approximately 1915. We maintain our corporate office at 6565 North MacArthur Boulevard in Irving, Texas, 75039, telephone number (214) 689-4300. Our fiscal year ends August 31, and any reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to any year refers to the fiscal year ended August 31 of that year unless otherwise noted. 

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to these reports are made available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our website, http://www.cmc.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The information contained on our website or available by hyperlink from our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or other documents we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. 

We have five business segments operating across two geographic divisions. Our CMC Americas Division includes three segments: Americas Recycling, Americas Mills and Americas Fabrication. Our CMC International Division includes two segments: International Mill and International Marketing and Distribution. Financial information for the last three fiscal years concerning our five business segments and the geographic areas of our operations is incorporated herein by reference from Note 22, Business Segments, to the consolidated financial statements, which are contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

CMC AMERICAS DIVISION OPERATIONS 

AMERICAS RECYCLING 

Our Americas Recycling segment processes scrap metals for use as a raw material by manufacturers of new metal products. This segment operates 26 &#32;scrap metal processing facilities with 13 &#32;locations in Texas , five &#32;locations in Florida , two &#32;locations in Missouri &#32;and one &#32;location each in Georgia , Kansas , Louisiana , North Carolina , Oklahoma &#32;and Tennessee . 

We purchase ferrous and nonferrous metals, processed and unprocessed, from a variety of sources in a variety of forms for our scrap metal processing facilities. Sources of metal for processing include manufacturing and industrial plants, metal fabrication plants, electric utilities, machine shops, factories, railroads, refineries, shipyards, ordinance depots, demolition businesses, automobile salvage firms, wrecking firms, and small scrap metal collection firms. 

Our scrap metal processing facilities typically consist of an office and a warehouse building located on several acres of land that we use for receiving, sorting, processing and storing metals. Our warehouse buildings are equipped with specialized equipment for processing both ferrous and nonferrous metal and one of our facilities has extensive equipment that segregates metallic content from large quantities of insulated wire. Several of our scrap metal processing facilities use a small portion of their site or a nearby location to display and sell metal products that may be reused for their original purpose without further processing. We equip our 

larger scrap metal processing facilities with various equipment, such as scales, shears, baling presses, briquetting machines, conveyors, magnetic separators, presses, shredders, and hydraulic shears, which enable these facilities to efficiently process large volumes of scrap metals. We use cranes to handle scrap metals for processing and to load material for shipment. We primarily transport processed ferrous metal to consumers by open gondola railcar; therefore many of our metal processing facilities have rail access. When water access is available, we also transport processed ferrous metal via barge. 

Americas Recycling operates four &#32;large shredding machines, two &#32;in Texas , one &#32;in Florida , and one &#32;in Oklahoma , capable of pulverizing obsolete automobiles or other sources of scrap metal. We have three additional shredders, two operated by our Americas Mills segment and one operated by our International Mill segment. With the exception of precious metals, our scrap metal processing facilities recycle and process practically all types of metal. 

We sell scrap metals to steel mills and foundries, aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers, brass and bronze ingot makers, copper refineries and mills, secondary lead smelters, specialty steel mills, high temperature alloy manufacturers and other consumers. Ferrous metal is the primary raw material for electric arc furnaces, such as those operated by our Americas Mills segment and other minimills. Some minimills periodically supplement purchases of ferrous metal with direct reduced iron and pig iron for certain product lines. Our Irving, Texas office coordinates the sale of substantially all scrap metals from our metal processing facilities to our customers. We negotiate export sales through our global network of offices as well as through our Irving, Texas office. 

We are not materially dependent on any single source for the scrap metal we purchase. No single customer represented 10% or more of our Americas Recycling segment's net sales in fiscal 2016 . One customer represented approximately 12% and 16% of our Americas Recycling segment's net sales in fiscal 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. Our recycling business competes with other scrap metal processors and primary nonferrous metal producers, both in the U.S. and internationally, for sales of nonferrous materials. Consumers of nonferrous metals frequently utilize primary or "virgin" ingot processed by mining companies instead of nonferrous metals. The prices of nonferrous metals are closely related to, but generally are less than, the prices of primary or "virgin" ingot. 

This segment's level of exports during a period is dependent on the level of demand and supply in the various markets we serve. Additionally, the primary markets for certain commodities are outside of the U.S. We exported approximately 7% of our ferrous scrap tonnage and approximately 19% of our nonferrous scrap tonnage during fiscal 2016 . This compares to ferrous scrap tonnage exports of approximately 6% and nonferrous scrap tonnage exports of approximately 22% during fiscal 2015 . The decrease in the percentage of nonferrous scrap tonnage exported was due to declining export demand, primarily in China. 

AMERICAS MILLS 

Our Americas Mills segment includes our five &#32;domestic steel mills, four commonly referred to as "minimills" and one commonly referred to as a "micro-mill," two &#32;scrap metal shredders, ten &#32;scrap metal processing facilities that directly support the steel minimills, and a railroad salvage operation. 

Our five &#32;steel mills, located in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, South Carolina and Texas, produce one or more of steel reinforcing bar ("rebar"), angles, flats, rounds, channels, fence post sections and other shapes. We utilize a fleet of trucks that we own or lease as well as private haulers to transport finished products from the mills to our customers and to our steel fabrication facilities. To minimize the cost of our products, to the extent feasibly consistent with market conditions and working capital demands, we prefer to operate all of our mills at or near full capacity. Market conditions such as increases in quantities of competing imported steel, production rates at U.S. competitors, customer inventory levels or a decrease in non-residential construction activity may reduce demand for our products and limit our ability to operate the mills at full capacity. Through our operations and capital improvements, we strive to increase productivity and capacity at the mills and to enhance our product mix. Because the steel mill business is capital intensive, we make substantial capital expenditures on a regular basis to remain competitive with other low cost producers. Over the past three fiscal years, we have spent approximately $209.0 million, or 55%, of our total capital expenditures on projects within our Americas Mills segment. 

The following table compares the amount of steel melted, rolled and shipped by our five &#32;steel mills in the past three fiscal years: 

(in short tons)

Descriptions of mill capacity, particularly rolling capacity, are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured. Our mills roll many different types and sizes of products in their range depending on market conditions including pricing and demand. Our estimated annual capacity for finished goods of approximately 3.0 million short tons assumes a typical product mix and will vary with the products we actually produce. 

Our Alabama, South Carolina and Texas minimills each consist of: 

&#8226; 

a melt shop with an electric arc furnace; 

&#8226; 

continuous casting equipment that shapes molten metal into billets; 

&#8226; 

a reheating furnace that prepares billets for rolling; 

&#8226; 

a rolling mill that forms products from heated billets; 

&#8226; 

a mechanical cooling bed that receives hot products from the rolling mill; 

&#8226; 

finishing facilities that cut, straighten, bundle and prepare products for shipping; and 

&#8226; 

supporting facilities such as maintenance, warehouse and office areas. 

Our Alabama minimill primarily manufactures products that are larger in size relative to products manufactured by our other steel minimills. These larger size products include mid-size structural steel products such as equal and unequal leg angles, channels and flats. This minimill does not produce rebar. Our Alabama minimill sells primarily to service centers; however, it also sells to customers in the construction, manufacturing and fabricating industries. Our Alabama minimill primarily ships its products to customers located in the Southeast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S. 

Our South Carolina minimill manufactures a full line of bar-sized products, including rebar, angles, channels, flats, rounds, squares, and fence post sections. Our South Carolina minimill sells primarily to customers in the rebar fabrication industry; however, it also sells to service centers, manufacturers of original equipment, and the agricultural industry. Our South Carolina minimill ships products to customers primarily located in the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S., which include the states from Florida through southern New England. In addition to the minimill, we operate a recycling yard, a steel fence post plant, and an alloy briquetting facility located on or near the same site. 

Our Texas minimill manufactures a full line of bar-sized products, including rebar, angles, rounds, channels, flats (in both merchant and special bar quality ("SBQ") grades), and other sections used primarily in building highways, reinforcing concrete structures and manufacturing. This minimill sells primarily to the construction, energy and petrochemical industries; however, it also sells to service centers and manufacturers of original equipment. Our Texas minimill primarily ships its products to customers located in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It also ships products to approximately 20 other states and Central America. In addition to the minimill, we operate a rebar fabrication facility, a shredder and downstream sorting equipment located on the same site. 

Our micro-mill in Arizona utilizes a "continuous continuous" design where metal flows uninterrupted from melting to casting to rolling. It is more compact than existing, larger capacity steel minimills, and production is dedicated to a limited product range. This micro-mill primarily produces rebar; however, it also manufactures fence post sections. Our Arizona micro-mill sells primarily to customers in the construction and fabricating industries, although it also sells to service centers. Our Arizona micro-mill ships its products to customers located in the Southwest region of the U.S., primarily Arizona and California, as well as Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico. We also operate a rebar fabrication facility located on the same site as the micro-mill. 

The primary raw material that our Alabama, Arizona, South Carolina and Texas mills use is ferrous scrap metal. This segment operates ten &#32;metal processing facilities that directly support the mills: four &#32;in South Carolina , four &#32;in Texas , and two &#32;in Alabama . This segment also includes two &#32;shredders. We believe the supply of ferrous metal is adequate to meet our future needs, but it has 

historically been subject to significant price fluctuations which have occurred more rapidly over the last several years. All four of these mills consume large amounts of electricity and natural gas. We have not had any significant curtailments, and we believe that energy supplies are adequate. The supply and demand of regional and national energy and the extent of applicable regulatory oversight of rates charged by providers affect the prices we pay for electricity and natural gas. 

Our smaller Arkansas minimill does not have a melt shop or continuous casting equipment. The Arkansas minimill manufacturing process begins with a reheating furnace capable of utilizing billets acquired either from our other minimills or from unrelated suppliers or used rail, primarily salvaged from railroad abandonments. The remainder of the manufacturing process utilizes a rolling mill, cooling bed, finishing equipment and support facilities similar to, but on a smaller scale than, those at our other minimills. The Arkansas minimill primarily manufactures bed frame angles, earth bar, and other specialty flat, angle and square shapes. Our Arkansas minimill primarily sells to customers in the construction and manufacturing industries. Since our Arkansas minimill does not have melting facilities, the minimill depends on an adequate supply of competitively priced billets or used rail. The availability of these raw materials fluctuates with the level of excess billet production by our minimills or that offered for sale by steel producers and for rail, the pace of railroad abandonments, rail replacement by railroads, and demand for used rail from competing domestic and foreign rail rerolling mills. 

One customer represented approximately 11% of our Americas Mills segment's net sales in fiscal 2016 , compared to approximately 10% in fiscal 2015 . No single customer represented 10% or more of our Americas Mills segment's net sales in fiscal 2014 . Due to the nature of certain stock products we sell in the Americas Mills segment, we do not have a long lead time between receipt of an order and the delivery of product. We generally fill orders for stock products from inventory or with products near completion. As a result, we do not believe that backlog levels are a significant factor in the evaluation of these operations. Backlog, defined as the total value of unfulfilled orders, for these mills at August 31, 2016 &#32;was approximately $222.9 million, compared to $222.8 million at August 31, 2015 . 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced a plan to build a new micro-mill in Durant, Oklahoma. This new micro-mill will mirror the "continuous continuous" design of the existing micro-mill in Arizona. We believe that this addition to our portfolio of highly efficient, customer focused and cost effective steel production facilities should allow us to better serve a growing North Texas market and increase our presence in adjacent markets. At this facility, we plan to produce low cost, high quality steel products, which we expect will complement our existing manufacturing capability to better serve our customers. We believe that this new micro-mill will also complement our existing recycling and fabrication footprint, enhancing our ability to further leverage our raw material supply chain and optimize product mix within our existing operations. We expect the Oklahoma micro-mill to be commissioned in late 2017. The direct and indirect investment is expected to be in excess of approximately $250 million. We expect that this investment will be funded primarily from internally generated capital. See Note 12, New Markets Tax Credit Transactions, to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information. 

In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we sold all of the outstanding capital stock of our wholly owned copper tube manufacturing operation, Howell Metal Company ("Howell"), for $58.5 million, of which $3.2 million was held in escrow as of August 31, 2015, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The full balance of escrow was released to the Company in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. During the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we made a $3.0 million working capital adjustment, which was included in our estimated pre-tax gain of $6.3 million. Howell was previously included in the Americas Mills reporting segment. We have included Howell in discontinued operations for all periods presented. 

AMERICAS FABRICATION 

Our Americas Fabrication segment consists of our steel fabrication facilities that bend, weld, cut and fabricate steel, primarily rebar; warehouses that sell or rent products for the installation of concrete; facilities that produce steel fence posts; and facilities that heat-treat steel to strengthen and provide flexibility. 

Steel Fabrication 

Through our Americas Fabrication segment we operate 37 &#32;facilities engaged in the various aspects of steel fabrication. Most of the facilities engage in general fabrication of reinforcing and structural steel, with three facilities fabricating only steel fence posts. We obtain steel for these facilities from our own mills and directly from third-party steel vendors. In addition, we utilize our marketing and distribution business to purchase steel from other steel manufacturers. 

We conduct steel fabrication activities in 14 &#32;locations in Texas , three &#32;each in South Carolina &#32;and California , two &#32;each in Colorado , Florida , Illinois &#32;and Louisiana , and one each in Arizona , Georgia , Mississippi , Nevada , New Mexico , North Carolina , Tennessee , Virginia &#32;and Utah . 

Fabricated steel products are used primarily in the construction of commercial and non-commercial buildings, hospitals, convention centers, industrial plants, power plants, highways, bridges, arenas, stadiums, and dams. Generally, we sell fabricated steel in response to a bid solicitation from a construction contractor or from a project owner. Typically, the contractor or the owner of the project awards the job based on the competitive prices of the bids and does not negotiate with the bidders individually. 

Backlog in our steel fabrication operations was approximately $658.1 million at August 31, 2016 , compared to $767.9 million at August 31, 2015 . We do not consider other backlogs in the Americas Fabrication segment to be material. 

Construction Services 

Our Construction Services business unit sells and rents construction-related products and equipment to concrete installers and other businesses in the construction industry. We have 19 &#32;locations in Texas , five &#32;in Louisiana &#32;and one &#32;in Oklahoma &#32;where we store and sell these construction-related products, which, with the exception of a small portion of steel products, are purchased from third-party suppliers. 

Impact Metals 

We provide heat-treated steel products through CMC Impact Metals, a subsidiary of CMC. CMC Impact Metals is one of North America's premier producers of high strength steel products. We operate facilities in Alabama &#32;and Pennsylvania , which manufacture armor plate for military vehicles, high strength bar for the truck trailer industry and special bar quality steel for the energy market. CMC Impact Metals works closely with our Alabama minimill, our distribution business and other steel mills that sell specialized heat-treated steel for customer specific use. 

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our Americas Fabrication segment's net sales in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

CMC INTERNATIONAL DIVISION OPERATIONS 

INTERNATIONAL MILL 

Our International Mill segment is comprised of all mill, recycling and fabrication operations located in Poland. Our subsidiary, CMC Poland Sp. z.o.o. ("CMCP"), owns a steel minimill and conducts its mill operations in Zawiercie, Poland. Our Poland steel minimill operates equipment similar to the equipment operated by our U.S. steel minimills. This segment's operations are conducted through: two rolling mills that produce primarily rebar and high quality merchant products; a specialty rod finishing mill; our scrap processing facilities, which include a large capacity scrap metal shredding facility similar to the largest shredder we operate in the U.S.; and four steel fabrication facilities primarily for rebar and wire mesh. 

Our Poland minimill operates a flexible rolling mill designed to allow efficient and flexible production of a range of medium section merchant bar products. This rolling mill complements the facility's other rolling mill dedicated primarily to rebar production. Either rolling mill can feed an alternative finishing end designed to produce higher grade wire rod. Our Poland minimill operation has annual rolling capacity of approximately 1.3 million short tons. 

Our Poland minimill is a significant manufacturer of rebar, merchant bar and wire rod in Central Europe, selling primarily to fabricators, manufacturers, distributors and construction companies. The majority of sales are to customers within Poland. However, the Poland minimill also exports to the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and other countries. Ferrous metal, the principal raw material used by our Poland minimill, electricity, natural gas and other necessary raw materials for the steel manufacturing process are generally readily available, although they can be subject to significant price fluctuations. 

Our international fabrication operations have expanded downstream captive uses for a portion of the rebar and wire rod manufactured at the Poland minimill. We conduct rebar fabrication activities in Zawiercie, &#379;yrard&#243;w and G&#322;og&#243;w Ma&#322;opolski, Poland. These three rebar fabrication facilities are similar to those operated by our U.S. fabrication facilities and sell fabricated rebar to contractors for incorporation into construction projects. In addition to fabricated rebar, these facilities sell fabricated mesh, assembled rebar cages and other rebar by-products. 

Additionally, we operate a fabrication facility in D&#261;browa G&#243;rnicza, Poland that produces welded steel mesh, cold rolled wire rod and cold rolled rebar. This operation enables our international fabrication operations to supplement sales of fabricated rebar by also offering wire mesh to customers which include metals service centers and construction contractors. We maintain a presence in the Polish fabrication market but we also sell to neighboring countries such as the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovakia. 

Backlog in our international fabrication operations was approximately $26.7 million at August 31, 2016 &#32;compared to $16.8 million at August 31, 2015 . Our Poland minimill generally fills orders for stock products from inventory or with products near completion. As a result, we do not believe that backlog levels are a significant factor in the evaluation of these operations. Backlog for our Poland minimill at August 31, 2016 &#32;was approximately $41.4 million compared to $25.3 million at August 31, 2015 . No single customer represented 10% or more of our International Mill segment's net sales in fiscal 2016 , 2015 &#32;and 2014 . 

INTERNATIONAL MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION 

Our International Marketing and Distribution segment includes international operations for the sales, distribution and processing of steel products, ferrous and nonferrous metals and other industrial products. Additionally, this segment includes two of our marketing and distribution divisions headquartered in the United States, CMC Cometals and CMC Cometals Steel, and a recycling facility in Singapore. We buy and sell primary and secondary metals, fabricated metals, semi-finished, long and flat steel products and other industrial products. During the past year, our International Marketing and Distribution facilities sold approximately 2.7 million short tons of steel products in addition to raw materials. We market and distribute these products through our global network of offices and processing facilities. 

We purchase steel products, industrial minerals, ores, metal concentrates and ferroalloys from producers in the U.S. and international markets. We utilize long-term contracts, spot market purchases and trading transactions to purchase materials. To obtain favorable long-term supply agreements, we occasionally offer assistance to producers by arranging structured finance transactions to suit their objectives. 

We sell our products to customers, primarily manufacturers, in the steel, nonferrous metals, metal fabrication, chemical, refractory, construction and transportation industries. We sell directly to our customers through and with the assistance of our offices in Irving, Texas; Fort Lee, New Jersey; Sydney and Melbourne, Australia; Singapore; Bangkok, Thailand; Luxembourg; K&#252;rten, Germany; Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom; Temse, Belgium; Hong Kong; Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai, China. We have representative offices in Moscow, Russia and Klang, Malaysia, and we have agents located in significant international markets. Our network of offices share information regarding the demand for our materials, assists with negotiation and performance of contracts and other services for our customers and identifies and maintains relationships with our sources of supply. 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we made the decision to exit our steel trading business headquartered in Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom. The Company's severance and exit costs incurred in connection with this decision, were not material. The operation will service existing customer commitments and we expect to wind down operations and liquidate any remaining inventories over the next several months. 

In most transactions, we act as a principal by taking title and ownership of the products. We are at times designated as a marketing representative, sometimes exclusively, by product suppliers, and on occasion we act as a broker for these products. We buy and sell these products in almost all major markets throughout the world where permitted by U.S. law. 

As opposed to companies that trade commodity futures contracts and frequently do not take delivery, we market physical products. As a result of sophisticated global communications, our customers and suppliers often have easy access to quoted market prices, although such price quotes are not always indicative of actual transaction prices. Therefore, to distinguish ourselves, we focus on value-added services for both sellers and buyers. Our services include actual physical market pricing and trend information (in contrast to market information from more speculative metal exchange futures), technical information and assistance, financing, transportation and shipping (including chartering of vessels), storage, warehousing, just-in-time delivery, insurance, hedging and the ability to consolidate smaller purchases and sales into larger, more cost efficient transactions. We limit exposure to price fluctuations by generally offsetting purchases with concurrent sales. We also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts as economic hedges of sales and purchase commitments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar or the functional currency of our international subsidiaries. In general, we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. 

This segment also operates a recycling facility in Singapore. The facility is similar to those operated by our Americas Recycling segment but on a smaller scale and is operated as part of the International Marketing and Distribution segment due to its oversight by managers in this segment. 

We believe we are one of the largest marketers of imported steel in Australia. Despite focused efforts and substantial progress to stabilize and improve the results of the Australian distribution business, we determined that achieving acceptable financial returns would take additional time and investment. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we made the decision to exit our steel distribution business in Australia. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we completed the sale of six locations that were part of our Australian steel distribution business and we ceased all operations at three other locations that were part of our Australian steel distribution business. On July 10, 2016, we completed the sale of the remaining Australian steel distribution business. We have included the 

results of the sales and the activity related to our Australian steel distribution businesses in discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of earnings for all periods presented. 

For financial data on the above segments, see Note 22, Business Segments, to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

SEASONALITY 

Many of our mills and fabrication facilities serve customers in the construction industry. Due to the increase in construction during the spring and summer months, our net sales are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year than in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year. 

COMPETITION 

The nonferrous recycling industry is fragmented in the U.S. However, we believe our Americas Recycling segment is one of the largest entities engaged in the recycling of nonferrous metals in the U.S. We are also a major regional processor of ferrous metal. The metal processing business is subject to cyclical fluctuations based upon the availability and price of unprocessed scrap metal and the demand for steel and nonferrous metals. In our Americas Recycling segment, we compete primarily on price and on the services we provide to scrap suppliers and generators. The price offered for scrap metal is the principal competitive factor in acquiring material from smaller scrap metals collection firms. Industrial generators of scrap metal may also consider factors other than price, such as supplying appropriate collection containers, timely removal, reliable documentation including accurate and detailed purchase records with customized reports, the ability to service multiple locations, insurance coverage, and the buyer's financial strength. 

Our Americas Mills segment competes with regional, national and foreign manufacturers of steel. We produce a significant percentage of the total domestic output of rebar and merchant bar. We do not produce a significant percentage of the total U.S. output of our other products. However, we are considered a substantial supplier in the geographic areas near our facilities. We compete primarily on the services we provide to our customers and on the price and quality of our products. See "Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Industry" below. 

Our Americas Fabrication segment competes with regional and national suppliers. We believe that we are among the largest fabricators of rebar in the U.S. We also believe that we are the largest manufacturer of steel fence posts in the U.S. We compete primarily on price, although we also compete based on the value added services we provide to our customers, our speed of delivery, ability to service large projects, and technical capability. 

Our International Mill segment competes with several large manufacturers of rebar and wire rod in Central and Eastern Europe, primarily on the basis of price, quality and product availability. We also compete on delivery times utilizing our global supply chain of steel producers and logistic partners. We believe we are the largest producer of merchant bars for the products we produce and the second largest producer of rebar and wire rod in Poland. 

Our International Marketing and Distribution segment operates in a highly competitive sector. We compete primarily on the price, quality and reliability of our products, our financing alternatives and the additional services we provide. In this business, we compete with other U.S. and international trading companies, some of which are larger and may have access to greater financial resources. In addition, some of our competitors may be able to pursue business without restriction by the laws of the U.S. We also compete with industrial consumers who purchase directly from suppliers, and from importers and manufacturers of semi-finished ferrous and nonferrous metals. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

A significant factor in our business is our compliance with environmental laws and regulations. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors &#8212; Risks Related to Our Industry" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Compliance with and changes in various environmental requirements and environmental risks applicable to our industry may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 

Occasionally, we may be required to clean up or take certain remediation action with regard to sites we use or formerly used in our operations. We may also be required to pay for a portion of the cleanup or remediation cost at sites we never owned or at sites which we never operated, if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or "Superfund") and analogous state statutes, we could be responsible for both the costs of cleanup as well as for associated natural resource damages. The U.S. 

Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), or equivalent state agency, has named us as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at several federal Superfund sites or similar state sites. In some cases, these agencies allege that we are one of many PRPs responsible for the cleanup of a site because we sold scrap metals to or otherwise disposed of materials at the site. With respect to the sale of scrap metals, we contend that an arm's length sale of valuable scrap metal for use as a raw material in a manufacturing process that we do not control should not constitute "an arrangement for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances" as defined under federal law. In 2000, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act was signed into law which, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, provides legitimate sellers of scrap metal for recycling with some relief from Superfund liability under federal law. Despite Congress' clarification of the intent of the federal law, some state laws and environmental agencies still seek to impose such liability. We believe efforts to impose such liability are contrary to public policy objectives and legislation encouraging recycling and promoting the use of recycled materials, and we continue to support clarification of state laws and regulations consistent with Congress' action. 

New federal, state and local laws, regulations and the varying interpretations of such laws by regulatory agencies and the judiciary impact how much money we spend on environmental compliance. In addition, uncertainty regarding adequate control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions impact our future expenditures in order to comply with environmental requirements. We cannot predict the total amount of capital expenditures or increases in operating costs or other expenses that may be required as a result of environmental compliance. We also do not know if we can pass such costs on to our customers through product price increases. During fiscal 2016 , we incurred environmental costs including disposal, permits, license fees, tests, studies, remediation, consultant fees and environmental personnel expense of $33.9 million . In addition, during fiscal 2016 , we spent approximately $19.6 million &#32;on capital expenditures for environmental projects. We believe that our facilities are in material compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations.
