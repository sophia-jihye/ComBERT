 ITEM 1. Business. 

Ford Motor Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1919. We acquired the business of a Michigan company, also known as Ford Motor Company, which had been incorporated in 1903 to produce and sell automobiles designed and engineered by Henry Ford. We are a global automotive and mobility company based in Dearborn, Michigan. With about 199,000 employees and 67 plants worldwide, our core business includes designing, manufacturing, marketing, financing, and servicing a full line of Ford cars, trucks, SUVs, and electrified vehicles, as well as Lincoln luxury vehicles. At the same time, we are aggressively pursuing emerging opportunities through Ford Smart Mobility, our plan to be a leader in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, the customer experience, and data and analytics. We provide financial services through Ford Motor Credit Company LLC (&#8220;Ford Credit&#8221;).

OVERVIEW 

Segments. We review and present our business results in two sectors: Automotive and Financial Services. Within these sectors, our business is divided into reportable segments (referred to herein as &#8220;segments,&#8221; &#8220;business units,&#8221; or &#8220;regions&#8221;) based on the organizational structure that we use to evaluate performance and make decisions on resource allocation, as well as availability and materiality of separate financial results consistent with that structure. 

The reportable segments within our Automotive and Financial Services sectors at December 31, 2015 were as described in the table below:

AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR 

General 

Our vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln. In 2015, we sold approximately 6,635,000 vehicles at wholesale throughout the world. See &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; (&#8220;Item 7&#8221;) for discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volumes. 

Substantially all of our vehicles, parts, and accessories are sold through distributors and dealers (collectively, &#8220;dealerships&#8221;), the substantial majority of which are independently owned. At December 31, 2015, the approximate number of dealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands was as follows: 

Brand 

Number of Dealerships 

at December 31, 2015

10,727

Total 

11,971 

We do not depend on any single customer or a few customers to the extent that the loss of such customers would have a material adverse effect on our business. 

In addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale, we also sell vehicles to our dealerships for sale to fleet customers, including commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments. We also sell parts and accessories, primarily to our dealerships (which in turn sell these products to retail customers) and to authorized parts distributors (which in turn primarily sell these products to retailers). We also offer extended service contracts. 

The worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic conditions over which we have little control. Vehicles are durable goods, and consumers have latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing vehicle. The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth, 

Item 1. Business (Continued) &#32;&#32; &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

geopolitical events, and other factors (including the cost of purchasing and operating cars and trucks and the availability and cost of financing and fuel). As we have seen in the United States and Europe, in particular, the number of cars and trucks sold may vary substantially from year to year. Further, the automotive industry is a highly competitive business that has a wide and growing variety of product offerings from a growing number of manufacturers. 

Our wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand. Our wholesale unit volumes also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory. Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived in comparison to those offered by other manufacturers based on many factors, including price, quality, styling, reliability, safety, fuel efficiency, functionality, and reputation. Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions. Our ability to satisfy changing consumer preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle, as well as design and performance characteristics, affects our sales and earnings significantly. 

As with other manufacturers, the profitability of our business is affected by many factors, including: 

&#8226; 

Wholesale unit volumes 

&#8226; 

Margin of profit on each vehicle sold - which in turn is affected by many factors, such as: 

&#9702; 

Market factors - volume and mix of vehicles and options sold, and net pricing (reflecting, among other factors, incentive programs) 

&#9702; 

Costs of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles 

&#9702; 

Costs for customer warranty claims and additional service actions 

&#9702; 

Costs for safety, emissions, and fuel economy technology and equipment 

&#8226; 

A high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can significantly affect overall profitability 

Our industry has a very competitive pricing environment, driven in part by industry excess capacity, which is concentrated in Europe and Asia but affects other markets because much of this capacity can be redirected to other markets. The decline in the value of the yen during the past four years also has contributed significantly to competitive pressures in many of our markets. For the past several decades, manufacturers typically have given price discounts and other marketing incentives to maintain market share and production levels. A discussion of our strategies to compete in this pricing environment is set forth in the &#8220;Overview&#8221; section in Item 7. 

Competitive Position. The worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers, with no single dominant producer. Certain manufacturers, however, account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries, especially their countries of origin. Key competitors with global presence include Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, General Motors Company, Honda Motor Company, Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Renault-Nissan B.V., Suzuki Motor Corporation, Toyota Motor Corporation, and Volkswagen AG Group. 

Seasonality. We generally record the sale of a vehicle (and recognize revenue) when it is produced and shipped or delivered to our customer (i.e., the dealership). See the &#8220;Overview&#8221; section in Item 7 for additional discussion of revenue recognition practices. 

We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors, including retail sales (i.e., units sold by our dealerships to their customers at retail) and dealer stock levels (i.e., the number of units held in inventory by our dealerships for sale to their customers). Historically, we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in the business, with production in many markets tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer (typically the strongest sales months of the year). 

Raw Materials. We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in production of our vehicles. These materials include base metals (e.g., steel, iron castings, and aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene). We believe we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs. There always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials, however, which could impact availability in sufficient quantities to meet our needs. See the &#8220;Overview&#8221; section of Item 7 for a discussion of commodity and energy price trends, and &#8220;Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk&#8221; (&#8220;Item 7A&#8221;) for a discussion of commodity price risks. 

Backlog Orders. We generally produce and ship our products on average within approximately 20 days after an order is deemed to become firm. Therefore, no significant amount of backlog orders accumulates during any period. 

Item 1. Business (Continued) &#32;&#32; &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Intellectual Property. We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, copyrights, and trademarks on a global basis. Our policy is to protect our competitive position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and international patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. We have generated a large number of patents, and expect this portfolio to continue to grow as we actively pursue additional technological innovation. We have approximately 38,500 active patents and pending patent applications globally, with an average age for patents in our active patent portfolio of just over five years. In addition to this intellectual property, we also rely on our proprietary knowledge and ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Although we believe these patents, patent applications, and know-how, in the aggregate, are important to the conduct of our business, and we obtain licenses to use certain intellectual property owned by others, none is individually considered material to our business. We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our Company and its products and services globally. Certain of these marks are integral to the conduct of our business, a loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Warranty Coverage, Field Service Actions, and Customer Satisfaction Actions. We provide warranties on vehicles we sell. Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage, and vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of its sale. Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust all parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period. In addition to the costs associated with this warranty coverage provided on our vehicles, we also incur costs as a result of field service actions (i.e., safety recalls, emission recalls, and other product campaigns), and for customer satisfaction actions. 

For additional information regarding warranty and related costs, see &#8220;Critical Accounting Estimates&#8221; in Item 7 and Note 27 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

______________ 

(a) 

Industry volume is an internal estimate based on publicly-available data collected from various government, private, and public sources around the globe and is based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations. 

(b) 

Market share represents reported retail sales of our brands as a percent of total industry volume in the relevant market or region. Market share is based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations; includes medium and heavy trucks. 

(c) 

Wholesale unit volume includes sales of medium and heavy trucks. Wholesale unit volume includes all Ford and Lincoln badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate) that are sold to dealerships, units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers, units distributed for other manufacturers, and local brand units produced by our unconsolidated Chinese joint venture Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. (&#8220;JMC&#8221;) that are sold to dealerships. Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option (i.e., rental repurchase), as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), also are included in wholesale unit volume. Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volume (specifically, Ford badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, as well as JMC brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue. 

(d) 

Amounts shown are based on total Europe. We previously reported these amounts on a Europe 20 basis, which consisted of Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Europe 20 industry volume was 16.0 million, 14.6 million, and 13.8 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Europe 20 market share was 8.0%, 7.9%, and 7.8% in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. 

(e) 

China industry volume and market share for years shown above are based on estimated wholesales. In 2016, we will begin using estimated vehicle registrations as a basis for calculating industry volume and market share. China industry volume, based on estimated vehicle registrations, was 23.5 million units in 2015. 

(f) 

ASEAN includes Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia. 

(g)

FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR 

Ford Motor Credit Company LLC 

Our wholly-owned subsidiary Ford Credit offers a wide variety of automotive financing products to and through automotive dealers throughout the world. The predominant share of Ford Credit&#8217;s business consists of financing our vehicles and supporting our dealers. Ford Credit earns its revenue primarily from payments made under retail installment sale and lease contracts that it originates and purchases; interest rate supplements and other support payments from us and our subsidiaries; and payments made under dealer financing programs. 

As a result of these financing activities, Ford Credit has a large portfolio of finance receivables and operating leases which it classifies into two portfolios&#8212; &#8220;consumer&#8221; and &#8220;non-consumer.&#8221; Finance receivables and operating leases in the consumer portfolio include products offered to individuals and businesses that finance the acquisition of our vehicles from dealers for personal and commercial use. Retail financing includes retail installment sale contracts for new and used vehicles and direct financing leases for new vehicles to retail and commercial customers including leasing companies, government entities, daily rental companies, and fleet customers. Finance receivables in the non-consumer portfolio include products offered to automotive dealers. Ford Credit makes wholesale loans to dealers to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory (i.e., floorplan financing), as well as loans to dealers to finance working capital and improvements to dealership facilities, finance the purchase of dealership real estate, and finance other dealer vehicle programs. Ford Credit also purchases receivables generated by us and our subsidiaries, primarily related to the sale of parts and accessories to dealers, receivables from Ford-related loans, and certain used vehicles from daily rental fleet companies. 

Ford Credit does business in the United States and Canada through business centers. Outside of the United States, Europe is Ford Credit&#8217;s largest operation. Ford Credit&#8217;s European operations are managed through its United Kingdom-based subsidiary, FCE Bank plc (&#8220;FCE&#8221;). Within Europe, FCE&#8217;s largest markets are the United Kingdom and Germany, representing 67% of FCE&#8217;s finance receivables and operating leases. 

The following table shows Ford Credit&#8217;s financing shares of new Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold in the United States and new Ford vehicles sold in Europe, as well as its wholesale financing shares of new Ford and Lincoln vehicles acquired by dealers in the United States (excluding fleet) and new Ford vehicles acquired by dealers in Europe:

See Item 7A for discussion of how Ford Credit manages its financial market risks. 

We routinely sponsor special retail and lease incentives to dealers&#8217; customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit. In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease payments offered to the retail customer, we pay the value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract. These programs increase Ford Credit&#8217;s financing volume and share. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information about our accounting for these programs. 

On April 30, 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated Relationship Agreement with Ford Credit, pursuant to which, if Ford Credit&#8217;s managed leverage for a calendar quarter were to be higher than 11.5:1 (as reported in its most recent periodic report), Ford Credit could require us to make or cause to be made a capital contribution to it in an amount sufficient to have caused such managed leverage to have been 11.5:1. No capital contributions have been made pursuant to this agreement. The agreement also limits to $3 billion the amount Ford Credit may borrow under our Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of April 30, 2015. In a separate agreement with FCE, Ford Credit also has agreed to maintain FCE&#8217;s net worth in excess of $500 million; no payments have been made pursuant to that agreement.

GOVERNMENTAL STANDARDS 

Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. &#160; In addition, manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances. The most significant of the standards and regulations affecting us are discussed below: 

Vehicle Emissions Control 

U.S. Requirements &#8211; &#32;Federal Emission Standards. &#160; The federal Clean Air Act imposes stringent limits on the amount of regulated pollutants that lawfully may be emitted by new vehicles and engines produced for sale in the United States. In &#160; 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) finalized new &#8220;Tier 3&#8221; regulations that phase in increasingly stringent motor vehicle emission standards beginning with the 2017 model year; compliance with these standards could be challenging. Compliance with automobile emission standards depends in part on the widespread availability of high-quality and consistent automotive fuels that the vehicles were designed to use. Fuel variables that can affect vehicle emissions include ethanol content, octane ratings, and the use of metallic-based fuel additives, among other things. There are various ongoing regulatory and judicial proceedings related to fuel quality at the national and state level, and the outcome of these proceedings could affect vehicle manufacturers&#8217; warranty costs as well as their ability to comply with vehicle emission standards. 

&#160; 

U.S. Requirements &#8211; &#32;California and Other State Emission Standards. &#160; Pursuant to the Clean Air Act, California may establish its own unique vehicle emission standards; the California standards can also be adopted by other states. The California Air Resources Board (&#8220;CARB&#8221;) has adopted &#8220;LEV III&#8221; standards, which took effect with the 2015 model year and impose increasingly stringent tailpipe and evaporative emissions requirements for light and medium duty vehicles. Thirteen states, primarily located in the Northeast and Northwest, have adopted the LEV III standards. 

The California vehicle emissions program also includes requirements for manufacturers to produce and deliver for sale zero-emission vehicles (&#8220;ZEVs&#8221;). The current ZEV regulations mandate substantial annual increases in the production and sale of battery-electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, particularly for the 2018&#8211;2025 model years. By the 2025 model year, approximately 15% of a manufacturer&#8217;s total California sales volume will need to be made up of such vehicles. Compliance with ZEV rules could have a substantial adverse effect on our sales volumes and profits. We are concerned that the market and infrastructure in California may not support the large volume of advanced-technology vehicles that manufacturers will be required to produce, especially if gasoline prices remain relatively low . We also are concerned about enforcement of the ZEV mandate in other states that have adopted California&#8217;s ZEV program, where the existence of a market for such vehicles is even less certain. CARB conducts periodic reviews of its upcoming ZEV requirements, taking into account factors such as technology developments and market acceptance. Ford and the industry will be active participants in such reviews, with the goal of ensuring that ZEV requirements are feasible and not excessively burdensome. 

&#160; 

European Requirements. &#160; European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) directives and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the EU. &#160; Stringent new Stage 6 emission standards took effect for vehicle registrations starting in September &#160; 2014, with a second phase beginning in September 2017. These standards will drive the need for additional diesel exhaust after-treatment, which will add cost and potentially impact the diesel CO 2 &#32;advantage. The European Commission has also proposed new Real Driving Emission (RDE) rules, which will require manufacturers to conduct on-road emission tests using portable emission analyzers. These on-road emission tests will complement the laboratory-based tests. During the initial phase, which started in January 2016, the RDE tests are used for monitoring purposes. Beginning in September 2017, manufacturers will have to reduce the divergence between the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory conditions and the values of RDE tests (&#8220;conformity factors&#8221;). The additional costs associated with conducting the RDE tests and complying with the conformity factors are expected to be significant. 

Other National Requirements. &#160; Many countries, in an effort to address air quality concerns, are adopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (&#8220;UN-ECE&#8221;) mobile source emission regulations. Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of European or U.S. regulations; for example, China adopted emission regulations for large cities based on European Stage V emission standards. Korea and Taiwan have adopted very stringent U.S.-based standards for gasoline vehicles and European-based standards for diesel vehicles. &#160; Although these countries have adopted regulations based on UN-ECE or U.S. standards, there may be some unique testing provisions that require emission-control systems to be redesigned for

these markets. &#160; Canadian criteria emissions regulations are aligned with U.S. Tier 2 requirements. In July 2015, the Canadian federal government amended the On-Road Vehicle and Engine Emission Regulations &#32;and the Sulphur in Gasoline Regulations to align Canadian emission standards with the U.S. Tier 3 regulations discussed above. 

Not all countries have adopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emission standards adopted. &#160; This could lead to compliance problems, particularly if on-board diagnostic or in-use surveillance requirements are implemented. 

Brazil and Chile have introduced stringent emission and on-board diagnostic standards based on the European Stage 5 standards for light duty vehicles and Stage V standards for heavy duty vehicles. In Brazil, more stringent on-board diagnostic standards for diesel light duty vehicles will be introduced in 2017. Argentina is phasing in European Stage 5 standards for all new light duty vehicle registrations by 2017 and European Stage V standards for heavy duty vehicles by 2018. 

Global Developments. In September 2015, the EPA and CARB announced that they were investigating a major competitor in connection with its alleged use of &#8220;defeat devices&#8221; in hundreds of thousands of light-duty diesel vehicles. The announcement triggered similar investigations of the competitor by regulators in other countries. Defeat devices are elements of design (typically embedded in software) that improperly cause the emission control system to function less effectively during normal on-road driving than during an official laboratory emissions test, without justification. They are prohibited by law in many jurisdictions, including the United States and Europe. We do not use defeat devices in our vehicles. 

The investigations by the EPA and CARB of our competitor have led to increased scrutiny of automakers&#8217; emission testing by regulators around the world. The EPA began carrying out additional non-standard tests as part of its vehicle certification program, following an announcement in September 2015. The EU accelerated efforts to finalize its RDE testing program as described above. Several European countries, including France and Germany, are conducting non-standard emission tests and meeting with manufacturers to discuss the results. 

Vehicle Fuel Economy and Greenhouse Gas Standards 

U.S. Requirements &#8211; &#32;Light Duty Vehicles . &#32;Federal law requires that light duty vehicles meet minimum corporate average fuel economy (&#8220;CAFE&#8221;) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (&#8220;NHTSA&#8221;). Manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all available credits for the preceding three model years and expected credits for the five succeeding model years. The law requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each manufacturer&#8217;s fleet of domestic passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light duty trucks. 

The EPA also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas (&#8220;GHG&#8221;) emissions under the Clean Air Act. Because the vast majority of GHGs emitted by a vehicle are the result of fuel combustion, GHG emission standards effectively are fuel economy standards. Thus, it is necessary for NHTSA and EPA to coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and GHG standards, respectively, to avoid potential inconsistencies. 

In 2010, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated regulations establishing the &#8220;One National Program&#8221; of CAFE and GHG regulations for light duty vehicles for the 2012-2016 model years. In 2012, EPA and NHTSA jointly promulgated regulations extending the One National Program framework through the 2025 model year. These rules require manufacturers to achieve, across the industry, a light duty fleet average fuel economy of approximately 35.5 mpg by the 2016 model year, 45 mpg by the 2021 model year, and 54.5 mpg by the 2025 &#160; model year. Each manufacturer&#8217;s specific task depends on the mix of vehicles it sells. The rules include the opportunity for manufacturers to earn credits for technologies that achieve real-world CO 2 &#32;reductions, and fuel economy improvements that are not captured by EPA fuel economy test procedures. Manufacturers also can earn credits for GHG reductions not specifically tied to fuel economy, such as improvements in air conditioning systems. 

The One National Program standards become increasingly stringent over time, and they will be difficult to meet if fuel prices remain relatively low and market conditions do not drive consumers to purchase electric vehicles and other highly fuel-efficient vehicles in large numbers. The rules provide for a midterm evaluation process under which, by 2018, EPA and NHTSA will re-evaluate their standards for model years 2022&#8211;2025 in order to ensure that those standards are feasible and optimal in light of intervening events. We are particularly concerned about the commercial feasibility of meeting the 2022&#8211;2025 model year GHG and CAFE standards, and therefore the midterm evaluation process is very important to Ford and the auto industry. Ford&#8217;s ability to comply with the 2022&#8211;2025 model year standards remains unclear because of the many unknowns regarding technology development, market conditions, and other factors so far 

Item 1. Business (Continued) &#32;&#32; &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

into the future. We intend to be an active participant in the midterm evaluation process for these standards. Our concern about the feasibility of the fuel economy and GHG standards also extends to some of the pre-2022 model year standards, which are not covered by the midterm evaluation. 

If the agencies seek to impose and enforce fuel economy and GHG standards that are misaligned with market conditions, we likely would be forced to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on our sales volume and profits. Such actions likely would include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options; increasing market support programs for our most fuel-efficient cars and light trucks; and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicles such as high-performance cars, utilities, and/or full-size light trucks, in order to maintain compliance. 

California has asserted the right to regulate motor vehicle GHG emissions, and other states have asserted the right to adopt the California standards. With the adoption of the federal One National Program standards discussed above, California and the other states have agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with any purported state GHG requirements for the 2012&#8211;2025 model years. This avoids a patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state GHG standards. Should California and other states ever renew their efforts to enforce state-specific motor vehicle GHG rules, this would impose significant costs on automotive manufacturers. 

U.S. Requirements &#8211; &#32;Heavy Duty Vehicles. EPA and NHTSA have jointly promulgated GHG and fuel economy standards on heavy duty vehicles (generally, vehicles over 8,500 &#160; pounds gross vehicle weight rating). In our case, the standards primarily affect our heavy duty pickup trucks and vans, plus vocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks. EPA and NHTSA are expected to finalize new rules in 2016 setting GHG and fuel economy standards for these vehicles, covering model years 2019&#8211;2027. As the heavy-duty standards increase in stringency, it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavy duty trucks. 

European Requirements. &#32;&#32;In December 2008, the EU approved regulation of passenger car CO 2 &#32;emissions beginning in 2012 that limits the industry fleet average to a maximum of 130 grams per kilometer (&#8220;g/km&#8221;), using a sliding scale based on vehicle weight. This regulation provides different targets for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for its fleet of vehicles. Limited credits are available for CO 2 &#32;off-cycle actions (&#8220;eco-innovations&#8221;), certain alternative fuels, and vehicles with CO 2 &#32;emissions below 50 g/km. A penalty system will apply for manufacturers failing to meet targets, with fees ranging from &#8364; 5 to &#8364; 95 per vehicle per g/km shortfall in the years 2012&#8211;2018, and &#8364; 95 per g/km shortfall beginning in 2019. Pooling agreements between different manufacturers are possible, although it is not clear that these will be of much practical benefit under the regulations. Starting in 2020, an industry target of 95 g/km has been set. Other non-EU European countries are likely to follow with similar regulations. For example, Switzerland has introduced similar rules, which began phasing-in starting in July 2012 with the same targets (which likely also will include a 2020 target of 95 g/km), although the industry average emission target is significantly higher. We face the risk of advance premium payment requirements if, for example, unexpected market fluctuation within a quarter negatively impact our average fleet performance. 

In separate legislation, &#8220;complementary measures&#8221; have been mandated, including requirements related to fuel economy indicators, and more-efficient low-CO 2 &#32;mobile air conditioning systems. &#160; The EU Commission, Council and Parliament have approved a target for commercial light duty vehicles to be at an industry average of 175 g/km (with phase-in from 2014&#8211;2017), and 147 g/km in 2020; &#160; it is likely that other European countries, like Switzerland, will implement similar rules but under even more difficult conditions. This regulation also provides different targets for each manufacturer based on its respective average vehicle weight in its fleet of vehicles. &#160; The final mass and CO 2 &#32;requirements for &#8220;multi-stage vehicles&#8221; (e.g., our Transit chassis cabs) are fully allocated to the base manufacturer (e.g., Ford) so that the base manufacturer is fully responsible for the CO 2 &#32;performance of the final up-fitted vehicles. &#160; The EU proposal also includes a penalty system, &#8220;super-credits&#8221; for vehicles below 50 &#160; g/km, and limited credits for CO 2 &#32;off-cycle eco-innovations, pooling, etc., similar to the passenger car CO 2 &#32;regulation. 

The United Nations has a project underway to develop a new technical regulation for passenger car emissions and CO 2. &#32;This new world light duty test procedure (&#8220;WLTP&#8221;) is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory CO 2 &#32;and fuel consumption figures with customer-reported figures. The introduction of WLTP in Europe is likely to require updates to CO 2 &#32;labeling as early as 2018 and could increase certain consumer label values. Costs associated with new or incremental testing for WLTP could be significant. The European Commission continues to apply political pressure for mandatory WLTP testing for regulated emissions and CO 2 &#32;&#32;starting in September 2017. The European Commission has assured equivalent stringency to the existing fleet average rules for each automobile manufacturer if the 2020 fleet average targets are required to be measured on WLTP instead of under the current European New European Driving Cycle (&#8220;NEDC&#8221;) requirements. 

Item 1. Business (Continued) &#32;&#32; &#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32; 

Some European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO 2 &#32;vehicle emissions, including fiscal measures and CO 2 &#32;labeling. &#160; For example, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, among others, have introduced taxation based on CO 2 &#32;emissions. &#160; The EU CO 2 &#32;requirements are likely to trigger further measures. To limit GHG emissions, the EU directive on mobile air conditioning currently requires the replacement of the current refrigerant with a lower &#8220;global warming potential&#8221; refrigerant for new vehicle types, and for all newly registered vehicles starting in January 2017. A refrigerant change adds considerable costs along the whole manufacturing chain. 

Other National Requirements. &#160; The Canadian federal government has regulated vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, beginning with the 2011 model year. &#160; The standards track the U.S. EPA GHG regulations for the 2012&#8211;2016 model years. &#160; In October 2014, the Canadian federal government published the final changes to the regulation for light duty vehicles, which maintain alignment with U.S. EPA vehicle GHG standards for the 2017&#8211;2025 model years. The final regulation for 2014&#8211;2018 heavy duty vehicles was published in February 2013. In October 2014, the Canadian federal government published the Notice of Intent to regulate heavy duty vehicles and engines for model year 2019 and beyond, which tracks U.S. EPA standards. 

Mexico adopted fuel economy/CO 2 &#32;standards, based on the U.S. One National Program framework, that took effect in 2014. 

Many Asia Pacific countries (such as Australia, China, India, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam) are developing or enforcing fuel efficiency or labeling targets. For example, South Korea has set fuel efficiency targets for 2020, with incentives for early adoption. China published standards for Stage IV fuel efficiency targets for 2016&#8211;2020. The fuel efficiency targets will impact the cost of vehicle technology in the future. 

In South America, Brazil introduced a voluntary vehicle energy-efficiency labeling program, indicating fuel consumption rates for all light-duty vehicles. Brazil has required inclusion of emission classification on fuel economy labels since January 2016. Brazil also published a new automotive regime establishing a minimum absolute CAFE value as a function of Fleet Corporate Average Mass for 2017 light duty vehicles with a spark ignition engine in order to qualify for industrialized products tax reduction. Additional tax reductions are available if further fuel efficiency improvements are achieved. A severe penalty system will apply to qualified manufacturers failing to meet fuel efficiency requirements for the 2013&#8211;2017 sales period. Brazil reduced import tax on electric and hybrid cars. The tax rate, which was 35%, will vary from zero to 7%, depending on a vehicle&#8217;s energy efficiency. Chile introduced a tax based on urban fuel consumption and NOx emission for light and medium vehicles beginning in late 2014. In general, fuel efficiency targets may impact the cost of technology of our models in the future. 

In the Middle East, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia introduced new light duty vehicle fuel economy standards, which are patterned after the U.S. CAFE standard structure, with fuel economy targets following the design of the U.S. 2012&#8211;2016 fuel economy standards. The standards became effective on January 1, 2016 and will be fully phased in by the end of 2017. 

Vehicle Safety 

U.S. Requirements. &#32;&#32;The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the &#8220;Safety Act&#8221;) regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in two primary ways. First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA. Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emission and fuel economy standards. Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns. A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial. 

Other National Requirements. &#160; The EU and many countries have established vehicle safety standards and regulations, and are likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirements in the future. &#160; The European General Safety Regulation introduced United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (&#8220;UN-ECE&#8221;) regulations, which will be required for the European Type Approval process. &#160; EU regulators also are focusing on active safety features such as lane departure warning systems, electronic stability control, and automatic brake assist. &#160; Globally, governments generally have been adopting UN-ECE based regulations with minor variations to address local concerns. &#160; Any difference between North American and UN-ECE based regulations can add complexity and costs to the development of global platform vehicles, and we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing a common level of safety performance; several recently launched bilateral negotiations on free trade can potentially contribute to this goal. New safety and recall requirements in China, India, and Gulf Cooperation Council countries also

may add substantial costs and complexity to our global recall practice. In South America, additional safety requirements are being introduced or proposed in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Uruguay, influenced by The New Car Assessment Programme for Latin America and the Caribbean (&#8220;Latin NCAP&#8221;), which may be a driver for similar actions in other countries. In Canada, regulatory requirements are currently aligned with U.S. regulations. However, recent amendments to the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Act have introduced broad powers to the Minister of Transport to order manufacturers to submit a notice of defect or non-compliance when the Minister considers it would be in the interest of safety.

(a) 

2015 includes employees of Ford Sollers, our joint-venture in Russia that was consolidated effective March 31, 2015. 

The year-over-year increase in employment primarily reflects hiring in North America to support product-led growth initiatives and increased vehicle production. 

Substantially all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. In the United States, approximately 99% of these unionized hourly employees in our Automotive sector are represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (&#8220;UAW&#8221; or &#8220;United Auto Workers&#8221;). Approximately 1.5% of our U.S. salaried employees are represented by unions. Many non-management salaried employees at our operations outside of the United States also are represented by unions. 

In 2015, we entered into a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the UAW covering approximately 53,000 employees in the United States. The terms of the agreement provide us with opportunities to improve our productivity and put us on common footing with our domestic competitors regarding labor cost structure. Overall, including the ratification and lump sum bonuses, our U.S. labor costs are expected to increase by less than 1.5% a year during the term of the agreement. 

In 2015, we also entered into collective bargaining agreements (covering wages, benefits and/or other employment provisions) with unions in Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, India, Mexico, New Zealand, Romania, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom. 

In 2016, we will negotiate collective bargaining agreements (covering wages, benefits and/or other employment provisions) with unions in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Taiwan and Thailand.
