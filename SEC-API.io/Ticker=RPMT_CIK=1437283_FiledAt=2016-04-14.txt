 ITEM 1. BUSINESS . 

General Development 

&#160; 

Virtual Piggy, Inc. (the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221;, or &#8220;us&#8221;) was incorporated in Delaware on February 11, 2008 under the name Chimera International Group, Inc. On April 4, 2008, we amended our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to Moggle, Inc. On August 22, 2011, we filed a Certificate of Ownership with the Secretary of State of Delaware, pursuant to which the Company&#8217;s newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Virtual Piggy Incorporated was merged into and with the Company (the &#8220;Merger&#8221;). In connection with the Merger and in accordance with Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the name of the Company was changed from &#8220;Moggle, Inc.&#8221; to &#8220;Virtual Piggy, Inc.&#8221; Our principal offices are located at 100 S. Murphy Avenue, Suite 200, Sunnyvale, California 94086 and our telephone number is (310) 853-1950 . 

On December 3, 2015, the Company incorporated a newly-formed wholly-owned Subsidiary, Finity, Inc. On December 11, 2015, the Company filed a Statement of Correction with the Pennsylvania Department of State, to change the name of Finity, Inc. to Finitii, Inc. The purpose of Finitii, Inc. is to teach children financial responsibility as a not for profit organization. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160;

As of the date of this report, we have not generated significant revenues. Our initial business plan was to develop an online game platform to allow game companies to create, monetize and distribute massive multiplayer online games (MMOG). The Virtual Piggy technology was the monetization component of this overall platform (our &#8220;Platform&#8221;). During 2010, we analyzed the market potential for an expanded Virtual Piggy solution and decided to concentrate our efforts on the delivery of a full-featured Virtual Piggy solution that was not restricted to online gaming. The expanded Virtual Piggy solution is designed to provide a complete online solution for families and parents to teach their children about financial management and spending on gaming, retail, music and entertainment. In late 2013, we rebranded our Virtual Piggy product under the name &#8220;Oink&#174;&#8221;. 

In the second half of 2015, the Company changed its management team. The new team is focused on building and improving the existing platform that will act as the foundation for the strategic alignment with the Financial Technology (&#8220;FinTech&#8221;) industry. The FinTech industry is composed primarily of startup companies that use software to provide financial services more efficiently and less costly than traditional financial service companies. 

&#160;

In March 2016, we discontinued our Oink product offering. 

Overview 

We are a technology company that will deliver an online ecommerce solution for the family. Our system allows parents and their children to manage, allocate funds and track their expenditures, savings and charitable giving online. Our system is designed to allow a minor to transact online without a credit card by gaining the parents&#8217; permission ahead of time and allowing the parent to set up the rules of use. 

Management believes that a future alternative for Virtual Piggy, Inc. will revolve around the FinTech industry with a partner-first go to market model in which established payments market leaders and vertical market participants can incorporate and integrate the company&#8217;s platform into co-branded payments solutions targeting youth and family. Management believes this approach will enable the company to reduce expenses while broadening its reach. 

Within this partner-first model, the company is incorporating licensing fees and customization services. This should enable the company to begin creating shareholder value above and beyond consumer transaction fees. 

In addition, the team is analyzing specific components of our technology for individual monetization as well as exploring opportunities in the Business to Business (&#8220;B2B&#8221;) realm. 

&#160; 

Industry Background 

There are over 800 million teens in the world and over 20 million in the US alone, most without credit cards. This is Generation Z (&#8220;Gen Z&#8221;), those born after the millennials (from 1995 to present) most of whom are currently under the age of 18 and are characterized by growing up in a highly sophisticated media and computer environment with greater internet savvy than any previous generation. They use the mobile internet more than any other generation on a daily basis. Marketers have been focused on the millennials for more than a decade. Gen Z is a generation that influences all family purchases and has disposable income. On average Gen Z receive $17/week in allowance which gives them $44 billion spending power in the US per year. 

Because there is no direct financial solution for this group, they still use either cash or their parent&#8217;s funding source (credit card) and hence there is still a lack of quantification of the dollar size of the kids &#8220;spending&#8221; market, which is separate from the dollars spent on kids. Marketers and regulators have taken note of the change and made a shift to a more &#8220;digital&#8221; approach to their overall strategy. Additionally, kids&#8217; access to increasingly available technology has fueled concerns about security, safety and compliance with government regulations. As children march toward adulthood, parents are providing the means for children to have products (money), and technology and providing them the increasingly easy opportunity to do so. 

With Gen Z in mind, the Company is focusing on the FinTech industry. Goldman Sachs has estimated that new FinTech companies could wrestle approximately $4.7 trillion in annual revenue and $470 billion in profit, away from established financial service companies. Additionally, over the last two years, venture capitalists have infused $23.5 billion into the FinTech industry. Of that investment, approximately 27% was invested in consumer lending, 23% in payments and 16% in business lending. The industry is priding itself on utilizing data in more productive ways and making the consumer interface smoother. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

The FinTech companies are not restricted by regulatory compliance nor antiquated systems with which the established financial services companies contend. These companies can concentrate on single purpose solutions, which are designed to enhance the user&#8217;s experience. The innovations taking place can be summarized in four categories: 

&#160; 

1. 

Peer-to-Peer (&#8220;P2P&#8221;) value exchanges &#8211; Growth of applications has been stimulated by the popularity and use of social networks. 

&#160; 

2. 

Applications with machine intelligence &#8211; Automation becoming a necessity in the do-it-yourself environment. 

&#160; 

3. 

Data-driven services &#8211; The ability to access data and data analytics are leading to more individualized products and lower pricing of financial services. 

&#160; 

4. 

Less definition between physical and virtual worlds &#8211; People are using financial services more in the virtual arena than in visiting physical locations. 

With this as a backdrop, Virtual Piggy has identified an emerging need to provide a financial platform that provides this generation with an alternative solution to traditional banking and solves current limitations on their ability to safely transact online. 

&#160; 

The Company&#8217;s Relationship to the Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act (&#8220;COPPA&#8221;) 

Though the Company does not target or collect the personal information of the under 13 age group, and rather targets parents and families as a whole, the products must still be compliant with COPPA. The new products will meet the requirements imposed by COPPA, including the recent amendments. 

Other Consumer Privacy Protection Legislation 

In late 2010, the Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) and the Department of Commerce (&#8220;DOC&#8221;) each issued a staff report proposing new frameworks for consumer privacy protection; the FTC report called for federal &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; legislation. The FTC has also increased its enforcement actions against companies that fail to live up to their privacy or data security commitments to consumers. A number of privacy and data security bills have been introduced in Congress that address the collection, maintenance and use of personal information, web browsing and geolocation data, and establish data security and breach notification requirements. Some state legislatures have adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate on the Internet, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches. Several Congressional hearings have examined privacy implications for online, offline and mobile data. The DOC recently issued a &#8220;green paper&#8221; on cybersecurity, and the White House has proposed cybersecurity legislation. 

A number of foreign governments also have either adopted or are considering data privacy and security regulations. For example, the EU is currently reviewing its data privacy directive, which became effective in 1998 and sets baseline standards for the collection, use, disclosure, storage, security and transfer of personal data (collectively referred to as &#8220;data processing&#8221;). Among the proposed revisions are new rules that strengthen requirements to obtain explicit consent for data processing; special rules requiring parental consent for collecting children&#8217;s personal data; data breach obligations for all industry sectors and enhanced remedies for violations of privacy. Different policy options, including new regulations, are being considered at both the EU and member state levels. 

The Opportunity 

&#160; 

Gen Z, the core target user of Virtual Piggy&#8217;s wallet platform. 

As consumers, Gen Z has deep pockets, but lacks direct access to funds. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Their spending power is significant and growing. According to the U.S. Census, Gen Z, will ultimately number close to 80 million. In 2015, 9.7% of adults said that their children influence 100% of what they buy, which is up from 7.6% in 2014 and 93% of parents say their children influence family spending and household purchases. 

Today, the average weekly allowance of a Gen Z is $17. And, Gen Z has a combined buying power of $44 billion in the US. 

Social and digital learning is key to Gen Z. 

52% of Gen Z uses YouTube or social media to research school assignments, while 85% research online and 33% watch lessons online. Sharing their knowledge is of equal importance with 60% of the Gen Z population opting to share their own knowledge with others online. 

Gen Z&#8217;s financial future and global impact has yet to be written. 

While 60% of Gen Z say &#8216;a lot of money&#8217; is a sign of success and 72% of Gen Z want to start a business one day, the details of how to make smart choices about money are not being shared. Only 17 states require a course in personal finance. Financial illiteracy is an epidemic and there&#8217;s no educational or private solution that has made an impact to scale. Gen Z is primed for deep engagement around future-focused payments solutions, but the conversation and learning and introduction of new financial technologies for this generation must occur within an experience that complements their values, interests and goals. 

&#160; 

Our Solution 

&#160; 

Our goal, moving forward is to enable both incumbent and new FinTech participants, as well as key verticals with a large base of &#8216;family accounts,&#8217; to provide their consumers with safe and empowering youth money management and financial literacy content and tools via a social digital wallet platform. 

Our partner profile includes established brands with large family-focused account bases &#8212; including banks, telecommunication companies, faith-based organizations, media distributors, mobile device Original Equipment Manufacturers (&#8220;OEMs&#8221;), and merchants. 

Virtual Piggy partners will leverage our platform to: 

Buy vs. Build: Partners can license a safe, compliant system, instead of building one on their own. 

Safety &#38; Security : Partners can safely engage a younger consumer segment &#38; their families with a new family friendly peer to peer payments approach. 

Youth Financial Literacy : Partners can expand their brand story around empowerment and education of youth financial literacy while engaging their &#8216;future customers&#8217; with Gen Z, a digital native population of post-millennial youth. 

The Virtual Piggy platform and associated digital wallet technology is designed to enable our partners to engage families with Gen Z through the leading money management, transactional and financial literacy platform that enables young people to make smart decisions about the things they value in life &#8212; including their money, their time, their ideas and their connections. 

In addition, we are analyzing specific components of our technology for individual monetization as well as exploring opportunities in the Business to Business (&#8220;B2B&#8221;) realm. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Our Intellectual Property 

Intellectual property is important to our business. The Company has four issued patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (&#8220;USPTO&#8221;), entitled &#8220;System and Method for Verifying the Age of an Internet User,&#8221; &#8220;System and Method for Virtual Piggy Bank Wish-List,&#8221; &#8221;Parent Match&#8221; and &#8220;System and Method for Virtual Piggy Bank.&#8221; The Company has filed for one provisional U.S. patent application, as well as twelve non-provisional U.S. patent applications, three of which are pending, four of which have been allowed, and five of which have been abandoned. Additionally, the Company has been granted two patents, entitled &#8220;Virtual Piggy Bank&#8221; and &#8220;Parent Match,&#8221; in each of Germany, Canada, and Australia. The Company also has patents pending in the Republic of Korea under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#8220;PCT&#8221;). Costs associated with the registration and legal defense of the patents have been capitalized and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of the patents.

&#160; 

&#160;

Until such time as the remaining pending patents are awarded, if ever, we intend to rely on trade secret protection and/or confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, business partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, we have filed trademark applications pertaining to our service with the USPTO, the European Community, and Canada. The USPTO has already granted us service mark registrations for Oink, Oink (stylized), PiggyPick, Virtual Piggy, Virtual Piggy and design (horizontal), the PIG design, Parent Match, Quickconnect, Virtual Piggy Youth Empowered Parent Approved and Design, Youth Empowered. Parent Approved, and Oink.com. The European Community has already granted us registration for Virtual Piggy, Virtual Piggy and Design, Virtual Piggy Youth Empowered Parent Approved and Design, PiggyPick, Wishlist Wednesday, the PIG design, and the PIG design (alternative). The Canadian Intellectual Property Office has already granted the registration for VP Authenticate. 

&#160; 

Despite certain precautions taken by us, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization. This risk may be increased due to the lack of any patent and/or copyright protection. If any of our proprietary rights are misappropriated or we are forced to defend our intellectual property rights, we will have to incur substantial costs. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, including diverting the time and effort of our senior management, and could disrupt our business, as well as have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Management will from time to time determine whether applying for and pursuing patent and copyright protection is appropriate for us. We have no guarantee that any applications will be granted or, if awarded, whether they will offer us any meaningful protection from other companies in our business, or that we will have the financial resources to oppose any actual or threatened infringement by any third party. Furthermore, any patent or copyrights that we may be granted may be held by a court to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and subject us to the payment of damage awards. 

&#160; 

In addition, we cannot be certain that our technology will not infringe upon patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. While we know of no basis for any claims of this type, the existence of and ownership of intellectual property can be difficult to verify and we have not made an exhaustive search of all patent filings. We may become subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business. If we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be enjoined from using such intellectual property, and we may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternative technology or obtain other licenses. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses in defending against these third party infringement claims and be diverted from devoting time to our business and operational issues, regardless of the merits of any such claim. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

During 2015 and 2014, our research and development expenses were $1.6 million and $3.3 million all of which were borne by us. 

Our Revenue Model 

As of the date of this report, we have not generated significant revenue. We take a small percentage of every transaction from an online merchant. Until now this was our only revenue source. As we proceed through 2016, we expect to generate additional revenue streams by generating licensing and customization fees from our co-branding partners. 

Our Plan of Operation 

A phased approach to the introduction of our improved Platform is planned. 

We plan to launch our co-branding platform in the fourth quarter of 2016, however, this is dependent on our ability to generate revenue in order to sustain our operations, or in the event that the Company cannot generate sufficient revenue to sustain its operations, the Company will need to obtain financing through the sale of debt and/or equity securities. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing Strategy 

In 2016, we are focusing on onboarding established brands with large family-focused account bases that would enable us to co-brand our platform and reach the Gen Z population through the FinTech industry. We believe this methodology is critical to our ability generate additional revenue through the FinTech industry. 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

Our new partner-first model, should not be subject to seasonality, as it is more a matter of when our partners come on board and pay the licensing and customization fees. 

Competition 

&#160; 

The online payment solutions business is intensely competitive. It is characterized by the continuous introduction of new entrants into the market and the development of new technologies and product offerings. Although payment services such as PayPal, Amex Bluebird, FamZoo and Visa Buxx can be viewed as our competitors, we do not believe that these provide the type of family friendly solution that not only teaches young people about saving, spending, and giving, but that is also compliant with COPPA, and other laws that users of all ages need to be aware of, including but not limited to privacy, data collection, and security. We believe we have built and continue to build a financial solution that is not only good for the youth market, but one that will be requested by them over other products. To compete effectively, we expect that we will focus a majority of our 2016 resources on technology and product development. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

The industry which we serve is subject to regulation by the FTC, laws such as COPPA, and other laws relating to collection, use, retention, and security. Complying with these varying U.S. and international requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. In addition, we have and post on our websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us. In addition, we are subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 14 employees, who were working in the areas of sales, marketing, programming and product development, web development, legal, finance and administration. None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
