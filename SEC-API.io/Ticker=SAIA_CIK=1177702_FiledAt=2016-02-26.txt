None of our approximately 8,700 employees is represented by a union. In 2015, Saia generated revenue of $1.22 billion and operating income of $90.0 million. In 2014, Saia generated revenue of $1.27 billion and operating income of $85.7 million.

Saia LTL Freight

Founded in 1924, Saia LTL Freight is a leading multi-regional LTL carrier that serves 34 states in the South, Southwest, Midwest, Pacific Northwest and West. Saia LTL Freight specializes in offering its customers a range of regional and interregional LTL services including time-definite and expedited options. Saia LTL Freight primarily provides its customers with solutions for shipments between 100 and 10,000 pounds, but also provides selected guaranteed, expedited and truckload services.

Saia LTL Freight has invested substantially in technology, training and business processes to enhance its ability to monitor and manage customer service, operations and profitability. These data capabilities enable Saia LTL Freight to provide its trademarked Customer Service Indicators &#174; (CSI) program, allowing customers to monitor service performance on a wide array of metrics most important to them. Customers can access the information via the Internet (www.saia.com) to help manage their shipments. The CSIs measure the following: on-time pickup; on-time delivery; claim-free shipments; claims settled within 30 days; exception free delivery; and invoicing accuracy. The CSIs provide both Saia LTL Freight and the customer with a report card of overall service levels.

As of December 31, 2015, Saia LTL Freight operated a network comprised of 150 owned and leased locations. In 2015, the average Saia LTL Freight shipment weighed approximately 1,137 pounds and traveled an average distance of approximately 775 miles.

Industry

The trucking industry consists of three segments including private fleets and two &#8220;for-hire&#8221; carrier groups. The private carrier segment consists of fleets owned and operated by shippers who move their own goods. The two &#8220;for-hire&#8221; carrier groups, truckload and LTL, are based on the typical shipment sizes handled by transportation service companies. Truckload refers to providers generally transporting shipments greater than 10,000 pounds and LTL refers to providers generally transporting shipments less than 10,000 pounds. Saia LTL Freight is primarily an LTL carrier.

LTL transportation providers typically consolidate numerous shipments, generally ranging from 100 to 10,000 pounds, from businesses in different locations at carrier-operated service facilities within a certain radius and then transport the shipments from the origin location to the carrier-operated destination location and then to the ultimate delivery destination. As a result, LTL carriers require expansive networks of pickup and delivery operations around local service facilities and shipments are moved between origin and destination often through an intermediate distribution or &#8220;breakbulk&#8221; facility. Depending on the distance shipped, the LTL segment historically was classified into three subgroups:

&#160;

&#183; 

Regional &#8212; Average shipment distance is typically less than 1,200 miles with a focus on one- and two-day markets. Regional transportation companies can move shipments directly to their respective destination location which increases service reliability and avoids costs associated with intermediate handling. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Interregional &#8212; Average shipment distance is usually between 1,200 and 1,500 miles with a focus on serving two- and three-day markets. 

&#160;

&#183; 

National &#8212; Average shipment distance is typically in excess of 1,500 miles with a focus on service in three- to five-day markets. National providers rely on intermediate shipment handling through hub and spoke networks, which require numerous satellite service facilities, multiple distribution facilities and a relay network. To gain service and cost advantages, national providers occasionally ship directly between service facilities reducing intermediate handling or utilize the rail system. 

&#160;

&#160;

Throughout the years, there has been a blurring of the above subgroups as individual companies are increasingly serving multiple markets. For example, a number of companies are focusing on serving one- and two-day lanes, as well as serving three and m ore day markets between adjacent regions. Saia LTL Freight operates as a traditional LTL carrier with ability to focus in all three areas. 

The truckload segment is the largest portion of the &#8220;for-hire&#8221; truck transportation market. Truckload carriers primarily transport large shipments from origin to destination with no intermediate handling. Although a full truckload can weigh over 40,000 pounds, it is common for carriers to haul two or three shipments exceeding 10,000 pounds each at one time making multiple delivery stops.

Because truckload carriers do not require an expansive network to provide point-to-point service, the overall cost structure of truckload participants is typically lower and more variable relative to LTL service providers. However, the lack of a network subjects their drivers to extended periods away from home thus resulting in higher driver turnover and periodic driver shortages. The truckload segment is comprised of several major carriers and numerous small entrepreneurial players. At the most basic level, a truckload company can be started with capital for rolling stock (a tractor and a trailer), insurance, a driver and little else. As size becomes a factor, capital is needed for technology infrastructure and some limited facilities. Saia LTL Freight participates in the truckload market as a means to fill empty miles in lanes that are not at capacity. Saia Sales&#8217; sales representatives also sell truckload and expedited offerings of Saia TL Plus and LinkEx.

Capital requirements are significantly different in the traditional LTL segment versus the truckload segment. In the LTL sector, substantial amounts of capital are required for a network of service facilities, shipment handling equipment and revenue equipment (both for city pick-up, delivery and linehaul). In addition, investment in effective technology has become increasingly important in the LTL segment largely due to the number of transactions and number of customers served on a daily basis. Saia LTL Freight picks up approximately 25,200 shipments per day, each of which has a shipper and consignee, and sometimes a third party, all of whom need access to information in a timely manner. More importantly, technology plays a key role in improving customer service, operations efficiency and compliance, safety and yield management. As a result of the significant infrastructure required to operate an LTL carrier, the LTL segment is more concentrated than the truckload segment with the largest players in the national and regional markets. Driver turnover in the LTL sector is low relative to the truckload sector. Midsize &#8220;niche&#8221; carriers serve the regional markets.

Business Strategy

Saia has grown historically through a combination of organic growth and geographic integration or &#8220;tuck-in&#8221; of smaller trucking and logistics companies acquired by Saia. Saia integrated WestEx and Action Express in 2001, Clark Bros. in 2004, The Connection in 2006 and Madison Freight Systems in 2007. In 2012, Saia acquired Robart Transportation, Inc. and its subsidiary, The RL Services Group, LLC (the Robart Companies) which provide customers with non-asset truckload full service and logistics solutions. Effective October 1, 2012, the Company rebranded Robart Transportation, Inc. as Saia TL Plus and The RL Services Group, LLC as Saia Logistics Services. In February 2015, Saia acquired LinkEx, a diversified, asset-light, third party logistics provider based in Dallas, Texas. The acquisition of LinkEx grew the Company&#8217;s existing portfolio of asset-light services. See Note 11 of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further information on the acquisition of LinkEx.

Key elements of our business strategy include:

Continue to focus on operating safely.

Our most valuable resource is our employees. It is a corporate priority to continually emphasize the importance of safe operations and to reduce both the frequency and severity of injuries and accidents. This emphasis is not only appropriate to protect our employees and our communities but with the continued escalation of commercial insurance and health care costs, it is important to maintain and improve stockholder returns. Management expects governmental safety regulations and related enforcement initiatives to increase in the future.

Manage yields and business mix.

This element of our business strategy involves managing both the pricing process and the mix of customers&#8217; freight in ways that allow our network to operate more profitably. Improvements in the economy coupled with the tightening of available capacity in the industry over the last several years allowed the Company to implement numerous pricing initiatives to increase yield significantly.

&#160;

&#160;

Increase density in existing geographies. 

We gain operating leverage by growing volume and density within existing geography. Depending on pricing and the specific lanes, we estimate that the potential incremental profitability on growth in current markets can be 20 percent or even higher. This improves margins, asset turnover and return on capital. We actively monitor opportunities to add service facilities where we have sufficient density. We see potential for future volume growth at Saia from improvements in the general economy, industry consolidation and strategic acquisitions, as well as specific sales and marketing initiatives.

Continue focus on delivering best-in-class service.

The foundation of Saia&#8217;s growth strategy is consistent delivery of high-quality service. Commitment to service quality is valued by customers and allows us to gain fair compensation for our services and positions us to improve market share.

Continue focus on improving operating efficiencies.

Saia has operating initiatives focused on continuing to improve efficiency. These initiatives help offset a variety of structural cost increases like wages, healthcare benefits, workers compensation claims, parts and maintenance expense as well as casualty insurance. We believe Saia continues to be well positioned to manage costs and utilize assets. We believe we will continue to see new opportunities for cost savings.

Prepare the organization for future growth.

Our primary focus within organizational development is maintaining strong relationships with our employees. We invest in our employees through internal communication, training programs, recognition programs and providing competitive wages and benefits.

We believe it is also important to invest in technology capabilities and strategic real estate which are designed to position our Company for future growth to meet the increasing demands of the marketplace. We also believe it is important to invest in our tractor and trailer fleet to improve brand image, gain access to new technologies, lower maintenance expenses, achieve improved fuel economy and gain other operating efficiencies.

Expand portfolio of services in the asset-light market

While our immediate priority is to improve profitability in our existing portfolio of services, we may pursue additional services to complement our existing asset-light market because it promotes profitability growth and improves our customer value proposition over time.

Expand geographic footprint.

While our immediate priority is to improve profitability in our existing geography, we plan to evaluate additional geographic expansion because it promotes profitability growth and improves our customer value proposition over time.

In addition to potential direct expansion through opening of new facilities, management may consider acquisitions from time to time to help expand geographic reach and density while gaining the business base of the acquired entity. Management believes integration of acquisitions is a core competency and it has developed a repeatable process from its successful experience, including Saia&#8217;s integration of WestEx, Action Express, Clark Bros., the Connection and Madison Freight. Collectively, these integrations increased Saia&#8217;s footprint from 12 to 34 states.

Seasonality

Our revenues are subject to seasonal variations. Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and operating expenses tend to be higher as a percent of revenue in the winter months primarily due to lower capacity utilization and weather effects. Generally, the first quarter is the weakest quarter while the second and third quarters are the strongest quarters in terms of revenue and profit. Quarterly profitability is also impacted by the timing of salary and wage increases and general rate increases which have varied over the years.

Labor

Most LTL companies, including Saia, and virtually all truckload companies are not subject to collective bargaining agreements.

&#160;

&#160;

In recent years, due to competition for quality employees, the compensation divide between union and non-union carriers has closed dramatically. However, there are still significant differences in benefi t costs and work rule flexibility. Benefit costs for union carriers remain significantly above those paid by non-union carriers and union carriers may be subject to certain contingent multi-employer pension liabilities. In addition, non-union carriers have more work rule flexibility with respect to work schedules, routes and other similar items. Work rule flexibility is a major consideration in the regional LTL sector as flexibility is important to meet the service levels required by customers. 

Our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe this provides for better communications and employee relations, stronger future growth prospects, improved efficiencies and customer service capabilities.

Competition

Although there has been some tightening of capacity and some industry consolidation, shippers continue to have a wide range of choices. We believe that service quality, price, variety of services offered, geographic coverage, responsiveness and flexibility are the important competitive differentiators.

Saia focuses primarily on regional and interregional business and operates in a highly competitive environment against a wide range of transportation service providers. These competitors include a small number of large, national transportation service providers in the long haul and two-day markets and a larger number of shorter-haul or regional transportation companies in the two-day and overnight markets. Saia also competes in and against several modes of transportation, including LTL, truckload and private fleets. The larger the service area, the greater the barriers to entry into the LTL trucking segment due to the need for additional equipment and operational facilities associated with this coverage. The level of technology investment required and density needed to provide adequate labor and asset utilization make larger-scale entry into the LTL market difficult. To a lesser extent, Saia also competes with small package carriers, railroads and air freight carriers.

Regulation

Over the past 36 years, the trucking industry has been substantially deregulated and rates and services are largely free of regulatory controls. Nevertheless, the trucking industry remains subject to regulation by many federal and state governmental agencies, and these authorities have broad powers over matters ranging from the authority to engage in motor carrier operations, motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers, insurance requirements, fuel efficiency and emissions standards, and the transportation and handling of hazardous materials.

Key areas of regulatory activity include:

Department of Homeland Security.

The trucking industry is working closely with government agencies to define and implement improved security processes. The Transportation Security Administration continues to focus on trailer security, driver identification, security clearance and border-crossing procedures. These and other safety and security measures, such as rules for transportation of hazardous materials, could increase the cost of operations, reduce the number of qualified drivers and disrupt or impede the timing of our deliveries to customers.

Department of Transportation.

Motor carrier and freight brokerage operations are subject to safety, insurance and bonding requirements prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (&#8220;DOT&#8221;) and various state agencies.

Within the DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) has issued rules including hours of service regulations that limit the maximum number of hours a driver may be on duty between mandatory off-duty hours. These rules could impact our operations, further tighten the market for qualified drivers and put additional upward pressure on driver wages and purchased transportation costs.

Additionally, the FMCSA&#8217;s Compliance Safety Accountability Program (CSA) could adversely affect our results and ability to maintain or grow our fleet. CSA is an enforcement and compliance model that involves assessments of a motor carrier&#8217;s on-road performance and investigation results for a 24-month period using roadside stops and inspections, resulting in safety and performance ratings in the following categories: unsafe driving; hours-of-service compliance; driver fitness; controlled substances/alcohol; vehicle maintenance; hazardous material compliance; and crash indicators. The evaluations are used to rank carriers and individual drivers and to select carriers for audit and other interventions. In January 2016, the FMCSA proposed to revise the current methodology for 

&#160;

&#160;

issuance of a safety fitness determination for motor carriers. The proposed new methodologies would determine when a motor carrier is not fit to operate commercial motor vehicles based on the carrier's on-road safety data in relation to industry data, an investigation or a combination of on-road safety data and investigation information. While the ultimate impact of CSA is not yet known, it is possible that these measurements could adversely impact our ability to attra ct and retain drivers which would adversely affect our results and cash flows. 

The FMCSA proposed a requirement that electronic driver logs be monitored by Electronic Log Devices (ELDs) for many in-state-only drivers and most interstate commercial motor vehicle drivers by no later than December 18, 2017. Drivers voluntarily using a compliant automatic on-board recording device by the December 18, 2017, deadline will be &#8220;grandfathered&#8221; for two years to give providers time to update their systems to be compliant with the ELD standards. While such regulations could increase the cost of technology, capital equipment and maintenance expenses across our industry, we implemented ELDs company-wide in 2014 prior to the effective date of the ELD standard.

In February 2014, President Obama announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#8220;EPA&#8221;) and the DOT have been ordered to propose additional regulations to reduce exhaust emissions and increase fuel efficiency for heavy-duty trucks manufactured after 2018. The agencies are expected to implement final rules by March 2016, which will build upon the fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks implemented for 2014-2018 model trucks. While the impact of these regulations cannot be ascertained at this time, such regulations could increase the cost of capital equipment and maintenance expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.

Environmental Protection Agency.

The EPA has issued regulations reducing sulfur content of diesel fuel and reducing engine emissions. These regulations increased the cost of replacing and maintaining trucks. Future environmental laws in this area could further increase our costs and impact our operations.

Our motor carrier operations are also subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, the handling, disposal, release and transportation of hazardous materials and other environmental matters. We maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, among others. If hazardous materials are released into the environment while being transported by us, we may have liability for response costs and the remediation of such a release. We have established programs designed to monitor and control environmental risks and to comply with all applicable environmental regulations. As part of our safety and risk management program, we periodically perform environmental reviews to maintain environmental compliance and avoid environmental risk. We believe that we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the cost of compliance has not materially affected results of operations.

Food and Drug Administration.

As a transportation provider of foodstuffs, we are subject to rules issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide for the security of food and foodstuffs throughout the supply chain. The Sanitary Food Transportation Act of 2005 (SFTA) shifted responsibility for the regulation of food transportation from the U.S. Department of Transportation to the FDA. In February 2014, the FDA published a proposed rule to establish requirements under SFTA for vehicles and transportation equipment, transportation operations, training, record keeping and waivers. The proposed rule aims to continue the use of best practices in the industry concerning cleaning, inspection, maintenance, loading and unloading of, and operation of vehicles. Carriers would also be required to develop and implement written procedures subject to recordkeeping that specify its practices for cleaning, sanitizing, and inspecting vehicles and transportation equipment. The rule is expected to become final in March 2016. Although we already strive to adhere to such best practices, the impact of the final rule is uncertain and compliance may incur additional expenses and affect our operations.

Trademarks and Patents

We have registered several service marks and trademarks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including Saia Guaranteed Select &#174; , Saia Customer Service Indicators &#174; and Saia Xtreme Guarantee &#174; . We believe these service marks and trademarks are important components of our marketing strategy.
