NeoGenomics, Inc., a Nevada corporation (referred to individually as the &#8220;Parent Company&#8221; or collectively with its subsidiaries as &#8220;NeoGenomics&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221; in this Form 10-K) is the registrant for SEC reporting purposes. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol &#8220;NEO&#8221;.

Overview 

We operate a network of cancer-focused genetic testing laboratories in the United States. Our mission is to improve patient care through exceptional genetic and molecular testing services. Our vision is to become the World&#8217;s leading cancer testing and information company by delivering uncompromising quality, exceptional service and innovative solutions. 

On December 30, 2015, we acquired Clarient, Inc, (&#8220;Clarient&#8221;) from GE Medical Holding AB (&#8220;GE Medical&#8221;), a subsidiary of General Electric Company, for approximately $249.5 million, consisting of (i) cash consideration of approximately $74.0 million, which included an approximately $6.7 million estimated working capital adjustment and adjustments for estimated cash on hand and estimated indebtedness of Clarient on the closing date, (ii) 15,000,000 shares of our common stock, and (iii) 14,666,667 shares of our series A convertible preferred stock (the &#8220;Acquisition&#8221;). For additional information and risks associated with the Acquisition, see "Risk Factors," which appears in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

We believe the Acquisition will allow us to broaden our offering of innovative cancer diagnostic tests to hospitals and physicians across the United States and to accelerate growth in the worldwide market for pharmaceutical clinical trials and research. The following discussion of our business includes the effects of the acquisition of Clarient.

As of December 31, 2015, the Company has laboratory locations in Ft. Myers and Tampa, Florida; Aliso Viejo, Fresno, Irvine, and West Sacramento, California; Houston, Texas and Nashville, Tennessee, and currently offers the following types of genetic and molecular testing services: 

&#160;

a) 

Cytogenetics - the study of normal and abnormal chromosomes and their relationship to disease. It involves looking at the chromosome structure to identify changes from patterns seen in normal chromosomes. Cytogenetic studies are often utilized to answer diagnostic, prognostic and predictive questions in the treatment of hematological malignancies.

&#160;

b) 

Fluorescence In-Situ Hybridization (&#8220;FISH&#8221;) - a branch of cancer genetics that focuses on detecting and locating the presence or absence of specific DNA sequences and genes on chromosomes. FISH helps bridge abnormality detection between the chromosomal and DNA sequence levels. The technique uses fluorescent probes that bind to only those parts of the chromosome with which they show a high degree of sequence similarity. Fluorescence microscopy is used to visualize the fluorescent probes bound to the chromosomes. FISH can be used to help identify a number of gene alternations, such as amplification, deletions, and translocations.

&#160;

c) 

Flow cytometry - a rapid way to measure the characteristics of cell populations. Cells from peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirate, lymph nodes, and other areas are labeled with selective fluorescent antibodies and analyzed as they flow in a fluid stream through a beam of light. The properties measured in these antibodies include the relative size, relative granularity or internal complexity, and relative fluorescence intensity. These fluorescent antibodies bind to specific cell surface antigens and are used to identify malignant cell populations. Flow cytometry is typically performed in diagnosing a wide variety of leukemia and lymphoma neoplasms. Flow cytometry is also used to monitor patients through therapy to determine whether the disease burden is increasing or decreasing, otherwise known as minimal residual disease monitoring.

&#160;

d) 

Immunohistochemistry (&#8220;IHC&#8221;) and Digital Imaging &#8211; Refers to the process of localizing proteins in cells of a tissue section and relies on the principle of antibodies binding specifically to antigens in biological tissues. IHC is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those found in cancerous tumors. Specific surface cytoplasmic or nuclear markers are characteristic of cellular events such as proliferation or cell death (apoptosis). IHC is also widely used to understand the distribution and localization of differentially expressed proteins. Digital imaging allows clients to see and utilize scanned slides and perform quantitative analysis for certain stains. Scanned slides are received online in real time and can be previewed often a full day before the glass slides can be shipped back to clients.

&#160;

e) 

Molecular testing - a rapidly growing cancer diagnostic tool focusing on the analysis of DNA and RNA, as well as the structure and function of genes at the molecular level. Molecular testing employs multiple technologies including DNA fragment length analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction (&#8220;RT-PCR&#8221;) RNA analysis, bi-directional Sanger sequencing analysis, and Next-Generation Sequencing (&#8220;NGS&#8221;).

&#160;

&#160;

f) 

Pathology consultation - services provided for clients in which our pathologists review surgical samples on a consultative basis. NeoGenomics is one of a few laboratories in the country with an electron microscopy lab which enables us to analyze complex renal cases.

&#160;

g) 

Pharma Services and Clinical Trials &#8211; Services supporting pharmaceutical firms in their drug development programs by supporting various clinical trials. This growing portion of our business often involves working with the pharmaceutical firms (sponsors) on study design as well as performing the required testing. Our medical team often advises the investigators and works closely with the researchers as specimens are received from the enrolled sites. We have also worked on developing tests that will be used as part of a companion diagnostic to determine patients&#8217; response to a particular drug. When studies are completed, our clinical trials team will report the data and often provide key analysis and insights back to the sponsors.

Our Pharma Services and Clinical Trials group provides comprehensive testing services in support of our pharmaceutical clients&#8217; oncology programs from discovery to commercialization. In biomarker discovery, our aim is to help our customers discover the right content. We help our customers develop a biomarker hypothesis by recommending an optimal platform for molecular screening and backing our discovery tools with the informatics to capture meaningful data. In other pre and non-clinical work, we can use our platforms to characterize markers of interest. Moving from discovery to development, we help our customers refine their biomarker strategy and, if applicable, develop a companion diagnostic pathway using the optimal technology for large-scale clinical trial testing. 

After assay design and validation, we provide a testing laboratory for large scale clinical trial testing. Whether serving as the single contract research organization or partnering with one, our Pharma Services and Clinical Trials team provides significant technical expertise working closely with our customers to support each stage of clinical trial development. Each trial we support comes with rapid turnaround time, dedicated project management and Quality Assurance oversight. We have experience in supporting FDA submissions for companion diagnostics and our pharma services activities is backed by our large clinical laboratory in Aliso Viejo, CA. Our Pharma Services and Clinical Trials business is supported by full-time sales associates. Our goal remains focused on helping bring more effective oncology treatments to market through providing world class laboratory services in oncology.

Multiomyx&#8482; - is a hyperplexed immunofluorecence assay technology that has similar staining characteristics as standard immunohistochemical stains, and has the significant advantage that multiple proteins demonstrated up to 60 can be interrogated from a single FFPE section. Direct comparison of multiple biomarkers is made on the same cell, enabling routine co-expression analysis and identification of cells requiring multiple biomarkers staining. In addition to protein analysis, MultiOmyx is able to integrate genomic data utilizing FISH and NGS on the same sample to generate multiomic phenotypes. 

The cancer testing services we offer to community-based pathologists are designed to be a natural extension of, and complementary to, the services that they perform within their own practices. We believe our relationship as a non-competitive partner to community-based pathology practices, hospital pathology labs and academic centers empowers them to expand their breadth of testing and provide a menu of services that matches or exceeds the level of service found in any center of excellence around the world. Community-based pathology practices and hospital pathology labs may order certain testing services on a technical component only (&#8220;TC&#8221; or &#8220;tech-only&#8221;) basis, which allows them to participate in the diagnostic process by performing the professional component (&#8220;PC&#8221;) interpretation services without having to hire laboratory technologists or purchase the sophisticated equipment needed to perform the technical component of the tests. We also support our pathology clients with interpretation and consultative services using our own specialized patholigists for difficult or complex cases and provide overflow interpretation services when requested by clients.

In areas where we do not provide services to community-based pathology practices and/or hospital pathology labs, we may directly serve oncology, dermatology, urology and other clinician practices that prefer to have a direct relationship with a laboratory for cancer-related genetic and molecular testing services. We typically service these types of clients with a comprehensive service offering where we perform both the technical and professional components of the tests ordered. However, in certain instances larger clinician practices have begun to internalize pathology interpretation services, and our &#8220;tech-only&#8221; service offering allows these larger clinician practices to also participate in the diagnostic process by performing the PC interpretation services on TC testing performed by NeoGenomics.

Markets 

The medical testing laboratory market can be broken down into three primary segments:

&#160;

&#183; 

Clinical Pathology testing, 

&#160;

&#183; 

Anatomic Pathology testing, and 

&#160;

&#183; 

Genetic and Molecular testing. 

Clinical Pathology testing covers high volume, highly automated, lower complexity tests on easily procured specimens such as blood and urine. Clinical lab tests often involve testing of a less urgent nature, for example, cholesterol testing and testing associated with routine physical exams.

Anatomic Pathology testing involves evaluation of tissue, as in surgical pathology, or cells as in cytopathology. The most widely performed Anatomic Pathology procedures include the preparation and interpretation of pap smears, skin biopsies, and tissue biopsies.

Genetic and molecular testing typically involves analyzing chromosomes, genes, proteins and/or DNA/RNA sequences for abnormalities. Genetic and molecular testing requires highly specialized equipment and credentialed individuals (typically M.D. or Ph.D. level) to certify results and typically yields the highest reimbursement levels of the three market segments.

NeoGenomics operates primarily in the Genetic and Molecular testing market. We also act as a reference laboratory supplying anatomic pathology testing. NeoGenomics typically does not compete in the Clinical Pathology testing market. 

The field of cancer genetics is evolving rapidly and new tests are being developed at an accelerated pace. Based on medical and scientific discoveries over the last decade, cancer testing falls into one of three categories: diagnostic testing, prognostic testing and predictive testing. Of the three, the fastest growing area is predictive testing, which is utilized by clinicians to predict a patient&#8217;s response to the various treatment options in order to deliver &#8220;personalized or precision medicine&#8221; that is optimized to that patient&#8217;s particular circumstances. Personalized or precision medicine allows clinicians to know if a patient will or will not respond to certain medications like Herceptin. This saves the healthcare system money by ensuring that expensive cancer drugs are only given to those who will benefit from them. This type of testing improves patient care and potentially saves lives by identifying optimized therapies much more rapidly than what was possible in previous years.

We estimate that the United States market for genetic and molecular testing is divided among approximately 400 laboratories. Many of these laboratories are attached to academic institutions and primarily provide clinical services to their affiliated university hospitals and associated physicians. We believe that the remainder of the market is quite fragmented and that less than 20 laboratories market their services nationally. We estimate that the top 20 laboratories account for approximately 50% of market revenues for genetic and molecular testing. 

We believe several key factors are influencing the rapid growth in the market for cancer testing: (i) every year, more and more genes and genomic pathways are implicated in the development and/or clinical course of cancer; (ii) cancer is primarily a disease of the elderly - one in four senior citizens is likely to develop some form of cancer during the rest of their lifetime once they turn sixty, and now that the baby boomer generation has started to reach this age range, the incidence rates of cancer are rising; (iii) increasingly, new drugs are being targeted to certain cancer subtypes and pathways which require companion diagnostic testing; (iv) patient and payer awareness of the value of genetic and molecular testing; (v) decreases in the cost of performing genetic and molecular testing; (vi) increased coverage from third party payers and Medicare for such testing; and (vii) the health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010. These factors have driven significant growth in the market for this type of testing. We estimate a $10-12 billion total market opportunity for cancer testing in the United States, about $5-7 billion of which is derived from genetic and molecular testing with the remaining portion derived from more traditional anatomic pathology testing services that are complementary to and often ordered with the genetic and molecular testing services we offer.

2016 Focus Areas: Drive a &#8220;One Company&#8217; Culture, Integrate, Grow and Innovate

In the past several years, NeoGenomics has experience rapid growth, substantially all of which has been organic. In December 2015, NeoGenomics completed its acquisition of Clarient from GE Medical. As a result, we expect to more than double in size in 2016, and we have focused on several initiatives to continue to build our company to be the World&#8217;s leading cancer testing and information company.

Create a &#8220;One Company&#8221; Culture 

We believe our acquisition of the business of Clarient, Inc. in 2015 presents us with a unique opportunity to create a unified corporate culture that supports our vision, values, and strategic objectives. We believe that by engaging our people, we will be able to retain them and motivate them to meet and exceed the expectations of our clients. With the combination of Clarient, we are bringing together two groups of employees that will become one team. Excellent teamwork is required as we implement best practices across our expanded testing disciplines and consolidate operations and facilities. 

To create a climate of strong teamwork, we constantly communicate company values as well as developments in our business. We invest substantially in training our employees and are working to become a &#8220;Best Place to Work&#8221; company. We conduct surveys and take action based on feedback from employees designed to make our company a better place for people to work. We also work to develop and implement performance-based incentive plans for every employee at the company as a tool to reinforce our desired behaviors and organizational culture. Creating a single organizational culture based on values and high performance is a critical initiative and key part of our 2016 plan. 

Integrate for Success 

Combining the best of NeoGenomics&#8217; and Clarient&#8217;s testing menus and services is one of our main objectives for 2016. There was overlap in many of our test offerings, and differences between operating processes and procedures. As a result, we are rapidly working to develop a single test menu, a single Laboratory Information System (&#8220;LIS&#8221;), a single billing process, a single brand, and a unified service offering. 

Our medical and operating teams are working to develop and implement plans to ensure that we are offering the best tests for our clients. Our information technology teams are working to combine the best features from each LIS. Numerous laboratory functional teams are reviewing and revising processes and procedures to select the highest quality and lowest-cost testing platforms. Our sales teams have been combined to form one national team so that each account has one point of contact. In billing, we intend to combine our separate operations using common policies and procedures in each billing location, and will integrate all operations using a common billing information system. While we expect significant synergies from the combination of our two laboratories, we are also focused on retaining all our clients, and our goal is to ensure that we maintain the highest quality service throughout the integration process. 

We believe successfully integrating Clarient&#8217;s and NeoGenomics&#8217; operations will also allow us to become more efficient and to reduce our cost per test. Our best practice teams are working with our information technology teams to make improvements in efficiencies to our lab processes, including a wide-scale adoption of on-line ordering, bar coding, specimen tracking, and other tools to create a streamlined, seamless, and efficient lab. In addition, we are working to implement plans to consolidate the Irvine Lab facility into the Aliso Viejo Lab facility, and to further streamline the design and operation of our [consolidated] laboratory. These initiatives have already had a dramatic impact on our cost structure and have allowed us to absorb reductions in average revenue per test with minimal impact to gross margin. For example, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we reduced our average cost of goods sold per test in our Base Business, which we define to be our consolidated operations excluding the Path Logic, business by 8.6% and 4.7%, respectively, versus the comparable periods in 2014 and 2013, and we have identified several other areas in the laboratory where we believe we can drive further automation and efficiencies.

&#160;

Drive Profitable Growth 

Our plans for 2016 include initiatives to continue our strong organic growth performance. We will continue to pursue market share gains by providing high complexity, cancer-related laboratory testing services to hospitals, community-based pathology practices, and clinicians throughout the United States. We currently perform comprehensive analyses for hematopoietic cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma (blood and lymphoid tumors) as well as solid tumors such as breast, lung, colon, and bladder cancers. For hematopoietic cancers, we typically analyze bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood specimens. For solid tumors cancers, we typically analyze tissue samples or urine.

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

&#160;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

Our growth over the past several years has been significantly influenced by our sales team performance. Our highly trained sales team has been successful in competing against other laboratories because we have one of the broadest and most comprehensive test menus in our industry. Our sales team is experienced with the scientific complexity and medical necessity of our testing services, and understands the needs of our client pathologists and oncologists. Our sales representatives often become trusted advisors to our clients who rely on them, and NeoGenomics, to keep up with the latest developments in the rapidly changing field of molecular genetics. We have also been successful in expanding to new geographies where we did not previously have sales representation and this has helped us bring our service offerings to new clients. We believe the strength of our sales team, combined with our broader service offering resulting from the Acquisition, positions us to further drive growth in 2016.

Our growth has also been aided by strong client retention. We believe our high rates of client retention are due to strong service levels, our &#8220;tech-only&#8221; service offerings, and a culture of customer focus in which our engaged employees seek to deliver highest customer satisfaction possible. Our &#8220;tech-only&#8221; testing option allows local pathologists to participate with us in the testing process by interpreting results and performing the professional component of certain tests. Our strong service levels are reinforced by a disciplined management process with a system of detailed measures and metrics to ensure committed turnaround times and customer service. By retaining our existing customer base and bringing in a steady stream of new customers, we have been able to organically grow our business and we plan to continue these activities in 2016.

We will also look to grow our business through mergers or acquisitions if the right opportunities become available. We are focused on strategic opportunities that would be complementary to our menu of services and would be accretive to our earnings and cash flow in the short to medium timeframe. In 2014 we acquired Path Labs, LLC, doing business as (&#8220;Path Logic&#8221;), a provider of specialized anatomic pathology services to hospitals and physicians primarily in Northern California. Path Logic provides high-quality Anatomic Pathology services with significant expertise in the sub-specialties of renal pathology, dermatopathology, women&#8217;s health and gastrointestinal and genitourinary pathology. In addition, on December 30, 2015 we completed the acquisition of Clarient. Clarient specializes in advanced oncology diagnostic services and will enable NeoGenomics to broaden its offering of innovative cancer diagnostic tests to hospitals and physicians across the country, and to accelerate its growth in the fast-growing worldwide market for pharmaceutical clinical trials and research. Complementary product offerings and expanded geographical reach of the combined company are expected to provide customers with substantial benefits and create a significantly larger and more diversified provider of precision oncology diagnostics. The Clarient transaction is a good example of the type of acquisition opportunity we will consider in the future.

Continuously Innovate 

We are keenly focused on innovation, and believe this has been a key factor in our growth. Over the past several years, we have developed over 125 new molecular oncology tests and disease-specific panels, and believe we now have one of the most comprehensive oncology test menus of any laboratory in the world. By launching new medically significant and necessary tests at a steady rate, we are able to provide cutting-edge developments in molecular genetics with clients and their patients and are developing our reputation as a leader in the field of molecular oncology. Our broad and innovative testing menu allows us to serve community-based pathologists and clinicians as well as pharmaceutical customers and nationally recognized academic centers. In addition, our comprehensive test offering allows us to be a one-stop shop for all of the oncology testing needs of our clients. Pharmaceutical firms are also attracted to our laboratory based on our knowledgeable research and development team and our ability to offer tests at the forefront of medical developments. In many cases, customers who begin using us because of our new innovative test offerings also begin to refer portions of their other testing. Therefore, innovation helps in many ways to sustain our growth. 

We are committed to being an innovative leader in oncology testing. Our goal is to develop new assays to help physician clients better manage their patients and to enable them to practice evidence-based medicine tailored specifically for each of their patients. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we introduced approximately 70 new or enhanced molecular and FISH based tests and cancer profiles. In 2014, we launched our multimodality solid tumor &#8220;Discovery Profile&#8221; which analyzes 315 genes for mutation using NGS and includes 9 FISH tests to analyze translocations, amplifications and deletions that might be missed by NGS. Our multimodality testing is somewhat unique in the industry and provides the gold standard FISH testing for detecting therapy-related abnormalities, many of which are required to be confirmed by FISH prior to initiating expensive therapy.

We are also focused on opportunities to offer &#8220;liquid biopsy&#8221; testing. We recently launched twelve NEOLAB liquid biopsy tests for hematological disease using next generation sequencing and other advanced molecular technologies. These twelve new tests use cell-free circulating DNA and RNA found in blood plasma to identify molecular abnormalities in the bone marrow without the need for a bone marrow biopsy. The technology is based on the concept that hematologic cells release their DNA, RNA, and protein into circulation as the cells are immersed in blood. The cell-free circulating DNA, RNA and protein are referred to as exosomes, 

&#160;

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

&#160;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

microvesicles, apoptotic bodies or simply DNA- or RNA-protein complexes. Our new tests use proprietary methods to extract these circulating nucleic acids and analyze them using next generation sequencing and advanced methods in order to evaluate molecular abnormalities present in hematological cancers. We estimate that more than 600,000 bone marrow biopsies are performed annually in the United States to diagnose and monitor patients with various hematologic cancers. However, bone marrow biopsies are a painful and uncomfortable procedure for patients, and can be associated with complications. These new tests are designed to help patients by reducing the need for bone marrow biopsies, and to assist clinicians in their treatment of cancer patients. Physicians can utilize the new liquid biopsy tests to: 1) screen patients to determine if a bone marrow biopsy is necessary, especially when myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia is suspected; 2) monitor disease status, response to therapy and predict early relapse; and 3) complete testing when a bone marrow sample is inadequate or is technically difficult to obtain.

We also continue to develop new testing approaches by combining the capabilities of a variety of testing technologies. We introduced a number of NeoTYPE TM profiles that combine multiple molecular tests into multi-gene tests targeting specific types of cancer to help pathologists and oncologists determine cancer subtypes on difficult cases. Managed care payers have expressed interest in the more targeted panels as a more cost effective alternative to ordering large panels that include genes that have never been tied to a particular type of cancer. We use NGS and bi-directional Sanger sequencing analysis which we believe is superior to many of the molecular tests being offered by our competitors because we are able to detect mutations that other methods would not detect. We also add other testing modalities to NGS such as FISH, IHC and flow cytometry which allow for a more comprehensive analysis of each case.

We are working to develop a proprietary NeoLAB (Liquid Biopsy) Prostate cancer test that is performed on blood plasma and urine rather than on prostate tissue biopsies. There are two goals for this test: 1) to diagnose the presence of cancer in patients and 2) to distinguish high-grade from low-grade cancer in patients with prostate cancer. We completed a preliminary patient study in June 2013, and the results were published in March 2014 in the Genetic Testing and Molecular Biomarkers journal. In addition, in February 2014, we completed a follow up study with additional patient samples which confirmed the published preliminary data from the first trial. The results of this second study were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (&#8220;ASCO&#8221;) meeting in 2014. We also conducted a pivotal prospective validation study that targeted over 2,000 patients to further validate the efficacy of our NeoLAB&#8482; Prostate Test. Recruitment for this prospective study was concluded by the end of 2015. Patients are being followed to collect outcome data and perform statistical analysis. We are planning an unrestricted commercial launch of the NeoLAB Prostate Test in 2016.

We also expect to continue to make investments in research and development that will allow us to commercialize a number of new and innovative genetic tests as scientific and medical technological advances are made.

&#160;

Turnaround Times 

We strive to provide industry leading turnaround times for test results to our clients nationwide. By providing information to our clients in a rapid manner, physicians can begin treating their patients as soon as possible. We believe our average 4-5 day turnaround time for our cytogenetics testing services, our average 3-4 day turnaround time for FISH testing services, our 5-7 day turnaround time for molecular testing and our average 1 day turnaround time for flow cytometry and pathology testing services are industry-leading benchmarks for national laboratories. Our consistent timeliness of results is a competitive strength and a driver of additional testing requests by our referring physicians. Rapid turnaround times allow for the performance of other adjunctive tests within an acceptable diagnosis window in order to augment or confirm results and more fully inform treatment options. We believe that our fast turnaround times are a key differentiator versus other national laboratories, and our clients often cite them as a key factor in their relationship with us.

Medical Team 

Our team of medical professionals and Ph.Ds. are specialists in the field of genetics, oncology and pathology. Our medical team is led by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Maher Albitar, a renowned hematopathologist with extensive experience in molecular and genetic testing. Prior to joining NeoGenomics, Dr. Albitar was Medical Director for Hematopathology and Oncology at the Quest Nichols Institute and Chief R&#38;D Director for Hematopathology and Oncology for Quest Diagnostics. He also served as Section Chief for Leukemia at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center and Medical Director of the MD Anderson Molecular laboratory, one of the first labs of its kind in the United States. As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 30 other full-time M.D.s and Ph.Ds in addition to part-time consultants, including our Chief Medical Officer, for specific specialties. The addition of Clarient&#8217;s pathology team has added increased depth to our medical team, and has enhanced our ability to service a wider range of specialties.

Competitive Strengths

Extensive Tech-Only Service Offerings 

We currently have the most extensive menu of &#8220;tech-only&#8221; FISH services in the country. We also offer &#8220;tech-only&#8221; flow cytometry and IHC testing services. These types of testing services allow the professional interpretation component of a test to be performed and billed separately by our physician clients. Our FISH, flow cytometry and other tech-only service offerings allow properly trained and credentialed community-based pathologists to extend their own practices by performing professional interpretations services, which allows them to better service the needs of their local clientele without the need to invest in the lab equipment and personnel required to perform the technical component of genetic and molecular testing.

Our tech-only services are designed to give pathologists the option to choose, on a case by case basis, whether they want to order just the technical information and images relating to a specific test so they can perform the professional interpretation, or order &#8220;global&#8221; services and receive a comprehensive test report which includes a NeoGenomics Pathologist&#8217;s interpretation of the test results. Our clients appreciate the flexibility to access NeoGenomics&#8217; medical staff for difficult or complex cases or when they are otherwise unavailable to perform professional interpretations. We believe this innovative approach to serving the needs of pathology clients&#8217; results in longer term, more committed client relationships that are, in effect, strategic partnerships. Our extensive &#8220;tech-only&#8221; service offerings have differentiated us and allowed us to compete more effectively against larger, more entrenched competitors in our niche of the industry.

Global Service Offerings 

We also offer a comprehensive suite of technical and interpretation services, to meet the needs of those clients who are not credentialed and trained in interpreting genetic tests and who are looking for specialists to interpret the testing results for them. In our global service offerings, our lab performs the technical component of the tests and our M.D.s and Ph.Ds. provide the service of interpreting the results of those tests. Our professional staff is also available for post-test consultative services. Clients using our global service offering rely on the expertise of our medical team to give them the answers they need in a timely manner to help inform their diagnoses and treatment decisions. Many of our tech-only clients also rely on our medical team for difficult or challenging cases by ordering our global testing services on a case-by-case basis or our medical team can serve as a backup to support our clients who need help to satisfy the continued and demanding requirements of their practice. Our reporting capabilities allow for all relevant case data from our global services to be captured in one summary report. When providing global services, NeoGenomics bills for both the technical and professional component of the test, which results in a higher reimbursement level.

Client Education Programs 

We believe we have one of the most extensive client education programs in the genetic and molecular testing industry. We train pathologists how to use and interpret genetic testing services so that they can better interpret technical data and render their diagnosis. Our educational programs include an extensive library of on-demand training modules, online courses, and custom tailored on-site training programs that are designed to prepare clients to utilize our tech-only services. We offer training and information on new cancer tests and the latest developments in the field of molecular genetic testing. Each year, we also regularly sponsor seminars and webinars on emerging topics of interest in our field. Our medical staff is involved in many aspects of our training programs.

Superior Testing Technologies and Instrumentation 

We use some of the most advanced testing technologies and instrumentation in the laboratory industry. The use of next generation sequencing in our molecular testing allows us to detect multiple mutations and our proprietary techniques allow us to achieve high sensitivity in our next generation sequencing testing. In addition, we use high sensitivity Sanger sequencing, RNA and DNA quantification, SNP/Cytogenetic arrays, Fragment Length analysis, and other molecular testing technologies. Our automated FISH and Cytogenetics tools allow us to deliver the highest quality testing to our clients and our flow cytometry laboratory uses 10-color flow cytometry analysis technology on a technical-only basis. We are one of only a few laboratories with an electron microscopy department for diagnosis in complex renal case analysis. NeoGenomics is continually testing new laboratory equipment in order to remain at the forefront of new developments in the testing field.

Laboratory Information System 

We believe we have a state-of-the-art LIS that interconnects our locations and provides flexible reporting solutions to clients. This system allows us to standardize testing and deliver uniform test results and images throughout our network, regardless of the location that any specific portion of a test is performed within our network. This allows us to move specimens and image analysis work between locations to better balance our workload. Our LIS also allows us to offer highly specialized and customizable reporting solutions to our tech-only clients. For instance, our &#8220;tech-only&#8221; FISH and flow cytometry applications allow our community-based pathologist clients to tailor individual reports to their specifications and incorporate only the images they select and then issue and sign-out such reports using our system. Our customized reporting solution also allows our clients to incorporate test results performed on ancillary tests not performed at NeoGenomics into summary report templates. This FlexREPORT feature has been well-received by clients.

National Direct Sales Force 

Our direct sales force has been trained extensively in cancer genetic testing and consultative selling skills to service the needs of clients. Our sales team for the core NeoGenomics business is organized into five regions (Northeast, Southeast, North Central, South Central and West), and we have one additional separate sales team for each of our BioPharma Services our Path Logic division. These sales representatives all utilize our custom Customer Relationship Management System (&#8220;CRM&#8221;) to manage their territories, and we have integrated all of the important customer care functionality within our LIS into the CRM so that our sales representatives can stay informed of emerging issues and opportunities within their regions. Our in-house customer care team is aligned with our field sales team to serve the needs of our clients by utilizing the same LIS and CRM. Our field teams can see in real-time when a client calls the laboratory, the reason for the call, the resolution, and if face-to-face interaction is needed for follow-up.

Geographic Locations 

Many high complexity laboratories within the cancer testing niche have frequently operated a core facility on either the West Coast or the East Coast of the United States to service the needs of their customers around the country. We believe our clients and prospects desire to do business with a laboratory with national breadth and a local presence. We have eight facilities and five large laboratory locations in Fort Myers, Florida, West Sacramento, California, Aliso Viejo, California, Irvine, California and Houston Texas and three smaller laboratory locations in Fresno, California, Nashville, Tennessee and Tampa, Florida. Our objective is to &#8220;operate one lab with multiple locations&#8221; in order to deliver standardized, high quality, test results. We intend to continue to develop and open new laboratories and/or expand our current facilities as market situations dictate and business opportunities arise.

Scientific Pipeline 

In the past few years our field has experienced a rapid increase in tests that are tied to specific &#8220;genomic pathways&#8221;. These predictive tests are typically individualized for a small sub-set of patients with a specific subtype of cancer. The therapeutic target in the genomic pathway is typically a small molecule found at the level of the cell surface, within the cytoplasm and/or within the nucleus. These genomic pathways, known as the &#8220;Hallmarks of Cancer&#8221;, contain a target-rich environment for small-molecule &#8220;anti-therapies&#8221;. These anti-therapies target specific mutations in the major cancer pathways such as the Proliferation Pathway, the Apoptotic Pathway, the Angiogenic Pathway, the Metastasis Pathway, and the Signaling Pathways and Anti-Signaling Pathways.

Our consolidated 15% year-over-year revenue growth is primarily the result of a broad based increase in the number of new clients as evidenced by the 34% increase in case volume. A portion of this increase is due to the fact that the 2014 consolidated figures do not include a full year of activity for Path Logic (as Path Logic was acquired on July 8, 2014). The year-over-year revenue growth in our Base Business was 12% for the period and the related increase in case volume for our Base Business was 25%. Clarient was purchased from GE Medical on December 30, 2015. The two days of revenue in 2015 from Clarient accounted for $665 thousand, which added 0.8% to our consolidated annual revenue growth. 

&#160;

In addition to adding new clients as mentioned above, we believe that the increase in revenues is the direct result of our efforts to innovate by developing one of the most comprehensive molecular testing menus in the industry. Our leading molecular testing menu has allowed us to up-sell many existing clients which is also helping to drive our growth. Customers increasingly see us as a one-stop-shop able to handle all of their cancer testing needs. In addition, we expanded our sales team during 2015 and are seeing the benefit from that expansion. 

&#160;

We believe that the market for our services is growing. As new tests and new therapies come onto the market a companion diagnostic test often comes onto the market as well. For example, the new PDL1 test is a result of the introduction of a new immunotherapy drug. The overall market growth is contributing to our company growth and we believe that we are achieving revenue growth in excess of the growth in the market. 

&#160;

Consolidated average revenue per requisition decreased approximately 15% year-over-year. This decrease in revenue per test is due to a significant reduction in reimbursement for FISH testing as a result of changes in the primary FISH reimbursement structure that were introduced in 2015 by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#8220;CMS&#8221;). CMS has reset the rates for FISH testing in 2016 and has put into place significant increases for the technical component of FISH testing.

Our consolidated cost of revenue increased approximately 21% year-over-year, primarily due to our increase in testing volume. As a percentage of revenue, costs increased by 3%. A portion of these changes are due to the fact that the 2014 consolidated figures do not include a full year of activity for Path Logic (as Path Logic was acquired on July 8, 2014). The cost of revenue in our Base Business increased by approximately 15% year-over-year, the related increase in costs of revenue as a percent of revenue for our Base Business was 1%.

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

&#160;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

We reduced our consolidated costs per requisition by 10% year-over-year which was the result of several factors including: 

&#160;

&#183; 

Improved productivity in our laboratory, as we experienced an increase in the amount of tests processed per laboratory FTE (full time equivalent personnel). This was driven by improved capacity planning and utilization along with several process improvements in the laboratory. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Our supplies cost as a percentage of revenue declined based on efforts made to reduce price from certain key vendors and efforts by the operations team to more efficiently utilize supplies and reduce supply waste. We have also changed vendors and platforms in order to drive down our cost of testing. 

Our best practice teams work closely with our information technology team to re-design our systems and processes to improve efficiencies. We continue to focus on improving our laboratory operations in order to continue to drive further improvements in our cost per test. We believe that we will continue to realize a reduction in average cost per requisition in future periods based on the activities of our best practices teams. We expect that the reductions in the average revenue per requisition described in the revenue section above will stabilize and we will see an increase in revenue per test as well as an increase in gross margin as a percentage of revenue.

Seasonality

The majority of our testing volume is dependent on patients being treated by hematology/oncology professionals and other healthcare providers. The volume of our testing services generally declines modestly during the summer vacation season, year-end holiday periods and other major holidays, particularly when those holidays fall during the middle of the week. In addition, the volume of our testing tends to decline due to extreme adverse weather conditions, such as excessively hot or cold spells, heavy snow, hurricanes or tornados in certain regions, consequently reducing revenues and cash flows in any affected period. Therefore, comparison of the results of successive periods may not accurately reflect trends for future periods.

Competition 

The genetic and molecular testing niche of the laboratory testing industry is highly competitive and, given the opportunities in this industry, we expect it to become even more competitive. There has been a high pace of consolidation in the industry in recent years and several new large players have entered the market. Competitive factors in genetic and molecular testing generally include the reputation of the laboratory, range of services offered, pricing, convenience of sample collection and pick-up, quality of analysis and reporting, medical staff, timeliness of delivery of completed reports (i.e. turnaround times) and post-reporting follow-up for clients.

Our competitors in the United States are numerous and include major national medical testing laboratories, hospital laboratories and in-house physician laboratories. Our principal competitors are Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America. Many of these competitors have greater financial resources and production capabilities than us. These companies may succeed in developing service offerings that are more effective than any that we have or may develop, and may also prove to be more successful than we are in marketing such services. In addition, technological advances or different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors may render our service offerings obsolete, less effective or uneconomical.

We intend to continue our efforts to gain market share by offering industry-leading turnaround times, a broad service menu, high-quality test reports, new tests including proprietary ones, enhanced post-test consultation services, and the personal attention from our direct sales force. In addition, we believe our flexible reporting solutions, which enable clients to report out customized results in a secure, real-time environment, will allow us to continue to gain market share.

Suppliers

The Company orders its laboratory and research supplies from large national laboratory supply companies such as Abbott Molecular, Fisher Scientific, Dako, Illumina, Life Technologies, Metasystems, Leica, Ventana (Roche) and Beckman Coulter. We do not believe any disruption from any one of these suppliers would have a material effect on our business.

Dependence on Major Clients 

We market our services to pathologists, oncologists, urologists, other clinicians, hospitals and other clinical laboratories throughout the United States. The Company&#8217;s client base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed clients diversified across various customer types. For the year ended December 31, 2015, no clients accounted for more than 5% of revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, a large oncology practice with multiple locations in the state of Florida accounted for 10.1% and 15.8%, respectively, of total revenue.

Our proportion of client direct billing has increased due to the expiration of the &#8220;TC-Grandfather clause&#8221; in July 2012, which shifted the billing for the technical component of certain anatomic pathology services away from Medicare and directly to hospitals. More payers including private commercial insurances and Medicare Advantage plans have followed Medicare&#8217;s lead and are practicing &#8220;consolidated payment&#8221; or &#8220;bundled payment&#8221; models where they pay the hospitals a lump sum, which is intended to include laboratory testing. This reflects an increase in the amount of risk sharing that CMS and other private payers are encouraging providers such as hospital systems to undertake. We anticipate a gradual increase in the percentage of client direct billing over the coming years. 

Trademarks 

The &#8220;NeoGenomics&#8221; and Clarient names and logos have been trademarked with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. We have also trademarked or have applications pending for the brand names NeoFISH, NeoFLOW, NeoSITE, NeoArray, NeoTYPE, NeoSCORE, NeoLAB and NeoLINK. We have also trademarked the marketing slogans, &#8220;When time matters and results count&#8221; and &#8220;Time matters, results count.&#8221;

Insurance

We maintain professional liability and other insurance policies. We believe that our present insurance is sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures, but we cannot assure that we will not incur liabilities in excess of the policy coverage limits. In addition, although we believe that we will be able to continue to obtain adequate insurance coverage, we cannot assure that we will be able to do so at acceptable cost.

Number of Employees 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 850 full-time equivalent employees. In addition, approximately 20 other individuals, including 20 pathologists and our Chief Medical Officer, serve as consultants to the Company on a regular basis. The Company also had approximately 10 temporary contract personnel at December 31, 2015. Our employees are not represented by any union and we believe our employee relations are good.

Government Regulation

The laboratory business is subject to extensive governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. The laboratories are required to be licensed by the states, certified by the federal government to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and are subject to extensive requirements as a condition of participation in various governmental health benefits programs. The failure to comply with any of the applicable federal and state laws, regulations, and reimbursement guidelines could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#8217;s business. The applicable laws and regulations, and the interpretations of them, change frequently and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to audit, inquiry, or investigation with respect to some aspect of its operations. Some of the federal and state laws and regulations are described below under &#8220;Clinical Laboratory Operations,&#8221; &#8220;Anti-Fraud and Abuse Laws,&#8221; &#8220;The False Claims Act,&#8221; &#8220;Confidentiality of Health Information&#8221; and &#8220;Food and Drug Administration&#8221;.

Clinical Laboratory Operations

Licensure and Accreditation 

The Company operates clinical laboratories in Florida, Tennessee, Texas and California. The laboratories are licensed as required by the states in which they are located. In addition, the laboratories in Fort Myers, Florida and Nashville, Tennessee are licensed by the State of New York as they accept clinical specimens obtained in New York. We also became licensed by the State of New York to perform molecular and histology testing in our Irvine, California location. All of the NeoGenomics laboratories are certified in accordance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, as amended (&#8220;CLIA&#8221;). Under CLIA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;HHS&#8221;) establishes quality standards for each category of testing performed by the laboratory. The categories of testing include waived, moderate complexity and high complexity. NeoGenomics&#8217; laboratories are categorized as high complexity. Five of the eight site locations for NeoGenomics&#8217; laboratories are also accredited by the College of American Pathologists (&#8220;CAP&#8221;) and actively participate in CAP&#8217;s proficiency testing programs for all tests offered by the Company. Our Tampa, Florida and Fresno, California facilities are read-only laboratories and therefore, CAP accreditation wouldn&#8217;t fully qualify and the Houston, TX location supports clinical trials and pharma services. Proficiency testing programs require the participating laboratories to test specimens that they receive from the testing entity and return the results. The testing entity, conducting an approved program, analyzes the results returned and provides to the Company a quality control report assessing the results. An important component of a quality assurance program is to establish whether the laboratory&#8217;s test results are accurate and valid.

The federal and state certification and licensure programs establish standards for the operation of clinical laboratories, including, but not limited to, qualifications of personnel and quality control. Compliance with such standards is verified by periodic inspections by inspectors employed by federal and state regulatory agencies and accrediting organizations. The Company has a Quality Assurance Committee which is comprised of representatives of all departments of the Company, conducts routine internal surveys and requires corrective action reports in response to the findings.

Quality of Care 

Our mission is to improve patient care through quality cancer genetic diagnostic services. By delivering exceptional service and innovative solutions, we aspire to become the world&#8217; leading cancer and information company. The quality of care provided to clients and their patients is of paramount importance to us. We maintain quality control processes, including standard operating procedures, controls, performance measurement and reporting mechanisms. Our employees are committed to providing accurate, reliable and consistent services at all times. Any concerns regarding the quality of testing or services provided by the Company are immediately communicated to NeoGenomics Medical Team, Company management and, if necessary, the Director for Quality Systems, the Compliance Department or Human Resources Department. We also continually revise and improve our tests and work with laboratory equipment vendors to ensure that our laboratory has the highest possible quality.

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

&#160;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

Compliance Program 

The health care industry is highly regulated and scrutinized with respect to fraud, abusive billing practices and improper financial relationships between health care companies and their referral sources. The Office of the Inspector General of HHS (the &#8220;OIG&#8221;) has published compliance guidance, including the Compliance Program Guidance for Clinical Laboratories in August of 1998, and advisory opinions. The Company has implemented a robust Compliance Program which is overseen by our Board of Directors. Its objective is to ensure compliance with the myriad federal and state laws, regulations and governmental guidance applicable to our business. Our program consists of training/education of employees and monitoring and auditing Company practices. The Board of Directors has formed a Compliance Committee of the Board which meets regularly to discuss all compliance-related issues that may affect the Company. The Company continuously reviews its policies and procedures as new regulations and interpretations come to light to comply with applicable regulations. The Director of Compliance reports directly to the Compliance Committee.

Hotline 

As part of its Compliance Program, the Company provides a hotline for employees who wish to anonymously or confidentially report suspected violations of our codes of conduct, policies/procedures, or laws and regulations. Employees are strongly encouraged to report any suspected violation if they do not feel the problem can be appropriately addressed through the normal chain of command. The hotline does not replace other resources available to our employees, including supervisors, managers and human resources staff, but is an alternative channel available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The hotline forwards all reports to the Director of Compliance who is responsible for investigating, reporting to the Compliance Committee, and documenting the disposition of each report. The hotline forwards any calls pertaining to the financial statements or financial issues to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Company does not allow any retaliation against an employee who reports a compliance related issue.

Laboratory Developed Tests (&#8220;LDTs&#8221;)

The federal Food and Drug Administration, (&#8220;FDA&#8221;), has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits reagents and other medical devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing. High complexity and CLIA-certified laboratories, such as ours, frequently develop internal testing procedures to provide diagnostic results to customers. These tests are referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs. LDTs are subject to CMS oversight through its enforcement of CLIA. The FDA has also claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but indicates that it has exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs offered by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories, and has not subjected these tests to the panoply of FDA rules and regulations governing medical devices. However, the FDA has stated that it has been considering changes in the way it believes that laboratories ought to be allowed to offer these LDTs, and since 2010 publicly announced that it would be exercising regulatory authority over LDTS, using a risk-based approach that will direct more resources to tests with the highest risk of injury. In October 2014, the FDA announced its proposed framework and timetable for implementing this guidance. Through the American Clinical Laboratory Association (&#8220;ACLA&#8221;), the industry has announced its intention to oppose the guidance proposed by the FDA and has engaged the services of Professor Lawrence Tribe and former Solicitor General Paul Clement to represent the interests of the industry in this matter. The FDA has completed a comment period and received numerous comments on the proposed regulations. The FDA has stated that they are considering the comments and are revising the proposed regulations. This FDA regulation may result in increased regulatory burdens for us to register and continue to offer our tests or to develop and introduce new tests and may increase our costs. We cannot be certain as to which of our tests would require FDA review and approval, and if approval was to be required, that our tests could obtain FDA approval.

Anti-Fraud and Abuse Laws

The federal laws governing Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health benefits, as well as other state and federal laws, regulate certain as pects of the relationships between health care providers, including clinical laboratories, and their referral sources, including physicians, hospitals, other laboratories and other entities. We are subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (&#8220;federal AKS&#8221;), as well as similar state statutes and regulations, which prohibit the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration in return for referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of items or services payable by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federally funded healthcare program. The federal AKS defines remuneration to include anything of value, in cash or in kind, and thus can implicate financial relationships including payments not commensurate with fair market value, such as in the form of space, equipment leases, professional or technical services or anything else of value. 

NEOGENOMICS, INC.

&#160;

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

The federal AKS is an &#8220;intent&#8209;based&#8221; statute, meaning that a violation occurs when one or both parties intend the remuneration to be in exchange for or to induce referrals. Violations of the federal AKS may result in substantial civil or criminal penalties, including criminal fines of up to $25,000, imprisonment of up to five years, civil penalties under the federal CMP Law of up to $50,000 for each violation, plus three times the remuneration involved, civil penalties under the federal False Claims Act of up to $11,000 for each claim submitted, plus three times the amounts paid for such claims and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Because of the broad proscriptions of the Anti-Kickback Statute, subsequent federal law required the HHS to publish regulations to guide the health care community in structuring relationships that would not violate the law. The OIG published regulations outlining certain categories of relationships between health care providers and persons or entities that may have a referral relationship that would be deeme d not to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. These regulations are known as the Safe Harbor Regulations (the &#8220;Safe Harbor Regulations&#8221;) because persons who enter into transactions that comply with all of the criteria for an applicable safe harbor will not violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Safe Harbor Regulations are narrowly drafted to avoid inadvertently immunizing prohibited conduct. A relationship or transaction that does not meet all of the criteria of an applicable Safe Harbor Regulation is not dee med to be illegal per se, rather it may be subject to additional scrutiny. The Company endeavors to comply with the Safe Harbor Regulations, but there can be no assurance that the Company would not be subject to investigation and, if investigated, that relationships could be found not to comply with the Safe Harbor Regulations.

Further, most states have adopted similar anti-kickback laws prohibiting the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration in exchange for referrals, and typically impose criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licenses. Some of these state laws apply to items and services paid for by private payers as well as to government payers. In addition, many states have adopted laws prohibiting the splitting or sharing of fees between physicians and non&#8209;physicians, as well as between treating physicians and referral sources. We believe our arrangements with physicians comply with the federal AKS, and state anti-kickback and fee&#8209;splitting laws of the states in which we operate, however, if government regulatory authorities were to disagree, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, and be required to restructure or terminate our contractual and other arrangements with physicians. This could result in a loss of revenue and have a material adverse effect on our business.

Medicare Payment Guidelines

We have various billing arrangements with our clients and with third party paye rs, including the Medicare program. When the Company bills the client for all, or a portion of, a lab test performed, these client billing arrangements are priced competitively at fair market value. These client billing arrangements may implicate the prohibition of the Medicare program against charging the Medicare or Medicaid programs fees substantially in excess of the Company&#8217;s usual and customary charges. These billing arrangements may also implicate the federal Stark Law and the federal and state anti-kickback statutes.

Federal law authorizes the Secretary of HHS to suspend or exclude providers f rom participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs if providers charge Medicare or state Medicaid programs fees &#8220;substantially in excess&#8221; of their &#8220;usual charges.&#8221; The OIG has stated in commentary to various final and proposed regulations its position that this statute has limited applicability to the current Medicare reimbursement system, though the OIG has also commented &#8220;we note that ancillary services, such as laboratory tests and drugs, would remain subject to these regulations, even when furnishe d by physicians. &#8221; [F.R., Vol. 68, No. 178, September 15, 2003 at 53940]. As such, application of this prohibition to the Company&#8217;s business is not clear, but the government could scrutinize the Company&#8217;s pricing and billing arrangements and determine to apply this law. 

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services promulgated, in 2009, a revision to the regulation that prohibits the mark up of purchased diagnostic services [42 C.F.R. &#167;414.50] (the &#8220;Anti-Markup Rule&#8221;). The Anti-Markup Rule prohibits a physician or other supplier from marking up the price paid for the technical or professional component of a diagnostic test that was ordered by the billing physician or supplier and which was performed by a physician who does not share a practice with the billing physician or supplier. The billing physician is prohibited from billing the Medicare program an amount greater than the lesser of: (i) the performing supplier&#8217;s net charge to the billing physician; (ii) the billing physician&#8217;s actual charge; or (iii) the fee schedule amount for the test that would be allowed if the performing supplier billed directly.

In light of the various federal regulations and guidance from the OIG, the Company seeks to price its products competitively while endeavoring to meet applicable statutes and regulations.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (Continued) 

Physician Self-Referral Laws

The federal law referred to as the &#8220;Stark Law&#8221;, named after U.S. Representative Fortney &#8220;Pete&#8221; Stark, prohibits physicians who have a financial relationship with an entity from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to that entity for the provision of designated health services unless the transaction meets an exception to the law. A &#8220;financial relationship&#8221; includes both an ownership interest and/or a compensation arrangement with a physician, both direct and indirect, and DHS includes, but is not limited to, laboratory services. 

The Stark Law prohibits an entity that receives a prohibited DHS referral from seeking payment from Medicare for any DHS services perform ed as a result of such a referral, unless an arrangement is carefully structure to satisfy every requirement of a regulatory exception. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, and thus any technical violation requires repayment of all &#8220;tainted&#8221; referr als, regardless of the intent. Penalties for violating the Stark Law may include the denial of payment to an entity for the impermissible provision of DHS, the requirement to refund any amounts collected in violation of the Stark Law, and civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 for each violation and $100,000 for each circumvention arrangement or scheme. Other implications of a Stark Law violation may include criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs, and potential False Claims Act liability, including via &#8220;qui tam&#8221; action. The Company endeavors to structure its financial relationships in compliance with the Stark Law and with similar state physician self-referral laws.

Further, many states have promulgated self &#8209;referral laws and regulations similar to the federal Stark Law, but these vary significantly based on the state. For example, the Florida Patient Self-Referral Act of 1992, as amended, (the &#8220;Florida Self-Referral Act&#8221;) is similar to the Stark law, but is narrower in some resp ects and broader in others. In addition to services reimbursed by Medicaid or government payers, often these state laws and regulations can encompass services reimbursed by private payers as well. Penalties for violating state self-referral laws and regulations vary based on the state, but often include civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicaid, and loss of licenses. Our financial arrangements with physicians are governed by the federal Stark Law and similar state self-referral laws, and we rely on certain exceptions to the Stark Law with respect to such relationships. While we believe that our financial relationships with physicians and referral practices are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that government authorities would agree. If we are found by the government to be in violation of the Stark Law or a similar state self-referral law, we could be subject to significant penalties, including fines as specified above, exclusion from participation in government and private payer programs and requirements to refund amounts previously received from government.

The False Claims Act

The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the U.S. government, or to a Medicare program contractor, a false or fraudulent claim for payment, or knowingly making or using a false record or statement to have a false claim paid by the government, or conspiring to defraud the U.S. government, or knowingly making or using a false statement to conceal an obligation to pay the government, or improperly retaining overpayments from, the government . A violation of the federal False Claims Act is punishable by a civil penalty of $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate false claim plus three times the amount of damages sustained by the government. Further, False Claims Act liability may lead to exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. The False Claims Act&#8217;s &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; or &#8220;qui tam&#8221; provisions are being used with more frequency to challenge the reimbursement practices of providers and suppliers. Those provisions allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has submitted false claims for payment to the federal government. The government must decide whether to intervene in the lawsuit and whether to prosecute the case. If it declines to do so, the individual may pursue the case alone, although the government must be kept apprised of the progress of the lawsuit. Whether or not the federal government intervenes in the case, it will receive the majority of any recovery. The successful qui tam relator who brought the case is entitled to a portion of the proceeds and its attorneys&#8217; fees and costs. As most qui tam cases are filed by current or former employees, an effective compliance program plays a crucial role in reducing the Company&#8217;s exposure to liability. It is also a criminal offense, under Title 18 U.S. Code, Section 287, for a person or entity to make a claim against the United States or any department or agency, knowing the claim to be false, fictitious or fraudulent. The penalty is a fine, and imprisonment of up to five years. The federal False Claims Act has been an effective enforcement tool for the federal government. Many states have enacted similar false claims acts as well.

The Company seeks to structure its arrangements with physicians and other clients to be in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, Stark Law, state laws, and the federal False Claims Act and to stay abreast of current developments and changes in the law and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are complex and subject to interpretation. Consequently, we are unable to ascertain with certa inty that any of our transactions will not be subject to scrutiny and, if scrutinized, will not result in sanctions or penalties. The Company has taken, and will continue to take, actions to endeavor to ensure compliance with the myriad federal and state laws that govern our business.

Confidentiality and Security of Personal Health Information 

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended (&#8220;HIPAA&#8221;), contains provisions that protect individually identifiable health information from unauthorized use or disclosure by covered entities and their business associates. The Office for Civil Rights of HHS, the agency responsible for enforcing HIPAA, has publish ed regulations to address the privacy (the &#8220;Privacy Rule&#8221;) and security (the &#8220;Security Rule&#8221;) of protected health information (&#8220;PHI&#8221;). The Company is a covered entity under HIPAA and has adopted policies and procedures to comply with the Privacy Rule and t he Security Rule and HIPAA statute. The health care facilities and providers that refer specimens to the Company are also bound by HIPAA.

HIPAA also requires that all providers who transmit claims for health care goods or services electronically utilize standard transaction and data sets and to standardize national provider identification codes. The Company has taken necessary steps to comply with HIPAA regulations, utilizes standard transaction data sets, and has obtained and implemented national provider identifiers, or NPIs, as the standard unique health identifier in filing and processing health care claims and other transactions.

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (&#8220;ARRA&#8221;) recently enacted the HITECH Act which extends the scope of HIPAA to permit enforcement against business associates for a violation, establishes new requirements to notify the Office for Civil Rights of HHS of a breach of HIPAA, and allows the Attorneys General of the states to bring actions to enforce violations of HIPAA. Rules implementing various aspects of HIPAA are continuing to be promulgated . With respect to these rules, commencing July 1, 2012, CMS required that all HIPAA-covered entities such as the Company to conduct electronic claim submissions and related electronic transactions under a new HIPAA transaction standard called Version 5010. CMS has required this upgrade in connection with another new requirement applicable to the industry, the implementation of new diagnostic code sets to be used in claims submission. The new diagnostic code sets are called the ICD-10-CM, and were implemented on October 1, 2015. The Company has been aware of these changes for some time, and believes successfully adopted the new standards. However, it is expected that these changes, in part icular the adoption of new diagnostic codes &#8212; which must be provided to us accurately by referring physicians in order for us to receive payment from payers, such as Medicare &#8212; may continue to result in a degree of disruption and confusion as providers continue to implement the standards, which may adversely affect Company operations, including reimbursement rates.

In addition to the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule described above, the Company is subject to state laws regarding the handling and disclosure of patient records and patient health information. These laws vary widely. Penalties for violation include sanctions against a laboratory&#8217;s licensure as well as civil or criminal penalties. Additionally, private individuals may have a right of action against the Company for a violation of a state&#8217;s privacy laws. We believe we are in material compliance with current state laws regarding the confidentiality of health information and will continue to monitor and comply with new or changing state laws.

The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, enacted on Dec. 4, 2003, directed the Federal Trade Commission to implement regulations to protect consumers against identity theft. The Federal Trade Commission issued what are referred to as the &#8220;Red Flag Rules&#8221;, but the effective date for enforcement has been delayed several times. The Red Flag Rules are now subject to enforcement as of January 1, 2012. The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010 (&#8220;RFPCA&#8221;) gave some relief to health care providers by changing the definition of &#8220;creditor&#8221;, thereby narrowing the application to health care providers who do not otherwise obtain or use consumer reports or furnish information to consumer reporting agencies in connection with a credit transaction. Health care providers who act as a &#8220;creditor&#8221; to any of its patients with respect to a &#8220;covered account&#8221; are required to implement an identity theft protection program to safeguard patient information. A creditor includes any entity that regularly in the course of business obtains or uses consumer reports in connection with credit transactions, furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency in connection with a credit transaction, or advances funds to or on behalf of a person based on the person&#8217;s obligation to repay the funds or repayable from specific property pledged by or on behalf of the person. But, a creditor, as defined in the RFPCA, that advances funds on behalf of a person for expenses incidental to a services provided by the creditor to that person is not subject to the Red Flag Rules. The Company has developed a written program designed to identify and detect the relevant warning signs &#8211; or &#8220;red flags&#8221; &#8211; of identity theft and establish appropriate responses to prevent and mitigate identity theft in order to comply with the Red Flag Rules. We are also developing a plan to update the program, and the program will be managed by senior management staff under the policy direction of our Board of Directors. The Company intends to take such steps as necessary to determine the extent to which the Red Flag Rules apply to it and to take such steps as necessary to comply.
