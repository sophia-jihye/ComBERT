Our Business 

&#160;

We are a biotechnology company that designs, optimizes and develops novel small molecule drugs that block key enzymes involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. We focus on the treatment of rare diseases in which significant unmet medical needs exist and align with our capabilities and expertise. We integrate the disciplines of biology, crystallography, medicinal chemistry and computer modeling to discover and develop small molecule pharmaceuticals through the process known as structure-guided drug design. Structure-guided drug design is a drug discovery approach by which we design synthetic compounds from detailed structural knowledge of the active sites of enzyme targets associated with particular diseases. We use X-ray crystallography, computer modeling of molecular structures and advanced chemistry techniques to focus on the three-dimensional molecular structure and active site characteristics of the enzymes that control cellular biology. Enzymes are proteins that act as catalysts for many vital biological reactions. Our goal generally is to design a compound that will fit in the active site of an enzyme and thereby prevent its catalytic activity. Molecules from our discovery efforts which are commercially available or that are in development are summarized in the table below:

Business Strategy 

&#160;

Our business strategy is to create shareholder value by focusing our discovery and development efforts on oral drugs for rare diseases for which a significant unmet medical need exists. We select disease targets and product candidates in which a small molecule would offer a significant benefit over existing products or would be the first to market. We strive to advance our product candidate portfolio from discovery to commercial markets efficiently by utilizing a small group of talented and highly-skilled employees working in conjunction with strategic outsource partners. BioCryst is unique in its approach to treat orphan diseases with small molecules utilizing crystallography and structure-guided drug design. The principal elements of our strategy are: 

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; Focusing on High Value-Added Structure-Guided Drug Design Technologies. We utilize structure-guided drug design in order to most efficiently develop new therapeutic candidates. Structure-guided drug design is a process by which we design a product candidate through detailed analysis of the enzyme target, which the product candidate must inhibit in order to stop the progression of the disease or disorder. We believe that structure-guided drug design is a powerful tool for the efficient development of small-molecule product candidates that have the potential to be safe and effective. Our structure-guided drug design technologies typically allow us to design and synthesize multiple product candidates that inhibit the same enzyme target, with the goal of establishing broad patent protection and formulating compounds with competitive advantages. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; Selecting Inhibitors that are Promising Product Candidates. We start by selecting disease targets with well-understood biology and characteristics that fit with our ability to utilize structure-guided drug design capabilities to build potent and specific enzyme inhibitors. Next, we narrow our selection of these product candidates based on product characteristics, such as initial indications of safety and biologic activity on the target. &#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; Developing our Product Candidates Efficiently. An important element of our business strategy is to efficiently progress our product candidates through the development process. In order to accomplish this, we strive for disease targets with a defined clinical and regulatory pathway for approval. In addition, we control fixed costs and overhead by outsourcing with strategic partners and contractors or entering into license agreements with third parties, including the U.S. Government. We maintain a streamlined corporate infrastructure that focuses our expertise. By contracting with the U.S. Government and outsourcing certain aspects of our operations, we are able to control overhead costs and focus financial resources directly where they provide the most benefit and reduce our business risk. &#160;

We are a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1986. Our corporate headquarters is located at 4505 Emperor Blvd., Suite 200, Durham, North Carolina 27703 and the corporate telephone number is (919) 859-1302.

RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) 

&#160;

Peramivir is an intravenous neuraminidase inhibitor approved in multiple countries for the treatment of patients with influenza, most recently in the United States as RAPIVAB &#174; . Influenza is a seasonal virus with the highest infection rates generally observed in colder months. Intravenous (&#8220;i.v.&#8221;) peramivir injection has also been approved in Japan (RAPIACTA &#174; ) and Korea (PERAMIFLU &#174; ). In the countries for which peramivir is commercially available, influenza occurs primarily during the September to April timeframe. 

&#160;

RAPIVAB was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) on December 19, 2014 for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients 18 years and older who have been symptomatic for no more than two days. In December 2013, we submitted a New Drug Application (&#8220;NDA&#8221;) which contained data from over 2,700 subjects treated with peramivir in 27 clinical trials. We made RAPIVAB available for commercial sale through agreements with specialty distributorships during the 2014-2015 influenza season. On June 17, 2015, we announced that BioCryst licensed RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) for the treatment of influenza to CSL Limited (&#8220;CSL&#8220;), a global biopharmaceutical company. RAPIVAB is being commercialized by a subsidiary of CSL called Seqirus UK Limited (&#8220;SUL&#8221;), which specializes in influenza prevention through the supply of seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine to global markets. Under the terms of the agreement, SUL obtained worldwide rights to commercialize RAPIVAB, with the exception of Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Israel. BioCryst retained all rights to pursue pandemic stockpiling orders for RAPIVAB from the U.S. Government, while SUL is responsible for government stockpiling outside the U.S. With the out-license of RAPIVAB to SUL, a strategic and well-suited commercialization partner, our current goals for RAPIVAB are to: (1) obtain a stockpiling procurement contract with the U.S. Government to realize the strategic value of this program; (2) fulfill our post-approval development requirements, including conducting a pediatric trial; and (3) submit a Marketing Authorization Application (&#8220;MAA&#8221;) and New Drug Submission (&#8220;NDS&#8221;) in the European Union and Canada, respectively, to allow SUL the ability to commercialize the drug in those regions. 

&#160;

&#160;

In January 2016, we filed a NDS with Health Canada for RAPIVAB as an i.v. treatment for acute, uncomplicated influenza.

&#160;

RAPIVAB was developed under a $234.8 million contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority within the United States Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;BARDA/HHS&#8221;), which expired on June 30, 2014. See &#8220;Collaborations and In-License Relationships&#8212;BARDA/HHS&#8221; below for a further discussion of this development contract.

&#160;

In January 2010, our partner Shionogi &#38; Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Shionogi&#8221;) received the first approval for peramivir injection and launched it in Japan under the commercial name RAPIACTA. It was initially approved for the treatment of adults with uncomplicated seasonal influenza, as well as those at high-risk for complications associated with influenza. In October 2010, Shionogi received approval for an additional indication to treat children and infants with influenza in Japan. In August 2010, Green Cross Corporation (&#8220;Green Cross&#8221;) received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Korean Food &#38; Drug Administration under the commercial name PERAMIFLU to treat patients with influenza A &#38; B viruses, including pandemic H1N1 and avian influenza. In addition, we have a regional collaboration for the development and commercialization of peramivir in Israel.

&#160;

Hereditary Angioedema Drug Candidates 

&#160;

Avoralstat : Avoralstat is our most advanced hereditary angioedema (&#8220;HAE&#8221;) product candidate in a suite of molecules being developed as oral treatments for the prevention of HAE attacks. Avoralstat is positioned to be the first oral prophylactic kallikrein inhibitor for the prevention of HAE attacks. Avoralstat is a novel, selective inhibitor of plasma kallikrein in development as an orally-administered treatment for the prevention of attacks in patients with HAE. By inhibiting plasma kallikrein, avoralstat suppresses bradykinin production. Bradykinin is the mediator of acute swelling attacks in HAE patients. HAE is a rare, severely debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition that occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 people. HAE symptoms include recurrent episodes of edema in various locations, including the hands, feet, face, genitalia and airway. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can lead to death by asphyxiation. In addition, patients often have bouts of excruciating abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting caused by swelling in the intestinal wall. 

&#160;

In December 2014 and January 2015, respectively, the FDA granted avoralstat &#8220;Orphan Drug&#8221; designation and &#8220;Fast Track&#8221; designation for the treatment of HAE. Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development to novel drugs intended for the safe and effective treatment of a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. This designation provides certain incentives, including federal grants, tax credits, waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act (&#8220;PDUFA&#8221;) filing fees, and a seven-year marketing exclusivity period against competition once the product candidate is approved. The Fast Track designation process of the FDA is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review and approval of drugs intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions and that address unmet medical needs. A drug that receives Fast Track designation is usually eligible for more frequent written communication and meetings with the FDA to discuss the drug's development plan and the collection of appropriate data supporting drug approval. In addition, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (&#8220;COMP&#8221;) of the European Medicines Agency (&#8220;EMA&#8221;) issued a positive opinion on the application for orphan drug designation for avoralstat for the treatment of patients with HAE and the European Commission recently affirmed this designation. Orphan drug designation by the EMA provides regulatory and financial incentives for companies to develop and market therapies that treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;).

&#160;

On December 18, 2014, we announced the dosing of the first patient in OPuS-2 ( O ral P rophylaxi S-2 ), a blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of orally-administered avoralstat in patients with HAE. OPuS-2 was a 12-week, three-arm, parallel cohort design trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two doses of avoralstat, 300 mg and 500 mg, administered three-times daily compared with placebo. This trial was conducted in the U.S. and select European countries, and it enrolled approximately 100 HAE patients. The primary goals of the trial were to characterize the efficacy of avoralstat in reducing the frequency of angioedema attacks, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 12 weeks of avoralstat treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was angioedema attack frequency.

&#160;

&#160;

On February 8, 2016, we announced results from OPuS-2. In the OPuS-2 study, HAE patients with a historical attack frequency of greater than 0.45 attacks per week were randomized to treatment with either 500 mg or 300 mg of avoralstat, or placebo, administered three times daily for 12 weeks. Thirty-eight subjects received avoralstat 500 mg, 36 subjects received avoralstat 300 mg, and 36 subjects received placebo. Treatment with 500 mg and 300 mg of avoralstat three times daily failed to demonstrate a statistically significantly lower mean attack rate versus placebo. The mean (standard deviation) attack rates per week were 0.63 (0.57) on avoralstat 500 mg and 0.71 (0.66) on avoralstat 300 mg, compared to 0.61 (0.41) on placebo. Statistically significant improvements in duration of attacks and in the Angioedema Quality of Life total score were observed comparing the 500 mg three times a day avoralstat arm to placebo. Following the analysis of OPuS-2 results, the decision was made to discontinue further development of softgel avoralstat formulation in order to focus development efforts on a novel solid dosage form of avoralstat to achieve meaningfully better drug exposure. We expect additional avoralstat results from a relative bioavailability study testing a novel solid dosage form of avoralstat by mid-year 2016. The primary goals of this study are to achieve meaningfully better drug exposures and twice daily dosing. 

&#160;

On May 27, 2014, we announced positive results from a Phase 2a proof of concept OPuS-1( O ral P rophylaxi S-1 ) clinical trial in patients with HAE. This clinical trial evaluated 400 mg of avoralstat administered three-times daily for 28 days in a randomized, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over design. Twenty-four HAE patients who had a high frequency of attacks (more than one per week) were enrolled. This study was designed to provide proof of concept for oral kallikrein inhibition as a treatment strategy for HAE. The primary goals of the trial were to estimate the degree of efficacy of avoralstat in reducing the frequency of angioedema attacks and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 28 days of avoralstat treatment. The OPuS-1 trial met its primary efficacy endpoint, several secondary endpoints as well as other objectives established for the clinical trial. Each of the twenty-four patients dosed completed the trial. The primary efficacy endpoint for the trial was the mean angioedema attack rate. Treatment with avoralstat demonstrated a statistically significant mean attack rate reduction of 0.45 attacks per week versus placebo, p&#60; 0.001. The mean attack rate per week was 0.82 on avoralstat treatment, compared to 1.27 on placebo. Oral administration of avoralstat was generally safe and well-tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that observed for placebo. Patient dosing compliance in this trial was 98 percent. 

&#160;

2nd generation HAE compounds: The goal of our second generation HAE discovery program is to discover and develop oral molecules for the prevention of HAE attacks which have a superior selectivity and bioavailability profile while maintaining similar potency as compared to avoralstat. In December 2013, we announced the selection of two optimized plasma kallikrein inhibitors to advance into preclinical development as potential once-daily, oral prophylactic treatments for HAE. Based on early preclinical development studies, these structurally different molecules have a similar mechanism of action as avoralstat and have achieved the principal goal of improved bioavailability. Both BCX7353 and the second compound had roughly five times better bioavailability than avoralstat. These compounds demonstrated sub-nanomolar potency on the isolated enzyme and single digit nanomolar potency in suppressing kallikrein activity in an ex-vivo activated normal human plasma kallikrein inhibition (&#8220;aPKI&#8221;) assay. Plasma concentrations of each of the optimized compounds exceeded the aPKI assay EC80 concentration at 24 hours after a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg in rats, indicating potential for once-daily dosing. In January 2015, we selected BCX7353 to advance into Phase 1 development as a once-daily, oral prophylactic HAE treatment. Given the other advanced second generation molecule&#8217;s inferior profile and similar molecular composition to BCX7353, we have chosen only to advance BCX7353. In addition to BCX7353, we continue to work on and advance other second generation compounds that are at an earlier stage. These molecules are in preclinical development and will be assessed for safety and efficacy in prophylactic HAE treatment as well as for other potential indications. We will provide additional information on these molecules as we approach an Investigational New Drug (&#8220;IND&#8221;) filing or we obtain data suggesting efficacy and safety surrounding these molecules in potential HAE and other therapeutic indications.

&#160;

BCX7353 : BCX7353 is structurally different from avoralstat, but has a similar mechanism of action targeting plasma kallikrein. On May 13, 2015, we announced the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of orally-administered BCX7353 in healthy volunteers.

On October 8, 2015, we announced that the randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 1 clinical trial of orally-administered BCX7353 in healthy volunteers successfully met all of its objectives.

In this Phase 1 clinical trial BCX7353 dose levels included single doses of up to 1000mg, once-daily doses of up to 500 mg for seven days, and once-daily doses of 350 mg for 14 days. Plasma levels increased in approximate proportion to dose, and drug exposure was not affected by dosing with food. The half-life of BCX7353 was estimated at 50-60 hours. After daily dosing, blood levels met or exceeded a predicted target therapeutic range throughout the 24 hour dosing interval. Inhibition of the target enzyme, plasma kallikrein, was measured in a sensitive and specific bioassay. Daily dosing with BCX7353 strongly inhibited plasma kallikrein at all four dose levels; the degree of inhibition was dose-related (p &#60; 0.0001) and inhibition was sustained throughout the 24 hour dosing interval. This pharmacodynamic effect correlated strongly to the achieved drug concentration (r = 0.91, p &#60; 0.0001).

Subsequently, cohorts of healthy Japanese volunteers were added to the study to support development of BCX7353 in Japan under the &#8220;Sakigake&#8221; accelerated R&#38;D designation. Following assessment of single oral doses of BCX7353 of 100mg (6 subjects) and 500 mg (6 subjects), 250 mg of BCX7353 was administered orally and daily for seven days to ten subjects. Compared to Western subjects administered the same dose level, plasma drug levels in Japanese subjects were moderately higher. Kallikrein inhibition on day seven of daily dosing with 250 mg in Japanese subjects was similar to that seen at the 350 mg daily and 500 mg daily dose levels in Western subjects.

The combined data from both Western and Japanese healthy volunteers indicates that oral BCX7353 has been generally safe and well tolerated in a total of 96 treated healthy volunteers, 46 with singles doses and 50 with multiple doses. No serious adverse events have been seen and no dose-limiting toxicity has been identified. There have been no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, ECG changes, or vital sign changes observed.

In single dose subjects, 89% (31 of 35) of adverse events (AEs) have been grade 1. The four grade 2 AEs observed were: nausea (1) and vomiting (1) occurring in one subject: hay fever (1) and diarrhea (1 from Japanese cohort).

&#160;

&#160;

In multiple dose subjects, 90% (63 of 70) of adverse events (AEs) have been grade 1. The six grade 2 AEs observed were: upper abdominal pain (1, discontinued from study); syncope (1) headache (1) diarrhea (1) and upper abdominal pain (1) occurring on one subject (discounted from study), and maculopapular rash. One grade 3 AE was observed, a cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. The two rash AE&#8217;s are described in more detail below.

The incidence of drug-related skin rash across all multiple-dose cohorts was 4% (2 of 50 subjects). One Japanese subject dosed at 250 mg daily for seven days developed a grade 2 maculopapular skin rash following cessation of dosing, and one Western subject dosed at 500 mg daily for seven days developed a grade 3 hypersensitivity reaction, described as a maculopapular skin rash, following cessation of dosing. Both AEs were assessed by the investigator as drug-related. The Japanese subject received antihistamines and the Western subject received corticosteroids, and in both cases the rash resolved within a few days.

The safety, tolerability, drug exposure and on-target plasma kallikrein inhibition results strongly support advancing the development program into a Phase 2 study in HAE patients. A Phase 2 trial (&#8220;APeX-1&#8221;) to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of BCX7353 as a preventative treatment to reduce the frequency of attacks in HAE patients is expected to begin in 2016. The design of the trial will be described when the APeX-1 protocol is approved by regulatory authorities and the clinical trial is initiated.

&#160;

On October 27, 2015 The Japanese Ministry of Health Labor &#38; Welfare (&#8220;MHLW&#8221;) announced that BioCryst&#8217;s BCX7353 was one of six products designated under MLHW&#8217;s new Sakigake fast track review system. The Sakigake Designation System promotes R&#38;D in Japan, aiming at early market availability for innovative pharmaceutical products. This designation provides for additional interactions with the regulatory agency in Japan from early development through filing, prioritized development and review, and introduction of the product as soon as possible to address a serious unmet medical need. We expect the results of APeX-1 to help us and the MHLW to determine the regulatory pathway and timeline for BCX7353 in Japan.

&#160;

BCX4430 

&#160;

BCX4430 is a broad-spectrum antiviral (&#8220;BSAV&#8221;) research program and is currently being developed under contracts with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (&#8220;NIAID/HHS&#8221;) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;BARDA/HHS&#8221;). The objective of our BSAV program is to develop BCX4430 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic for viruses that pose a threat to national health and security. The primary focus of the program is treatment of hemorrhagic fever viruses. NIAID/HHS funding has supported BCX4430&#8217;s development as a treatment for Marburg virus and Ebola virus. In March 2014, BCX4430 was featured in an online Nature publication depicting successful efficacy results in animal models of infection with Marburg virus and Ebola virus. BCX4430 completely protected cynomolgus macaques from Marburg virus infection when administered by intramuscular (&#8220;i.m.&#8221;) injection 48 hours post-infection. Post-exposure i.m. administration of BCX4430 also protected rodents against Marburg virus and Ebola virus infections. In addition, BCX4430 was shown to be active in vitro against a broad range of other RNA viruses, including the emerging viral pathogen Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (&#8220;MERS-CoV&#8221;). The publication, which reported the protection of non-human primates from filovirus disease by BCX4430, describes efficacy results generated from an ongoing collaboration between scientists in the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infection Diseases (&#8220;USAMRIID&#8221;) and us. BCX4430 has been shown to be active against more than 20 RNA viruses in nine different families, including filoviruses, togaviruses, bunyaviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses, coronaviruses and flaviviruses. In tests conducted at USAMRIID, BCX4430 protected animals against parenteral exposures to Marburg, Ebola and Rift Valley Fever viruses and from exposures to aerosolized Marburg virus, an experimental condition designed to mimic an exposure scenario that could result during a bioterrorist attack.

&#160;

On December 23, 2014, we announced results from a successful proof-of-concept study of BCX4430 for the treatment of experimental Ebola virus infection in Rhesus macaques, conducted at USAMRIID. The primary goal of the study was to assess the effect of BCX4430 treatment on survival through Day 41 in animals infected with Ebola virus. Dosing of placebo or BCX4430 by i.m. injection was initiated 30-120 minutes after virus challenge and continued twice a day (&#8220;BID&#8221;) for 14 days. Animals were dosed with either placebo, 16 mg/kg of BCX4430 BID or 25 mg/kg of BCX4430 BID. Survival at day 41 in the 16 mg/kg BID group of BCX4430 treated animals was 4 of 6 (66.7%, p &#60; 0.001 compared to 0% survival in controls) and 6 of 6 in the 25 mg/kg BID group (100%, p &#60; 0.001 compared to controls). The overall survival rate for BCX4430 treated animals at day 41 was 10 of 12 (83%, p &#60; 0.001 compared to controls). Preliminary evaluation of the quantity of virus in the blood showed an approximate 3-log reduction in Ebola virus RNA copies/mL of plasma, compared with control animals. This Rhesus macaque study was conducted following the completion, in November 2014, of a dose-ranging study of BCX4430 for the experimental treatment of cynomolgus macaques infected with Ebola virus. The cynomolgus macaque study was designed to evaluate whether BCX4430 showed a meaningful benefit for survival in Ebola virus non-human primate (&#8220;NHP&#8221;) disease models and explore a dose range. In this study BCX4430 demonstrated a statistically significant prolongation of survival for the animals at the highest dose regimen tested, but no animals survived beyond 21 days.

&#160;

On December 15, 2014, we announced the dosing of the first subject in a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate i.m. administration of BCX4430 in healthy volunteers. The main goals of this first-in-human study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of BCX4430 administered via i.m. injection in healthy subjects. In part one of the study, subjects will receive a single dose of BCX4430; and then subjects will receive BCX4430 for seven days in the second part of the study. Up to six single-dose cohorts and four multiple-dose cohorts will be evaluated, with a total of up to 88 volunteers participating. This Phase 1 study is expected to continue in 2016. 

&#160;

Forodesine 

Forodesine is a Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (&#8220;PNP&#8221;) inhibitor in development by Mundipharma as a treatment for cancer under a world-wide license agreement. PNP is a purine salvage pathway enzyme. High doses of PNP inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of hematological malignancies. Mundipharma has received orphan drug status for forodesine, and following successful completion of a Phase 2 pivotal study in recurrent/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma patients in Japan, is preparing to file for regulatory approval.

On November 11, 2011, we entered into an Amended and Restated License and Development Agreement (the &#8220;Amended and Restated Agreement&#8221;) with Mundipharma, amending and restating the February 1, 2006 exclusive, royalty-bearing Development and License Agreement for the development and commercialization of forodesine for use in the field of oncology. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Agreement, Mundipharma obtained worldwide rights to forodesine, so Mundipharma controls the worldwide development and commercialization of forodesine and assumes all future development and commercialization costs. The Amended and Restated Agreement is a multiple element arrangement for accounting purposes in which we were required to deliver to Mundipharma both the worldwide rights to forodesine and the transfer of product data and know-how to permit Mundipharma to develop and commercialize forodesine (the &#8220;Knowledge Transfer&#8221;). The world-wide license rights were granted to Mundipharma upon execution of Amended and Restated Agreement and the Knowledge Transfer was completed in the first quarter of 2012.

&#160;

We have licensed the PNP technology from Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University (&#8220;AECOM&#8221;) and Industrial Research, Ltd. (&#8220;IRL&#8221;) and will owe sublicense payments to AECOM/IRL based on the future milestone payments and royalties received by us from Mundipharma and any other partners for which we out-license our PNP inhibitors. On November 17, 2011, we amended our agreement with AECOM/IRL whereby AECOM/IRL agreed to accept a reduction of one-half of the percentage of Net Proceeds (as defined in the license agreement) received by us under our Amended and Restated Agreement with Mundipharma. This reduction does not apply to royalty payments made as a result of sales of licensed products by our sub licensees.

&#160;

Collaborations and In-License Relationships 

&#160;

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;BARDA/HHS&#8221;) . In January 2007, BARDA/HHS awarded us a $102.6 million, four-year contract for the advanced development of peramivir for the treatment of influenza. During 2009, peramivir clinical development shifted to focus on intravenous delivery and the treatment of hospitalized patients. To support this focus, a September 2009 contract modification was awarded to extend the i.v. peramivir program and to increase funding by $77.2 million. On February 24, 2011, we announced that BARDA/HHS had awarded us a $55.0 million contract modification, intended to fund completion of the Phase 3 development of i.v. peramivir for the treatment of patients hospitalized with influenza. That contract modification brought the total contract award from BARDA/HHS to $234.8 million and provided funding to support the filing of an NDA to seek regulatory approval for i.v. peramivir in the U.S. In December 2013, we submitted an NDA filing for i.v. peramivir to the FDA and the NDA was approved in December 2014. The BARDA/HHS contract expired on June 30, 2014 according to its terms.

&#160;

On March 31, 2015, we announced that BARDA/HHS awarded us a contract for the continued development of BCX4430 as a potential treatment for diseases caused by RNA pathogens, including filoviruses. This BARDA/HHS contract includes a base contract of $13.3 million to support BCX4430 drug manufacturing, as well as $22.9 million in additional development options that can be exercised by the government, bringing the potential value of the contract to $36.2 million. As of December 31, 2015, a total of $16.3 million has been awarded under exercised options within this contract.

&#160;

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (&#8220;NIAID/HHS&#8221;) . In September 2013, NIAID/HHS contracted with us for the development of BCX4430 as a treatment for Marburg, and subsequently, Ebola virus disease. NIAID/HHS, part of the National Institutes of Health, made an initial award of $5.0 million to us. A total of $29.9 million of initial and option funding has been awarded under the NIAID/HHS contract to date and total funding under the contract could be up to $34.0 million, if all contract options are exercised. The goals of this contract, including amendments, are to file IND applications for i.v. and i.m. BCX4430 for the treatment of Marburg virus disease, to conduct an initial Phase 1 human clinical trial, as well as to study BCX4430 as a treatment for Ebola virus disease.

&#160;

The contracts with BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS are cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. That is, we are entitled to receive reimbursement for all costs incurred in accordance with the contracts provisions that are related to the development of peramivir and BCX4430 plus a fixed fee, or profit. BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS will make periodic assessments of progress and the continuation of the contract is based on our performance, the timeliness and quality of deliverables, and other factors. The government has rights under certain contract clauses to terminate these contracts. These contracts are terminable by the government at any time for breach or without cause.

&#160;

&#160;

Seqirus UK Limited . On June 16, 2015, we and SUL, a limited company organized under the laws of the United Kingdom and a subsidiary of CSL Limited, a company organized under the laws of Australia, entered into a License Agreement (the "SUL Agreement") granting SUL and its affiliates worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) for the treatment of influenza except for the rights to conduct such activities in Israel, Japan, Korea and Taiwan (the permitted geographies together constituting the "Territory"). RAPIVAB is an intravenous treatment for acute uncomplicated influenza and is currently licensed for use in the United States, Japan and Korea. RAPIVAB is the first and only intravenous influenza treatment in the world and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2014 for the treatment of acute uncomplicated influenza in patients 18 years and older who have been symptomatic for no more than two days. We retain all rights and associated economics to procure pandemic stockpiling orders for RAPIVAB from the U.S. Government, while SUL has the right to pursue government stockpiling outside the U.S. 

&#160;

Pursuant to the SUL Agreement, RAPIVAB will be commercialized by CSL's subsidiary, SUL, which specializes in influenza prevention through the supply of seasonal and pandemic vaccine to global markets. SUL will manufacture, commercialize and exercise decision-making authority with respect to the development and commercialization of RAPIVAB within the Territory and be responsible for all related costs, including sales and promotion. We will exercise sole decision-making authority with regard to the development and commercialization of RAPIVAB outside of the Territory and are responsible for all associated costs.

&#160;

In December 2013, we submitted a NDA for RAPIVAB to the FDA. Under the terms of the SUL Agreement, we are responsible for fulfilling all post-marketing approval commitments in connection with the FDA's approval of the NDA, and upon fulfillment will transfer ownership of and financial responsibility for the NDA to SUL. Pursuant to potential rights to sell RAPIVAB in Canada and the EU, we are also responsible for regulatory filings and interactions with the Health Canada and the European Medicines Agency until marketing approval for RAPIVAB is obtained and assigned to SUL. In accordance with the SUL Agreement, we and SUL formed a joint steering committee, composed of an equal number of representatives from each party, to oversee, review and coordinate the conduct and progress of the commercialization of RAPIVAB in the Territory and any additional development. 

&#160;

Under the terms of the SUL Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $33.7 million, and may receive up to $12.0 million in additional milestone payments related to the successful achievement of regulatory milestones, including marketing approval (i) by the FDA for a pediatric indication, (ii) by the EMA for an adult indication in the EU and (iii) by Health Canada for an adult indication in Canada. We are also entitled under the SUL Agreement to receive tiered royalties at a percentage rate beginning in the mid-teens contingent upon meeting minimum thresholds of net sales, as well as a low-thirties percentage of the gross profit from government stockpiling purchases made outside the U.S. Specifically, we receive tiered royalties at a percentage rate in the mid-teens to low-forties on net sales in the U.S. during a Contract Year (defined as July 1 - June 30) and tiered royalties at a percentage rate in the mid-teens to mid-twenties on net sales in the Territory, other than in the U.S., during a Calendar Year, each subject to certain downward adjustments for circumstance or events impacting the overall market opportunity. SUL's royalty payment obligations commence on the date of the SUL Agreement and expire, on a country-by-country basis, upon the later of (i) the expiration of legal exclusivity in such country and (ii) ten years from the date of the SUL Agreement (the "Royalty Term"). We developed RAPIVAB under a license from UAB and will owe sublicense payments to them on any future milestone payments and/or royalties received by us from SUL.

&#160;

The term of the SUL Agreement shall continue on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire Royalty Term in any such country in the Territory. Either party may terminate the SUL Agreement in its entirety if the other party breaches a payment obligation, otherwise materially breaches the SUL Agreement, subject to applicable cure periods, or if the other party suffers an insolvency event. We may also terminate the SUL Agreement if SUL or any of its affiliates seek to challenge the validity of our patents. Termination does not affect a party's rights which have accrued prior thereto, but there are no stated payments in connection with termination other than payments of obligations previously accrued. For all terminations exercised by us, the SUL Agreement provides for the termination of any sublicenses granted by SUL to third parties, and in the case of termination by us for cause, the ceasing of SUL's activities with respect to RAPIVAB, the discontinued use of all of our intellectual property and the termination of licenses and rights previously granted to SUL. If requested by us, SUL shall also promptly sell to us all licensed product it then holds in stock, otherwise, SUL may continue to sell such licensed product for designated periods.

&#160;

Shionogi &#38; Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Shionogi&#8221;) . On February 28, 2007, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the &#8220;Shionogi Agreement&#8221;), an exclusive license agreement with Shionogi to develop and commercialize peramivir in Japan for the treatment of seasonal and potentially life-threatening human influenza. In October 2008, we and Shionogi amended the Shionogi Agreement to expand the territory covered by the agreement to include Taiwan. Under the terms of the Shionogi Agreement, Shionogi obtained rights to injectable formulations of peramivir in Japan in exchange for a $14.0 million upfront payment. The license provided for development milestone payments (up to $21.0 million), which have all been paid, and for commercial milestone payments (up to $95.0 million) in addition to double-digit (between 10% and 20%) royalty payments on product sales of peramivir.

&#160;

&#160;

Generally, all payments under the Shionogi Agreement are non-refundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. Shionogi is responsible for all development, regulatory, and marketing costs in Japan. The term of the Shionogi Agreement is from February 28, 2007 until terminated. Either party may terminate in the event of an uncured breach. Shionogi has the right of termination without cause. In the event of termination, all license and rights granted to Shionogi shall terminate and shall revert back to us. We developed peramivir under a license from the University of Alabama Birmingham (&#8220;UAB&#8221;) and have paid sublicense payments to UAB on the upfront payments and will owe sublicense payments on any future event payments and/or royalties received by us from Shionogi.

&#160;

Shionogi Royalty Monetization and Non-Recourse Notes Payable . On March 9, 2011, we completed a $30.0 million financing transaction to monetize certain future royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement, pursuant to which JPR Royalty Sub LLC (&#8220;Royalty Sub&#8221;) a wholly-owned subsidiary of BioCryst, issued the PhaRMA Notes discussed below. We received net proceeds of $22.7 million from this transaction.

&#160;

As part of the transaction, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement dated as of March 9, 2011 with Royalty Sub, whereby we transferred to Royalty Sub, among other things, (i) its rights to receive certain royalty and milestone payments from Shionogi arising under the Shionogi Agreement, and (ii) the right to receive payments under a Japanese yen/US dollar foreign currency hedge arrangement (as further described below, the &#8220;Currency Hedge Agreement&#8221;) put into place by us in connection with the transaction. Royalty payments will be paid by Shionogi in Japanese yen and milestone payments will be paid in U.S. dollars. Our collaboration with Shionogi was not impacted by this transaction.

&#160;

On March 9, 2011, Royalty Sub completed a private placement to institutional investors of $30.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its PhaRMA Senior Secured 14.0% Notes due 2020 (the &#8220;PhaRMA Notes&#8221;). The PhaRMA Notes were issued by Royalty Sub under an Indenture, dated as of March 9, 2011 (the &#8220;Indenture&#8221;), by and between Royalty Sub and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. Principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes issued are payable from, and are secured by, the rights to royalty and milestone payments under the Shionogi Agreement transferred by us to Royalty Sub and payments, if any, made to Royalty Sub under the Currency Hedge Agreement. The PhaRMA Notes bear interest at 14% per annum, payable annually in arrears on September 1st of each year (the &#8220;Payment Date&#8221;). We remain entitled to receive any royalties and milestone payments related to sales of peramivir by Shionogi following repayment by Royalty Sub of the PhaRMA Notes.

&#160;

Royalty Sub&#8217;s obligations to pay principal and interest on the PhaRMA Notes are obligations solely of Royalty Sub and are without recourse to any other person, including the Company, except to the extent of our pledge of its equity interests in Royalty Sub in support of the PhaRMA Notes. We may, but are not obligated to, make capital contributions to a capital account that may be used to redeem, or on up to one occasion pay any interest shortfall on, the PhaRMA Notes.

&#160;

In September 2013, Royalty Sub paid $1.8 million of interest on the PhaRMA Notes from royalty payments received from RAPIACTA sales from the preceding four calendar quarters. This payment resulted in an obligation shortfall of approximately $2.4 million associated with accrued interest due September 3, 2013. As stipulated under the PhaRMA Notes Indenture, if the amount available for payment on any Payment Date is insufficient to pay all of the interest due on a Payment Date, the shortfall in interest will accrue interest at the interest rate applicable to the PhaRMA Notes compounded annually. Accordingly, commencing in September 2013, interest began to accrue at 14% per annum on the interest shortfall of $2.4 million. In March, June and August of 2014, Royalty Sub paid additional interest of $446,000, $1.9 million and $70,000, respectively, bringing the shortfall down to $222,000 as of September 30, 2014. Under the terms of the Indenture, Royalty Sub&#8217;s inability to pay the full amount of interest payable in September 2013 by the next succeeding Payment Date for the PhaRMA Notes, which was September 1, 2014, constituted an event of default. Accordingly, we have classified the PhaRMA Notes and related accrued interest as current liabilities on our balance sheet. As a result of the event of default under the PhaRMA Notes, the holders of the PhaRMA Notes may pursue acceleration of the PhaRMA Notes, may foreclose on the collateral securing the PhaRMA Notes and the equity interest in Royalty Sub and exercise other remedies available to them under the Indenture in respect of the PhaRMA Notes. In such event, we may not realize the benefit of future royalty payments that might otherwise accrue to us following repayment of the PhaRMA Notes and we might otherwise be adversely affected. Due to the non-recourse nature of the PhaRMA Notes, in the event of any potential acceleration or foreclosure, we believe the primary impact to us would be the loss of future royalty payments from Shionogi and legal costs associated with retiring the PhaRMA Notes. In addition, we may incur costs associated with liquidating the related Currency Hedge Agreement, which would no longer be required in the event of foreclosure or if the PhaRMA Notes cease to be outstanding. As the PhaRMA Notes are the obligation of Royalty Sub, we do not currently expect the event of default on the PhaRMA Notes to have a significant impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. As of December 31, 2015, the PhaRMA Notes remain in default.

&#160;

The Indenture does not contain any financial covenants. The Indenture includes customary representations and warranties of Royalty Sub, affirmative and negative covenants of Royalty Sub, Events of Default and related remedies, and provisions regarding the duties of the Trustee, indemnification of the Trustee, and other matters typical for indentures used in structured financings of this type. The PhaRMA Notes are redeemable at the option of Royalty Sub at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal balance of the PhaRMA Notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest through the redemption date on the PhaRMA Notes being redeemed.

&#160;

&#160;

Foreign Currency Hedge . In connection with the issuance by Royalty Sub of the PhaRMA Notes, we entered into a Currency Hedge Agreement to hedge certain risks associated with changes in the value of the Japanese yen relative to the U.S. dollar. Under the Currency Hedge Agreement, we have the right to purchase dollars and sell yen at a rate of 100 yen per dollar for which we may be required to pay a premium in each year from 2016 through 2020. A payment of $2.0 million will be required if, on May 18 of the relevant year, the U.S. dollar is worth 100 yen or less, as determined in accordance with the Currency Hedge Agreement.

&#160;

The Currency Hedge Agreement does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment; therefore, mark-to-market adjustments are recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Loss. Cumulative mark-to-market adjustments resulted in a loss of $0.6 million and gains of $5.5 million and $5.3 million for the twelve months ended December 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, a realized currency exchange gain of $1.6 million was recognized in 2015 related to the exercise of a U.S. dollar/Japanese yen currency option under our foreign currency hedge. Thus, a resulting $1.1 million net gain is recognized on our foreign currency derivative for 2015.We are also required to post collateral in connection with the mark-to-market adjustments based on defined thresholds. As of December 31, 2015, no collateral was posted under the Currency Hedge Agreement. We will not be required at any time to post collateral exceeding the maximum premium payments remaining payable under the Currency Hedge Agreement. The maximum amount of hedge collateral we would be required to post is $9.8 million. We are required to maintain a foreign currency hedge at 100 yen per dollar under the agreements governing the PhaRMA Notes.

&#160;

Green Cross . In June 2006, we entered into an agreement with Green Cross to develop and commercialize peramivir in Korea. Under the terms of the agreement, Green Cross is responsible for all development, regulatory, and commercialization costs in Korea. We received a one-time license fee of $250,000. The license provides that we will share in profits resulting from the sale of peramivir in Korea, including the sale of peramivir to the Korean government for stockpiling purposes. Furthermore, Green Cross will pay us a premium over its cost to supply peramivir for development and any future marketing of peramivir products in Korea. Both parties have the right to terminate in the event of an uncured material breach. In the event of termination, all rights, data, materials, products and other information would be transferred to us.

&#160;

In August 2010, we announced that Green Cross had received marketing and manufacturing approval from the Korean Food &#38; Drug Administration for i.v. peramivir, under the commercial name PERAMIFLU &#174; . PERAMIFLU is intended to treat patients with influenza A &#38; B viruses, including pandemic H1N1 and avian influenza. Green Cross received the indication of single dose administration of 300 mg i.v. peramivir. Since PERAMIFLU&#8217;s approval, Green Cross has been in pricing discussions with the Korean National Health Insurance Corporation and has yet to agree to a formulary price. PERAMIFLU&#8217;s distribution to date has been limited to a case-by-case basis and significant sales have not occurred.

&#160;

Other Peramivir Collaborations . In addition to our collaborations with Shionogi and Green Cross, in March 2011 we entered into an arrangement with Neopharm Scientific Limited, granting certain commercial and distribution rights for peramivir in Israel.

&#160;

Mundipharma . In February 2006, we entered into an exclusive, royalty bearing right and license agreement with Mundipharma for the development and commercialization of forodesine, a PNP inhibitor, for use in oncology (the &#8220;Original Agreement&#8221;). Under the terms of the Original Agreement, Mundipharma obtained rights to forodesine in markets across Europe, Asia, and Australasia in exchange for a $10.0 million up-front payment. In addition, Mundipharma contributed $10.0 million of the documented out-of-pocket development costs incurred by us in respect of the current and planned trials as of the effective date of the agreement, and Mundipharma would conduct additional clinical trials at their own cost up to a maximum of $15.0 million. The Original Agreement provided for the possibility of future event payments totaling $155.0 million for achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial events (including certain sales level amounts following a product&#8217;s launch) for certain indications. In addition, the Original Agreement provided that we would receive royalties (ranging from single digits to mid teens) based on a percentage of net product sales, which varies depending upon when certain indications receive NDA approval in a major market country and can vary by country depending on the patent coverage or sales of generic compounds in a particular country. Generally, all payments under the Original Agreement were nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit. We licensed forodesine and other PNP inhibitors from AECOM/IRL and will owe sublicense payments to AECOM/IRL on all milestone payments and royalties received by us from Mundipharma.

&#160;

On November 11, 2011, we entered into the Amended and Restated Agreement with Mundipharma. Under the terms of this Amended and Restated Agreement, Mundipharma obtained worldwide rights to forodesine in the field of oncology. Mundipharma will control the development and commercialization of forodesine and assume all future development and commercialization costs. The Amended and Restated Agreement provides for the possibility of future event payments totaling $15.0 million for achieving specified regulatory events for certain indications. In addition, the Amended and Restated Agreement provides that we will receive tiered royalties ranging from mid- to high-single digit percentages of net product sales in each country where forodesine is sold by Mundipharma. These royalties are subject to downward adjustments based on the then-existing patent coverage and/or the availability of generic compounds in each country. Generally, all payments under the Amended and Restated Agreement are nonrefundable and non-creditable, but they are subject to audit.

&#160;

&#160;

Mundipharma will also have a right of exclusive negotiations with us for a limited period of time if they initiate negotiations for a specified backup PNP inhibitor. Otherwise, they will be able to participate in the same negotiations process we enter into with another company for the backup PNP inhibitor. The Amended and Restated Agreement will continue for the commercial life of the licensed products, but may be terminated by either party following an uncured material breach by the other party or in the event the pre-existing third party license with AECOM/IRL expires. It may be terminated by Mundipharma upon 60 days written notice without cause or under certain other conditions as specified in the Amended and Restated Agreement. If Mundipharma terminates the Amended and Restated Agreement, Mundipharma would no longer have any rights in forodesine and the rights would revert back to us; provided, however, that in the event the we determine to subsequently use the data developed under the Amended and Restated Agreement for development and commercialization of forodesine in the field of oncology, then we would have to pay Mundipharma 150% of the cost of such data for such use.

&#160;

Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University and Industrial Research, Ltd. (&#8220;AECOM&#8221; and &#8220;IRL&#8221; respectively) . In June 2000, we licensed a series of potent inhibitors of PNP from AECOM and IRL, (collectively, the &#8220;Licensors&#8221;). The lead product candidate from this collaboration is forodesine. We have obtained worldwide exclusive rights to develop and ultimately distribute it, or any other, product candidates that might arise from research on these inhibitors. We have the option to expand our license agreement with the Licensors to include other inventions in the field made by the investigators or employees of the Licensors. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop these drugs. In addition, we have agreed to pay certain milestone payments for each licensed product (which range in the aggregate from $1.4 million to almost $4.0 million per indication) for future development of these inhibitors, single digit royalties on net sales of any resulting product made by us, and to share approximately one quarter of future payments received from other third-party partners, if any. In addition, we have agreed to pay annual license fees, which can range from $150,000 to $500,000, that are creditable against actual royalties and other payments due to the Licensors. This agreement may be terminated by us at any time by giving 60 days advance notice or in the event of material uncured breach by the Licensors.

&#160;

In May 2010, we amended the license agreement through which we obtained worldwide exclusive rights to develop and ultimately distribute any product candidates that might arise from research on a series of PNP inhibitors, including forodesine. Under the terms of the amendment, the Licensors agreed to accept a reduction of one-half in the percentage of future payments received from third-party sub licensees of the licensed PNP inhibitors that must be paid to the Licensors. This reduction does not apply to (i) any milestone payments we may receive in the future under our license agreement with Mundipharma and (ii) royalties received from its sub licensees in connection with the sale of licensed products, for which the original payment rate will remain in effect. The rate of royalty payments to the Licensors based on net sales of any resulting product made by us remains unchanged. At our sole option and subject to certain agreed upon conditions, any future non-royalty payments due to be paid by us to the Licensors under the license agreement may be made either in cash, in shares of our common stock, or in a combination of cash and shares. 

&#160;

On November 17, 2011, we further amended our agreements with the Licensors whereby the Licensors agreed to accept a reduction of one-half in the percentage of Net Proceeds (as defined in the license agreement) received by us under our Amended and Restated Agreement with Mundipharma that will be paid to AECOM/IRL. 

&#160;

On June 19, 2012, we further amended our agreements with the Licensors whereby the parties clarified the definition of the field with respect to PNP inhibition and the Licensors agreed to grant an exclusive worldwide license of BCX4430 to us for any antiviral use. 

&#160;

The University of Alabama at Birmingham (&#8220;UAB&#8221;) . We currently have agreements with UAB for influenza neuraminidase and complement inhibitors. Under the terms of these agreements, UAB performed specific research for us in return for research payments and license fees. UAB has granted us certain rights to any discoveries in these areas resulting from research developed by UAB or jointly developed with us. We have agreed to pay single digit royalties on sales of any resulting product and to share in future payments received from other third-party partners. We have completed the research under the UAB agreements. These two agreements have initial 25-year terms, are automatically renewable for five-year terms throughout the life of the last patent and are terminable by us upon three months&#8217; notice and by UAB under certain circumstances. Upon termination both parties shall cease using the other parties&#8217; proprietary and confidential information and materials, the parties shall jointly own joint inventions and UAB shall resume full ownership of all UAB licensed products. There is currently no activity between us and UAB on these agreements, but when we license this technology, such as in the case of the Shionogi and Green Cross agreements, or commercialize products related to these programs, we will owe sublicense fees or royalties on amounts it receives.

&#160;

&#160;

Government Contracts 

&#160;

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (&#8220;BARDA/HHS&#8221;) . In January 2007, BARDA/HHS awarded us a $102.6 million four-year contract for the advanced development of peramivir for the treatment of influenza. During 2009, peramivir clinical development shifted to focus on intravenous delivery and the treatment of hospitalized patients. To support this focus, a September 2009 contract modification was awarded to extend the i.v. peramivir program and to increase funding by $77.2 million. On February 24, 2011, we announced that BARDA/HHS had awarded us a $55.0 million contract modification, intended to fund completion of the Phase 3 development of i.v. peramivir for the treatment of patients hospitalized with influenza. That contract modification brought the total contract award from BARDA/HHS to $234.8 million and provided funding to support the filing of an NDA to seek regulatory approval for i.v. peramivir in the U.S. In December 2013, we submitted an NDA filing for i.v. peramivir to the FDA and the NDA was approved in December 2014. The BARDA/HHS contract expired on June 30, 2014 according to its terms.

&#160;

Under the defined scope of work in the contract with BARDA/HHS for the development of peramivir, a process was undertaken to validate a U.S.-based manufacturer and the related method for producing commercial batches of peramivir active pharmaceutical ingredient (&#8220;API&#8221;). As a required outcome of this validation process, large quantities of peramivir API were produced. In accordance with our accounting practices, we recorded all costs associated with this validation process as research and development expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Simultaneously, revenue from the BARDA/HHS contract was also recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss in 2009. BARDA/HHS subsequently reimbursed us for these costs and upon reimbursement from BARDA/HHS, the associated peramivir API became property of the U.S. Government.

&#160;

Under the terms of the contract, if we determine the amount of peramivir API produced under the contract is in excess of what is necessary to complete the contract, we can acquire any excess peramivir API at cost to use for our own purposes. We believe that as a result of the manufacturing campaign described above, more peramivir API has been produced than what was required to support U.S. regulatory approval. If we use any excess API for our other contracts or activities, we will need to reconcile through an appropriate acquisition process with BARDA/HHS and to determine the appropriate acquisition process remuneration for this API.

&#160;

On March 31, 2015, we announced that BARDA/HHS awarded us a contract for the continued development of BCX4430 as a potential treatment for diseases caused by RNA pathogens, including filoviruses. This BARDA/HHS contract includes a base contract of $13.3 million to support BCX4430 drug manufacturing, as well as $22.9 million in additional development options that can be exercised by the government, bringing the potential value of the contract to $36.2 million. As of December 31, 2015, a total of $16.3 million has been awarded under exercised options within this contract.

&#160;

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (&#8220;NIAID/HHS&#8221;) . In September 2013, NIAID/HHS contracted with us for the development of BCX4430 as a treatment for Marburg virus disease. NIAID/HHS, part of the National Institutes of Health, made an initial award of $5.0 million to the Company. The total funding under this contract as of December 31, 2015 could be up to $34.0 million, if all contract options are exercised by NIAID/HHS, over a five year period. The goals of this contract, including amendments, are to file IND applications for i.v. and i.m. BCX4430 for the treatment of Marburg virus disease, to study BCX4430 as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and to conduct an initial Phase 1 human clinical trial. As of December 31, 2015, a total of $29.9 million has been awarded under exercised options within this contract. BCX4430 is the lead compound in our BSAV research program.

&#160;

The contracts with BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS are cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts. That is, we are entitled to receive reimbursement for all costs incurred in accordance with the contracts provisions that are related to the development of BCX4430 plus a fixed fee, or profit. BARDA/HHS and NIAID/HHS will make periodic assessments of progress and the continuation of the contract is based on our performance, the timeliness and quality of deliverables, and other factors. The government has rights under certain contract clauses to terminate these contracts. These contracts are terminable by the government at any time for breach or without cause.

&#160;

Patents and Proprietary Information 

&#160;

Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products, methods, processes and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. We own or have rights to certain proprietary information, proprietary technology, issued and allowed patents and patent applications which relate to compounds we are developing. We actively seek, when appropriate, protection for our products, proprietary technology and proprietary information by means of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and contractual arrangements. In addition, we rely upon trade secrets and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information, proprietary technology and products.

&#160;

&#160;

The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated, rendered unenforceable or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar compounds or technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates or those developed by our partners can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.

&#160;

As of December 31, 2015, we have been issued approximately 13 U.S. patents that expire between 2017 and 2030 and that relate to our HAE program compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds and PNP compounds. We have licensed a number of compounds protected by certain composition of matter patents from AECOM and IRL, plus additional manufacturing patents, totaling 14 additional U.S. patents that expire between 2017 and 2029. Additionally, we have approximately 12 Patent Cooperation Treaty or U.S. patent applications pending related to HAE program compounds, neuraminidase inhibitor compounds, BSAV and PNP compounds. Our pending applications may not result in issued patents, our patents may not cover the products of interest or may not be enforceable in all, or any jurisdictions and our patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially viable. After expiration of composition of matter patents for our products and product candidates, we may rely on data exclusivity, or in some cases, method of use patents. The enforceability of these patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may not be allowed or enforceable in some territories where we may seek approval. We may not have the funds to continue patent prosecution or to defend all of our existing patents in our current patent estate and may selectively abandon patents or patent families worldwide or in certain territories.

&#160;

Our success is also dependent upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, none of which is patentable. To help protect our rights, we require all employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of BioCryst and, where possible, require disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions. These agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information. &#160; 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive. Many companies, including biotechnology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies, are actively engaged in activities similar to ours, including research and development of drugs for the treatment of rare medical conditions. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial and other resources, larger research and development staffs, and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations than we do. In addition, some of them have considerable experience in preclinical testing, clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures. In addition, there are also academic institutions, governmental agencies and other research organizations that are conducting research in areas in which we are working. We expect to encounter significant competition for any of the pharmaceutical products we plan to develop. Companies that successfully complete clinical trials, obtain required regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their products may achieve a significant competitive advantage. 

&#160;

Antivirals : The pharmaceutical market for products that prevent or treat influenza is very competitive. Key competitive factors for RAPIVAB (peramivir injection) include, among others, efficacy, ease of use, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, storage and handling requirements and reimbursement. A number of neuraminidase inhibitors are currently available in the U.S. and/or other counties, including Japan, for the prevention or treatment of influenza, including seasonal flu vaccines and F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.&#8217;s (&#8220;Roche&#8221;) TAMIFLU &#174; , GlaxoSmithKline plc&#8217;s (&#8220;GSK&#8221;) RELENZA &#174; and Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd.&#8217;s INAVIR &#174; . In addition, FUJIFILM Corporation&#8217;s favipiravir, a polymerase inhibitor, is approved in Japan. Roche&#8217;s neuraminidase inhibitor is also approved for prophylaxis of influenza, and both Roche and GSK have i.v. formulations in clinical trial development.

&#160;

In January 2011, GSK announced initiation of a multi-country Phase 3 study of i.v. zanamivir (the same active ingredient as in RELENZA) in hospitalized patients with influenza. The GSK study was completed during the 2014-2015 flu season. In addition to these companies with neuraminidase inhibitors, there are other companies working to develop additional antiviral drugs to be used against various strains of influenza. Currently, there are a number of other companies developing potential new influenza therapies. Various government entities throughout the world are offering incentives, grants and contracts to encourage additional investment into preventative and therapeutic agents against influenza, which may have the effect of further increasing the number of our competitors and/or providing advantages to certain competitors.

&#160;

BCX4430 is a product candidate in our BSAV research program and is currently being developed under a contract with NIAID/HHS. The objective of our BSAV program is to develop BCX4430 as a broad-spectrum therapeutic for viruses that pose a threat to national health and security. The U.S. Government is investing in a number of programs intended to address gaps in its medical countermeasure plan. Due to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014, investment in medical countermeasures has increased worldwide. Therapeutic products with potentially promising data to treat Ebola include FUJIFILM Corporation&#8217;s favipiravir (polymerase inhibitor), Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation&#8217;s TKM-Ebola (RNAi interference based) and Mapp Biopharmaceutical, Inc.&#8217;s ZMapp (antibody-based). Both TKM-Ebola and ZMapp have been used in Ebola patients. Gilead Sciences, Inc announced in October 2015 that it had provided the investigational compound, GS-5734, to two patients with Ebola for compassionate use.

&#160;

&#160;

HAE : HAE is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by painful, unpredictable, recurrent attacks of inflammation affecting the hands, feet, face, abdomen, urogenital tract, and the larynx. The inflammation can be disfiguring, debilitating, or in the case of laryngeal attacks, life-threatening. Prevalence for HAE is uncertain but is estimated to be approximately 1 case per 50,000 persons without known differences among ethnic groups and is caused by deficient (Type I) or dysfunctional (Type II) levels of C1-Inhibitor (&#8220;C1-INH&#8221;), a naturally occurring molecule that is known to inhibit kallikrein, bradykinin, and other serine proteases in the blood. If left untreated, HAE can result in a mortality rate as high as 40% primarily due to upper airway obstruction. There are a number of licensed and developmental therapies for HAE, including the following:

&#160;

&#160; &#183; C1-INH therapy is available as an acute therapy (Berinert &#174; ) and as a prophylactic therapy (Cinryze &#174; ). These therapies are available intravenously and work by replacing the missing or malfunctioning C1-INH protein in patients. &#160; &#183; Kallikrein Inhibition - Kalbitor &#174; (ecallantide) is a specific recombinant plasma kallikrein inhibitor that halts the production of bradykinin and can be dosed subcutaneously in an inpatient setting.

&#160; &#183; Bradykinin receptor antagonist - Firazyr &#174; (icatibant) is a competitive antagonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor. Firazyr is approved for the treatment of acute attacks and is administered by subcutaneous administration. &#160; &#183; Other medications - Prophylactic administration of synthetic attenuated androgens (generically available as danazol or stanozolol) has been utilized to reduce the frequency or severity of attacks. However, long-term use of danazol or stanozolol may result in virilization and arterial hypertension. Six-month liver function tests, annual lipid profiles, and biennial hepatic ultrasound are recommended because these medications increase production of C1-INH in the liver. &#160;

In addition to avoralstat, BCX7353 and our other second generation compounds, there are a number of other HAE therapies in development. These include a prophylactic plasma derived C1-INH delivered by subcutaneous injection in Phase 3 (CSL Behring); DX-2930/SHP643, a monoclonal antibody administered by subcutaneous injection for prophylactic treatment of HAE in Phase 3 (Shire PLC); ISIS-PKK, a RNA-targeted antisense drug to inhibit prekallikrein for prophylactic treatment of HAE in Phase 1 (ISIS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.); and two potential oral kallikrein inhibitors being developed by KalVista and Global Blood Therapeutics, respectively.

&#160;

In order to compete successfully in these and other therapeutic areas, we must develop proprietary positions in patented drugs for therapeutic markets that have not been satisfactorily addressed by conventional research strategies and, in the process, expand our expertise in structure-based drug design. Our product candidates, even if successfully tested and developed, may not be adopted by physicians over other products and may not offer economically feasible alternatives to other therapies.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160;

We initiated our research and development activities in 1986. We have assembled a scientific research staff with expertise in a broad base of advanced research technologies including protein biochemistry, X-ray crystallography, chemistry and pharmacology. Our research facilities, located in Birmingham, Alabama, include protein biochemistry and organic synthesis laboratories, testing facilities, X-ray crystallography, computer and graphics equipment and facilities to make product candidates on a small scale for early stage clinical trials. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, our research and development expenses were $72.8 million, $51.8 million and $41.9 million, respectively.

&#160;

Compliance 

&#160;

We conduct our business in an ethical, fair, honest and lawful manner. We act responsibly, respectfully and with integrity in our relationships with patients, health care professionals, collaborators, governments, regulatory entities, stockholders, suppliers and vendors.

&#160;

In order to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, our Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Vice President of Human Resources oversee compliance training, education, auditing and monitoring; enforce disciplinary guidelines for any infractions of our corporate polices; implement new policies and procedures; respond to any detected issues; and undertake corrective action procedures. Our controls address compliance with laws and regulations that govern public pharmaceutical companies including, but not limited to, the following: federal and state law, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977; NASDAQ listing requirements; the regulations of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority; the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;); the FDA; and the United States Department of Health and Human Services. Our standard operating procedures are designed to provide a framework for corporate governance in accordance with ethical standards and best legal practices.

&#160;

&#160;

Government Regulation 

&#160;

The FDA regulates the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in the U.S., and our product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulations prior to commercialization. The FDA regulates, among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In foreign countries, our products are also subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments. These government regulations will be a significant factor in the production and marketing of any pharmaceutical products that we develop. Failure to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process may subject us to sanctions, including:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; delays; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; warning letters; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; fines; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; product recalls or seizures; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; injunctions; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; penalties; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; refusal of the FDA to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approval applications; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; total or partial suspension of production; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; civil penalties; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; criminal prosecutions. &#160;

The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any products, we or our partners must demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The approval process takes many years, substantial expenses may be incurred and significant time may be devoted to clinical development.

&#160;

Before testing potential product candidates in humans, we carry out laboratory and animal studies to determine safety and biological activity. After completing preclinical trials, we must file an IND, including a proposal to begin clinical trials, with the FDA. Thirty days after filing an IND, a Phase 1 human clinical trial can start, unless the FDA places a hold on the trial.

&#160;

Clinical trials to support a NDA are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap.

&#160;

Phase 1&#8212;During Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy volunteers, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions and safety, including side effects associated with increasing doses.

&#160;

Phase 2&#8212;Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to: (1) assess the efficacy of the drug in specific, targeted indications; (2) assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and (3) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.

&#160;

Phase 3 (pivotal) &#8212;If a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials, also called pivotal studies, major studies or advanced clinical trials, are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. In general, the FDA requires that at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials be conducted.

&#160;

Initiation and completion of the clinical trial phases are dependent on several factors including things that are beyond our control. For example, the clinical trials cannot begin at a particular site until that site receives approval from its Institutional Review Board (&#8220;IRB&#8221;), which reviews the protocol and related documents. This process can take from several weeks to several months. In addition, clinical trials are dependent on patient enrollment, but the rate at which patients enroll in the study depends on:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; willingness of investigators to participate in a study; &#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; &#160; ability of clinical sites to obtain approval from their IRB; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; the availability of the required number of eligible subjects to be enrolled in a given trial; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; the availability of existing or other experimental drugs for the disease we intend to treat; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; the willingness of patients to participate; and &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#8226; &#160; the patients meeting the eligibility criteria. &#160;

Delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased expense and longer development timelines.

&#160;

After successful completion of the required clinical testing, generally an NDA is submitted. Upon receipt of the NDA, the FDA will review the application for completeness. Within 60 days, the FDA will determine if the application is sufficiently complete to warrant full review and will consider the application &#8220;filed&#8221; at that time. Also upon receipt of the application, the FDA will assign a review priority to the application. Priority review applications are usually reviewed within 8 months; standard review applications are usually reviewed within 12 months. The FDA will usually refer NDAs for new molecular entities to an appropriate advisory committee for review and evaluation in regards to providing a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound to follow the recommendation of an advisory committee.

&#160;

Following the review of the application, which may include requests for additional information from the sponsor and results from inspections of manufacturing and clinical sites, the FDA will issue an &#8220;action letter&#8221; on the application. The action letter will either be an &#8220;approval letter,&#8221; in which case the product may be lawfully marketed in the United States, or a &#8220;complete response letter.&#8221; A complete response letter will state that the FDA cannot approve the NDA in its present form and, usually, will describe all of the specific deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the application. The complete response letter, when possible, will include the FDA&#8217;s recommended actions to place the application in a condition for approval. Deficiencies can be minor (e.g., labeling changes) or major (e.g., requiring additional clinical trials). A complete response letter may also be issued before the FDA conducts the required facility inspection and/or reviews labeling, leaving the possibility that additional deficiencies in the original NDA could be subsequently cited. An applicant receiving a complete response letter is permitted to resubmit the NDA addressing the identified deficiencies (in which case a new two or six month review cycle will begin), or withdraw the NDA. The FDA may consider a failure to take action within one year of a complete response letter to be a request to withdraw, unless the applicant has requested an extension of time in which to resubmit. If the FDA approves an NDA, the marketing of the product will be limited to the particular disease states and conditions of use that are described in the product label.

&#160;

We and all of our contract manufacturers are also required to comply with the applicable FDA current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations during clinical development and to ensure that the product can be consistently manufactured to meet the specifications submitted in an NDA. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to product quality as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities must be approved by the FDA before they can be used to manufacture our products. Based on an inspection, the FDA determines whether manufacturing facilities are in compliance with applicable regulations. Manufacturing facilities in non-United States countries that are utilized to manufacture drugs for distribution into the United States are also subject to inspection by the FDA. Additionally, failure to comply with local regulatory requirements could affect production and availability of product in relevant markets.

&#160;

Human Resources 

&#160;

As of January 31, 2016, we had approximately 70 employees, of whom approximately 50 were engaged in the research and development function of our operations. Our research and development staff, 24 of whom hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees, have diversified experience in biochemistry, pharmacology, X-ray crystallography, synthetic organic chemistry, computational chemistry, medicinal chemistry, clinical development and regulatory affairs.

&#160;

Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. Employees are required to execute confidentiality and assignment of intellectual property agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
