 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General 

HNI Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) is an Iowa corporation incorporated in 1944. The Corporation is a provider of office furniture and hearth products. Office furniture products include panel-based and freestanding furniture systems and complementary products such as seating, storage and tables. These products are sold primarily through a national system of dealers, wholesalers and office product distributors but also directly to end-user customers and federal, state and local governments. Hearth products include a full array of gas, wood and pellet burning fireplaces, inserts, stoves, facings and accessories. These products are sold through a national system of dealers and distributors, as well as Corporation-owned distribution and retail outlets. In fiscal 2015 , the Corporation had net sales of $2.3 billion , of which approximately $1.8 billion &#32;or 77% &#32;was attributable to office furniture products and $0.5 billion &#32;or 23% &#32;was attributable to hearth products. Please refer to Reportable Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about operating segments. 

The Corporation is organized into a corporate headquarters and operating units with offices, manufacturing plants, distribution centers and sales showrooms in the United States, Canada, China, Hong Kong, India and Taiwan. See Item 2."Properties" for additional related discussion. 

Nine operating units, marketing under various brand names, participate in the office furniture industry. These operating units include: The HON Company LLC ("HON"), Allsteel Inc., Maxon Furniture Inc., The Gunlocke Company L.L.C., Paoli LLC, Hickory Business Furniture, LLC (&#8220;HBF&#8221;), Artco-Bell Corporation ("Artcobell"), HNI Hong Kong Limited (&#8220;Lamex&#8221;) and BP Ergo Limited ("BP Ergo"). Each of these operating units provides products which are sold through various channels of distribution and segments of the industry. HNI International Inc. (&#8220;HNI International&#8221;) sells office furniture products manufactured by the Corporation&#8217;s operating units in select markets outside the United States and Canada. 

The operating unit Hearth &#38; Home Technologies LLC (&#8220;Hearth &#38; Home&#8221;) participates in the hearth products industry. The retail and distribution brand for this operating unit is Fireside Hearth &#38; Home. During fiscal 2014, the Corporation completed the acquisition of Vermont Castings Group ("VCG"), a leading manufacturer of free-standing hearth stoves and fireplaces, for a purchase price of approximately $62 million . 

The Corporation has been committed to systematically eliminating waste through its process improvement approach known as Rapid Continuous Improvement (&#8220;RCI&#8221;), which focuses on streamlining design, manufacturing and administrative processes. The Corporation's RCI program has contributed to increased productivity, lower costs, improved product quality and enhanced workplace safety. In addition, the Corporation's RCI efforts enable it to offer short average lead times, from receipt of order to delivery and installation, for most products. 

The Corporation's product development efforts are focused on developing and providing relevant and differentiated solutions delivering quality, aesthetics and style. 

An important element of the Corporation's success has been its member-owner culture, which has enabled it to attract, develop, retain and motivate skilled, experienced and efficient members (i.e., employees). Each of the Corporation's eligible members has the opportunity to own stock in the Corporation through a number of stock-based plans, including a member stock purchase plan and a profit-sharing retirement plan, which drives a unique level of commitment to the Corporation&#8217;s success throughout the workforce. 

For further financial-related information with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, operating segment information, restructuring and the Corporation&#8217;s operations in general, refer to &#8220;Item 7. Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; in Part II of this report, and the following sections in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Nature of Operations, Business Combinations and Reportable Segment Information.

Industry 

According to the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturer's Association (&#8220;BIFMA&#8221;), U.S. office furniture industry shipments were estimated to be $10.2 billion &#32;in 2015 , an increase of 5% &#32;compared to 2014 , which was a 4% &#32;increase from 2013 &#32;levels. 

The U.S. office furniture market consists of two primary channels&#8212;the contract channel and the supplies-driven channel. The contract channel has traditionally been characterized by sales of office furniture and services to large corporations, primarily for new office facilities, relocations or department or office redesigns, which are frequently customized to meet specific client and designer preferences. Contract furniture is generally purchased through office furniture dealers who typically prepare a custom-designed office layout emphasizing image and design. The selling process is complex and lengthy and generally has several manufacturers competing for the same projects. 

The supplies-driven channel of the market, in which the Corporation is a leader, primarily represents smaller orders of office furniture purchased by small/medium businesses on the basis of price, quality, selection and speed and reliability of delivery. Office products dealers, wholesalers and national office product distributors are the primary distribution channels in this market. Office furniture and products dealers publish content on the internet and periodic catalogs displaying office furniture and products from various manufacturers. 

The Corporation also competes in the hearth products industry, where it is a market leader. Hearth products are typically purchased by builders during the construction of new homes and homeowners during the renovation of existing homes. Both types of purchases involve seasonality with remodel/retrofit activity being concentrated in the September to December time-frame. Distribution is primarily through independent dealers, who may buy direct from the manufacturer or from an intermediate distributor. 

Strategy 

The Corporation's strategy is to build on its position as a leading manufacturer of office furniture and hearth products in North America and pursue select global markets where opportunities exist to create shareholder value. The components of this growth strategy are to introduce new products, build brand equity, provide outstanding customer satisfaction by focusing on the end-user, strengthen the distribution network, respond to global competition, pursue complementary strategic acquisitions, enter markets not currently served and continually reduce costs. 

The Corporation&#8217;s strategy has a dual focus: working continuously to extract new growth from its core markets while identifying and developing new, adjacent potential areas of growth. The Corporation focuses on extracting new growth from each of its existing businesses by deepening its understanding of end-users, using new insights gained to refine branding, selling and marketing and developing new products to serve them better. The Corporation also pursues opportunities in potential growth drivers related to its core business, such as vertical markets or new distribution models. 

Employees/Members 

As of January 2, 2016 , the Corporation employed approximately 10,400 &#32;persons, 10,000 &#32;of whom were full-time and 400 &#32;of whom were temporary personnel. The Corporation believes its labor relations are good. 

Products and Solutions 

Office Furniture 

The Corporation designs, manufactures and markets a broad range of office furniture systems and seating across a range of price points. The Corporation's portfolio includes panel-based and freestanding furniture systems and complementary products such as seating, storage and tables. The Corporation offers a complete line of office panel system products and freestanding desks, classroom solutions, bookshelves and credenzas in order to meet the needs of a wide spectrum of organizations. The Corporation offers a variety of storage options designed either to be integrated into the Corporation's office systems products or to function as freestanding furniture in office applications. The Corporation's seating line includes chairs designed for all types of office work. The chairs are available in a variety of frame colors, coverings and a wide range of price points. 

- &#32;5 - 

To meet the demands of various markets, the Corporation's products are sold under the Corporation's brands &#8211; HON &#174; , Allsteel &#174; , Maxon &#174; , Gunlocke &#174; , Paoli &#174; , HBF &#174; , artcobell TM , Midwest Folding Products TM , American Desk TM , basyx &#174; by HON, Lamex &#174; &#32;and ERGO &#174; , as well as private labels. 

Hearth Products 

The Corporation is North America&#8217;s largest manufacturer and marketer of prefabricated fireplaces, hearth stoves and related products, primarily for the home, which it sells under its widely recognized Heatilator &#174; , Heat &#38; Glo &#174; , Majestic &#174; , Monessen &#174; , Quadra-Fire &#174; , Harman Stove TM &#32;, Vermont Castings &#174; and PelPro TM brand names. 

The Corporation&#8217;s line of hearth products includes a full array of gas, wood and pellet burning fireplaces, inserts, stoves, facings and accessories. Heatilator &#174; , Heat &#38; Glo &#174; , Majestic &#174; and Monessen &#174; &#32;are brand leaders in the two largest segments of the home fireplace market: gas and wood fireplaces. The Corporation is the leader in &#8220;direct vent&#8221; fireplaces, which replace the chimney-venting system used in traditional fireplaces with a less expensive vent through the roof or an outer wall. In addition, the Corporation is the leader in wood and pellet-burning stoves and furnaces with its Quadra-Fire &#174; , Harman Stove TM ,Vermont Castings &#174; and PelPro TM &#32;product lines which provide home heating solutions using renewable fuels. See &#8220;Intellectual Property&#8221; under Item 1. "Business" for additional details. 

Manufacturing 

The Corporation manufactures office furniture in Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, New York, North Carolina, Texas, China and India. The Corporation manufactures hearth products in Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Vermont and Washington. 

The Corporation purchases raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers, and generally most items are available from multiple sources. Major raw materials and components include coil steel, aluminum, zinc, castings, lumber, veneer, particleboard, fabric, paint, lacquer, hardware, glass, plastic products and shipping cartons. 

Since its inception, the Corporation has focused on making its manufacturing facilities and processes more flexible while at the same time reducing cost, eliminating waste and improving product quality. The Corporation applies the principles of RCI and a lean manufacturing philosophy leveraging the creativity of its members to eliminate and reduce costs. To achieve flexibility and attain efficiency goals, the Corporation has adopted a variety of production techniques, including cellular manufacturing, focused factories, just-in-time inventory management, value engineering, business simplification and 80/20 principles. The application of RCI has increased productivity by reducing set-up and processing times, square footage, inventory levels, product costs and delivery times, while improving quality and enhancing member safety. The Corporation's RCI process involves production and administrative employees, management, customers and suppliers. The Corporation has facilitators, coaches and consultants dedicated to the RCI process and strives to involve all members in the RCI process. Manufacturing also plays a key role in the Corporation's concurrent product development process in order to design new products for ease of manufacturability. 

Product Development 

The Corporation's product development efforts are primarily focused on developing relevant and differentiated end-user solutions focused on quality, aesthetics, style, sustainable design and on reducing manufacturing costs. The Corporation accomplishes this through improving existing products, extending product lines and platforms, applying ergonomic research, improving manufacturing processes, applying alternative materials and providing engineering support and training to its operating units. The Corporation conducts its product development efforts at both the corporate and operating unit level. The Corporation invested approximately $31.1 million , $29.7 million &#32;and $27.3 million &#32;in product development during fiscal 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Intellectual Property 

As of January 2, 2016 , the Corporation owned 245 &#32;U.S. and 262 &#32;foreign patents with expiration dates through 2040 and had applications pending for 25 &#32;U.S. and 84 &#32;foreign patents. In addition, the Corporation holds 198 &#32;U.S. and 460 &#32;foreign trademark registrations and has applications pending for 29 &#32;U.S. and 26 &#32;foreign trademarks. 

The Corporation's principal office furniture products do not require frequent technical changes. The Corporation believes neither any individual office furniture patent nor the Corporation's office furniture patents in the aggregate are material to the Corporation's business as a whole. 

- &#32;6 - 

The Corporation&#8217;s patents covering its hearth products protect various technical innovations. While the acquisition of patents reflects Hearth &#38; Home&#8217;s position in the market as an innovation leader, the Corporation believes neither any individual hearth product patent nor the Corporation&#8217;s hearth product patents in the aggregate are material to the Corporation&#8217;s business as a whole. 

The Corporation applies for patent protection when it believes the expense of doing so is justified, and the Corporation believes the duration of its registered patents is adequate to protect these rights. The Corporation also pays royalties in certain instances for the use of patents on products and processes owned by others. 

The Corporation applies for trademark protection for brands and products when it believes the expense of doing so is justified. The Corporation actively protects trademarks it believes have significant value. The Corporation believes neither the loss of any individual trademark nor the loss of the Corporation's trademarks in the aggregate would materially adversely affect the Corporation's business as a whole, except for HNI, HON and Allsteel. 

Sales and Distribution: Customers 

The Corporation sells its office furniture products through five principal distribution channels. The first channel consisting of independent, local office furniture and office products dealers, specializes in the sale of a broad range of office furniture and office furniture systems to business, government, education and health care entities. 

The second distribution channel comprises national office product distributors including Staples, Inc. and Office Depot, Inc. which have announced a planned merger. These distributors sell furniture along with office supplies through a national network of dealerships and sales offices, which assist their customers with the evaluation of office space requirements, systems layout and product selection and design and office solution services provided by professional designers. These distributors also sell through on-line and retail office products stores. 

The third distribution channel is where the Corporation has the lead selling relationship with the end-user. 

The fourth distribution channel comprises wholesalers serving as distributors of the Corporation's products to independent dealers and national office products distributors. The Corporation sells to the nation's largest office supply/furniture wholesalers, Essendant and S.P. Richards Company. Wholesalers maintain inventory of standard product lines for resale to the various dealers and national office products distributors. They also special order products from the Corporation in customer-selected models and colors. The Corporation's wholesalers maintain warehouse locations throughout the United States, which enables the Corporation to make its products available for rapid delivery to resellers anywhere in the country. 

The fifth distribution channel comprises direct sales of the Corporation's products to federal, state and local government offices. 

The Corporation's office furniture sales force consists of regional sales managers, salespersons and firms of independent manufacturers' representatives who collectively provide national sales coverage. Sales managers and salespersons are compensated by a combination of salary and variable performance compensation. 

Office products dealers, national wholesalers and national office product distributors market their products over the Internet and through catalogs published periodically. These catalogs are distributed to existing and potential customers. 

The Corporation also makes export sales through HNI International to office furniture dealers and wholesale distributors serving select foreign markets. Distributors are principally located in the Middle East, Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean. Through Lamex and BP Ergo, the Corporation manufactures and distributes office furniture directly to end-users and through independent dealers and distributors in Asia, primarily China and India. 

Limited quantities of select finished goods inventories primarily built to order and awaiting shipment are at the Corporation's principal manufacturing plants and at its various distribution centers. 

Hearth &#38; Home sells its fireplace and stove products through dealers, distributors and Corporation-owned distribution and retail outlets. The Corporation has a field sales organization of regional sales managers, salespersons and firms of independent manufacturers' representatives. 

In fiscal 2015 , the Corporation's five largest customers represented approximately 22% &#32;of its consolidated net sales. No single customer accounted for 10% &#32;or more of the Corporation&#8217;s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2015 . The substantial purchasing power exercised by large customers may adversely affect the prices at which the Corporation can successfully offer its products. 

- &#32;7 - 

The above percentages do not include revenue from various government agencies. In aggregate, purchases by federal government entities collectively accounted for approximately 3% of the Corporation's consolidated net sales. 

As of January 2, 2016 , the Corporation had an order backlog of approximately $173.8 million , which will be filled in the ordinary course of business within the first few months of the fiscal year. This compares with $192.4 million &#32;as of January 3, 2015 . Backlog, in terms of percentage of net sales, was 7.6% &#32;and 8.7% &#32;for fiscal 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively. The Corporation&#8217;s products are typically manufactured and shipped within a few weeks following receipt of order or later upon customer request. The dollar amount of the Corporation&#8217;s order backlog is, therefore, not considered by management to be a leading indicator of the Corporation&#8217;s expected sales in any particular fiscal period. 

Competition 

The Corporation is a leading global office furniture manufacturer and believes it is the largest provider of furniture to small- and medium-sized workplaces. The Corporation is North America's largest manufacturer and marketer of fireplaces. 

The office furniture industry is highly competitive, with a significant number of competitors offering similar products. The Corporation competes by emphasizing its ability to deliver compelling value products, solutions and a high level of tailored customer service. The Corporation competes with large office furniture manufacturers, which cover a substantial portion of the North America market share in the contract-oriented office furniture market, such as Steelcase Inc., Haworth, Inc., Herman Miller, Inc. and Knoll, Inc. The Corporation also competes with a number of other office furniture manufacturers, including The Global Group (a Canadian company), Kimball International, Inc., Krueger International Inc. (KI), Virco Mfg. Corporation and Teknion Corporation (a Canadian company), as well as global importers. The Corporation faces significant price competition from its competitors and may encounter competition from new market entrants. 

Hearth products, consisting of prefabricated fireplaces and related products, are manufactured by a number of national and regional competitors. The Corporation competes primarily against a broad range of manufacturers, including Travis Industries Inc., Innovative Hearth Products, Wolf Steel Ltd. (Napoleon) and FPI Fireplace Products International Ltd. (Regency). 

Both office furniture and hearth products compete on the basis of performance, quality, price, complete and on-time delivery to the customer and customer service and support. The Corporation believes it competes principally by providing compelling value products designed to be among the best in their price range for product quality and performance, superior customer service and short lead-times. This is made possible, in part, by the Corporation's on-going investment in brands, product development, highly efficient and low cost manufacturing operations and an extensive distribution network. 

For further discussion of the Corporation's competitive situation, refer to &#8220;Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; later in this report. 

Effects of Inflation 

Certain business costs may, from time to time, increase at a rate exceeding the general rate of inflation. The Corporation&#8217;s objective is to offset the effect of normal inflation on its costs primarily through productivity increases in combination with certain adjustments to the selling price of its products as competitive market and general economic conditions permit. 

Investments are routinely made in modernizing plants, equipment, information technology capabilities and RCI programs. These investments collectively focus on business simplification and increasing productivity which helps to offset the effect of rising material and labor costs. The Corporation also routinely employs ongoing cost control disciplines. In addition, the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") valuation method is used for most of the Corporation's inventories, which ensures changing material and labor costs are recognized in reported income and, more importantly, these costs are recognized in pricing decisions. 

Environmental 

The Corporation is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing the use of materials and substances in products, the management of wastes resulting from use of certain material and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances used in the past. Although the Corporation believes it is in material compliance with all of the various regulations applicable to its business, there can be no assurance requirements will not change in the future or the Corporation will not incur material costs to comply with such regulations. The Corporation has trained staff responsible for monitoring compliance with environmental, health and safety requirements. The Corporation&#8217;s environmental staff works with responsible personnel at each manufacturing facility, the Corporation&#8217;s environmental legal counsel and consultants on the management of 

- &#32;8 - 

environmental, health and safety issues. The Corporation&#8217;s environmental objective is to reduce and, when practical, eliminate the human and ecosystem impacts of materials and manufacturing processes. 

The Corporation&#8217;s environmental management system has earned the recognition of numerous state and federal agencies as well as non-government organizations. Aligning continuous improvement initiatives with the Corporation&#8217;s environmental objectives creates a model of the triple bottom line of sustainable development where members work toward shared goals of personal growth, economic reward and a healthy environment for the future. 

Over the past several years, the Corporation has expanded its environmental management system and established metrics to influence product design and development, supplier and supply chain performance, energy and resource consumption and the impacts of its facilities. In addition, the Corporation is providing sustainability training to senior decision makers and has assigned resources to documenting and communicating its progress to an increasingly knowledgeable market. Integrating sustainable objectives into core business systems is consistent with the Corporation&#8217;s vision and ensures its commitment to being a sustainable enterprise remains a priority for all members. 

Compliance with federal, state and local environmental regulations has not had a material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Corporation to date. The Corporation does not anticipate financially material capital expenditures will be required during fiscal 2016 &#32;for environmental control facilities. It is management&#8217;s judgment that compliance with current regulations should not have a material effect on the Corporation&#8217;s financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance new environmental legislation, material science or technology in this area will not result in or require material capital expenditures. 

Business Development 

The development of the Corporation's business during the fiscal years ended January 2, 2016 , January 3, 2015 &#32;and December 28, 2013 &#32;is discussed in &#8220;Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221;.
