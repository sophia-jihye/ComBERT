 Item 1. Business. 

General 

VOC Energy Trust, which we refer to as the "trust," was formed in November 2010, by VOC Brazos Energy Partners, L.P., which we refer to as "VOC Brazos." Much of the information disclosed herein has been provided to the trust by VOC Brazos, including information associated with the underlying properties such as production and well counts, major producing areas, customer relationships, competition, marketing and post-production services, and certain information on which reserve data is based. 

The trust is a statutory trust created under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The business and affairs of the trust are managed by The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee. The trust maintains its offices at the office of the trustee, at 919 Congress Avenue, Austin, Texas 78701. The telephone number of the trustee is 1-855-802-1094. In addition, Wilmington Trust Company acts as the Delaware trustee of the trust. The Delaware trustee has only minimal rights and duties as are necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The trust does not have any employees and the business and affairs of the trust are managed by the trustee. 

The trustee does not maintain a website for filings by the trust with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the "SEC." Electronic filings by the trust with the SEC are available free of charge through the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and at http://voc.investorhq.businesswire.com . 

On May 10, 2011, VOC Brazos and the trust completed an initial public offering of units of beneficial interest in the trust, which are referred to herein as the "trust units." In connection with the closing of the initial public offering, on May 10, 2011, VOC Brazos conveyed a net profits interest to the trust, which entitles the trust to receive 80% of the net proceeds (calculated as described below) from the sale and production of substantially all of the interests in oil and natural gas properties in the states of Kansas and Texas held by VOC Brazos as of May 10, 2011, which is referred herein as the "net profits interests." VOC Brazos' net interests in such properties, after deduction of all royalties and other burdens on production thereon as of May 10, 2011, is referred to herein as the "underlying properties." As of December 31, 2015, the underlying properties included interests in 823 gross (504.6 net) producing wells and included 91,491 gross (56,534.3 net) acres. The net proceeds attributable to the net profits interest were impacted by the settlement of hedge contracts that VOC Brazos entered into for the year 2013 and for the six months ended June 30, 2014. See "&#151;Hedge Contracts" below. The net profits interest will terminate on the later to occur of (1) December 31, 2030, or (2) the time from and after January 1, 2011 when 10.6 MMBoe have been produced from the underlying properties and sold (which amount is the equivalent of 8.5 MMBoe in respect of the trust's right to receive 80% of the net proceeds from the underlying properties pursuant to the net profits interest), and the trust will soon thereafter wind up its affairs and terminate. As of December 31, 2015, cumulatively, since inception, the trust has received payment for approximately 3.1 MMBoe of the trust's 8.5 MMBoe interest. 

The trust will make quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its quarterly cash receipts, after deducting the trust's administrative expenses, on or about 45 days following the completion of each quarter through (and including) the quarter ending December 31, 2030. Because payments to the trust will be generated by depleting assets and the trust has a finite life with the production from the underlying properties diminishing over time, a portion of each distribution will represent a return of the original investment in the trust units. 

The amount of trust revenues and cash distributions to trust unitholders will depend on, among other things: 

&#149; oil sales prices and, to a lesser extent, natural gas sales prices; &#149; volumes of oil and natural gas produced and sold attributable to the underlying properties; &#149; the payments made or received by VOC Brazos pursuant to the hedge contracts; &#149; property and production taxes; &#149; development expenses; &#149; lease operating expenses; and &#149; administrative expenses of the trust. The trust was created to acquire and hold the net profits interest for the benefit of the trust unitholders. The net profits interest is passive in nature and neither the trust nor the trustee has any control over or responsibility for costs relating to the operation of the underlying properties. The business and affairs of the trust are managed by the trustee, and neither VOC Brazos nor any of its affiliates has the ability to manage or influence the operations of the trust. Vess Oil Corporation, which we refer to as "Vess Oil," L.D. Drilling, Inc. and Davis Petroleum, Inc., which are collectively referred to herein as the "VOC Operators," are currently the operator or contract operator of substantially all of the underlying properties. VOC Brazos does not, as a matter of course, make public projections as to future sales, earnings or other results relating to the underlying properties. 

Description of the Trust Units 

Each trust unit is a unit of beneficial interest in the trust and is entitled to receive cash distributions from the trust on a pro rata basis. Each trust unitholder has the same rights regarding each of his trust units as every other trust unitholder has regarding his units. The trust units are in book-entry form only and are not represented by certificates. The trust had 17,000,000 trust units outstanding as of March 15, 2016. 

Distributions and Income Computations 

Each quarter, the trustee will determine the amount of funds available for distribution to the trust unitholders. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the trust from the net profits interest and other sources (such as interest earned on any amounts reserved by the trustee) in that quarter, over the trust's expenses for that quarter. Available funds will be reduced by any cash the trustee decides to hold as a reserve against future expenses. It is expected that quarterly cash distributions during the term of the trust will be made by the trustee on or before the 45th day following the end of each quarter to the trust unitholders of record on the 30th day following the end of each quarter (or the next succeeding business day). 

Unless otherwise advised by counsel or the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to herein as the "IRS," the trustee will treat the income and expenses of the trust for each quarter as belonging to the trust unitholders of record on the quarterly record date. For federal income tax purposes, trust unitholders must take into account items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit consistent with their methods of accounting and without regard to the taxable year or accounting method employed by the trust and without regard to the quarter in which the trust makes distributions related to those items to the trust unitholders. Variances between taxable income and cash distributions may occur. For example, the trustee could establish a reserve in one quarter using funds that would be included in income in the quarter in which the reserve is created but may not result in a tax deduction or a distribution until a later quarter or possibly in a later taxable year. Similarly, the trustee could also 

make a payment in one quarter that would be amortized for income tax purposes over several quarters. See "&#151;Federal Income Tax Matters." 

Periodic Reports 

The trustee files all required trust federal and state income tax and information returns. The trustee prepares and provides the tax information that trust unitholders need to correctly report their share of the income and deductions of the trust. The trustee also causes to be prepared and filed reports required to be filed under the Exchange Act and by the rules of any securities exchange or quotation system on which the trust units are listed or admitted to trading, and also causes the trust to comply with the provisions of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including but not limited to, by establishing, evaluating and maintaining a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 thereof. 

Each trust unitholder and his representatives may examine, for any proper purpose, during reasonable business hours, the records of the trust and the trustee. 

Liability of Trust Unitholders 

Under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act, trust unitholders are entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. No assurance can be given, however, that the courts in jurisdictions outside of Delaware will give effect to such limitation. 

Voting Rights of Trust Unitholders 

The trustee or trust unitholders owning at least 10% of the outstanding trust units may call meetings of trust unitholders. The trust is responsible for all costs associated with calling a meeting of trust unitholders unless such meeting is called by the trust unitholders, in which case the trust unitholders are responsible for all costs associated with calling such meeting of trust unitholders. Meetings must be held in such location as is designated by the trustee in the notice of such meeting. The trustee must send written notice of the time and place of the meeting and the matters to be acted upon to all of the trust unitholders at least 20 days and not more than 60 days before the meeting. Trust unitholders representing a majority of trust units outstanding must be present or represented to have a quorum. Each trust unitholder is entitled to one vote for each trust unit owned. 

Unless otherwise required by the trust agreement, a matter may be approved or disapproved by the vote of a majority of the trust units held by the trust unitholders at a meeting where there is a quorum. This is true even if a majority of the total trust units did not approve it. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding trust units is required to: 

&#149; dissolve the trust; &#149; remove the trustee or the Delaware trustee; &#149; amend the trust agreement (except with respect to certain matters that do not adversely affect the rights of trust unitholders in any material respect); &#149; merge or consolidate the trust with or into another entity; or &#149; approve the sale of all or any material part of the assets of the trust. In addition, certain amendments to the trust agreement may be made by the trustee without approval of the trust unitholders. The trustee must consent before all or any part of the trust assets can be sold except in connection with the dissolution of the trust or limited sales directed by VOC Brazos in conjunction with its sale of underlying properties. 

Duration of the Trust; Sale of the Net Profits Interest 

The trust will remain in existence until the later to occur of (1) December 31, 2030 or (2) the time when 10.6 MMBoe (which is the equivalent of 8.5 MMBoe in respect of the trust's right to receive 80% of the net proceeds from the underlying properties pursuant to the net profits interest) have been produced and sold. The trust will dissolve prior to its termination if: 

&#149; the trust sells the net profits interest; &#149; annual gross proceeds attributable to the net profits interest are less than $1 million for each of two consecutive years; &#149; the holders of a majority of the outstanding trust units vote in favor of dissolution; or &#149; there is a judicial dissolution of the trust. Upon dissolution, the trustee would sell all of the trust's assets, either by private sale or public auction, and distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the trust unitholders. 

Computation of Net Proceeds 

The provisions of the conveyance governing the computation of the net proceeds are detailed and extensive. The following information summarizes the material information contained in the conveyance related to the computation of the net proceeds. For more detailed provisions concerning the net profits interest, please see the conveyance, which is referenced as an exhibit to this Form 10-K. 

Net Profits Interest 

The net profits interest was conveyed to the trust by VOC Brazos on May 10, 2011 by means of a conveyance instrument that has been recorded in the appropriate real property records in each of Kansas and Texas where the oil and natural gas properties to which the underlying properties relate are located. The net profits interest burdens the net interest owned by VOC Brazos in the underlying properties in existence as of May 10, 2011. 

The amounts paid to the trust for the net profits interest are based on the definitions of "gross proceeds" and "net proceeds" contained in the conveyance and described below. Under the conveyance, net proceeds are computed quarterly, and 80% of the aggregate net proceeds attributable to a computation period will be paid to the trust on or before the 30th day of the month following the computation period. VOC Brazos will not pay to the trust any interest on the net proceeds held by VOC Brazos prior to payment to the trust. The trustee will make distributions to trust unitholders quarterly, if sufficient funds are available. See "&#151;Description of the Trust Units&#151;Distributions and Income Computations." 

&#160;"Gross proceeds" means the aggregate amount received by VOC Brazos from sales of oil and natural gas produced from the underlying properties (other than amounts received for certain future non-consent operations). However, gross proceeds does not include consideration for the transfer or sale of any underlying property by VOC Brazos or any subsequent owner to any new owner. Gross proceeds also does not include any amount for oil or natural gas lost in production or marketing or used by the owner of the underlying properties in drilling, production and plant operations. Gross proceeds includes payments for future production if they are not subject to repayment in the event of insufficient subsequent production. 

&#160;"Net proceeds" means gross proceeds less the following: 

&#149; all payments to mineral owners or landowners, such as royalties, overriding royalties or other burdens against production, delay rentals, shut-in oil and natural gas payments, minimum royalty or other payments for drilling or deferring drilling; 9 

&#149; any taxes paid by the owner of an underlying property to the extent not deducted in calculating gross proceeds, including estimated and accrued general property (ad valorem), production, severance, sales, gathering, excise and other taxes; &#149; the aggregate amount paid by VOC Brazos upon settlement of hedge contracts on a quarterly basis, as specified in the hedge contracts; &#149; any extraordinary taxes or windfall profits taxes that may be assessed in the future that are based on profits realized or prices received for production from the underlying properties; &#149; costs paid by an owner of a property comprising the underlying properties under any joint operating agreement pursuant to the terms of the conveyance; &#149; all other costs and expenses, development costs and liabilities of drilling, recompleting, workovers, operating and producing oil and natural gas, including allocated expenses such as labor, vehicle and travel costs and materials and any plugging and abandonment liabilities (net of any capital costs for which a reserve had already been made to the extent such development costs are incurred during the computation period) other than costs and expenses for certain future non-consent operations; &#149; costs or charges associated with gathering, treating and processing oil and natural gas (provided, however, that any proceeds attributable to treatment or processing will offset such costs or changes, if any); &#149; any overhead charge incurred pursuant to any operating agreement relating to an underlying property; &#149; costs for recording the conveyance and costs estimated to record the termination and for the release of the conveyance; &#149; costs paid to counterparties under the hedge contracts or to the persons that provide credit to maintain any hedge contracts, excluding any hedge settlement amounts; &#149; amounts previously included in gross proceeds but subsequently paid as a refund, interest or penalty; &#149; costs and expenses for renewals or extensions of leases; and &#149; at the option of VOC Brazos (or any subsequent owner of the underlying properties), amounts reserved for approved development, maintenance or operating expenditures, including well drilling, recompletion and workover costs, which amounts will at no time exceed $1.0 million in the aggregate, and will be subject to the limitations described below (provided that such costs shall not be debited from gross proceeds when actually incurred). All of the hedge payments received by VOC Brazos from hedge contract counterparties upon settlements of hedge contracts and certain other non-production revenues, including salvage value for equipment related to plugged and abandoned wells, as detailed in the conveyance, offset the costs outlined above in calculating the net proceeds. If any excess amounts have not been used to offset costs at the time when the later to occur of (1) December 31, 2030 or (2) the time when 10.6 MMBoe (which is the equivalent of 8.5 MMBoe in respect of the net profits interest) have been produced from the underlying properties and sold, then trust unitholders will not be entitled to receive the benefit of such excess amounts. 

During each twelve-month period beginning on the later to occur of (1) December 31, 2027 and (2) the time when 9.8 MMBoe have been produced from the underlying properties and sold (which is the equivalent of 7.8 MMBoe in respect of the net profits interest), which we refer to, in either case, as the "Capital Expenditure Limitation Date," the sum of the development expenditures and amounts 

reserved for approved development expenditure projects for such twelve-month period may not exceed the Average Annual Capital Expenditure Amount. The "Average Annual Capital Expenditure Amount" means the quotient of (x) the sum of the development expenditures and amounts reserved for approved development expenditure projects with respect to the three twelve- month periods ending on the Capital Expenditure Limitation Date, divided by (y) three. Commencing on the Capital Expenditure Limitation Date, and each anniversary of the Capital Expenditure Limitation Date thereafter, the Average Annual Capital Expenditure Amount will be increased by 2.5% to account for expected increased costs due to inflation. 

As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, VOC Brazos pays an overhead fee to the VOC Operators to operate the underlying properties on behalf of VOC Brazos. The operating activities include various engineering, accounting and administrative functions. The fee is based on a monthly charge per active operated well, which totaled $1.8 million and $1.7 million paid to the VOC Operators in 2014 and 2015, respectively, for all of the underlying properties for which VOC Brazos was designated as the operator. The fee is adjusted annually and will increase or decrease each year based on changes in the Overhead Adjustment Index ("OAI") published by the Council of Petroleum Accountants Society ("COPAS") for that year. 

In the event that the net proceeds for any computation period is a negative amount, the trust will receive no payment for that period, and any such negative amount plus accrued interest at the prime rate will be deducted from gross proceeds in the following computation period for purposes of determining the net proceeds for that following computation period. 

Gross proceeds and net proceeds are calculated on a cash receipts and cash disbursements basis except that certain costs, primarily ad valorem taxes and expenditures of a material amount, may be determined on an accrual basis. 

Hedge Contracts 

The revenues derived from the underlying properties depend substantially on prevailing crude oil prices and, to a lesser extent, natural gas prices. As a result, commodity prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for distribution to the trust unitholders. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that VOC Brazos can economically produce. VOC Brazos sells the oil and natural gas production from the underlying properties under floating market price contracts each month. VOC Brazos had entered into hedge contracts for 2013 and for the six months ended June 30, 2014 to reduce the exposure of the revenues from oil production from the underlying properties to fluctuations in crude oil prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow. VOC Brazos has not entered into any hedge contracts relating to oil volumes to be produced after June 30, 2014, and the terms of the conveyance of the net profits interest prohibit VOC Brazos from entering into new hedging arrangements for the benefit of the Trust. 

The crude oil swap contracts settled based on the average of the settlement price for each commodity business day in the contract month. In a swap transaction, the counterparty was required to make a payment to VOC Brazos for the difference between the fixed price and the settlement price if the settlement price was below the fixed price. VOC Brazos was required to make a payment to the counterparty for the difference between the fixed price and the settlement price if the settlement price was above the fixed price. The amounts received by VOC Brazos from the hedge contract counterparty upon settlement of the hedge contracts reduced the operating expenses related to the underlying properties in calculating the net proceeds. In addition, the aggregate amounts paid by VOC Brazos on settlement of the hedge contracts reduced the amount of net proceeds paid to the trust. 

Additional Provisions 

If a controversy arises as to the sales price of any production, then for purposes of determining gross proceeds: 

&#149; amounts withheld or placed in escrow by a purchaser are not considered to be received by the owner of the underlying property until actually collected; &#149; amounts received by the owner of the underlying property and promptly deposited with a nonaffiliated escrow agent will not be considered to have been received until disbursed to it by the escrow agent; and &#149; amounts received by the owner of the underlying property and not deposited with an escrow agent will be considered to have been received. The trustee is not obligated to return any cash received from the net profits interest. Any overpayments made to the trust by VOC Brazos due to adjustments to prior calculations of net proceeds or otherwise will reduce future amounts payable to the trust until VOC Brazos recovers the overpayments plus interest at the prime rate. 

The conveyance generally permits VOC Brazos to transfer without the consent or approval of the trust unitholders all or any part of its interest in the underlying properties, subject to the net profits interest. The trust unitholders are not entitled to any proceeds of a sale or transfer of VOC Brazos' interest unless certain conditions set forth in the following paragraph are satisfied. Except in certain cases where the net profits interest is released, following a sale or transfer, the underlying properties will continue to be subject to the net profits interest, and the net proceeds attributable to the transferred property will be calculated as part of the computation of net proceeds described in this Form 10-K. 

In addition, VOC Brazos may, without the consent of the trust unitholders, require the trust to release the net profits interest associated with any lease that accounts for less than or equal to 0.25% of the total production from the underlying properties in the prior 12 months and provided that the net profits interest covered by such releases cannot exceed, during any 12-month period, an aggregate fair market value to the trust of $500,000. These releases will be made only in connection with a sale by VOC Brazos to a non-affiliate of the relevant underlying properties and are conditioned upon the trust receiving an amount equal to the fair value to the trust of such net profits interest. Any net sales proceeds paid to the trust are distributable to trust unitholders for the quarter in which they are received. 

As the designated operator of a property comprising the underlying properties, VOC Brazos may enter into farm-out, operating, participation and other similar agreements to develop the property. VOC Brazos may enter into any of these agreements without the consent or approval of the trustee or any trust unitholder. 

VOC Brazos and any transferee of an underlying property will have the right to abandon its interest in any well or property if it reasonably believes the well or property ceases to produce or is not capable of producing in commercially paying quantities. In making such decisions, VOC Brazos or any transferee of an underlying property is required under the applicable conveyance to operate, or to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the operators of the underlying properties to operate these properties as would a reasonably prudent operator in the State of Kansas or Texas under the same or similar circumstances would act if it were acting with respect to its own properties, disregarding the existence of the net profits interest as a burden on such property. Upon termination of the lease, the portion of the net profits interest relating to the abandoned property will be extinguished. 

VOC Brazos must maintain books and records sufficient to determine the amounts payable for the net profits interest to the trust. Quarterly and annually, VOC Brazos must deliver to the trustee a 

statement of the computation of the net proceeds for each computation period. The trustee has the right to inspect and copy the books and records maintained by VOC Brazos during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice. 

Federal Income Tax Matters 

The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax matters that may be relevant to trust unitholders. This summary is based upon current provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the "Code," existing and proposed Treasury regulations thereunder and current administrative rulings and court decisions, all of which are subject to changes that may or may not be retroactively applied. No attempt has been made in the following summary to comment on all U.S. federal income tax matters affecting the trust or the trust unitholders. 

The summary is limited to trust unitholders who are individual citizens or residents of the United States. Accordingly, the following summary has limited application to domestic corporations and persons subject to specialized federal income tax treatment. Each trust unitholder should consult his own tax advisor with respect to his particular circumstances. 

Classification and Taxation of the Trust 

Tax counsel to the trust advised the trust at the time of formation that, for federal income tax purposes, in its opinion the trust will be treated as a grantor trust and not as an unincorporated business entity. No ruling has been or will be requested from the IRS with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the trust, including as to the status of the trust as a grantor trust for such purposes. Thus, no assurance can be provided that the tax treatment of the trust would be sustained by a court if contested by the IRS or another taxing authority. The remainder of the discussion below is based on tax counsel's opinion, at the time of formation, that the trust will be classified as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. As a grantor trust, the trust will not be subject to federal income tax at the trust level. Rather, each trust unitholder will be considered for federal income tax purposes to own its proportionate share of the trust's assets directly as though no trust were in existence. The income of the trust is deemed to be received or accrued by the trust unitholder at the time such income is received or accrued by the trust, rather than when distributed by the trust. Each trust unitholder will be subject to tax on its proportionate share of the income and gain attributable to the assets of the trust and will be entitled to claim its proportionate share of the deductions and expenses attributable to the assets of the trust, subject to applicable limitations, in accordance with the trust unitholder's tax method of accounting and without regard to the taxable year or accounting method employed by the trust. 

The trust will allocate items of income, gain, loss, deductions and credits to trust unitholders based on record ownership at each quarterly record date. It is possible that the IRS or another taxing authority could disagree with this allocation method and could assert that income and deductions of the trust should be determined and allocated on a daily, prorated or other basis, which could require adjustments to the tax returns of the trust unitholders affected by this issue and result in an increase in the administrative expense of the trust in subsequent periods. 

Classification of the Net Profits Interest 

Tax counsel to the trust also advised the trust at the time of formation that, for federal income tax purposes, based upon representations made by VOC Brazos regarding the expected economic life of the underlying properties and the expected duration of the net profits interest, in its opinion the net profits interest should be treated as a "production payment" under Section 636 of the Code or otherwise as a debt instrument. On the basis of that advice, the trust will treat the net profits interest as indebtedness subject to Treasury regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments, and 

by purchasing trust units, a trust unitholder will agree to be bound by the trust's application of those regulations, including the trust's determination of the rate at which interest will be deemed to accrue on the net profits interest. No assurance can be given that the IRS or another taxing authority will not assert that the net profits interest should be treated differently. Any such different treatment could affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain or loss in respect of an investment in trust units and could require a trust unitholder to accrue income at a rate different than that determined by the trust. 

Widely Held Fixed Investment Trust Reporting Information 

The trustee assumes that some trust units are held by middlemen, as such term is broadly defined in Treasury regulations (and includes custodians, nominees, certain joint owners, and brokers holding an interest for a custodian in street name). Therefore, the trustee considers the trust to be a non-mortgage widely held fixed investment trust ("WHFIT") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., 919 Congress Avenue, Austin, Texas 78701, telephone number 1-855-802-1094, is the representative of the trust that will provide tax information in accordance with applicable Treasury regulations governing the information reporting requirements of the trust as a WHFIT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the middlemen holding trust units on behalf of trust unitholders, and not the trustee of the trust, are solely responsible for complying with the information reporting requirements under the Treasury regulations with respect to such trust units, including the issuance of IRS Forms 1099 and certain written tax statements. Trust unitholders whose trust units are held by middlemen should consult with such middlemen regarding the information that will be reported to them by the middlemen with respect to the trust units. Any generic tax information provided by the trustee of the trust is intended to be used only to assist trust unitholders in the preparation of their federal and state income tax returns. 

Available Trust Tax Information 

In compliance with the reporting requirements for WHFITs and the dissemination of trust tax reporting information, the trustee provides a generic tax information reporting booklet that is intended to be used only to assist unitholders in the preparation of their 2015 federal and state income tax returns. The projected payment schedule for the net profits interest is included with the tax information booklet. This tax information booklet can be obtained at http://voc.investorhq.businesswire.com . 

Description of the Underlying Properties 

The underlying properties consist of VOC Brazos' net interests in substantially all of its oil and natural gas properties after deduction of all royalties and other burdens on production thereon as of May 10, 2011, which properties are located in the states of Kansas and Texas. The VOC Operators are currently the operators or contract operators of substantially all of the underlying properties. 

VOC Brazos' interests in the properties comprising the underlying properties require VOC Brazos to bear its proportionate share along with the other working interest owners of the costs of development and operation of such properties. The underlying properties are burdened by non-working interests owned by third parties consisting primarily of overriding royalty and royalty interests retained by the owners of the land subject to the working interests. These landowners' royalty interests typically entitle the landowner to receive 12.5% of the revenue derived from oil and natural gas production resulting from wells drilled on the landowner's land, without any deduction for drilling costs or other costs related to production of oil and natural gas. A working interest percentage represents a working interest owner's proportionate ownership interest in a property in relation to all other working interest owners in that property, whereas a net revenue interest percentage is a working interest owner's percentage of production after reducing such percentage by the percentage of burdens on such production such as royalties and overriding royalties. 

Based on the reserve report, the net profits interest would entitle the trust to receive net proceeds from the sale of production of not less than 10.6 MMBoe of proved reserves attributable to the underlying properties expected to be produced over the term of the trust. The trust is entitled to receive 80% of the net proceeds from the sale of production of oil and natural gas attributable to the underlying properties that are produced during the term of the trust, whereas total reserves as reflected on the summary reserve reports and attributable to the underlying properties include all reserves expected to be economically produced during the economic life of the properties. 

In general, the producing wells included in the underlying properties have stable production profiles and their production is long-lived. Based on the reserve report, annual production from the underlying properties is expected to decline at an average annual rate of 6.6% over the next 20 years assuming no additional development drilling or other development expenditures are made on the underlying properties after 2019. VOC Brazos expects total development expenditures for the underlying properties through December 31, 2019 will be approximately $37.6 million, which it expects will partially offset the natural decline in production otherwise expected to occur with respect to the underlying properties as described in more detail below. 

Reserves 

The engineering department of Vess Oil Corporation, who serves as contract operator for VOC Brazos, maintains oversight and compliance responsibility for the internal reserve estimate process and, in accordance with internal policies and procedures, provides appropriate data to independent third party engineers for the annual estimation of year-end reserves. This engineering department accumulates historical production data for the underlying properties, calculates historical lease operating expenses and differentials, updates working interests and net revenue interests, and obtains logs, 3-D seismic and other geological and geophysical information. This data is forwarded to Cawley, Gillespie &#38; Associates, Inc., which we refer to as "CG&#38;A," thereby allowing CG&#38;A to prepare estimated proved reserves in their entirety based on such data. 

Estimates of the proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the trust as of December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 are based on reports prepared by CG&#38;A. CG&#38;A has been in business since 1961 and serves many organizations and individuals in the petroleum industry, including owners and operators of oil and gas properties, exploration groups, planners, and professionals in investment and finance. One of the principal businesses of CG&#38;A is providing detailed assessment of producing reservoirs. CG&#38;A is an independent firm of petroleum engineers, geologists, geophysicists and petrophysicists and does not own an interest in the underlying properties and is not employed on a contingent basis. Mr. W. Todd Brooker, Senior Vice President, is the technical person at CG&#38;A who is primarily responsible for overseeing CG&#38;A's preparation of the reserve estimates. Mr. Brooker is a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin with a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and has 24 years of experience in petroleum engineering. He is a licensed professional engineer in the State of Texas (License #83462). 

Oil and gas proved reserves are disclosed by significant geographic area, using the 12-month average beginning-of-month price for the year, based on the use of reliable technologies to estimate proved oil and gas reserves, if those technologies have been demonstrated to result in reliable conclusions about reserves volumes.

(1) Before interest and taxes. (2) Discounted at 10%. 

The net profits interest entitles the trust to receive 80% of the net proceeds attributable to the underlying properties. The net profits interest will terminate on the later to occur of (1) December 31, 2030, or (2) the time when 10.6 MMBoe have been produced from the underlying properties and sold, and the trust will soon thereafter wind up its affairs and terminate. Based on the reserve report for the year ended December 31, 2015, CG&#38;A estimated that the trust would terminate December 31, 2030 based on the calculation that 10.6 MMBoe would have been produced from the underlying properties and sold (which amount is the equivalent of 8.5 MMBoe in respect of the trust's right to receive 80% of the net proceeds from the underlying properties pursuant to the net profits interest) prior to this date. 

Oil and gas prices were adjusted to a WTI Cushing oil price of $50.28 per Bbl and a Henry Hub natural gas price of $2.59 per MMBtu. As specified by the SEC, these prices are 12-month averages based upon the price on the first day of each month during 2015. The price adjustments were based on oil price differentials forecast at &#150;$6.00 per Bbl for the Kansas underlying properties, &#150;$3.00 per Bbl for the Kurten (Woodbine) Field wells in Texas, &#150;$3.50 per Bbl for the Sand Flat Unit wells in Texas and &#150;$3.50 per Bbl for all other Texas underlying properties. Oil price differentials were not escalated. Gas price differentials were forecast on a per property basis as provided by VOC Brazos and were also not escalated. Price differentials include adjustments for transportation and basis differential. Gas prices were further adjusted with a heating value (Btu content) applied on a per-property basis. Operating expenses, workover expenses, COPAS overhead charges and investments were forecast on a per property basis as furnished by VOC Brazos. Expenses and investments were held constant in accordance with SEC rules and guidelines. For Kansas properties, severance taxes were applied at 4.33 percent of revenue until exemption levels were forecasted to be reached. The severance tax rate was dropped to zero (0) when a rate of six (6) Bbl/day per well were reached or when gross gas production value reached $87/day per gas well. Severance taxes were forecasted at 4.6 percent of oil 

revenue and 7.5 percent of gas revenue for properties in Texas. Ad valorem taxes for Kansas properties were applied at 6.0 percent of revenue, but dropped to 2.0 percent as properties qualified for the tax exemption. Kansas oil and gas conservation taxes were included within the severance tax estimates. Ad valorem taxes were applied at 3.29 percent of revenue (after severance taxes) for the Texas properties. 

The estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to the underlying properties are based on estimates prepared by CG&#38;A. Rules and guidelines established by the SEC regarding the present value of future net revenues were used to prepare these reserve estimates. Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner, and estimates of other engineers might differ materially from those included in the report. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering, and estimates may justify revisions based on the results of drilling, testing, and production activities. Accordingly, reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and should not be construed as representing the actual quantities of future production or cash flows to be realized from oil and natural gas properties or the fair market value of such properties. 

Producing Acreage and Well Counts 

For the following data, "gross" refers to the total wells or acres in which VOC Brazos owns a working interest and "net" refers to gross wells or acres multiplied by the percentage working interest owned by VOC Brazos. Although many of VOC Brazos' wells produce both oil and natural gas, a well is categorized as an oil well or a natural gas well based upon the ratio of oil to natural gas production. 

The underlying properties are interests in developed properties located in oil and natural gas producing regions of Kansas and Texas. The following is a summary of the approximate acreage of the underlying properties at December 31, 2015.

As of December 31, 2015, no wells were being drilled but VOC had one DUC. There were no capital expenditures associated with converting proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves for the year ended December 31, 2015. VOC Brazos continues to develop further proved undeveloped reserves pursuant to its planned development and workover program. See "Trustee's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Planned Development and Workover Program."

(1) In accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, the proved reserves presented above were determined using the twelve month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the period from January 1, 2015 through December 1, 2015, without giving effect to any hedge transactions, and were held constant for the life of the properties. This yielded a price for oil of $50.28 per barrel and a price for natural gas of $2.59 per MMBtu. (2) Because the trust bears no federal tax expense and taxable income is passed through to the unitholders of the trust, no provision for federal or state income taxes is included in the summary reserve reports and therefore the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows attributable to the underlying properties is equal to the pre-tax PV-10 value. PV-10 may not be considered a GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC and is derived from the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. The pre-tax PV-10 value and the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows do not purport to present the fair value of the oil and natural gas reserves attributable to underlying properties. 

Kansas. As of December 31, 2015, proved reserves attributable to the portion of the Kansas underlying properties were approximately 3.9 MMBoe and were located in three primary areas: the Central Kansas Uplift, Western Kansas and South Central Kansas. As of December 31, 2015, the VOC Operators operated 95.9% of the total proved reserves attributable to the Kansas underlying properties based on PV-10 value. 

The major fields in the Central Kansas Uplift include Fairport Field, Chase-Silica Field and Marcotte Field, all of which are producing primarily from the Arbuckle and Lansing Kansas City zones. The major fields in Western Kansas include the Bindley, Moore-Johnson and Wesley fields, which are producing primarily from the Mississippian, Morrow, Lansing Kansas City and Cherokee zones. The major fields in South Central Kansas include the Gerberding, Spivey Grabs and Alford fields, which are producing primarily from the Mississippian, Simpson and Lansing Kansas City zones. 

Texas. As of December 31, 2015, proved reserves attributable to the Texas underlying properties were approximately 5.5 MMBoe and are located in two areas: Central Texas and East Texas. As of December 31, 2015, the VOC Operators operated approximately 99.8% of the total proved reserves attributable to the Texas underlying properties based on PV-10 value. 

Central Texas production is attributable to the Kurten Woodbine Unit, which is producing primarily from the EagleBine Interval and Buda Georgetown zones. East Texas properties include the Sand Flat field and Hitts Lake North field, each of which is producing primarily from the Paluxy and Chisum zones. 

The following table summarizes the production by product for the years indicated for the only field, Kurten, that contains 15% or more of total proved reserves attributable to the underlying properties from the above table: 

&#160; &#160; Oil (MBbl) &#160; Natural Gas (MMcf) &#160; Oil Equivalents (MBoe) &#160; 2013 &#160; &#160; 212 &#160; &#160; 196 &#160; &#160; 245 &#160; 2014 &#160; &#160; 187 &#160; &#160; 197 &#160; &#160; 220 &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 140 &#160; &#160; 137 &#160; &#160; 163 &#160; 

Marketing and Post-Production Services 

Pursuant to the terms of the conveyance that created the net profits interest, VOC Brazos has the responsibility to market, or cause to be marketed, the oil and natural gas production attributable to the underlying properties. The terms of the conveyance that created the net profits interest do not permit VOC Brazos to charge any marketing fee when determining the net proceeds upon which the net profits interest is calculated. As a result, the net proceeds to the trust from the sales of oil and natural gas production from the underlying properties are determined based on the same price that VOC Brazos receives for oil and natural gas production attributable to VOC Brazos' remaining interest in the underlying properties. 

Texas is a mature oil producing state with a well-developed crude oil refining, transportation and marketing infrastructure. According to the Texas Railroad Commission, more than 5,000 operators reported aggregate oil production of approximately 1.009 billion barrels for the State of Texas during 2015. There were 27 operating oil refineries located in Texas in 2015 with combined capacity to refine over 5.23 million barrels of oil per day. With oil production in the state of Texas averaging approximately 2.76 million barrels of oil per day, Texas refineries are net importers of crude oil. As a result, oil producers in Texas benefit from competitive marketing conditions for their oil production as a result of the high demand from the crude oil marketing companies and refineries located in Texas. 

Kansas is a mature oil producing state with a well-developed transportation infrastructure for crude oil transportation and marketing. According to the Kansas Geological Society, more than 2,100 operators reported aggregate oil production of approximately 46.4 million barrels for the state of Kansas in 2015. Kansas is home to three oil refineries located in McPherson, El Dorado and Coffeyville, Kansas. These refineries have combined capacity to refine over 300,000 barrels of oil per day. With oil production in the state of Kansas averaging approximately 127,000 barrels of oil per day, Kansas is a net importer of crude oil. As a result, Kansas operators benefit from the competitive marketing conditions for their oil production as a result of the high demand from the refineries located in Kansas. 

Vess Oil Corporation generally sells production from the underlying properties to several purchasers, including MV Purchasing LLC, an affiliate of VOC Brazos, which we refer to as "MV Purchasing," under short-term arrangements using market sensitive pricing. These sales to purchasers are under terms ranging from one month to six months, using market sensitive pricing. Five purchasers, including MV Purchasing, have been purchasing substantially all of the crude oil production, and a substantial portion of the crude oil production may continue be acquired by one or more single purchasers. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, MV Purchasing purchased 34%, 35% and 37%, respectively, of the production sold from the underlying properties. VOC Brazos does not believe that loss of any of these parties as a purchaser would have a material adverse impact on the business of VOC Brazos, as substitute purchasers are generally available; however, a purchaser's failure to pay for purchased crude oil could have a significant adverse impact on VOC Brazos' business. 

Oil production is typically transported by truck from the field to the closest gathering facility or refinery. VOC Brazos sells the majority of the oil production from the underlying properties under short-term arrangements using market sensitive pricing. The price received by VOC Brazos for the oil production from the underlying properties is usually based on the NYMEX price applied to equal daily quantities on the month of delivery, which price is then reduced for differentials based upon delivery location and oil quality. The average differential for oil production during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 received by the trust from the underlying properties were $2.32, $4.88 and $4.48 per barrel, respectively. 

All natural gas produced by VOC Brazos is marketed and sold to third-party purchasers. The natural gas is sold on a contract basis and, in all but two cases, the contracts are in their secondary terms and are on a month-to- month basis. In all cases, the contract price is based on a percentage of a published regional index price, after adjustments for Btu content, transportation and related charges. 

Vess Oil Corporation has committed to sell all of its natural gas production attributable to the Kurten Woodbine Unit in Texas to ETC Texas Pipeline, Ltd., on a year-to-year basis effective October 1, 2014. Vess Oil Corporation has also committed to sell to ONEOK Field Services Company, L.L.C. all of its natural gas production attributable to nine wells in Kingman and Barber Counties, Kansas on a month-to-month basis effective as of August 31, 2015. 

VOC Brazos does not have any volume commitments or take or pay arrangements. 

Sale and Abandonment of Underlying Properties 

VOC Brazos and any transferee of any of an underlying property will have the right to abandon its interest in any well or property if it reasonably believes a well or property ceases to produce or is not capable of producing in commercially paying quantities. To reduce the potential conflict of interest between VOC Brazos and the trust in determining whether a well is capable of producing in commercially paying quantities, VOC Brazos is required under the applicable conveyance to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the operators of the underlying properties to operate these properties as would a reasonably prudent operator acting with respect to its own properties, disregarding the existence of the net profits interest as a burden on such property. Upon termination of 

the lease, the portion of the net profits interest relating to the abandoned property will be extinguished. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, VOC Brazos plugged and abandoned 15, 26 and 14 wells, respectively, located on leases within the underlying properties based on its determination that such wells could no longer produce oil or natural gas in commercially economic quantities. 

VOC Brazos generally may sell all or a portion of its interests in the underlying properties, subject to and burdened by the net profits interest, without the consent of the trust unitholders. In addition, VOC Brazos may, without the consent of the trust unitholders, require the trust to release the net profits interest associated with any lease that accounts for less than or equal to 0.25% of the total production from the underlying properties in the prior 12 months and provided that the net profits interest covered by such releases cannot exceed, during any 12-month period, an aggregate fair market value to the trust of $500,000. These releases will be made only in connection with a sale by VOC Brazos to a non-affiliate of the relevant underlying properties and are conditioned upon the trust receiving an amount equal to the fair value to the trust of such net profits interest. Any net sales proceeds paid to the trust are distributable to trust unitholders for the quarter in which they are received. Net sales proceeds of $229,344 were paid to the trust during 2015 for its share of interest in certain underlying properties that were sold. VOC Brazos has not identified any of the underlying properties for sale as of December 31, 2015. 

Title to Properties 

The underlying properties are subject to certain burdens that are described in more detail below. To the extent that these burdens and obligations affect VOC Brazos' rights to production and the value of production from the underlying properties, they have been taken into account in calculating the trust's interests and in estimating the size and the value of the reserves attributable to the underlying properties. 

VOC Brazos' interests in the oil and natural gas underlying properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following: 

&#149; royalties, overriding royalties and other burdens, express and implied, under oil and natural gas leases; &#149; overriding royalties, production payments and similar interests and other burdens created by VOC Brazos or its predecessors in title; &#149; a variety of contractual obligations arising under operating agreements, farm-out agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the underlying properties or their title; &#149; liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements that are not yet delinquent or, if delinquent, are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings; &#149; pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations and orders; &#149; easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property; &#149; conventional rights of reassignment that obligate VOC Brazos to reassign all or part of a property to a third party if VOC Brazos intends to release or abandon such property; and &#149; rights reserved to or vested in the appropriate governmental agency or authority to control or regulate the underlying properties and the net profits interest therein. 24 

VOC Brazos has informed the trustee that VOC Brazos believes that the burdens and obligations affecting the underlying properties are conventional in the industry for similar properties. VOC Brazos also has informed the trustee that VOC Brazos believes that the existing burdens and obligations do not, in the aggregate, materially interfere with the use of the underlying properties and do not materially adversely affect the value of the net profits interest. 

VOC Brazos recorded the conveyance of the net profits interest in Kansas and Texas in the real property records in each Kansas or Texas county in which the underlying properties are located. Although under Texas law it is well-established that the recording in the appropriate real property records of an interest such as the net profits interest constitutes the conveyance of a fully vested real property interest to the trust, the law in Kansas is less certain. VOC Brazos and the trust believe that the recording in the appropriate real property records in Kansas of the net profits interest should constitute the conveyance of a fully vested real property interest, interests in hydrocarbons in place or to be produced or a production payment as such is defined under the United States Bankruptcy Code. In a bankruptcy of VOC Brazos, creditors of VOC Brazos would be able to claim the net profits interest as an asset of the bankruptcy estate to satisfy obligations to them if the conveyance of the net profits interest did not constitute the conveyance of a real property interest or interests in hydrocarbons in place or to be produced under applicable state law or a production payment, in which case the trust would be an unsecured creditor of VOC Brazos at risk of losing the entire value of the net profits interest to senior creditors. 

VOC Brazos believes that its title to the underlying properties is, and the trust's title to the net profits interest is, good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject to such exceptions as are not so material to detract substantially from the use or value of such properties or royalty interests. Please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors&#151;The trust units may lose value as a result of title deficiencies with respect to the underlying properties." 

Competition and Markets 

The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. VOC Brazos competes with major oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas companies for oil and natural gas, equipment, personnel and markets for the sale of oil and natural gas. Many of these competitors are financially stronger than VOC Brazos, but even financially troubled competitors can affect the market because of their need to sell oil and natural gas at any price to attempt to maintain cash flow. The trust is subject to the same competitive conditions as VOC Brazos and other companies in the oil and natural gas industry. 

Oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate forms of energy include electricity, coal and fuel oils. Changes in the availability or price of oil, natural gas or other forms of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas. 

Future price fluctuations for oil and natural gas will directly impact trust distributions, estimates of reserves attributable to the trust's interests and estimated and actual future net revenues to the trust. In view of the many uncertainties that affect the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, neither the trust nor VOC Brazos can make reliable predictions of future oil and natural gas supply and demand, future product prices or the effect of future product prices on the trust. 

Regulation 

The production of oil and gas from the underlying properties is affected by many state and federal regulations with respect to allowable rates of production, drilling permits, well spacing, marketing, 

environmental matters and pricing. Future regulations could change allowable rates of production or the manner in which oil and gas operations may be lawfully conducted. 

FERC Regulation 

Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or NGA, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or NGPA, and regulations issued under those statutes. Over the last two decades, the FERC has issued orders and adopted regulations resulting in a restructuring of the natural gas industry. The principal elements of this restructuring were the requirement that interstate pipelines separate, or "unbundle," into individual components the various services offered on their systems, with all transportation services to be provided on a non- discriminatory basis, and the prohibition against an interstate pipeline providing gas sales services except through separately organized affiliates. In various rulemaking proceedings following its initial unbundling requirement, the FERC has refined its regulatory program applicable to interstate pipelines in various respects, and it has announced that it will continue to monitor these and other regulations to determine whether further changes are needed. In addition to rulemaking proceedings, the FERC establishes new policies and regulations through policy statements and adjudications of individual pipeline matters. Further, additional changes to regulations may occur based on actions taken by the United States Congress and/or the courts. 

In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold. While sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the NGPA and culminated in adoption of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act which removed all price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective January 1, 1993. 

Sales of crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. Sales of crude oil are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is subject to rate and access regulation. The FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act. In general, interstate oil pipeline rates must be just and reasonable and may not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shopper. Rates generally are cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. 

Although the price at which VOC Brazos sells oil and natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation, with regard to physical sales of natural gas and oil, VOC Brazos is required to observe anti-market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC. If VOC Brazos were to violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, VOC Brazos could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities. 

As to these various developments, VOC Brazos has advised the trust that the on-going and evolving nature of these regulatory initiatives makes it impossible to predict their ultimate impact on the prices, markets or terms of sale of natural gas related to the trust. 

State and Other Regulation 

In general, the jurisdictions in which royalty properties are located have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas. The regulations often require permits for the drilling of wells but extend also to the spacing of wells, the prevention of waste of oil and gas resources, the rate of production, prevention and clean-up of pollution and other matters. 

Environmental Matters and Regulation 

General. The operations of the underlying properties are subject to stringent and complex federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may impose significant obligations on VOC Brazos' operations, including requirements to, among other things: 

&#149; obtain permits to conduct regulated activities; &#149; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in the performance of drilling and production activities; &#149; limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; &#149; initiate remedial activities or corrective actions to mitigate pollution from former or current operations, such as restoration of drilling pits and plugging of abandoned wells; &#149; apply specific health and safety criteria addressing workover protection; and &#149; impose substantial liabilities on VOC Brazos for pollution resulting from VOC Brazos' operations. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of VOC Brazos' operations. Moreover, these laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. VOC Brazos believes that it is in substantial compliance with all existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to its current operations and that its continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the cash distributions to the trust unitholders. However, the clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly emission or discharge limits or waste handling, disposal or remediation obligations could have a material adverse effect on VOC Brazos' development expenditures, results of operations and financial position. VOC Brazos may be unable to pass on those increases to its customers. 

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, each as amended from time to time, to which VOC Brazos' business operations are subject: 

Hazardous substance and wastes. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or "CERCLA," also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. Under CERCLA, these "responsible persons" may include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and entities that transport or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. These responsible persons may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or "EPA," and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third- parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage 

allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. VOC Brazos generates materials in the course of its operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or "RCRA," and comparable state laws regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, production and development of crude oil or natural gas are currently exempt from regulations as hazardous wastes under RCRA. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. In September 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a petition with the EPA asking them to reconsider the RCRA exemption for exploration, production, and development wastes. To date, the EPA has not taken any action on the petition. Any change in the RCRA exemption for such wastes could result in an increase in the costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the cash distributions to the trust unitholders. In addition, VOC Brazos generates industrial wastes in the ordinary course of its operations that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. 

The real properties upon which VOC Brazos conducts its operations have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years. Although VOC Brazos may have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the real properties upon which VOC Brazos conducts its operations, or on or under other, offsite locations, where these petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for recycling or disposal. In addition, the real properties upon which VOC Brazos conducts its operations may have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons was not under VOC Brazos' control. These real properties and the petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes disposed or released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, VOC Brazos could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to clean up contaminated property, and to perform remedial operations such as restoration of pits and plugging of abandoned wells to prevent future contamination. 

Water discharges and hydraulic fracturing. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the "Clean Water Act," and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by EPA or an analogous state agency. Any unpermitted discharge of pollutants could result in penalties and significant remedial obligations. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. 

It is customary to recover oil and natural gas from deep shale and tight sand formations through the use of hydraulic fracturing, combined with sophisticated horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemical additives under pressure into rock formations to stimulate gas production. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Underground Injection Control provisions of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act to exclude certain hydraulic fracturing activities from the definition of "underground injection." At present, hydraulic fracturing is regulated at the state and local level. Due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality, legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal, state and local level and in some states have been initiated to require or make more stringent the permitting and compliance requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations. Repeal of the exemption would allow the EPA to promulgate new regulations. Many states have adopted rules that required operators to disclose chemicals and water volumes associated with hydraulic fracturing. In addition, the EPA has commenced 

a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, and issued a draft report for peer review and comment in June 2015. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could make it more difficult or costly for VOC Brazos to perform hydraulic fracturing activities. Moreover, required disclosure without protection for trade secret or proprietary products could discourage service companies from using such products and as a result impact the degree to which some oil and gas wells may be efficiently and economically completed or brought into production. Finally, VOC Brazos believes that enactment of legislation regulating hydraulic fracturing at the federal level may have a material adverse effect on its business. 

Air emissions. The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources through air emissions permitting programs and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. The EPA has recently proposed rules that define the terms used to determine whether a source is considered to be a major souce under the Clean Air Act. These laws and regulations may require VOC Brazos to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significant increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or incur development expenditures to install and utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Federal and state regulatory agencies may impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. 

Climate change. In response to certain scientific studies suggesting that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, or "GHGs," and including carbon dioxide and methane, are contributing to the warming of the Earth's atmosphere and other climatic conditions, both houses of Congress have actively considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. These allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time. Although it is not possible at this time to predict when Congress may pass climate change legislation, any future federal or state laws that may be adopted to address GHG emissions could require VOC Brazos to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas VOC Brazos produces. 

The EPA has adopted various regulations under the federal Clean Air Act addressing emissions of GHGs. In November 2010, the EPA published its final regulations expanding the existing GHG monitoring and reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. Reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis, with reporting beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In addition, EPA has taken the position that existing Clean Air Act provisions require an assessment of GHGs for certain large new or modified stationary sources beginning in 2011. EPA has issued rules that require additional reductions of volatile organic compounds, hazardous air pollutants and methane and has recently announced plans to issue additional rules which target methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. The adoption of any regulations that requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise limits emissions of GHGs from the equipment and operations of VOC Brazos could require VOC Brazos to incur costs to monitor and report on GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with its operations, and such requirements also could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that VOC Brazos produces. 

Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical 

effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, drought and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas produced by VOC Brazos or otherwise cause VOC Brazos to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects. 

Endangered Species Act. The federal Endangered Species Act, or "ESA," restricts activities that may affect endangered and threatened species or their habitats. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause VOC Brazos to incur additional costs or become subject to operating delays, restrictions or bans in the affected areas. While some of VOC Brazos' facilities or leased acreage may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, VOC Brazos believes that it is in substantial compliance with the ESA. 

Employee health and safety. The operations of VOC Brazos are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or "OSHA," and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. VOC Brazos believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
