ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS 

&#160;

FairWind Energy was incorporated on April 18, 2013. Through its proprietary use of materials and manufacturing technique, FairWind Energy is developing power sources drawing from renewable energy supply. We also use our trade secrets and composite industry know-how to cross-market products into the oil &#38; gas extraction industry. Providing a reliable power source based on renewable energies required us to address shortcomings of existing technologies ranging from availability of supply ( e .g., solar power at night) to quality of componentry available (blades, stanchions, magnets). The hybridization of power sources (solar and wind) and manufacturing with next generation composite materials is our solution. Our fiscal year end is August 31, and we have no subsidiaries. Our business offices are currently located at 32932 Pacific Coast Highway, #14-254, Dana Point, California 92629. 

&#160;

We had revenues of $43,143 and $28,375 for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Such revenues were primarily from consulting services, but also nominal materials sales. At August 31, 2016, our total current assets were $619, consisting solely of cash, and our total current liabilities were $3,689. Our net loss for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016 was $295,637.

OVERVIEW 

&#160;

Through proprietary use of materials and manufacturing technique, FairWind Energy is developing power sources drawing from renewable energy supply. We also use trade secrets and composite industry know-how to cross-market products into the oil &#38; gas extraction industry.

&#160;

We are a development stage corporation and have not yet generated or realized any revenues from our business. We are involved in the design, engineering and manufacturing of composite products. The initial thrust of our business will be to supply products to the oil and gas industry. These products will include upstream production products such as sucker rods, fracking plugs, casings and other products where high temperature resistance, chemical resistance and a low weight to strength ratio products offer advantages to traditional materials ( e.g. , steel). If we are able to supply products to the oil and gas industry, then we plan to continue the development and sales of wind and solar hybrid energy systems. These systems also benefit from the use of higher performance materials (composites) and we will intend to incorporate them in product design and development.

&#160;

Providing a reliable power source based on renewable energies required us to address shortcomings of existing technologies ranging from availability of supply ( i.e. , solar at night) to quality of componentry available (blades, stanchions, magnets). The hybridization of power sources (solar and wind) and manufacturing with next generation composite materials was the obvious solution.

&#160;

From years of experience in the composite industry, our principals have refined the use of toughened resin systems ideal for the manufacture of structural and exposed components. An example would be the turbine blade. A leading cause of failure in wind turbines is the damage caused to the blades (even atop 100 meter towers) from blowing debris and rocks. We use toughened resin systems and reinforcements to eliminate this problem. The stanchion that supports the turbine and solar panels is typically galvanized steel. Again, using composites materials, our composite pole is stronger, lighter and non-conductive. Equally important, the composite needs no galvanization to protect against corrosion, eliminating hazardous waste products spent to the land, water and air.

&#160;

A by-product of the use of toughened high-strength composites was the development of high-tensile products for infrastructure. Our composite products can prove good alternatives to steel and lower strength fiberglass/resin parts used in down-well drilling and pumping. An investment in superior materials and manufacturing technology allows for cross-marketing of these energy related products and from a business strategy perspective provides some security against fluctuating markets or reliance on single product lines.

&#160;

The importance of the use of high quality material in the construction of composite parts cannot be overstated. Of equal importance (with respect to wind power) is the quality and design of the generator itself. Currently China supplies 95% of rare earth magnets &#8211; the key component of turbine generators. We have already established relationships and have tested generator prototypes of high quality from China. We are positioned to benefit from superior supply lines of essential materials almost exclusively available offshore. This supply challenge is now a Company asset.

&#160;

Our offices are located at 32932 Pacific Coast Highway, #14-254, Dana Point, California 92629.

&#160;

Joint Venture in China 

&#160;

On October 26, 2013, we entered into a Joint Venture Contract for Sino-Foreign Composites Company with Xingcheng Haibao Advanced Materials Industrial Park Co., Ltd., a Chinese entity. During the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, we sold our interest in the joint venture for $3,205 because joint venture was inactive and we did not expect any operations from the joint venture in the future.

&#160;

Potential Customers 

&#160;

While the opportunity for our products is global in scope, the main initial thrust of the company will be towards sales in North America. Several reasons exist for this strategy.

&#160;

We believe that of paramount importance is the manufacture and delivery of quality products in a consistent and businesslike manner. We will have management in place domestically to insure an efficient business model. Additionally, the primary designs and specifications for the turbine/solar power generation will come domestically from us. With regards to high tensile products for infrastructure, the design, chemistry and raw materials all have R&#38;D history in the U.S. And with burgeoning opportunities existing for prototyping, field trials, testing and sales to domestic energy companies (i.e., oil &#38; gas) the initial focus will be to North American customers.

&#160;

For wind and solar power generation, the likely end users are the biggest promoters of green energy &#8211; the government. Obvious choices include municipalities, transit authorities and other government agencies. Private construction projects seeking LEED Certification (Leadership in Energy &#38; Environmental Design) are also likely targets. The benefits of solar/wind powered LED (light emitting diodes) lights are beyond media green energy hype. The benefits to being off-grid include hundreds of dollars per light due to elimination of trenching, wiring and purchased electricity cost. Off-grid eliminates landscaping issues and the LED lights further save in yearly maintenance. Finally, and something surely government entities can understand, this green energy often qualifies for rebates and subsidies.

&#160;

The requirement for toughened resin systems and high strength parts for wind &#38; solar systems has uncovered extraordinary potential in US energy markets. Specifically, the high strength reinforcements combined with high temperature / high shear resin for use in oil and gas extraction is a tremendous opportunity. New technology in this industry has allowed for discovery of new and large fields of gas and oil. Much of these energy finds require deeper more sophisticated drilling and pumping and that is precisely where these new high temperature resistance, high strength and chemical resistant composites perform best (superior to existing technology).

&#160;

Hydraulic fracturing (fracking), which is a method of extraction that is not new, but is now pressing pumpers to extreme limits, is a technology that is in search of higher performing tooling and equipment. We believe that we could be well positioned to deal with the current and future high growth rates forecast for this high margin domestic industry. Forbes Magazine reports (Schlumberger Fattens Margins With Enhanced Fracking Technology &#8211; 09/26/2012) that the company is counting on new technology to drive growth &#8211; fracking capacity grew last year at 42% and is forecast to rise again by 28% this year.

&#160;

We believe that we are in a unique position to make use of its know-how in composites to bring to market sought after high-technology composite products for oil &#38; gas extraction and to service wind &#38; solar power generation products.

&#160;

Our Operations 

&#160;

We are an early stage company developing composite products for use in industries that require higher material properties than might be had from typical composite parts. Additionally, we are designing a small scale hybrid power source for low energy use.

&#160;

In a priority project, we are currently near developmental completion of a high strength, high Tg (high temperature use) composite designed and intended to be used in the oil &#38; gas industry. Intended for use in the exploration and production sector, we have manufactured nearly 5,000 feet of &#8220;sucker rod&#8221; used to be use in connection with the extraction of oil and gas from underground. The employed design uses proprietary resin systems that exceed typical temperature use limits of competing thermosetting systems. Additionally, utilizing higher tensile strength reinforcements, our parts can achieve higher operating loads, allowing for superior performance. New designs for mechanical joints in the rod string have also been completed. Significant testing has been completed on the final design (and will be continuing). We believe that the testing marks we have achieved to date are a result of the high performance materials and architecture of the product.

&#160; &#160; 5 

&#160;

Our intended business operations will be to make use of our proprietary resin systems and unique composite architecture and apply that to other areas. With proof of concept via physical and field trial testing in hand, we will proceed to apply the proven benefits (see above) in other infrastructure projects. Two examples that are currently in the examination stage, include pultruded power poles suitable for supporting high voltage electrical transmission lines. Another early stage endeavor is second generation composite strength members for cable and conductor. As a replacement to more typical construction materials(e.g., steel, aluminum, concrete and even lower performing FRP) &#8211; we believe that our composite parts mix the benefits of strength, weight, corrosion resistance, non-conductivity and high temperature operation.

&#160;

Another project in current development is a hybrid power generating system, incorporating both solar and wind power. Initially, we have purchased wind turbines and are in the process of combining them with solar panels. The first planned demonstration project will be to power street/parking lot lighting. The potential to independently operate off battery stored power, or to back-feed into the grid is possible. After vetting the POC prototypes, we intend to combine already-established supply chain lines for componentry with in-house manufactured composite elements ( e.g. , see power poles above). This hybrid power project gives us some business diversity, as well as a secondary market for our composite metrics.

&#160;

A streamlined operation will initially support R&#38;D and final development of both product lines (hybrid solar/wind power generation products &#38; oil and gas pumping products and tooling). It is anticipated a facility of less than 10,000 SF for initial years&#8217; development, production and assembly will adequately suffice. Composite blade prototyping and production and then assembly with imported generators and solar panels would occupy approximately 4,000 SF of space. The method of manufacturing high strength lineal strength members (sucker rods and down-well tubes) is referred to as &#8220;pultrusion&#8221;. This automated continuous process requires relatively little manpower, produces little waste and is considered the most efficient process in composite manufacturing. The initial machinery requirement would occupy a similar 4,000 SF. Within 2 years and upon completion of prototyping and early sales of both product lines, it will be our goal to expand domestically, as well as to consider foreign markets and lower cost manufacturing sites.

&#160;

Marketing and Sales 

&#160;

We believe that consumer interest in green energy continues to grow. Finding viable uses that make sense on a sustainable business model will be a priority for FairWind Energy. Final development of hybrid wind/solar power supply will show a feasible low-cost, no direct subsidy product that can be taken to the consumer and light industrial market. &#8220;Becoming known&#8221; will be the marketing challenge. And to take this on will call for an aggressive presence at trade shows, well designed internet visibility and frequent participation in field trials. Equally important will be cultivating industry alliances and leveraging existing relationships.

&#160;

The prove out for success in the oil and gas industry will be a combination of successful testing (lab and field trial) and strategically aligning with current successful and industry known operations. More focus on developing alliances and strategic partners will be the theme for growing the business. And more typical trade show, internet and media placement will also be utilized.

&#160;

COMPETITION AND COMPETITIVE STRATEGY 

&#160;

Certainly competition exists in the market place for our product lines. The difference in our thrust will be that our products are technology driven and materially improved over earlier generation alternatives.

&#160;

In the case of wind/solar lighting products, no domestic product has the established tie-in to direct sources of rare-earth magnets and quality low cost generators. The advanced blade design and high-tech material use will set the company apart from lesser quality poor designs. The package of low cost components / high-tech material and superior design is the bat to beat the competition with.

&#160;

Specifically for down-hole pump products, such as, sucker rods, tubing, and fracking balls, we will have a strength, cost and survivability advantage over steel and first generation composite products. The depths that pumping equipment go to now almost preclude the use of steel (it does not have the strength to support its weight at these super long lengths). Capturing market share based on a superior product is the focus, but the capacity constraints of suppliers to the pumpers will enhance our position to a quicker entry and a larger presence.
