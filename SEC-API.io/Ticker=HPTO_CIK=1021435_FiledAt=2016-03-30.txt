 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Introduction 

&#160; 

We are developers of software productivity products for mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones, and application publishing software solutions. Our newest product line, which is called hopTo, was originally marketed to consumers and is now also marketed to small and medium sized businesses and enterprise level customers under the name hopTo Work, which is now our primary focus in the hopTo product line. 

&#160; 

hopTo provides mobile end-users with a productivity workspace for their mobile devices that allows them to manage, share, view, and edit their documents, regardless of where they are stored. We launched the first commercial version of hopTo through Apple&#8217;s App Store on November 14, 2013. This version was targeted at Apple&#8217;s tablet devices, the iPad and the iPad Mini. From the initial launch through 2015, we made hopTo available for free. 

&#160; 

On November 10, 2014, we launched the first version of hopTo Work, a version of the hopTo workspace made available to businesses for a fee. hopTo Work expands upon the core capabilities of hopTo by providing mobile access to applications that businesses rely on for their daily operations. 

&#160; 

During 2015, we announced several major enhancements to hopTo Work, including the introduction of the MAX (Mobile App eXperience) feature set, which allows customers to instantly transform their legacy applications to become touch friendly on modern mobile devices. We also worked to integrate our hopTo Work product with certain software products offered by Citrix Systems and on November 12, 2015 we launched hopTo Work for Citrix through Apple&#8217;s App Store. 

&#160; 

Over the years, we have also made significant investments in intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;). We have filed many patents designed to protect the new technologies embedded in hopTo, and we plan to continue to aggressively invest in the creation and protection of new IP as we continue to develop hopTo and other products. 

&#160; 

Recent Developments 

&#160; 

On January 27, 2016, we filed an amendment of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of our common stock (the &#8220;Reverse Stock Split&#8221;). The Reverse Stock Split became effective in the stock market upon commencement of trading on January 28, 2016. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every fifteen shares of our pre-Reverse Stock Split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and cash paid to stockholders for potential fractional shares was insignificant. The number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding options, restricted stock units, warrants and convertible securities were also reduced by a factor of fifteen as of January 27, 2016. All historical share and per share amounts reflected throughout this report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The authorized number of shares and the par value per share of our common stock were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. 

&#160; 

On January 13, 2016, we announced Project Mobilis, our development project to provide a deep integration with Citrix&#174; mobile end-user technologies to deliver hopTo&#8217;s MAX features in conjunction with the complete capabilities of Citrix XenApp&#174; and HDX&#8482;. 

&#160; 

On January 11, 2016, we announced the development of MAX-IE, the first native mobile app experience for Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer&#174;. This exciting breakthrough capability will allow enterprises to instantly mobilize and provide a native mobile experience for Internet Explorer&#174; based web applications, including applications that employ Java, Adobe Flash, or Silverlight technologies. 

&#160;

&#160; 

The hopTo Opportunity 

&#160; 

The adoption of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, in the workplace has revealed the need for a mobile application and content access platform that addresses a range of mobile productivity challenges for professional/consumer users (&#8220;prosumers&#8221;), small and home offices (&#8220;SOHO&#8221;), small- to medium-sized businesses (&#8220;SMB&#8221; or &#8220;SMBs&#8221;), and Enterprise organizations. We believe a mobile platform that addresses this need will become a critical asset for any size organization, or information technology (&#8220;IT&#8221;) department, offering the most productive end user experience. 

&#160; 

Focusing more specifically on the larger SMB/Enterprise business markets, adoption of mobile devices is reshaping how organizations deliver, secure, and manage applications and content on these devices. This has also introduced challenges for organizations to integrate the devices into daily workflows and manage security on both company-owned and employee-owned devices. 

&#160; 

From a workflow standpoint, we believe business users want mobile solutions that enable them to replace or extend their traditional desktop PC environment with mobile devices, which is often easier said than done. PC users have enjoyed a rich ecosystem of applications and technologies that has been growing for over 30 years, and have come to expect an exceptional level of power and flexibility to get their work done. Many solutions have been developed to meet this challenge but generally have failed, in particular for the iOS and Android devices that dominate both the consumer and business markets. 

&#160; 

The hopTo Work Product 

&#160; 

In March, 2014, we announced our hopTo Work product which was subsequently released on November 11, 2014. hopTo Work builds upon the hopTo consumer product, bringing its core mobile productivity features to SMB/Enterprise users, with additional security and manageability functions. It targets IT departments that are concerned with protecting and managing access to sensitive data, controlling access to business applications, compliance with internal policies and, in some cases, government regulations. 

&#160; 

With hopTo Work, IT departments will be able to more easily and safely address these concerns while integrating mobile technology into their networks and user workflows. The initial version of hopTo Work leverages a customer&#8217;s existing Microsoft RDS infrastructure &#8211; a significant portion of Microsoft&#8217;s on-premise customer base &#8211; which enables an IT department to have mobile access for end users in minutes. Subsequent versions of hopTo Work are integrated to leverage a customer&#8217;s existing Citrix Systems infrastructure, which represents a significant percentage of the Enterprise market for our product. 

&#160; 

hopTo Work allows business users to make a smooth and simple transition from PCs to mobile devices for all or part of their work. As with the original prosumer/SOHO version of hopTo, the premise of hopTo Work is that mobile users in SMB/Enterprise businesses using devices such as the Apple iPad would like to travel with just their tablets but still have the benefits of secure access and editing capabilities for documents in their corporate cloud or network storage, personal cloud storage, and on their Windows computers. In addition, hopTo Work delivers the capability to mobilize Windows applications that businesses and organizations rely on for their daily operation. 

&#160; 

hopTo Work is designed not only to assist users in performing operations on their iPads that typically require a Mac or Windows PC, but to do so within the data protection and access control policies of their IT organizations. Our view is that current solutions are limited because of the need to install special applications and procedures that are a hindrance to user productivity. We address these issues with the following features: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The ability to access and manage all of the user&#8217;s files and documents, no matter where they are stored. This includes enterprise document management systems, enterprise-class network servers and cloud storage services, or the user&#8217;s PC. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The ability to view, create, edit, manage, and share files through a native touch-screen mobile device interface rather than apps designed for legacy PC desktops with keyboards and mice. &#160; 

&#160; 4 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; The ability to access Windows applications and use them in a touch-friendly manner consistent with end user expectations for mobile devices. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The ability to access web applications based on Microsoft Internet Explorer and the additional technologies incorporated into those apps such as Java, Flash, ActiveX, and Microsoft Silverlight, all of which are not readily operable from iOS or Android based devices. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The ability to multitask, which means working with multiple documents and applications at the same time, side-by-side. The iPad is inherently a single document environment, which we believe is a major shortcoming for most users. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The ability to view, create, and edit Microsoft Office documents that are 100% compatible with Microsoft Office, thus allowing users to collaborate with other users who are using Microsoft Office on a Mac or a Windows PC. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The ability to address the problems of document sprawl, giving users easy access to manage, search, and browse the data they need across storage devices and cloud services, but without allowing sensitive documents to leave the corporate network undetected. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The ability for IT departments to implement a &#8220;bring-your-own-device&#8221; (BYOD) solution that integrates mobile device use into daily workflows and enhances user productivity without compromising security, requiring additional server infrastructure, or putting an additional burden on the user experience. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; The ability for IT departments to grant and revoke access to anyone for any data anywhere. Employees must have the ability to access corporate internal data (documents, file and applications) efficiently but without jeopardizing security. &#160; 

hopTo Work Target Markets 

&#160; 

We view hopTo Work, with its additional application mobilization, security and manageability features, as a product that appeals to the SMB and Enterprise markets. We expect sales strategies for the hopTo Work versions of the product to involve a combination of strategic partnerships with various relevant enterprise software companies, a sales partner channel, and a direct sales team, just to name a few. hopTo Work is a paid offering that is currently sold on a perpetual license plus maintenance model. Other models such as subscription based pricing might be made available in the future based on market requirements. 

&#160; 

The hopTo Consumer Product 

&#160; 

hopTo also offers a comprehensive productivity workspace for mobile devices (currently for the Apple iPad) that empowers mobile users by offering them functionalities similar to what they&#8217;ve come to expect from their PCs. For example, hopTo aggregates files and documents from multiple storage silos (such as Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, or the user&#8217;s PC) into a single touch-friendly workspace. Within this workspace, users are able to search for documents in the workspace (which includes their cloud storage silos and their PC), view, edit, and share their documents, and import photos from their iPad camera roll or Google Image from Web. 

&#160; 

hopTo provides powerful document editing capabilities that leverage legacy Windows applications, such as Microsoft Office, to give users a rich, native editing feature set. Its high degree of compatibility with Microsoft Office enables easy collaboration with other users running Microsoft Office on Mac or Windows PCs. hopTo is unique in that it both leverages legacy applications for document editing and provides a touch-friendly user experience that, in our view, none of our competitors have achieved, and which mobile users will view as highly desirable. 

&#160; 

The first commercially available version of hopTo was released on November 14, 2013, through the Apple App Store. hopTo currently runs on the Apple iPad family of devices, and we may make it available for other devices, such as the Apple iPhone and devices based on the Google Android platform. This product is targeted at users who are transitioning from PC to mobile&#8212;to provide access to their content regardless of where it&#8217;s stored, along with rich document editing capabilities, multitasking, file management, and more. The hopTo product is currently offered free of charge. Based on usage patterns and market acceptance we may, at some point in the future, decide to charge fees for this offering.

&#160; 

Our Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We believe that IP is a business tool that potentially maximizes our competitive advantages and product differentiation, grows revenue opportunities, encourages collaboration with key business partners, and protects our long-term growth opportunities. Strategic IP development is therefore a critical component of our overall business strategy. It is a business function that consistently interacts with our research and development, product development, and marketing initiatives to generate further value from those operations. 

&#160; 

We rely primarily on trade secret protection, copyright law, confidentiality, and proprietary information agreements to protect our proprietary technology and registered trademarks. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy portions of our products, or to obtain information we regard as proprietary. The loss of any material trade secret, trademark, trade name or copyright could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We intend to defend our proprietary technology rights; however, we cannot give any assurance that our efforts to protect our proprietary technology rights will be successful. 

&#160; 

We also currently hold rights to patents. We regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research, development and design, and are currently pursuing additional patent applications. 

&#160; 

We do not believe our products infringe on the rights of any third parties, but we can give no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future, or that any such assertion will not result in costly litigation or require us to obtain a license to proprietary technology rights of such parties. 

&#160; 

ipCapital Group, Inc. 

&#160; 

On October 11, 2011, we engaged ipCapital Group, Inc. (&#8220;ipCapital&#8221;), an affiliate of John Cronin, who is one of our directors, to assist us in the execution of our strategic decision to significantly strengthen, grow and commercially exploit our intellectual property assets. Our engagement agreement with ipCapital, which has been amended three times, affords us the right to request ipCapital to perform a number of diverse services, employing its proprietary processes and methodologies, to facilitate our ability to identify and extract from our current intellectual property base new inventions, potential patent applications, and marketing and licensing opportunities. See the Exhibits referred to in Item 15 in this Form 10-K for further details on the ipCapital engagement agreement and amendments thereto. 

&#160; 

In addition to the fees we agreed to pay ipCapital for its services, we issued ipCapital a five-year warrant to purchase up to 26,667 shares of our common stock at an initial price of $3.90 per share. Half of the warrant (13,333 shares) has a time-based vesting condition, with such vesting to occur in three equal annual installments. The vesting installments occurred on October 11, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. The remaining 13,333 shares became fully vested upon the completion to our satisfaction of all services that we requested from ipCapital under the engagement agreement, prior to the signing of the amendments. Such performance was deemed satisfactory during 2012. We believe that these fees, together with the issuance of the warrant, constitute no greater compensation than we would be required to pay an unaffiliated person for substantially similar services. 

&#160; 

As a result of ipCapital&#8217;s work under the engagement agreement, as amended, as of March 30, 2016, 173 new patent applications have been filed. Of these 173 applications, 37 patents have been granted by the USPTO. We have also received notice from the USPTO that 8 additional patent applications have been allowed and will ultimately issue as US patents in the next 60-90 days. We expect to file more applications in 2016. 

&#160; 

ipCapital Licensing Company I, LLC 

&#160; 

On February 4, 2013, we entered into an IP Brokerage agreement with ipCapital Licensing Company I, LLC (&#8220;ipCLC&#8221;) (the &#8220;IP Brokerage Agreement&#8221;). At the time that we entered into this agreement, John Cronin was a partner at ipCLC. He is no longer affiliated with ipCLC. Pursuant to the IP Brokerage Agreement, we have engaged ipCLC, on a no-retainer basis, to identify and present us with candidates who may be seeking to acquire a certain limited group of our patents unrelated to our current business strategy. If during the applicable term we enter into an agreement with any candidate presented by ipCLC to acquire or otherwise exploit the covered patents, we will pay ipCLC a fee of ten percent (10%) of the royalties, fees, and other consideration paid over the life of the agreement. 

&#160; 

The IP Brokerage Agreement is effective as of February 4, 2013, and will end 18 months after we or ipCLC serve 60 days written notice of termination to the other party (with earlier termination possible in the event of a material breach). To date, we have paid no fee to ipCLC under the terms of the IP Brokerage Agreement. 

&#160; 

The IP Brokerage Agreement provides for customary confidentiality undertakings, limitations on ipCLC&#8217;s total liability and mutual indemnification provisions. 

&#160; 

We believe the terms of the IP Brokerage Agreement are fair and reasonable to us and are at least as favorable as those that could be obtained on an arms&#8217; length basis.

&#160; 

The GO-Global Software Products 

&#160; 

Our GO-Global product offerings can be categorized into product families as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; GO-Global for Windows: Allows access to Windows-based applications from remote locations and a variety of connections, including the Internet and dial-up connections. The Windows applications run on a central computer server along with GO-Global Windows Host software. This allows the applications to be accessed remotely via GO-Global Client software, or a Web browser, over many types of data connections, regardless of the bandwidth or operating system. Web-enabling is achieved without modifying the underlying application&#8217;s code or requiring costly add-ons. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; GO-Global for UNIX: Allows access to UNIX and Linux-based applications from remote locations and a variety of connections, including the Internet and dial-up connections. The UNIX/Linux applications run on a central computer server along with the GO-Global for UNIX Host software. This allows the applications to be accessed and run remotely via GO-Global Client software or a Web browser without having to modify the application&#8217;s code or requiring costly add-ons. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; GO-Global Client: We offer a range of GO-Global Client software that allows remote application access from a wide variety of local, remote and mobile platforms, including Windows, Linux, UNIX, Apple OS X and iOS, and Google Android. We plan to continue to develop GO-Global Client software for new portable and mobile devices. &#160; 

Target Markets 

&#160; 

The target market for our GO-Global products includes small to medium-sized companies, departments within large corporations, governmental and educational institutions, independent software vendors (ISVs) and value-added resellers (VARs). Our software enables these targeted organizations to move their existing applications to the public cloud and provide SaaS, or move them to a secure, private cloud environment. By using our software, organizations can give their remote users, partners and customers access to their native applications. Our software is designed to allow these organizations and enterprises to tailor the configuration of the end-user device for a particular purpose, rather than following a &#8220;one PC fits all&#8221; high-cost ownership model. We believe our opportunities are as follows: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; ISVs . By Web-enabling their applications through use of our products, we believe that our ISV customers can accelerate their time to market without the risks and delays associated with rewriting applications or using other third-party software, thereby opening up additional revenue opportunities and securing greater satisfaction and loyalty from their customers. Our technology integrates with their existing software applications without sacrificing the full-featured look and feel of such applications, thereby providing ISVs with out-of-the-box Web-enabled applications with their own branding for licensed, volume distribution to their enterprise customers. We further believe that ISVs that effectively address the Web computing needs of customers and the emerging application service provider market will have a competitive advantage in the marketplace. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Enterprises Employing a Mix of UNIX, Linux, Macintosh and Windows . Small to medium-sized companies that utilize a mixed computing environment require cross-platform connectivity software, like GO-Global Host and/or GO-Global Gateway, which will allow users to access applications from different client devices. We believe that our server-based software products will significantly reduce the cost and complexity of connecting PCs to various applications. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; Enterprises with Remote Computer Users and/or Extended Markets . We believe that remote computer users and enterprises with extended markets comprise two of the faster growing market segments in the computing industry. Extended enterprises permit access to their computing resources by their customers, suppliers, distributors and other partners, thereby affording them manufacturing flexibility, increased speed-to-market, and enhanced customer satisfaction. For example, extended enterprises may maintain decreased inventory via just-in-time, vendor-managed inventory and related techniques, or they may license their proprietary software application on a &#8220;pay-per-use&#8221; model, based on actual time usage by the user. The early adoption of extended enterprise software may be driven in part by an organization&#8217;s need to exchange information over a wide variety of computing platforms. We believe that our server-based software products, along with our low-impact communications protocol, which has been designed to enable highly efficient low-bandwidth connections, are well positioned to provide extended enterprises with the necessary means to exchange information over a wide variety of computing platforms. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; VARs . The VAR channel presents an additional sales force for our products and services. In addition to creating broader awareness of our GO-Global products, VARs also provide integration and support services for our current and potential customers. Our products allow VARs to offer a cost-effective competitive alternative for server-based, or thin-client, computing. In addition, reselling our GO-Global products creates new revenue streams for our VARs. &#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

Strategic Customer Relationships 

&#160; 

We believe it is important to maintain our current strategic alliances and to seek suitable new alliances in order to enhance shareholder value, improve our technology and/or enhance our ability to penetrate relevant target markets. We also are focusing on strategic relationships that have immediate revenue generating potential, strengthen our position in the server-based software market, add complementary capabilities and/or raise awareness of our products and us. Our strategic relationships for all GO-Global products include the following: 

&#160; 

&#160; &#9679; We are party to a non-exclusive distribution agreement with KitASP, a Japanese application service provider founded by companies within Japan&#8217;s electronics and infrastructure industries, including NTT DATA, Mitsubishi Electric, Omron, RICS, Toyo Engineering and Hitachi. Pursuant to this agreement, which was entered into in September 2011, KitASP has licensed our GO-Global product line for inclusion in their software products, primarily their server-bundled application service provider software solution. Either party may terminate the contract upon 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We are party to a non-exclusive channel partner agreement with Elosoft Informatica Ltda, a South American distributor of various technology products, including both hardware and software offerings, and related services. Under the terms of this agreement, Elosoft has licensed both our GO-Global Windows Host and GO-Global for UNIX software for deployment to their distribution network with both sub-distributors and end-users. Our agreement with Elosoft, which was originally entered into in February 2005, automatically renews annually. Either party may terminate the agreement upon 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We are party to a non-exclusive global purchasing agreement with Alcatel-Lucent, a telecommunications, network systems and services company. Pursuant to this relationship, which started in July 1999, Alcatel-Lucent has licensed our GO-Global for UNIX software for inclusion with their software products. Many of Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s customers are using our server-based software to remote access Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s Network Management Systems (&#8220;NMS&#8221;) applications. Our current agreement with Alcatel-Lucent expired in December 2012. Since December 2012 we have mutually agreed with Alcatel-Lucent to renew this contract each year for additional one-year with terms consistent with those set forth in the expired contract. The current renewal period expires in December 2016. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; We are party to a non-exclusive distribution agreement with GE Intelligent Platforms (&#8220;GE&#8221;), a U.S. based designer, manufacturer, and supplier of products for industrial control and automation. GE has licensed our GO-Global product line for inclusion in their automation and production management software products. Our agreement with GE, which was originally entered into in December 2002, automatically renews annually. Either party may terminate the contract upon 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party. &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; In August 2011 we entered into an agreement with GAD eG (&#8220;GAD&#8221;), a Germany based provider of information technology, software development and data processing solutions for retail banks. GAD licensed our GO-Global for Windows software and embedded it in their banking applications. This agreement covered a one-time transaction of theirs with a large German bank. The installation of their software application generated significant product license sales for us in 2011 and 2012. We expect to have maintenance sales in future years; however we do not expect to have future product licensing sales to GAD comparable to the 2012 and 2011 levels. 

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#9679; In January 2010, we entered into a non-exclusive reseller and distribution agreement with Information Delivery Systems, LLC (IDS), a U.S. based publisher and hosting solutions provider for churches and educational institutions. IDS has licensed our GO-Global for Windows software and has utilized it as the hosting engine for its cloud-based solutions. Our agreement with IDS automatically renews annually. Either party may terminate the contract upon 60 days&#8217; written notice to the other party. &#160;

&#160; 

Sales, Marketing and Support 

&#160; 

Sales and marketing efforts for our software products are directed at increasing product awareness and demand among ISVs, small to medium-sized enterprises, departments within larger corporations and VARs who have a vertical orientation or are focused on Windows, UNIX and/or Linux environments. Current marketing activities include Internet marketing, direct response, targeted advertising campaigns, tradeshows, promotional materials, public relations, and maintaining an active Web presence for marketing and sales purposes. 

&#160; 

We currently consider the following to be our most significant customers and partners. For the purposes of this table, &#8220;Sales&#8221; refers to the dollar value of orders received from these customers and partners in the period indicated. These Sales values do not necessarily equal recognized revenue for these periods due to our revenue recognition policies which require deferral of revenue associated with stocking orders of software licenses and prepaid software service fees.

&#160; &#160; 2015 &#160; &#160; 2014 &#160; Customer &#160; % Sales &#160; &#160; % Sales &#160; Centric System &#160; &#160; 5.0 % &#160; &#160; 4.3 % GE &#160; &#160; 2.0 % &#160; &#160; 30.2 % IDS LLC &#160; &#160; 5.8 % &#160; &#160; 4.2 % Uniface &#160; &#160; 5.3 % &#160; &#160; 2.0 % Elosoft &#160; &#160; 10.9 % &#160; &#160; 5.7 % Total &#160; &#160; 29.0 % &#160; &#160; 46.4 % &#160; 

Many of our customers enter into, and periodically renew, maintenance contracts to ensure continued product updates and support. Currently, we offer maintenance contracts for one, two, three and five-year periods. 

&#160; 

Operations 

&#160; 

We perform all purchasing, order processing and shipping of products and accounting functions related to our operations. Although we generally ship products electronically, when a customer requires us to physically ship them a disc, production of the disc, printing of documentation and packaging are also accomplished through in-house means; however, since virtually all of our orders are currently being fulfilled electronically, we do not maintain any prepackaged inventory. Additionally, we have relatively little backlog at any given time; thus, we do not consider backlog a significant indicator of future performance. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Our research and development efforts currently are focused on further enhancing the functionality, performance and reliability of existing products and developing new products &#8211; principally hopTo. We invested approximately $4,224,000 and $4,911,400 in research and development with respect to our software products in 2015 and 2014, respectively. During 2015 and 2014 we capitalized an additional $12,000 and $16,500 of development investments incurred in the development of hopTo, respectively. During 2015, we determined that an impairment of $182,400 existed with certain capitalized software development costs associated with our hopTo consumer product and recognized that cost as part of cost of revenue.

Competition 

&#160; 

The software markets in which we participate are highly competitive. Competitive factors in our market space include price, product quality, functionality, product differentiation and the breadth and variety of product offerings and product features. We believe that our products offer certain advantages over our competitors, particularly in product performance and market positioning. 

&#160; 

Although hopTo Work is a unique mobile workspace offering, we believe it is at the intersection of an established software market known as end-user computing (EUC) and more specifically a fairly new category that&#8217;s becoming known as application mobilization, or application refactoring. 

&#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

In the application mobilization market, we believe we compete with products from Capriza, Inc., Reddo Mobility, Inc., StarMobile Inc and Powwow, Inc, as well several other providers. 

&#160; 

GO-Global competes with developers of conventional server-based software for the individual PC, as well as with other companies in the cloud computing software market and the application virtualization software market. We believe our principal competitors in the cloud computing software market include Citrix Systems, Inc., OpenText Communications, Ltd. and Microsoft Corporation. Citrix is an established leading vendor of virtualization software, OpenText is an established market leader for remote access to UNIX applications and Microsoft is an established leading vendor of Windows operating systems and services for servers.

Employees 

&#160; 

As of March 30, 2016, we had a full-time equivalent of 26 total employees, including 5 in marketing, sales and support, 15.5 in research and development (which is inclusive of employees who may also perform customer service related activities), 5 in administration and finance and 0.5 in our patent group. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
