Who We Are 

Steel Partners Holdings L.P. ("SPLP" or the "Company") is a global diversified holding company that engages in multiple businesses through consolidated subsidiaries, associated companies and other interests. It owns and operates businesses, and has significant investments in companies, in various industries, including diversified industrial products, energy, defense, supply chain management and logistics, banking, and youth sports. 

Each of our companies has its own management team with significant experience in their industries. Our subsidiary, SP Corporate Services LLC (&#8220;SP Corporate&#8221;), through Management Services Agreements, provides services to us and some of our companies which include assignment of C-Level management personnel, as well as a variety of services including legal, tax, accounting, treasury, consulting, auditing, administrative, compliance, environmental health and safety, human resources, marketing, investor relations and other similar services. 

We work with our businesses to increase corporate value over the long term for all stakeholders by implementing our unique strategy discussed in more detail below. 

Our History 

Steel Partners, a private investment firm, was founded in February 1990 by Warren G. Lichtenstein. In December 2008, in order to preserve an investment strategy that successfully served the investment firm and its investors since inception, Steel Partners restructured its business. The result was the creation of SPLP, a limited partnership formed in the State of Delaware on December 16, 2008. 

On April 10, 2012, after fulfilling stringent regulatory and financial reporting requirements, the company became listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: SPLP). 

Our Structure 

SPLP is managed by SP General Services LLC (the &#8220;Manager&#8221;), pursuant to the terms of an amended and restated management agreement (the &#8220;Management Agreement&#8221;) discussed in further detail in Note 13 &#8211; "Related Party Transactions" to the SPLP consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. From its founding in 1990, the Manager and its affiliates have focused on increasing value for investors in the entities it has managed, including SPLP and SPII. 

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Steel Partners Holdings GP Inc., formerly known as Web LLC and Steel Partners Holdings GP LLC (the &#8220;General Partner&#8221;), is our general partner. The General Partner converted from a limited liability company to a corporation on September 21, 2010. The General Partner has a board of directors (the &#8220;Board of Directors&#8221;). The Board of Directors is currently comprised of seven members, five of whom are elected annually by our unitholders and two of 

whom are appointed by the Manager. Warren G. Lichtenstein, the Executive Chairman of our Manager, serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

Our Strategy 

We continuously evaluate the retention and disposition of existing operations and investigate possible acquisitions of new businesses, often focusing on businesses that are selling substantially below intrinsic value. We consider possible synergies and economies of scale in operating and/or making determinations to acquire or dispose of companies. We seek additional means to reduce costs and to encourage integration of operations and the building of business relationships among our companies consistent with our desire that our unitholders benefit from the diversified holding company structure. 

We strive to enhance the business operations of our companies and increase long-term value for unitholders and stakeholders through balance sheet improvements, strategic allocation of capital and operational and growth initiatives. We use a set of tools and processes called the Steel Business System &#32;to drive operational and sales efficiencies across each of our business units. The &#32;Steel Business System &#32;is designed to drive strategy deployment and sales and marketing based on lean principles. Our operational initiatives include creating efficiencies through consolidated purchasing and materials sourcing provided by the Steel Partners Purchasing Council, which arranges shared purchasing programs and is reducing costs for, and providing other benefits to, a number of our companies. We strive to reduce our companies' operational costs, and enhance growth and profitability, through the implementation of Steel Partners Operational Excellence Programs , which include the deployment of Lean Manufacturing, Design for Six Sigma, Six Sigma and Strategy Deployment. We are focused on reducing corporate overhead of our companies by centralizing certain administrative and corporate services through Steel Partners Corporate Services that provides management, consulting and advisory services. 

Generally, we seek to actively acquire and maintain control over our companies through our ability to influence their policies. Depending on the size of our ownership interests in any given company, this may be achieved by obtaining board representation and overseeing and providing assistance to the existing management team. We generally view our companies as long-term holdings and we expect to realize value by operating them with a view towards fostering growth and maximizing their value rather than through the sale of ownership interests. The securities of some of the companies in which we have interests are traded on national securities exchanges, while others are privately held or not actively traded.

Description of Our Businesses 

Diversified Industrial Segment 

Our Diversified Industrial segment is comprised of our HNH and WFH LLC operations. 

HNH (NASDAQ (CM): HNH) is a diversified manufacturer of engineered niche industrial products with leading market positions in many of the markets it serves. Four of our representatives serve on HNH's seven-member board of directors, one of whom serves as Chairman. Our representatives also serve as the Executive Chairman (Principal Executive Officer), Chief Financial 

Officer (Principal Accounting Officer), Chief Legal Officer and as various Vice Presidents of HNH. HNH distributes products to customers through its sales personnel, outside sales representatives and distributors in North and South America, Europe, Australia, Asia and several other international markets. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;HNH employed 2,125 employees worldwide. Of these employees, 355 were sales employees, 466 were office employees, 79 were covered by collective bargaining agreements, and 1,225 were non-union operating employees. HNH is diversified across industrial markets and customers. HNH sells to customers in the construction, electrical, electronics, transportation, utility, medical, oil and gas exploration, aerospace and defense, and food industries. No customer accounted for more than 10% of HNH's consolidated net sales in 2015 , 2014 &#32;or 2013 . HNH's 15 largest customers accounted for approximately 33% of consolidated HNH net sales in 2015. Below is a description of HNH's products: 

&#8226; 

Joining Materials - HNH's Joining Materials business primarily fabricates precious metals and their alloys into brazing alloys. Brazing alloys are used to join similar and dissimilar metals, as well as specialty metals and some ceramics, with strong, hermetic joints. The Joining Materials business offers these metal joining products in a wide variety of alloys, including gold, silver, palladium, copper, nickel, aluminum and tin. Operating income from precious metal products is principally derived from the "value added" of processing and fabricating and not from the purchase and resale of precious metals. 

&#8226; 

Tubing - HNH's Tubing business manufactures and produces value added fabrications for a wide variety of steel tubing products such as continuous seamless stainless steel tubing coils for the petrochemical infrastructure and shipbuilding markets and small diameter coil tubing for the aerospace, defense and semiconductor fabrication markets. This unit also manufactures welded carbon steel tubing in coiled and straight lengths with a primary focus on products for the transportation, appliance and heating and oil and gas industries. 

&#8226; 

Building Materials - HNH's Building Materials business manufactures and supplies products primarily to the commercial construction and building industries. It manufactures fasteners and fastening systems for the U.S. commercial low slope roofing industry, which are sold to building and roofing material wholesalers, roofing contractors and private label roofing system manufacturers, and a line of engineered specialty fasteners for the building products industry for fastening applications in the remodeling and construction of homes, decking and landscaping. 

&#8226; 

Performance Materials &#32;- HNH's Performance Materials business manufactures sheet and mechanically formed glass and aramid materials for specialty applications in a wide expanse of markets requiring highly engineered components. Its products are used in a wide range of advanced composite applications, such as civilian and military aerospace components, printed electronic circuit boards, filtration and insulation products, specialty commercial construction substrates, automotive and industrial components, and soft body armor for civilian and military applications. HNH's Performance Materials business is currently comprised solely of the operations of JPS Industries, Inc. ("JPS"), which HNH acquired on July 2, 2015. 

&#8226; 

Kasco Blades and Route Repair Services ("Kasco") - HNH's Kasco business provides meat-room blade products, repair services and resale products for the meat and deli departments of supermarkets, restaurants, meat and fish processing plants, and for distributors of electrical saws and cutting equipment, principally in North America and Europe. Kasco also provides wood cutting blade products for the pallet manufacturing, pallet recycler and portable saw mill industries in North America. 

&#160; 

WFH LLC (formerly known as CoSine) operates through its subsidiary API, which CoSine obtained control over on April 17, 2015. On December 31, 2015 CoSine was merged into and with WFH LLC, with WFH LLC being the surviving company. API is a manufacturer and distributor of foils, films and laminates used to enhance the visual appeal and authenticating brands and packaging. API's Laminates and Foils businesses produce carton board laminates and foils for the packaging of consumer goods as well as the food &#38; confectionery, health &#38; beauty, personal care, greeting cards, books, magazines, footwear &#38; sports goods and office &#38; promotional products industries. API's Holographics business manufactures holographic products for use on premium branded goods in various industries, as well as use in government and institutional documents and currencies. No customer accounted for more than 10% of API's consolidated net sales in 2015 &#32;and API's 15 largest customers accounted for approximately 59% of consolidated API net sales in 2015. As of December 31, 2015 &#32;API employed 533 employees worldwide. Of these employees, 75 were sales employees, 64 were office employees, 377 were manufacturing employees and 17 were in other functions. A total of 270 of API's employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. WFH LLC has no employees. 

SPLP's investment in SLI (AMEX:SLI), a New Jersey corporation that designs, manufactures and markets power electronics, motion control, power protection and specialized communication equipment, is classified within the Diversified Industrial segment. We account for SLI as an equity method investment at fair value (see Note 2 - "Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 5 - "Investments" to the SPLP consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K). SLI's products are 

used in a variety of medical, commercial and military aerospace, computer, datacom, industrial, telecom, transportation, utility, rail and highway equipment applications. Two of our representatives serve on SLI's five-member board of directors, one of whom serves as Chairman. 

Energy Segment 

Steel Excel is a Delaware corporation formerly known as ADPT Corporation (NASDAQ:SXCL). Three of our representatives serve on Steel Excel's six-member board of directors, one of whom serves as Chairman and another of whom serves as the Chief Executive Officer. Our representatives also serve as Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Steel Energy Ltd. ("Steel Energy"), Steel Excel&#8217;s Energy business provides drilling and production services to the oil and gas industry. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary Steel Sports Inc., Steel Excel&#8217;s Sports business is a social impact organization that strives to provide a first-class youth sports experience emphasizing positive experiences and instilling the core values of discipline, teamwork, safety, respect, and integrity. Steel Excel also makes significant non-controlling investments in entities in industries related to its existing businesses as well as entities in other unrelated industries, and continues to identify business acquisition opportunities in all these areas. As of December 31, 2015 , Steel Excel had 763 employees, of which 658 were full-time employees and 105 were part-time employees. All of Steel Excel's employees are located in the United States. Steel Excel also hires additional full-time and part-time employees during peak seasonal periods. None of Steel Excel's employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Steel Excel considers its employee relations to be satisfactory. 

&#160; 

Steel Excel's energy services are affected by seasonal factors, such as inclement weather, fewer daylight hours, and holidays during the winter months. Heavy snow, ice, wind, or rain can make it difficult to operate and to move equipment between work sites, which can reduce its ability to provide services and generate revenues. These seasonal factors affect Steel Excel's competitors as well. 

Steel Excel relies primarily on its local operations to sell and market its services. Because they have conducted business together over several years, the members of its local operations have established strong working relationships with certain of their clients. These strong client relationships provide a better understanding of region-specific issues and enable Steel Excel to better address customer needs. In 2015, Steel Excel had two customers, that made up 28% or more of its net revenues, and its top 15 customers made up 76%, 81% and 81% of its net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

Steel Excel also has equity method investments in Aviat (NASDAQ:AVNW), a global provider of microwave networking solutions, API Tech (NASDAQ:ATNY), a designer and manufacturer of high performance systems, subsystems, modules, and components and iGo, a mobile device accessories provider company. 

Financial Services Segment 

The Financial Services segment activity during 2015 primarily consists of our subsidiary WFHC, which conducted its financial operations during 2015 through its wholly owned subsidiary WebBank. WebBank is a Utah chartered industrial bank subject to comprehensive regulation, examination, and supervision of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) and the State of Utah Department of Financial Institutions (&#8220;UDFI&#8221;). WebBank is not considered a &#8220;bank&#8221; for Bank Holding Company Act purposes and, as such, SPLP is not regulated as a bank holding company. WebBank's deposits are insured by the FDIC. As of December 31, 2015 , WebBank had 58 employees. 

WebBank engages in a full range of banking activities including originating loans, issuing credit cards, and taking deposits that are federally insured. WebBank originates and funds consumer and small business loans through lending programs with unaffiliated companies that market and service the programs (&#8220;Marketing Partners&#8221;), where the Marketing Partners subsequently purchase the loans (or interests in the loans) that are originated by WebBank. WebBank also has private-label financing programs that are branded for a specific retailer, manufacturer, dealer channel, or proprietary network and bank card programs. WebBank also participates in syndicated commercial and industrial as well as asset based credit facilities and asset based securitizations through relationships with other financial institutions. 

WebBank's interest income is primarily derived from interest and origination fees earned on loans and investments. WebBank's non-interest income is primarily derived from fee income on contractual lending arrangements, premiums on the sale of loans, and loan servicing fees. For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , the two highest grossing contractual lending programs accounted for 46%, 35% and 46%, respectively, of WebBank's total revenue. 

Corporate and Other Segment 

The Corporate and Other segment consists of several consolidated subsidiaries, equity method investments as well as other various investments and cash and cash equivalents. Below is a description of the Corporate and Other segment: 

&#8226; 

SPH Services - SPH Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of SPLP, &#32; provides legal, tax, accounting, treasury, consulting, auditing, administration, compliance, environmental health and safety, human resources, marketing, investor relations and similar services, to other affiliated companies. SP Corporate has management services agreements with HNH, Steel Excel, WebBank, WFH LLC, BNS, DGT and other related companies. For additional information on these service agreements see Note 13 - "Related Party Transactions" to the SPLP consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2015 , SPH Services had 69 employees. 

&#8226; 

BNS Liquidating Trust - In June 2012, BNS Holding Inc. ("BNS") formed a liquidating trust, the BNS Liquidating Trust. BNS assigned its assets and liabilities to the BNS Liquidating Trust and initiated its dissolution. The BNS Liquidating Trust is owned by the BNS former shareholders in the same proportion as their former ownership in BNS. The BNS Liquidating Trust has no employees. 

&#8226; 

DGT - DGT's operations currently consist of investments, general and administrative expenses and one building which is held for sale at December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

SPLP's investment in MLNK (NASDAQ:MLNK), which provides supply chain and logistics services to companies in consumer electronics, communications, computing, medical devices, software, luxury goods and retail, is classified in the Corporate and Other segment. Two members of SPLP's management team serve on the six-member MLNK board of directors, one of whom serves as chairman. We account for MLNK as an equity method investment under the fair value option (see Note 2 - "Significant Accounting Policies" and Note 5 - "Investments" to the SPLP consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K). 

Raw Materials 

&#160; 

Besides precious metals, the raw materials used in certain HNH operations consist principally of stainless, galvanized and carbon steel, copper, tin, nickel alloys, a variety of high-performance alloys and various plastic compositions. The raw materials used in the operations of HNH's Performance Materials business consist principally of fiberglass, quartz and aramid yarns. HNH purchases all such raw materials at open market prices from domestic and foreign suppliers. HNH has not experienced any significant problem in obtaining the necessary quantities of raw materials. Prices and availability, particularly of raw materials purchased from foreign suppliers, are affected by world market conditions and government policies. The raw materials used by HNH in its non-precious metal products are generally readily available from more than one source. 

The raw materials used in the operations of API consist principally of board, PET film, organic solvents, aluminum, resins, pigments and adhesives. API purchases all such raw materials at open market prices and has not experienced any significant problem in obtaining the necessary quantities of raw materials. Prices and availability of raw materials purchased are affected by world market conditions and government policies. The raw materials used are generally readily available from more than one source. 

HNH and API require significant amounts of electricity, oil and natural gas to operate their facilities and they are subject to price changes in these commodities. A shortage of electricity, oil or natural gas, or a government allocation of supplies resulting in a general reduction in supplies, could increase costs of production and could cause some curtailment of production. 

Capital Investments 

SPLP believes that in order to be and remain competitive, its businesses must continuously strive to improve productivity and product quality, and control and/or reduce manufacturing costs. Accordingly, SPLP expects to continue to make capital investments that reduce overall manufacturing costs, improve the quality of products produced, services provided and broaden the array of products offered to the industries SPLP serves, as well as replace equipment as necessary to maintain compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. SPLP's capital expenditures for 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 &#32;for continuing operations were $23,252 , $28,769 &#32;and $20,885 , respectively. SPLP anticipates funding its capital expenditures in 2016 from funds generated by operations and borrowed funds. 

Competition 

There are many companies, larger and smaller, domestic and foreign, which manufacture products or provide services of the type offered by our subsidiaries. Some of these competitors are larger and have financial resources greater than our subsidiaries. Some of these competitors enjoy certain other competitive advantages, including greater name recognition, greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources, a larger installed base of customers and well-established relationships with current and potential customers. 

Competition in the Diversified Industrial segment is based on quality, technology, service, reputation, price, and in some industries, new product introduction. 

Steel Excel's Energy business operates in a highly competitive industry that is influenced by price, capacity, reputation, and experience. In times of high demand, capacity, reputation and experience are major competitive forces. In times of low demand, service providers will compete on price to attract customers. In addition, Steel Excel needs to maintain a safe work environment and a well-trained work force to remain competitive. The market for the Steel Excel's Sports business&#8217; baseball facility services and soccer camps and leagues is very fragmented, and its competitors are primarily small local or regional operations. The market for its strength and conditioning services is fragmented, and its competitors vary from large national providers of such services to local providers of comparable or other niche services. 

WebBank competes with a broad range of banks , &#32;both larger and smaller, across its various lines of business. 

Regulation 

Certain of our business are subject to various regulations relating to protection of the environment, worker safety, the handling of hazardous materials, transportation standards, and banking. The Company does not presently anticipate that compliance with currently applicable environmental regulations and controls will significantly change its competitive position, capital spending or earnings during 2016. SPLP believes it's subsidiaries are in compliance with all orders and decrees it has consented to with environmental regulatory agencies. These regulations are discussed in more detail below. Also, please see "Item 1A - Risk Factors," "Item 3 - Legal Proceedings" and Note 21 - "Commitments and Contingencies" to the SPLP consolidated financial statements found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. 

&#8226; 

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, and comparable state laws (&#8220;CERCLA&#8221; or &#8220;Superfund&#8221;) impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain defined parties, including current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release of hazardous substances occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposition of the hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these parties may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that were released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Further, claims may be filed for personal injury and property damages allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances and other pollutants. We may encounter materials that are considered hazardous substances in the course of our operations. As a result, our businesses may incur CERCLA liability for cleanup costs and be subject to related third-party claims. We also may be subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, and comparable state statutes (&#8220;RCRA&#8221;) related to solid wastes. Under CERCLA or RCRA, our subsidiaries could be required to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial activities to prevent future contamination. 

&#8226; 

The Clean Water Act established the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and quality standards for surface waters. 

&#8226; 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 imposed a multitude of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in the waters of the United States. 

&#8226; 

The Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations may require our subsidiaries to obtain approvals or permits for construction, modification, or operation of certain projects or facilities and may require use of emission controls. 

&#8226; 

The Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, (&#8220;OSHA&#8221;) and comparable state laws regulate the protection of employee health and safety. OSHA&#8217;s hazard communication standard requires that information about hazardous materials used or produced in its operations be maintained and provided to employees and state and local government authorities. 

WebBank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the FDIC. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, WebBank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of WebBank&#8217;s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. WebBank&#8217;s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on WebBank&#8217;s financial statements. In addition, federal banking laws and regulations generally would prohibit WebBank from making any capital distribution (including payment of a dividend) if WebBank would be under-capitalized thereafter. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth limitations and must submit a capital restoration plan, which must be guaranteed by the institution&#8217;s holding company. In addition, an undercapitalized institution is subject to increased monitoring and greater regulatory approval requirements. Currently, WebBank meets or exceeds all applicable regulatory capital requirements. &#160; &#160; 

WebBank is also subject to legal requirements in connection with the consumer and business lending programs that it originates. These include disclosure requirements, prohibitions on certain activities, and a broad prohibition on engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. These requirements are enforced by WebBank&#8217;s regulators, the FDIC and the UDFI, as well as through private litigation.
