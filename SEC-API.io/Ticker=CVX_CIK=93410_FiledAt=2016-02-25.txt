General Development of Business 

Summary Description of Chevron 

Chevron Corporation, * &#32;a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil and refined products; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives. 

A list of the company&#8217;s major subsidiaries is presented on page E-4. As of December 31, 2015 , Chevron had approximately 61,500 employees (including about 3,300 service station employees). Approximately 29,600 employees (including about 3,100 service station employees), or 48 percent, were employed in U.S. operations. 

Overview of Petroleum Industry 

Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are a major factor in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies conduct their operations and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly. 

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies and other independent refining, marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the sale or acquisition of various goods or services in many national and international markets. 

Operating Environment

Chevron&#8217;s Strategic Direction 

Chevron&#8217;s primary objective is to create shareholder value and achieve sustained financial returns from its operations that will enable it to outperform its competitors. In the upstream, the company&#8217;s strategies are to grow profitably in core areas and build new legacy positions. In the downstream, the strategies are to deliver competitive returns and grow earnings across the value chain. The company also continues to apply commercial and functional excellence in supply, trading and transportation to enable the success of the upstream and downstream strategies, and to utilize technology across all its businesses to differentiate performance.

________________________________________________________ 

* &#32;Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term &#8220;Chevron&#8221; and such terms as &#8220;the company,&#8221; &#8220;the corporation,&#8221; &#8220;our,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;us&#8221; may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include &#8220;affiliates&#8221; of Chevron &#8212; i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or investments accounted for by the cost method. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs. 

Description of Business and Properties 

The upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects * &#32;in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2015 , and assets as of the end of 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#160;&#8212; for the United States and the company&#8217;s international geographic areas &#8212; are in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page FS-37. Similar comparative data for the company&#8217;s investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in Notes 15 and 16 on pages FS-40 through FS-41. Refer to page FS-13 of this Form 10-K in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company's capital and exploratory expenditures. 

Upstream 

Reserves 

Refer to Table V beginning on page FS-65 for a tabulation of the company&#8217;s proved net liquids (including crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and synthetic oil) and natural gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2013 &#32;and each year-end from 2013 &#32;through 2015 . Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2015 , are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations. 

At December 31, 2015, 21 percent of the company's net proved reserves were located in Kazakhstan and 19 percent were located in the United States. 

The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2013 &#32;through 2015 &#32;are shown in the following table:

Net Production of Liquids and Natural Gas &#32; 

The following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2015 &#32;and 2014 &#32;by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 2.622 million &#32;barrels per day in 2015 &#32;was up 2 percent from 2014 . Production increases from project ramp-ups in the United States and Bangladesh and production entitlement effects in several locations were partially offset by the Partitioned Zone shut-in, normal field declines and the effect of asset sales. Refer to the &#8220;Results of Operations&#8221; section beginning on page FS-6 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the 2013 through 2015 &#32;changes in production for crude oil and natural gas liquids, and natural gas, and refer to Table V on pages FS-68 and FS-69 for information on annual production by geographical region.

Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities, as discussed below. 

In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver 160 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties through 2018 . The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company&#8217;s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are all based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. 

Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 1,343 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2016 &#32;through 2018 &#32;from operations in Australia, Colombia, Denmark and the Philippines. These sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that are generally referenced to the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company&#8217;s proved developed reserves in these countries.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas 

Chevron has exploration and production activities in most of the world's major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron&#8217;s 2015 &#32;key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page FS-6, are presented below. The comments include references to &#8220;total production&#8221; and &#8220;net production,&#8221; which are defined under &#8220;Production&#8221; in Exhibit 99.1 on page E-10. 

The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. Amounts indicated for project costs represent total project costs, not the company&#8217;s share of costs for projects that are less than wholly owned. 

United States 

Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in California, the Gulf of Mexico, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia and Wyoming. Net oil-equivalent production in the United States during 2015 averaged 720,000 barrels per day. 

In California, the company has significant production in the San Joaquin Valley. In 2015, net daily production averaged 166,000 barrels of crude oil, 61 million cubic feet of natural gas and 3,000 barrels of natural gas liquids (NGLs). 

During 2015, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 164,000 barrels of crude oil, 315 million cubic feet of natural gas and 16,000 barrels of NGLs. The company is pursuing selected opportunities for divestment of shelf assets in the Gulf of Mexico. Chevron is also engaged in various exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. 

The deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit (FPU) located between the two fields. Chevron has a 50 percent interest in the Jack Field and a 51 percent interest in the St. Malo Field. Both fields are company operated. The company has a 40.6 percent interest in the production host facility, which is designed to accommodate production from the Jack/St. Malo development and third-party tiebacks. Total daily production from the Jack and St. Malo fields in 2015 averaged 61,000 barrels of liquids (31,000 net) and 10 million cubic feet of natural gas (5 million net). Production ramp-up and development drilling for the first development phase continued in 2015. In addition, front-end engineering and design (FEED) activities for the second development phase, Stage 2, were completed in September 2015. Drilling of the Stage 2 development wells commenced in fourth quarter 2015 and is planned to continue into 2016. First oil from Stage 2 is expected in 2017, and proved reserves have been recognized for this project. Production from the Jack/St. Malo development is expected to ramp up to a total daily rate of 94,000 barrels of crude oil and 21 million cubic feet of natural gas. The Jack and St. Malo fields have an estimated remaining production life of 30 years. 

The development plan for the 60 percent-owned and operated Big Foot Project includes a 15-slot drilling and production platform with water injection facilities and a design capacity of 75,000 barrels of crude oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Work to install the platform was suspended in second quarter 2015 when nine of 16 mooring tendons lost buoyancy. The remaining tendons were recovered, and the platform was moved to a safe harbor location. As of early 2016, the company is completing reviews of schedule and cost estimate. No production is expected in 2016 or 2017. The field has an estimated production life of 35 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. 

At the 58 percent-owned and operated Tahiti Field, net daily production averaged 31,000 barrels of crude oil, 12 million cubic feet of natural gas, and 2,000 barrels of NGLs. The next development phase, the Tahiti Vertical Expansion Project, entered FEED in mid-2015, and a final investment decision is expected in mid-2016. At the end of 2015, proved reserves had not been recognized for the vertical expansion project. The Tahiti Field has an estimated remaining production life of at least 20 years. 

The company has a 42.9 percent nonoperated working interest in the Tubular Bells Field. In 2015, net daily production averaged 10,000 barrels of crude oil and 20 million cubic feet of natural gas. Development drilling continued during 2015.

Chevron holds a 25 percent nonoperated working interest in the Stampede Project, the unitized development of the Knotty Head and Pony discoveries. The planned facilities have a design capacity of 80,000 barrels of crude oil and 40 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Development drilling commenced in fourth quarter 2015, with first oil expected in 2018. The field has an estimated production life of 30 years from the time of start-up. Proved reserves have been recognized for this project. 

FEED activities progressed in 2015 on a project to jointly develop the 55 percent-owned and operated Buckskin Field and the 87.5 percent-owned and operated Moccasin Field. A decision was made in fourth quarter 2015 not to pursue the development. In January 2016, the company relinquished its interest in Moccasin and transferred the operatorship of Buckskin to another working interest partner. The company plans to transfer its interest in Buckskin to the other working interest owners in 2016. 

During 2015 and early 2016, the company participated in five appraisal wells and four exploration wells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Drilling was completed at the 50 percent-owned and operated Sicily exploration well in second quarter 2015, which resulted in a crude oil discovery. Drilling commenced on an appraisal well at Sicily in December 2015. Appraisal activities, including a sidetrack of the discovery well, at the 55 percent-owned and operated Anchor discovery were completed in fourth quarter 2015 and were successful. Drilling commenced on an additional appraisal well at Anchor in first quarter 2016. 

Chevron is the operator of an exploration and appraisal program covering 28 jointly held offshore leases in the northwest portion of Keathley Canyon. This area may have the potential to support a multifield hub development of the Guadalupe and Tiber discoveries, with the potential addition of the Gibson prospect. This potential development, named Tigris, is under evaluation as exploration and appraisal work progresses. Drilling of a sidetrack well at the 36 percent-owned and operated Gila discovery was completed in third quarter 2015. The Gila prospect was deemed noncommercial, and two of the leases were relinquished in early 2016. Drilling commenced at a 36 percent-owned and operated Gibson exploration well in fourth quarter 2015 and is planned to be completed in second quarter 2016. 

Chevron added thirteen leases to its deepwater portfolio as a result of awards from the central Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 235, held in first quarter 2015.
