&#160; 

Fluid Flow Markets 

&#160; 

Our primary industrial fluid flow markets are water desalination and oil &#38; gas. We have been and continue to be the technology leader for energy recovery devices (&#8220;ERDs&#8221;) in the water desalination market with our proprietary Pressure Exchanger technology and turbochargers. We also provide high-performance and high-efficiency pumps to facilitate a packaged solution for our customers. Building on our leading technology, we have expanded our solution offerings into other fluid flow markets, such as those found in upstream, midstream, and downstream applications of the oil &#38; gas industry, as well as exploring other end markets for which our solutions may be applicable. We offer the VorTeq hydraulic fracturing system (&#8220;VorTeq&#8221;), IsoBoost, and IsoGen product lines to the oil &#38; gas market. 

&#160; 

Water Desalination 

&#160; 

Water Desalination has been our core market for revenue generation to date. The water desalination market ranges from small water desalination plants such as those used in cruise ships and resorts to mega-project desalination plant deployments globally. Because of the geographical location of many significant desalination projects, geopolitical and economic events can have an effect on the timing of expected projects. In addition, population and economic growth in countries such as India and China are driving water demand for human, agricultural, and industrial use. We anticipate that markets traditionally not associated with water desalination, including the United States, will inevitably develop and provide further revenue growth opportunities. Our solutions leverage our Pressure Exchanger, turbocharger, and pump technologies providing our customers significant operational efficiency and energy savings. 

&#160; 

Oil &#38; Gas 

&#160; 

Across the oil &#38; gas upstream, midstream and downstream market, highly pressurized fluid flows are required to extract and process oil or gas. These pressurized fluid flows are both a necessity and liability to the oil &#38; gas industry. 

&#160; 

&#160;

- 4 -

&#160;

&#160; 

Within the oil &#38; gas upstream segment, hydraulic fracturing is a well-stimulation technique in which rock is fractured by pressurized liquid through the injection of a highly abrasive, proppant-laden fluid into a wellbore to create cracks in deep-rock formations thereby permitting oil &#38; gas extraction. Oilfield service providers utilize high-pressure hydraulic fracturing pumps to pressurize the fracturing fluid at treating pressures up to 15,000 psi. These pumps are routinely destroyed during the hydraulic fracturing process causing significant oilfield service operator costs associated with excessive downtime, repairs, maintenance, and capital equipment redundancy. Our solution leverages our Pressure Exchanger technology to isolate high-pressure hydraulic fracturing pumps from abrasive fracturing fluid thereby enabling oilfield service operators to realize immediate and long-term savings. 

&#160; 

Within the oil &#38; gas midstream and downstream segments, pressure energy becomes a waste product at different stages of oil and gas processing. It is at these stages that our technology enables the recovery of pressure energy in the fluid flow either through the exchange of pressure within the application or by converting it to electricity. We enable gas processing plant and pipeline owners and operators to achieve immediate and long-term energy savings with little or no operational disruption. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

OUR SOLUTIONS 

&#160; 

In the Water Desalination market, our energy recovery solutions reduce plant operating costs by capturing and reusing the otherwise lost pressure energy from the reject stream of the desalination process. In the Oil &#38; Gas market, our hydraulic fracturing solutions reduce operating and capital equipment costs by isolating high cost pumping equipment from highly abrasive fracturing fluids. In addition, our oil &#38; gas solutions reduce plant or pipeline operating costs by capturing and reusing otherwise lost pressure energy. Energy and capital costs are major cost drivers in both the water desalination and oil &#38; gas markets. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Water Desalination 

&#160; 

Our water desalination ERDs are categorized into two technology groups: PX energy recovery devices and turbochargers. The first technology group is comprised of our patented Pressure Exchanger technology consisting of ceramic rotors and almost frictionless hydrodynamic bearings. Our PX energy recovery devices perform with up to 98% efficiency and unmatched uptime in the desalination industry as well as save up to 60% of the energy costs of a desalination plant . 

&#160; 

The second technology group is comprised of AT turbochargers designed for low-pressure brackish and high-pressure seawater reverse osmosis systems. Our turbochargers provide premium efficiency with state-of-the-art engineering and configuration. Designed for reliability and optimum efficiency, our turbochargers offer substantial savings, and the custom-designed hydraulics and 3-D geometry allow for optimum performance. Also, the patent-protected technology for volute inserts allows field flexibility. 

&#160; 

Complementing both our PX energy recovery devices and AT turbochargers are our high-efficiency and high-pressure pumps marketed under the trademark of AquaBold. These pumps range from single and multiple stage centrifugal pumps to circulation and advanced high-speed pumps. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Oil &#38; Gas &#160; 

&#160; 

In the Oil &#38; Gas market, we design and manufacture innovative solutions that preserve or eliminate pumping technology in hostile processing environments and convert wasted pressure energy into a reusable asset. Our core solutions are the VorTeq hydraulic fracturing system and our centrifugal line of products, the IsoBoost and the IsoGen. 

&#160; 

Field trials were initiated for the VorTeq in the second quarter of 2015 and successfully completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. In October 2015, we entered into a fifteen (15) year license agreement with Schlumberger for the exclusive, worldwide right to use the VorTeq technology for hydraulic fracturing onshore operations. The product is currently in the research and development stage. The VorTeq is an enabling technology for oilfield service (&#8220;OFS&#8221;) companies to isolate and preserve costly hydraulic fracturing pumps by re-routing hostile fracturing fluid away from these critical pumps. These hydraulic fracturing pumps will then process only water, which leads to reduced repairs and maintenance costs, increased fleet revenue, and reduced capital costs by extending pump life expectancy and eliminating redundant capital equipment. The VorTeq further allows for the migration to increasingly efficient pumping technology that could lead to the revolutionizing of the hydraulic fracturing system. 

&#160; 

The IsoBoost and IsoGen were commercialized in 2012. Our IsoBoost energy recovery systems are comprised of hydraulic turbo chargers and related controls and automation systems. Our IsoBoost systems, through the use of turbochargers, enable oil &#38; gas operators to capture wasted hydraulic pressure energy from a high-pressure fluid flow and transfer the energy to a low-pressure fluid flow thereby recovering wasted pressure energy. Our IsoGen energy recovery systems are comprised of hydraulic turbines, generators, and related controls and automation systems. The IsoGen enables oil &#38; gas operators to capture hydraulic energy and generate electricity from high-pressure fluid flows. Additionally, our energy recovery and power generation systems result in lower capital costs for oil &#38; gas operators by minimizing the need for high-pressure pumps that consume large amounts of energy. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Services 

&#160; 

We provide a portfolio of services tailored to our customers&#8217; needs. Specifically, we assist our customers in the early stages of planning and design by leveraging our broad experience in fluid flows and advanced material science. We also provide engineering, technical support, and training to customers during installation and commissioning. Additionally, we offer preventive maintenance and support services as well as reinstallation services. To date the revenue from these services has not represented a significant portion of our revenue. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

CUSTOMERS 

&#160; 

Water Desalination 

&#160; 

Our water desalination customers include major international engineering, procurement, and construction (&#8220;EPC&#8221;) firms that design and build large desalination plants, original equipment manufacturers (&#8220;OEM&#8221;), which are companies that supply equipment and packaged solutions for small- to medium-sized desalination plants, and national, state and local municipalities worldwide. 

&#160; 

Large Engineering, Procurement and Construction Firms 

&#160; 

A significant portion of our revenue historically has come from sales of solutions to large EPC firms worldwide that have the required desalination expertise to engineer, undertake procurement for, construct, and sometimes own and operate large desalination plants or mega-projects (&#8220;MPD&#8221;). We work with these firms to specify our solutions for their plants. The time between project tender and shipment can range from 16 to 36 months. Each MPD project typically represents a revenue opportunity of between $1 million and $10 million. 

&#160; 

A limited number of these EPC firms account for 10% or more of our product revenue. Revenue from customers representing 10% or more of product revenue varies from year to year. For the year ended December 31, 2015, one customer, Acciona Agua, S.A.U., accounted for approximately 14% of our product revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2014, one customer, IDE Americas, Inc., accounted for approximately 14% of our product revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2013, one customer, Acciona Agua, S.A.U., accounted for approximately 15% of our product revenue. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Original Equipment Manufacturers 

&#160; 

We also sell our solutions and services to suppliers of pumps and other water-related equipment for assembly and use in small- to medium-sized desalination plants located in hotels, power plants, cruise ships, farm operations, island bottlers, mobile and containerized water desalination solutions, and small municipalities. These OEMs also purchase our solutions for &#8220;quick water&#8221; or emergency water solutions. O ur OEM customer base accounted for approximately 45% of our 2015 revenues. We typically sell and promote our packaged solutions to this sales channel represented by a product mix of PX Pressure Exchangers, turbochargers, high-pressure pumps, and circulation &#8220;booster&#8221; pumps. The time from project tender and shipment can range from one (1) to twelve (12) months. OEM projects typically represent revenue opportunities between $0.01 million to $1.0 million. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Oil &#38; Gas 

&#160; 

Our oil &#38; gas customers include international oil companies (&#8220;IOC&#8221;), national oil companies (&#8220;NOC&#8221;), exploration and production companies (&#8220;E&#38;P&#8221;), oilfield service companies (&#8220;OFS&#8221;), and EPC firms that design and build oil &#38; gas processing plants. 

&#160; 

Upstream 

&#160; 

OFS companies provide the infrastructure, equipment, intellectual property, and services needed by the oil &#38; gas industry to explore for, extract, and transport crude oil and natural gas. OFS hydraulic fracturing operators face significant pressure to reduce costs as oil &#38; gas companies curtail capital expenditures and seek operational efficiencies in response to lower commodity prices. We developed the VorTeq hydraulic pumping system which enables these operators to isolate pumps from fracturing fluid thereby reducing operating and capital costs. 

&#160; 

In the third quarter of 2014, we entered into a strategic partnership with Liberty Oil Field Services to pilot and conduct field trials with the VorTeq hydraulic pumping system, which were initiated in the second quarter of 2015. These field trials were successfully completed in December 2015. In October 2015, we entered into a fifteen (15) year license agreement with Schlumberger for the exclusive, worldwide right to use our VorTeq technology for hydraulic fracturing onshore operations. 

&#160; 

Midstream and Downstream 

&#160; 

With respect to IsoBoost and IsoGen, we have contracted and delivered oil &#38; gas solutions, as pilot projects to customers in North America, Asia, and the Middle East. The sales cycle for our oil &#38; gas solutions can be prolonged and may be impacted by procurement processes and budgetary constraints. 

&#160; 

For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized oil &#38; gas revenue from the license agreement with Schlumberger, cancellation of a purchase order with Conoco Philips, and from the commissioning of an IsoGen system with a customer in Saudi Arabia. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized oil &#38; gas rental income from the operating lease and subsequent lease buy-out of an IsoGen system to a customer in Saudi Arabia. For the year ended December 31, 2013, we did not recognize any revenue from shipments of our oil &#38; gas solutions. 

&#160; 

Additional information regarding our product revenue by segment is included in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

COMPETITION 

&#160; 

Water Desalination 

&#160; 

The market for energy recovery devices and pumps in the Water Desalination market is competitive. As the demand for fresh water increases and the market expands, we expect competition to persist and intensify. 

&#160; 

We have two main competitors for our energy recovery devices: Flowserve Corporation (Flowserve) and Fluid Equipment Development Company (FEDCO). We compete with these companies on the basis of price, quality, efficiency, lead time, expected life, downtime, and maintenance costs. Although these companies may offer competing solutions at lower prices, we believe that our solutions offer a competitive advantage because it is our belief that our solutions are the most cost-effective energy recovery devices for reverse osmosis desalination over time. 

&#160; 

&#160;

- 7 -

&#160;

&#160; 

In the market for large desalination projects, our PX devices and large turbochargers compete primarily with Flowserve&#8217;s DWEER product. We believe that our PX devices have a competitive advantage over DWEER devices because our devices are made with highly durable and corrosion-resistant ceramic parts that are designed for a life of 25 years, are warranted for high efficiencies, cause no unplanned downtime, and offer lower lifecycle costs. Additionally, the PX devices offer optimum scalability with a quick startup as well as minimal maintenance. We believe that our large turbocharger solutions also have a competitive advantage over the DWEER product, particularly in countries where energy costs are low and upfront capital costs are a critical factor in purchase decisions, because our turbocharger solutions have lower upfront capital costs, a simple design with one rotating assembly, a small physical footprint, and a long operating life that leads to low total lifecycle costs. 

&#160; 

In the market for small- to medium-sized desalination plants, our solutions compete with Flowserve&#8217;s Pelton turbines and FEDCO&#8217;s turbochargers. We believe that our PX devices have a competitive advantage over these solutions because our devices provide up to 98% energy efficiency, have lower lifecycle maintenance costs, and are made of highly durable and corrosion-resistant ceramic parts. We also believe that our turbochargers compete favorably with Pelton turbines and FEDCO turbochargers on the basis of efficiency and price and because our turbochargers have design advantages that enhance efficiency, field flexibility, and serviceability. 

&#160; 

In the market for high-pressure pumps, our solutions compete with pumps manufactured by Clyde Union Ltd.; FEDCO; Flowserve; D&#252;chting Pumpen Maschinenfabrik GmbH &#38; Co KG; KSB Aktiengesellschaft; Torishima Pump Mfg. Co., Ltd.; Sulzer Pumps, Ltd.; and other companies. We believe that our pump solutions are competitive with these solutions because our pumps are developed specifically for reverse osmosis desalination, are highly efficient, and feature product-lubricated bearings. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Oil &#38; Gas &#160; 

&#160; 

The market for our technology in the Oil &#38; Gas market is competitive. As demand for our products increase, we expect competition to intensify. 

&#160; 

Within the oil &#38; gas upstream market, OFS hydraulic fracturing operators utilize high-pressure hydraulic fracturing pumps to pressurize fracturing fluid. This fluid is sent through traditional missile manifolds into the wellbore to create cracks in the deep-rock formations thereby permitting oil &#38; gas extraction. Our VorTeq system is a hydraulic pumping system that replaces the traditional missile manifold used by OFS hydraulic fracturing operators. There are many manufacturers of the traditional missile manifolds. 

&#160; 

We believe our VorTeq technology represents a competitive advantage over existing missile manifold technology because our solution re-routes abrasive proppant away from high-pressure pumps, thereby extending pump lifespan, reducing repairs and maintenance costs, and decreasing the need for redundant capital equipment. In addition, because our VorTeq technology isolates the high-pressure pumps from abrasive proppant, OFS hydraulic fracturing operators have the ability to transition to more robust, longer lived centrifugal pumps thereby further decreasing operating and capital costs. 

&#160; 

Within the oil and gas midstream and downstream markets, acid gas removal &#8212; also known as amine gas treating &#8212; refers to a process that utilizes solvents such as an amine solution to remove acid gasses, specifically hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from natural gas, synthesis gas, or other hydrocarbon streams. Our IsoBoost and IsoGen technologies integrate into acid gas removal systems to reduce energy consumption and increase the reliability and uptime of the amine circulation system. Currently, most acid gas removal plants use pumps and valves to pressurize and depressurize the amine solution; the depressurization of the cleansing fluid (e.g. amine) provides an opportunity for the use of energy recovery devices. 

&#160; 

Our IsoBoost system is based partly on hydraulic turbocharger technology. While to our knowledge the only turbocharger systems presently utilized in acid gas removal applications are manufactured by Energy Recovery, there is at least one established competitor, FEDCO, which makes a similar hydraulic turbocharger for desalination applications. We combine our highly competitive turbocharger technology with process equipment and control systems to make a unique, proprietary, and highly competitive offering for oil &#38; gas and petrochemical plants. 

&#160; 

Our IsoGen system is partly based on hydraulic turbine technology which converts recovered energy to electric power. Many other companies make hydraulic turbines for a broad range of applications. For acid gas removal plants, our competitors utilize reverse running pumps (also called hydraulic power recovery turbines or HPRTs) to perform the same energy recovery function that our IsoGen systems provide. These reverse running pumps are typically part of a large &#8220;skid-mounted&#8221; system, incorporating a multi-stage pump and motor, all rotating about a common shaft. Flowserve, Sulzer, and Shin Nippon Machinery are known to have supplied these systems and other major pump companies may have built systems for this application as well. We believe most of our competitors&#8217; reverse running pump systems present concerns related to reliability, operational flexibility, and low energy efficiency as compared to our solution. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We market and sell our solutions directly to customers through our direct sales organization and, in some countries, through authorized, independent sales agents. Our current sales organization consists of two groups, water desalination and oil &#38; gas. The water desalination group targets MPD, OEM, and aftermarket opportunities. MPD opportunities are for desalination projects exceeding 50,000 cubic meters per day. OEM opportunities include sales of PX devices, turbochargers, and pumps for plants typically designed to produce less than 50,000 cubic meters per day. Aftermarket opportunities include new and replacement parts and products, as well as technical support, training, product installation, and plant commissioning. 

&#160; 

Our oil &#38; gas group targets IOCs, NOCs, E&#38;Ps, OFSs, or EPCs on behalf of oil producers, and chemical producers who have applications for our solutions and services. 

&#160; 

Many of the large EPC firms that specialize in large projects are located in the Mediterranean region. Our sales branch in Dubai, United Arab Emirates serves the Middle East, where many desalination plants and key EPC firms are located. We have a sales force in Spain focused on the Spain and European markets. We also have a sales office in Shanghai, China to address this emerging market for our energy recovery solutions. In the U.S., our sales office along with our corporate headquarters is located in San Leandro, California. In February 2016, we hired an oil &#38; gas sales manager in Dublin, Ireland with responsibilities for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. As opportunities and diversification dictate, particularly in oil &#38; gas, we will look to expand our geographical presence. 

&#160; 

A significant portion of our revenue is from outside of the United States. Sales in the United States represented 7%, 4%, and 13% of our product revenue for the fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Additional segment and geographical information regarding our product revenue is included in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

Our primary manufacturing facility is in San Leandro, California, where our energy recovery devices are produced, assembled, and tested. We produce the majority of our ceramic components for our water desalination PX solutions in our ceramics manufacturing facility in San Leandro. We complete machining and assemble of all ceramic components for our PX devices and many components of our turbochargers and pumps to protect the proprietary nature of our manufacturing methods and product designs and to maintain premium quality standards. In October 2015, we hired a supply chain manager in Dublin, Ireland responsible for commercializing the VorTeq and expanding our manufacturing activities in Europe. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

Design, quality, and innovation are key facets of our corporate culture. Our development efforts are focused on enhancing our existing energy recovery devices and pumps for the desalination market and advancing our know-how in fluid dynamics for use in other markets such as oil &#38; gas and chemical processing. In the last several years our engineering work has led to the development of new solutions for applications both within the water desalination market as well as other fluid flow applications such as oil &#38; gas and chemical processing. 

&#160; 

In July 2015, with the sale of our oil &#38; gas intellectual property (&#8220;IP&#8221;) to ERI Energy Recovery Holdings Ireland Limited, Dublin, Ireland has become key to our VorTeq commercialization efforts. 

&#160; 

We continue to make significant investments in oil &#38; gas technologies and solutions to diversify our business and expand addressable markets. Most of these investments are expensed as incurred in research and development expense. Those that have reached commercial feasibility are ultimately recorded in cost of revenue when leased, sold, or evaluated for net realizable value and therefore impact gross profit. Research and development expense totaled $7.7 million, $9.7 million, and $4.4 million in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Research and development costs may increase in the future as we continue to advance our existing technology and develop new energy recovery and efficiency-enhancing solutions for markets outside of seawater desalination. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Seasonality 

&#160; 

In the water desalination sector, we often experience substantial fluctuations in product revenue from quarter to quarter and from year to year due to the fact that a single order for our energy recovery devices by a large EPC firm for a particular plant may represent significant revenue. In addition, historically our EPC customers tend to order a significant amount of equipment for delivery in the fourth quarter, and as a consequence, a significant portion of our annual sales typically occurs during the fourth quarter. 

&#160; 

We do not currently have enough history to determine revenue patterns within the oil &#38; gas sector. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We seek patent protection for new technologies, inventions, and improvements that are likely to be incorporated into our solutions. We rely on patents, trade secret laws, and contractual safeguards to protect the proprietary tooling, processing techniques, and other know-how used in the production of our solutions. We have a robust intellectual property portfolio consisting of (i) U.S. and internationally issued patents and (ii) a number of U.S. and International pending patent applications. 

&#160; 

We have registered the following trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark office: &#8220;ERI,&#8221; &#8220;PX,&#8221; &#8220;PX Pressure Exchanger,&#8221; &#8220;Pressure Exchanger,&#8221; the Energy Recovery logo, &#8220;ERI Energy Recovery, Inc.&#8221;, &#8220;Making Desalination Affordable&#8221;, &#8220;AT&#8221;, &#8220;VorTeq&#8221;, &#8220;IsoBoost&#8221;, and &#8220;IsoGen&#8221;. We have also applied for and received registrations in international trademark offices. 

&#160; 

In July 2015, the U.S. parent company transferred the oil &#38; gas IP via platform license agreements to ERI Energy Recovery Holdings Ireland Limited. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Employees&#160; 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 114 employees: 42 in manufacturing; 27 in corporate services and management; 28 in sales, service, and marketing; and 17 in engineering and research and development. Thirteen (13) of these employees were located outside of the United States. We also engage a relatively small number of independent contractors, primarily as sales agents worldwide. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and our employees are not unionized.
