 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

We are a specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses primarily on developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling technically-challenging generic and proprietary injectable, inhalation, and intranasal products. Additionally, in 2014, we commenced sales of insulin active pharmaceutical ingredient, or insulin API , products. We currently manufacture and sell 18 products including Amphadase &#174; , which we re-launched in the fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, we are developing a portfolio of 12 generic abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, three generic biosimilar and six proprietary injectable and inhalation product candidates. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded net revenues of $ 251. 5 million, $210.5 million, and $229.7 million, respectively. We recorded a net loss of $ 2.8 million and $10.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and recorded net income of $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. 

&#160; 

Our largest product by net revenues is currently enoxaparin sodium injection, the generic equivalent of Sanofi S.A.&#8217;s Lovenox &#174; . Enoxaparin is a difficult to manufacture injectable form of low molecular weight heparin that is used as an anticoagulant and is indicated for multiple indications including the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis. We commenced sales of our enoxaparin product in January 2012, and for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recognized net revenues from the sale of our enoxaparin product of $84.5 million, $107.5 million, and $145.9 million, respectively. We believe that our enoxaparin product demonstrates our capabilities in characterizing complex molecules (which is a process that involves a determination of physiochemical properties, biological activity, immunochemical properties and purity), performing sophisticated immunogenicity studies, developing therapeutically equivalent generic versions of drugs with large, complex molecules and meeting regulatory requirements . 

In June 2015, we received approval of our new drug application, or NDA, supplement for Amphadase &#174; . This marks the first approved starting material from Amphastar Nanjing Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., or ANP, and signifies that our facility located in Nanjing, China has been qualified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. We re-launched Amphadase &#174; in the fourth quarter of 2015. Amphadase &#174; is competing in the hyaluronidase market and is used for the dispersion and absorption of other injected drugs . 

&#160; 

In addition to our currently marketed products, we have a pipeline of 2 1 generic and proprietary product candidates in various stages of development which target a variety of indications. With respect to these product candidates, we have three ANDAs and &#160; one NDA currently on file with the FDA. 

Our product candidate, Primatene &#174; HFA, an over-the-counter epinephrine inhalation product, is intended to be used for the temporary relief of mild asthma symptoms . In 2013, we filed a n NDA for Primatene &#174; HFA. &#160; In May 2014, we received a complete response letter, or CRL, from the FDA, w hich require d additional non-clinical information, label revisions and follow-up studies (label comprehension, behavioral /human factors and actual use) to assess consumers&#8217; ability to use the device correctly to support approval of the product in the over-the-counter setting. We met with the FDA in October 2014 to discuss preliminary data results and to clarify the FDA requirements for further studi es. We received further advice regarding our ongoing studies from the FDA in January 2016 and we are currently in the process of generating the remaining data required by the CRL and plan to submit an NDA a mendment that we believe will address the FDA&#8217;s concerns. However, there can be no guarantee that any amendment to our NDA will result in timely approval of the product candidate or approval at all. 

&#160;

Our multiple technological capabilities enable the development of technically-challenging products. These capabilities include characterizing complex molecules, analyzing peptides and proteins, conducting immunogenicity studies, engineering particles and improving drug delivery through sustained-release technology. These technological capabilities have enabled us to produce bioequivalent versions of complex drugs and support the development and manufacture of a broad range of dosage formulations, including solutions, emulsions, suspensions and lyophilized products, as well as products administered via pre-filled syringes, vials, metered dose inhalers, or MDIs, and dry powder inhalers, or DPIs. 

Our primary strategic focus is to develop and commercialize products with high technical barriers to market entry. We are specifically focused on products that: 

&#183; 

leverage our proprietary research and development capabilities; 

&#183; 

require raw materials or API s for which we believe we have a competitive advantage in sourcing, synthesizing or manufacturing; and/or 

&#183; 

improve upon an existing drug&#8217;s formulation with respect to drug delivery, safety and/or effic a cy. 

Not all of our products will include all of these characteristics. Moreover, we will opportunistically develop and commercialize product candidates with lower technical barriers to market entry if, for example, our existing supply chain and manufacturing infrastructure allow us to pursue a specific product candidate in a competitive and cost-effective manner. 

To complement our internal growth and expertise, we have made several strategic acquisitions of companies, products and technologies. We believe that t hese acquisitions collectively have strengthened our core injectable and inhalation product technology infrastructure by providing additional manufacturing, marketing and research and development capabilities including the ability to manufacture raw materials, APIs and other components for our products. 

Our Markets 

We primarily target products with high technical barriers to market entry, with a particular focus on the injectable and inhalation markets. We also manufacture and sell certain APIs. 

&#183; 

Injectable market. Based on an IMS Health National Sales Perspective Report, the U.S. generic injectable drug market in 2015 was approximately $8.6 billion, of which our generic development portfolio is targeting over $5.0 billion. The injectable market requires highly technical manufacturing capabilities and compliance with strict current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP , requirements, which create high barriers to market entry. Due to these high barriers to market entry, there are a limited number of companies with the technology and experience needed to manufacture injectable products. There have also been a number of quality issues over the past several years that have disrupted the ability of certain injectable manufacturers to produce sufficient product quantity to meet market demand. As such, the supply of injectables has been constrained, even as demand for injectable products has continued to increase. 

&#183; 

Inhalation market. Based on an IMS Health National Sales Perspective Report, the U.S. inhalation drug market in 2015 was approximately $24.0 billion, of which our generic development portfolio is targeting over $10.5 billion. Inhalation drug therapy is used extensively to treat respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The MDI is the most widely used device to deliver inhalation therapies. It uses pressurized gas, historically chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and more recently hydrofluoroalkanes, or HFAs, to release its dose when the device is activated by the patient. The DPI, which does not rely on a propellant, is also widely used. As in the case of injectables, there are significant technical barriers to manufacturing inhalation products. The evolution of inhalation delivery technologies from nebulizers and CFCs to HFAs and DPIs has required manufacturers of inhalation products to re-formulate their products, which in many cases may require technical engineering capabilities, additional regulatory approvals and modified delivery devices. Additionally, the development of generic HFA and DPI products will require bioequivalence studies for FDA approval. 

&#160;

Our Strengths 

We have built our company by integrating the following capabilities and strengths that we believe enable us to compete effectively in the pharmaceutical industry: 

&#183; 

Robust portfolio of products and product candidates. Including our enoxaparin product, we have 1 8 commercial products and 2 1 product candidates at differen t stages of development. We also continue to develop our product candidates, which represent our longer-term growth opportunities. 

&#183; 

Advanced technical capabilities and multiple delivery technologies. We have developed several advanced technical capabilities that we incorporate into the development of our products and product candidates, including characterization of complex molecules, peptide and protein analysis, immunogenicity studies, particle engineering and sustained-release technology. In addition, we apply these capabilities across our injectable and inhalation delivery technologies. Our injectable delivery technologies enable us to develop and manufacture generic and proprietary injectables in normal solution, lyophilized, suspension, jelly and emulsion forms, as well as in pre-filled syringes. Our inhalation technologies cover a variety of delivery methods, including DPIs and HFA formulations of MDIs. These technical capabilities form the foundation for our strategy to develop products with high barriers to market entry targeting a wide range of indications. 

&#183; 

Vertically integrated infrastructure. We are a vertically integrated company with the demonstrated ability to advance a product candidate from the research stage through commercialization. Our capabilities include strong research and development expertise, sophisticated pharmaceutical engineering capabilities, comprehensive manufacturing capabilities, including the ability to synthesize and manufacture our own API, a strict quality assurance system, extensive regulatory and clinical experience and established marketing and distribution relationships. We believe our vertical integration allows us to achieve better operating efficiencies, accelerated product development and internal control over product quality. 

&#183; 

Experienced management team with deep scientific expertise. Our management team has a successful track record in product development, project management, quality assurance and sales and marketing, as well as established relationships with our key customers, partners and suppliers. Our research and development leadership has deep expertise in areas such as pharmaceutical formulation, process development, in vivo studies, analytical chemistry, physical chemistry, drug delivery and clinical research. We believe that our scientific and technical expertise, coupled with our management team&#8217;s experience and industry relationships, will enable us to successfully expand our position with respect to our current products and establish a meaningful market position for our product candidates. 

Our Strategy 

Our goal is to be an industry leader in the development, manufacturing and marketing of technically-challenging injectable and inhalation pharmaceutical products. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following key strategies: 

&#183; 

Diversify our revenues by commercializing our product candidates. Assuming we are successful in developing and obtaining regulatory approvals, we plan to commercialize our product candidates and thereby diversify our sources of revenues. We have 2 1 product candidates in various stages of development, including 1 2 generic ANDAs, three generic biosimilar product candidates and six proprietary product candidates. We also expect to expand our internal sales and marketing capabilities and, in some cases, enter into strategic alliances with other pharmaceutical companies, to drive market penetration for our product candidates. 

&#183; 

Focus on high-margin generic product opportunities. We believe that we have significant opportunities for growth driven by our technical expertise in the development of generic product candidates with high technical barriers to market entry. We believe that if these product candidates are commercialized, they are likely to face less competition than less technically-challenging generic products, which may enable us to earn higher margins for a longer period of time. We believe that generic competition for these products is likely to be limited because of challenges in product development, manufacturing or sourcing of raw materials or APIs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Develop proprietary products. We currently have six proprietary product candidates at various stages of development targeting a broad range of indications. We believe that proprietary products tend to face less competition than generic products due to market exclusivity, intellectual property protection and other barriers to entry. For these reasons, we believe that our proprietary products will provide us with the opportunity for higher margins and long-term revenue growth. 

&#183; 

Leverage our vertically-integrated infrastructure to drive operational efficiencies. We believe our vertically - integrated infrastructure provides significant benefits including better operating efficiencies, accelerated product development and internal control over product quality. Our ability to manufacture our own API allows us to develop products that other companies may not focus on due to the uncertainty of API supply. In addition, our vertically - integrated infrastructure, including our research and development capabilities, allows us to conduct technically-challenging studies in-house. We believe this vertically - integrated &#160; infrastructure has led , and will continue to lead , to a competitive portfolio of products and product candidates. 

&#183; 

Target and integrate acquisitions of pharmaceutical companies, products and technologies. We have a demonstrated ability to identify, acquire and integrate pharmaceutical companies, products and technologies to complement our internal product development capabilities. We have acquired International Medication Systems, Limited, or IMS, Armstrong Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Armstrong, Nanjing Puyan Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd. (which we renamed Amphastar Nanjing Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.), or ANP , and Merck&#8217;s API Manufacturing Business in &#201;ragny-sur-Epte, France, in connection with which , we established our French subsidiary, Amphastar France Pharmaceuticals, S.A.S., or AFP . P roducts we have acquired include Cortrosyn &#174; and Epinephrine Mist, and trade names such as Primatene &#174; . We believe that our scientific and managerial expertise and our integration experience have improved the quality of the product lines and companies that we have acquired, which has had , and we believe will continue to have, a positive effect on our results of operations. For example, if approval is received from the FDA, we plan to have our acquired subsidiary ANP provide us with access to certain raw materials for the manufacture of the API for our enoxaparin product and eventually to manufacture API for our other products and product candidates. 

Our Technical Capabilities 

We develop, manufacture, market and sell generic and proprietary products targeting injectable and inhalation markets . We also manufacture and sell insulin API. 

&#183; 

Injectable. Our injectable product technologies enable us to develop and manufacture generic and proprietary injectables in liquid, lyophilized, suspension and emulsion forms, as well as pre-filled syringes. We have multiple injectable facilities that include aseptic filling lines dedicated to the sterile manufacture and fill of injectable products. Additionally, we maintain compliance with cGMP regulations which has enabled us to obtain regulatory approvals and support commercial supply. 

&#183; 

Inhalation. We are focused on developing a range of generic and proprietary inhalation products utilizing a variety of delivery technologies. We have expertise in formulating HFA - based MDIs as well as packaging our inhalation drugs in DPIs, blister packs and other forms for loading in a variety of inhalation devices. As with our injectable products, we maintain compliance with cGMP regulations , which we believe will enable us to obtain regulatory approvals and support commercial supply. 

&#160;

We have advanced capabilities that enable us to focus on developing technically-challenging products. 

&#183; 

Characterization of complex molecules. Characterization of complex molecules includes a determination of physiochemical properties, biological activity, immunochemical properties and purity. Such characterization is important in the development of a generic product that is the same as a reference drug product, which in turn allows the generic drug developer to demonstrate such &#8220;sameness&#8221; to the FDA. Complex molecule drugs typically have large molecules composed of a mixture of molecules that differ very slightly from one another. These slight variances make complex molecules difficult to characterize. We have developed analytical tools that have enabled us to characterize complex molecules in our products and product candidates. We believe we have the technology to develop a variety of additional analytical tools that will enable us to characterize other complex molecules, including peptide and protein - based products. 

&#183; 

Immunogenicity. The ability of an antigen to elicit immune responses is called immunogenicity. Unwanted immunogenicity , which is strongly linked with protein drug products, occurs when a patient mounts an undesired immune response against a drug therapy. As a result, the FDA has signaled that they may require immunogenicity studies as part of the new pathway for biosimilars and biogenerics, and in the past the FDA has required these studies in connection with the approval of products with complex molecules. We gained expertise in immunogenicity by performing immunogenicity studies in connection with the FDA approval process for our enoxaparin product. We believe that our experience in conducting these difficult immunogenicity studies will be of primary importance in our future efforts to develop complex molecules, biosimilar and biogeneric product candidates. 

&#183; 

Peptide and protein product development and production. The development of peptide and protein drug products utilizes characterization technology and immunogenicity studies as well as recombinant DNA, or rDNA, API manufacturing technology. We have experience in the use of rDNA manufacturing technology which includes the genetic engineering of host cells, fermentation to promote cell culture growth and isolation and purification of the desired protein from the cell culture. Through each step, testing is required to ensure that only the desired protein is included in the finished product. We believe that this technology will allow us to develop protein and peptide drug products. 

&#183; 

Particle engineering. Particle engineering is important in the field of pulmonary drug delivery as there is a direct relationship between the properties of a particle and its absorption by the lungs. We believe our expertise and technology applicable to particle engineering and physical chemistry allows us to engineer the size, shape, surface smoothness and distribution of particles to develop inhalation products that are more easily dispersed through targeted areas. We believe this expertise will allow us to formulate difficult to disperse inhalation products. 

&#183; 

Sustained-release. We have developed technology aimed at improving drug delivery through sustained-release injectable products. The purpose of our sustained-release technology is to create products that require less dosing frequency and that we believe can diminish the fluctuations of drug concentrations in a patient&#8217;s blood stream that otherwise require more frequent dosing. We plan to use our sustained-release technology to develop both generic and proprietary products. 

Business Segments 

Our performance will be assessed and resources will be allocated based on the following two reportable segments: (1) finished pharmaceutical products and (2) active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API products . The finished pharmaceutical products segment currently manufactures, markets and distributes enoxaparin, Cortrosyn &#174; , Amphadase &#174; , naloxone, lidocaine jelly, as well as various other critical and non-critical care drugs. The API segment currently manufactures and distributes recombinant human insulin and porcine insulin. &#160; Information reported herein is consistent with how it is reviewed and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker. Factors used to identify our segments include markets, customers and products . 

&#160; 

&#160;

For more information regarding our segments, see "Part II &#8211; Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data &#8211; Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements &#8211; Segment Information." 

Finished Pharmaceutical Product Segment 

Our Marketed Products 

We currently manufacture and sell 16 products in our finished pharmaceutical product segment. The following is a description of products in our existing portfolio. 

Enoxaparin 

Enoxaparin is a difficult to manufacture injectable form of low molecular weight heparin that is used as an anticoagulant, which is indicated for multiple indications, including the prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis. Enoxaparin is difficult to produce in part because the API is not easily obtained or manufactured. We manufacture the API for our enoxaparin product and perform all subsequent manufacturing of the finished product in-house. In January 2012, we commenced sales of our enoxaparin product. For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we recorded net revenues from enoxaparin of $84.5 million, $107.5 million, and $145.9 million, respectively. 

Other Marketed Products 

We have 15 other products that we currently market. Other marketed products include the following: 

&#183; 

Cortrosyn &#174; (cosyntropin for injection), which is a lyophilized powder that is indicated for use as a diagnostic agent in the screening of patients with adrenocortical insufficiency; 

&#183; 

Amphadase &#174; , which is a bovine-sourced hyaluronidase injection and is used as an adjuvant in subcutaneous fluid administration for achieving hydration, to increase absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs, and in subcutaneous urography for improving absorption of radiopaque agents; 

&#183; 

Lidocaine jelly, which is a local anesthetic product used primarily for urological procedures; 

&#183; 

Lidocaine topical solution, which is used as a local anesthetic for a variety of procedures; 

&#183; 

Phytonadione injection, which is Vitamin K that is used for newborn babies; 

&#183; 

our portfolio of emergency syringe products, which include critical care drugs, such as morphine, atropine, calcium chloride, dextrose, epinephrine, lidocaine, naloxone and sodium bicarbonate, which are provided in pre-filled syringes and are designed for emergency use in hospital settings; 

&#183; 

Epinephrine in vial form; and 

&#183; 

Lorazepam injection, which is a sedative used prior to surgery and medical procedures. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015 , 201 4 , and 201 3 , we recorded net revenues from these other marketed products of $ 140. 4 million, $91.0 million , and $83.8 million, respectively. 

Our Product Candidates 

We seek to develop product candidates with high technical barriers to competitive market entry that leverage our technical capabilities and other competitive advantages. We are focused on both generic and proprietary product candidates in the injectable and inhalable markets . The product candidates in our pipeline are in various stages of development, with a number of these candidates still in early stages of development. We currently have 2 1 product 

&#160;

candidates in our pipeline, including 1 2 generic ANDAs, three generic biosimilar product candidates and six proprietary product candidates. 

The development, regulatory approval for and commercialization of our product candidates are subject to numerous risks. See &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; for additional information. 

Generic Product Candidates 

We generally employ a strategy of developing generic product candidates that possess a combination of factors that present technical barriers to competition , including difficult formulations, which require complex characterizations, difficult manufacturing requirements and/or limited availability of raw materials . &#160; W e believe that such factors will make these product candidates less susceptible to competition and pricing pressure. We currently have 1 2 generic ANDAs and three generic biosimilar product candidates at various development stages that leverage our various technical capabilities, including: 

&#183; 

injectable technologies, which include various delivery methods and sizes of pre-filled syringes, vials in solution, jelly, suspension and lyophilized forms; 

&#183; 

inhalation technologies, which include MDIs , and DPIs; 

&#183; 

nasal delivery systems; and 

&#183; 

sophisticated analytical technologies, which include characterization and immunogenicity studies for complex molecules, particle engineering, sustained-release technology and peptide, protein and DNA analysis. 

The following table summarizes our current portfolio of the 1 2 generic ANDAs and three generic biosimilar product candidates in development.

Our generic product candidates are at various stages of development, ranging from early formulation work to bioequivalence studies or the filing of an ANDA. Of these product candidates, five are in early - stage development prior to bioequivalence studies. 

In March 2016, we acquired fourteen ANDAs, representing eleven different injectable chemical entities from Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC. We plan to transfer the product candidates to our facilities in California, which will require FDA approval before the product candidates can be launched. 

Proprietary Product Candidates 

Our integrated technical skills and expertise provide a strong basis for the development of proprietary drug candidates. These skills include new chemical entity assessment, synthesis technology, formulation development, characterization analysis and immunogenicity studies, among others. 

With respect to our proprietary pipeline strategy, we currently have six proprietary drug candidates at various development stages that leverage our various technical capabilities. The following table summarizes our proprietary product candidates for which NDAs have been filed with the FDA.

&#252; 

&#160; 

Primatene &#174; HFA 

Primatene &#174; HFA, an over-the-counter epinephrine inhalation product candidate, is intended to be used for the temporary relief of mild symptoms of intermittent asthma. We developed Primatene &#174; HFA to replace the over-the-counter CFC formulation of our Primatene &#174; Mist product which was withdrawn for environmental reasons under the Montreal Protocol. We acquired the exclusive rights to the trademark, domain name, website and domestic marketing, distribution and selling rights related to Primatene &#174; Mist, and the associated CFC inventory, from Wyeth Consumer Healthcare Division in 2008 for $33.1 million. At the time of the transaction the Environmental Protection Agency was reviewing a possible ban on all CFC formulated products. In our first full year of sales of the CFC formulation of Primatene &#174; Mist, we generated cash flows from sales of the product in excess of the purchase price. We filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, for Primatene &#174; &#160; HFA for mild symptoms of intermittent asthma in October 2009. &#160; 

We filed an NDA for Primatene &#174; HFA in 2013. In February 2014, the FDA held a joint meeting of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and its Pulmonary Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee, which we refer to as the Committee, to discuss the NDA for Primatene &#174; HFA. The Committee voted 14 to 10 that the data in the NDA supported efficacy, but voted 17 to 7 that safety had not been established for the intended over-the-counter use. The Committee also voted 18 to 6 that the product did not have a favorable risk-benefit profile for the intended over-the-counter use, and individual Committee members provided recommendations for resolving their concerns. On May 22, 2014, we received a CRL from the FDA, which require d additional non-clinical information, label revisions and follow-up studies (label comprehension, behavioral /human factors and actual use) to assess consumers&#8217; ability to use the device correctly to support approval of the product in the over-the-counter setting. We met with the FDA in October 2014 to discuss preliminary data results and to clarify the FDA requirements for further studies. We received further advice regarding our ongoing studies from the FDA in January 2016 and w e are currently in the process of generating the remaining data required by the CRL and plan to submit an NDA a mendment that we believe will address the FDA&#8217;s concerns. However, there can be no guarantee that any amendment to our NDA will result in timely approval of the product candidate or approval at all. 

Other Proprietary Product Candidates 

In addition to Primatene &#174; HFA , we have five other proprietary product candidates in development , which include two new chemical entity drug candidates. These proprietary product candidates target indications including diabetes, asthma, anticoagulants, osteoporosis and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. These product candidates incorporate a wide variety of our technical capabilities, such as particle engineering, sustained-release technology and peptide and protein analysis and utilize our inhalation and injectable delivery technologies. 

API Segment 

We began to manufacture and sell two API products, recombinant human insulin, or RHI , API and porcine insulin API , as a result of our acquisition of Merck Sharpe &#38; Dohme&#8217;s, or Merck&#8217;s, API manufacturing business in &#201;ragny &#8209;sur &#8209;Epte, France, or the Merck API Transaction , in April 2014. The purpose for the acquisition was for our vertical integration strategy as we are targeting certain finished products for the injectable insulin market. However, we continue to sell RHI to third parties, which helps fund our vertical integration strategy including the ongoing technology transfer from Merck to AFP. 

&#160; 

In July 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with MannKind Corporation, or MannKind, to supply them with RHI for use in their product Afrezza &#174; , and in January 2015, we entered into a supply option agreement with MannKind to supply additional quantities, as needed. 

&#160; 

&#160;

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 201 4 , we recorded net revenues of $2 6 . 6 million and &#160; $ 12 .0 million, respectively , &#160; from our API products. 

Acquisition of Merck&#8217;s API Manufacturing Business 

On April 30, 2014, we completed our acquisition of the Merck&#8217;s API manufacturing business in &#201;ragny-sur-Epte, France , which manufactures porcine insulin API and recombinant human insulin API. The purchase price of the transaction totaled &#8364;24.8 million, or $34.4 million &#160; on April 30, 2014 , subject to certain customary post &#8209;closing adjustments and currency exchange fluctuations. The terms of the purchase include multiple payments over four years as follows:

In order to facilitate the acquisition, we established a subsidiary in France, AFP. We will continue the current site manufacturing activities, which consist of the manufacturing of porcine insulin API and recombinant human insulin API. As part of the transaction, we have entered into various additional agreements, including various supply agreements, as well as the assignment and /or licensing of patents under which Merck was operating at this facility. In addition, certain existing customer agreements have been assigned to AFP. Currently, we are in the process of transferring the manufacturing of starting material for RHI from Merck to AFP. This process will require capital expenditures at AFP and is expected to take two or more years to complete.

On July 31, 2014, we entered in a supply agreement with MannKind , pursuant to which we will manufacture for and supply to MannKind certain quantities of RHI, for use in MannKind&#8217;s product Afrezza &#174; . Under the terms of the supply agreement, we will be responsible for manufacturing the RHI in accordance with MannKind&#8217;s specifications and agreed-upon quality standards. MannKind has agreed to purchase annual minimum quantities of RHI under the supply agreement of an aggregate amount of approximately &#8364;120.1 million, or approximately $146.0 million, in cal endar years 2015 through 2019. 

MannKind paid a non-refundable reservation fee to us in the amount of &#8364;11.0 million, o r approximately $14.0 million upon entry into the agreement. Under the agreement, the non-refundable reservation fee was considered as partial payment for the purchase commitment quantity for 2015. We classified the amount as deferred revenue. As of December 31, 2015, the full amount of the deferred revenue has been recognized. 

Unless earlier terminated, the term of the supply agreement expires on December 31, 2019 , and can be renewed for additional, successive two-year terms upon 12 month &#8217; s written notice given prior to the end of the initial term or any additional two-year term. MannKind and we each have customary termination rights, including termination for material breach that is not cured within a specific time frame or in the event of liquidation, bankruptcy, or insolvency of the other party. In addition, MannKind may terminate the supply agreement upon two years&#8217; prior written notice to us without cause or upon 30 days prior written notice to us if a controlling regulatory authority withdraws approval for Afrezza &#174; ; provided, however, in the event of a termination pursuant to either of these scenarios, the provisions of the supply agreement require MannKind to pay the full amount of all unpaid purchase commitments due over the initial term within 60 calendar days of the effective date of such termination. 

&#160;

In January 2015, we entered into a supply option agreement with MannKind, pursuant to which MannKind will have the option to purchase RHI, for use in MannKind&#8217;s product Afrezza &#174; , in addition to the amounts specified in the July 2014 s upply a greement. Under the agreement, MannKind has the option to purchase additional RHI in calendar year s 2016 through 2019. In the event MannKind elects not to exercise its minimum annual purchase option for any year, MannKind shall pay us a capacity cancellation fee. 

By mutual agreement, MannKind did not purchase the full contractually obligated amount in 2015. The 2015 sales of RHI to MannKind were $ 20.8 million. We are currently in discussions with MannKind regarding the timing of future purchases. In October 2015, MannKind informed us they were not going to exercise the option to purchase additional quantities of RHI for 2016 under the option agreement. Accordingly , MannKind paid us a capacity cancellation fee in 2015 for 2016. We recognized this payment as revenue in 2015. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

We have approximately 238 employees dedicated to research and development with expertise in areas such as pharmaceutical formulation, process development, toxicity stud ies , analytical, synthetic and physical chemistry, drug delivery, device development, equipment and engineering, clinical research statistical analysis, etc. Our focus on developing products with high barriers to market entry requires a significant investment in research and development, including clinical development. In particular, developing proprietary products that are reformulations of existing proprietary compounds often requires clinical trials to gain regulatory approval , and we have a team dedicated to designing and managing clinical trials. We have successfully completed several clinical trials for some of our product candidates and are in the process of planning clinical trials for other product candidates under development. 

We have made, and will continue to make, substantial investments in research and development. Research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were $37.1 million, $28.4 million, and $33.0 million, respectively, which represent 15%, 14% &#160; and 14% of our net revenues for that period, respectively. 

Backlog 

A significant portion of our customer shipments in any fiscal year relate to orders received and shipped in that fiscal year, resulting in low product backlog relative to total shipments. &#160; Backlog is not material and not a meaningful indicator in any given period of our ability to achieve any particular level of overall revenue or financial performance. 

Manufacturing and Facilities 

Our manufacturing facilities are located in Rancho Cucamonga and South El Monte, California; Canton, Massachusetts; &#201; ragny-sur-Epte, France; and Nanjing, China. We own or lease a total of 60 buildings at six locations in the U.S., France and China, that comprise 1.6 &#160; million square feet of manufacturing, research and development, distribution, packaging, laboratory, office and warehouse space. Our facilities are regularly inspected by the FDA in connection with our product approvals, and we believe that all of our facilities are being operated in material compliance with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations. 

We are currently expanding our facility in Nanjing, China and we expect that the investment in expanding our facility in China will require a total of up to approximately $15.0 million . We currently have contractual commitments with third parties obligating us to undertake this investment. 

We acquired Merck&#8217;s API manufacturing business in &#201; ragny-sur-Epte, France in April 2014 , which manufactures porcine insulin API and RHI API, and we expect to continue the current site activities. 

We believe that our current manufacturing capacity is adequate for the near term. We have in the past approached capacity at one of our facilities largely as a result of the FDA&#8217;s request that we reintroduce certain previously discontinued products to help cope with a nation-wide shortage of these products. We believe that these capacity issues have been ameliorated as a result of certain other manufacturers re-entering the market and increasing the production of the products that were subject to the shortage. 

&#160;

Raw Material and Other Suppliers 

We depend on suppliers for raw materials, APIs and other components that are subject to stringent FDA requirements. In some cases, we obtain raw materials, components or API s used in certain of our products from single sources. Currently we obtain the starting material, heparin USP, for our enoxaparin product, epinephrine for our Primatene &#174; HFA product candidate and API for certain of our other marketed products from single sources. If we experience difficulties acquiring sufficient quantities of required materials or products from our existing suppliers, or if our suppliers are found to be non-compliant with the FDA&#8217;s quality system regulation, or QSR, cGMPs or other applicable laws or regulations, we would be required to find alternative suppliers. Obtaining the required regulatory approvals to use alternative suppliers may be a lengthy and uncertain process during which we could lose sales. If our primary suppliers become unable or unwilling to perform, we could experience protracted delays or interruptions in the supply of materials which would ultimately delay our manufacture of products for commercial sale, which could materially and adversely affect our development programs, commercial activities, operating results and financial condition. 

If our suppliers encounter problems during manufacturing, establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these materials may take a substantial period of time, as suppliers must be approved by the FDA. Further, a significant portion of our raw materials may be available only from foreign sources, which are subject to the special risks of doing business abroad. For example, heparin USP is the starting material for the production of the API in our enoxaparin product. We have established a supply chain for heparin that originates in China and have implemented validated technology processes designed to screen and test incoming starting material, which includes methods currently required by the FDA. However, the FDA has required companies importing heparin to test imported heparin using specific screening methods to detect certain contaminants and it has increased its scrutiny of Chinese facilities that produce heparin for the U.S. market. For example, in August 2008, the FDA inspected two facilities in China belonging to suppliers in our heparin supply chain and issued warning letters, one of which needed to be resolved as a precondition to approving the ANDA for our enoxaparin product candidate in September 2011. If the facility owned by our ANP subsidiary is qualified by the FDA, we plan to have ANP provide us with starting materials for the manufacture of API for enoxaparin. We also plan to have our subsidiar ies eventually manufacture APIs for not only enoxaparin, but also our other products and product candidates. 

Sales and Marketing 

Our products are primarily marketed and sold to hospitals, long-term care facilities, alternate care sites, clinics and doctors&#8217; offices. Most of these facilities are members of one or more group purchasing organizations, which negotiate collective purchasing agreements on behalf of their members. These facilities purchase products through specialty distributors and wholesalers. We have relationships with the major group purchasing organizations in the U.S. We also have relationships with major specialty distributors, wholesalers and retailers who distribute pharmaceutical products nationwide.

In June 2015, Actavis plc adopted Allergan plc as its new global name. 

&#160; 

Our marketing department is responsible for establishing and maintaining contracts and relationships with the group purchasing organizations, distributors, retailers, wholesalers and, occasionally, directly with hospitals or long-term care 

&#160;

facilities. One or more of our proprietary product candidates may require deployment of a sales force either directly or through a strategic partner. 

Under an agreement with Allergan plc, or Allergan, we are paid a fixed cost per unit of our enoxaparin product sold to A llergan and also share in the gross profits from Allergan sales of the product in the U.S. retail pharmacy market. We may enter into similar agreements with distributors or strategic partners in the future. 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, we generated 2%, 4% and 1% of our total revenue, respectively, from customers located outside of the United States. Other financial information about our segment and geographic areas is incorporated herein by reference to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. 

Competition 

The majority of our marketed products are generic products. We face and will face significant competition for our products and product candidates from pharmaceutical companies that focus on the generic injectable and inhalation markets such as Hospira , Inc., Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Akorn, Inc., Sandoz Inc., Mylan Inc. , Fresenius Kabi USA and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Competition in the generic pharmaceutical industry has increased as producers of branded products have entered the business by creating generic drug subsidiaries, purchasing generic drug companies, or licensing their products to generic manufacturers prior to patent expiration and/or as their patents expire. Therefore, our competitors also include the innovator companies of our generic drug products. For example, enoxaparin is currently marketed by Sanofi S.A., or Sanofi, under the brand name Lovenox &#174; . Sanofi also markets its authorized generic enoxaparin product through its subsidiary, Winthrop , and also through Fresenius Kabi USA . Sandoz and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. also market a generic version of enoxaparin. Other companies may have filed an ANDA with the FDA for its generic version of enoxaparin. The presence of these current and prospective competitive products may have an adverse effect on our market share, revenue and gross profit from our enoxaparin product. 

Similarly, we will face significant competition for our proprietary product candidates. Our competitors vary depending upon product categories, and within each product category, upon dosage strengths and drug-delivery systems. Based on total assets, annual revenues and market capitalization, we are smaller than many of our national and international competitors with respect to both our generic and proprietary products and product candidates. Many of our competitors have been in business for a longer period of time, have a greater number of products on the market and have greater financial and other resources than we do. It is also possible that developments by our competitors will make our generic or proprietary products and product candidates noncompetitive or obsolete. 

For pharmaceutical companies, the most important competitive factors are scope of product line, ability to timely develop new products and relationships with group purchasing organizations, retailers, wholesalers and customers. Sales of generic pharmaceutical products tend to follow a pattern based on regulatory and competitive factors. As patents for brand-name products and related exclusivity periods expire, the first generic pharmaceutical manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for generic versions of products is typically able to achieve significant market penetration and higher margins. As competing generic manufacturers receive regulatory approval on the same products, market size, revenue and gross profit typically decline. The level of market share and price will be affected, which will in turn affect the revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic pharmaceutical product. This impact is normally related to the number of competitors in that product&#8217;s market and the timing of that product&#8217;s regulatory approval. We must develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost-effective manner and identify products with significant barriers to market entry in order to grow our business. 

&#160;

Government Regulation and Price Constraints 

In the United States 

General 

Pharmaceutical companies and their prescription brand and generic pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, the Public Health Service Act of 1944, or PHSA, and regulations implementing those statutes, with regard to the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion of such products, and by comparable agencies and laws in foreign countries. For many drugs (drugs falling within the definition of &#8220;new drug&#8221; in the FFDCA), FDA approval is required before the product can be marketed in the U.S. All applications for FDA approval must contain, among other things, comprehensive and scientifically reliable information relating to pharmaceutical formulation, stability, manufacturing, processing, packaging, labeling and quality control. These applications must also contain data and information related to safety, effectiveness, bioavailability and/or bioequivalence. 

In addition, many of our activities are subject to the jurisdiction of other federal regulatory and enforcement departments and agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, the Federal Trade Commission (which also has the authority to regulate the advertising of consumer healthcare products, including OTC drugs), the Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, the Veterans Administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws. 

FDA Approval and Regulatory Considerations 

Prescription generic and branded pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the FFDCA and PHSA and regulations implementing those statutes, with regard to the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising and promotion of such products, and regulation by other state, federal and foreign agencies under the laws that they enforce. For many drugs (drugs falling within the definition of &#8220;new drug&#8221; in the FFDCA), including the drugs in our current drug portfolio, FDA approval is required before marketing in the U.S. Applications for FDA drug approval must generally contain, among other things, information relating to pharmaceutical formulation, stability, manufacturing, processing, packaging, labeling, quality control and either safety and effectiveness or bioequivalence. There are two drug approval processes under the FFDCA &#8212; an ANDA approval process for generic drugs and an NDA approval process for new drugs that cannot be approved in ANDAs. For drugs that are &#8220;biological products&#8221; within the meaning of the PHSA, there are two different approva l processes &#8212; a biological license application, or BLA, approval process for original biological products and a biosimilar application approval process for biosimilar products that are approved based on their similarity to biologicals that were previously approved in BLAs. 

The ANDA Approval Process 

Our generic drug product candidates cannot be lawfully marketed unless we obtain FDA approval. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as &#8220;the Hatch-Waxman Act,&#8221; established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be bioequivalent to drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process, which are commonly referred to as the &#8220;innovator&#8221; or &#8220;reference&#8221; drugs. Approval to market and distribute these bioequivalent drugs is obtained by filing an ANDA with the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the API, drug product formulation, specifications, stability, analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data, quality control procedures and bioequivalence. Rather than demonstrating safety and effectiveness, an ANDA applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to an approved reference drug. In certain situations, an applicant may submit an ANDA for a product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a reference drug based upon FDA approval of an ANDA Suitability Petition. The FDA will approve an ANDA Suitability Petition if it finds that the product does not raise questions of safety and efficacy requiring new clinical data. ANDAs generally cannot be 

&#160;

submitted for products that are not bioequivalent to the referenced drug or that are labeled for a use that is not approved for the reference drug. Applicants seeking to market such products can submit an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA with supportive data from clinical trials. 

Upon approval of an NDA or ANDA, the FDA lists the product in a publication entitled &#8220;Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,&#8221; which is commonly known as the &#8220;Orange Book.&#8221; In the case of an NDA, the FDA also lists patents identified by the NDA applicant as claiming the drug or an approved method of using the drug. Any applicant who files an ANDA must certify to the FDA with regard to each relevant patent that (1) no patent information has been submitted to the FDA; (2) the patent has expired; (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the ANDA is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification. A notice of the Paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA refers. If the NDA holder submits the patent information to FDA prior to submission of the ANDA and the NDA holder or patent owner(s) sues the ANDA applicant for infringement within 45 days of its receipt of the certification notice, the FDA is prevented from approving that ANDA until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the Paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. An ANDA applicant that is sued for infringement may file a counterclaim to challenge the listing of the patent or information submitted to FDA about the patent. 

Generally, if an ANDA applicant (1) files a substantially complete ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification on the first day that any ANDA applicant files an application with such a certification based on the same reference drug and (2) provides appropriate notice to the NDA holder, and all patent owner(s) for a particular generic product, the applicant may be awarded a delay in the approval of other subsequently filed ANDAs with Paragraph IV certifications based on the same reference drug. This statutory delay is commonly referred to as 180-day exclusivity. A substantially complete ANDA is one that contains all the information required by the statute and the FDA&#8217;s regulations, including the results of any required bioequivalence studies. The FDA may refuse to accept the filing of an ANDA that is not substantially complete or may determine during substantive review of the ANDA that additional information, such as an additional bioequivalence study, is required to support approval. Such a determination may affect an applicant&#8217;s first to file status and eligibility for 180-day exclusivity. The MMA provides that the 180-day exclusivity delay ends 180 days after the first commercial marketing of the ANDA product. This exclusivity may be forfeited under a number of different circumstances, including: (1) failure to market within certain prescribed periods of time following certain events related to submission of the application, approval of the application, court decisions and settlements and patent withdrawals from the Orange Book; (2) an amendment or withdrawal of the Paragraph IV certification or certifications upon which the exclusivity was based; (3) failure to obtain tentative approval within certain prescribed time periods (30, 36, or 40 months after submission of the ANDA); (4) an agreement with the NDA holder, patent owner or another ANDA applicant that is determined by a court or the FTC to violate provisions of antitrust laws; (5) withdrawal of the ANDA; or (6) expiration of patent or patents upon which exclusivity is based. 

The 180-day exclusivity provisions described above were passed in the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, and do not apply where the first ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification submitted for the reference drug was filed before December 8, 2003. In this circumstance, the pre-MMA exclusivity provisions apply. Under these provisions, the 180-day exclusivity delay ends 180 days after the first commercial marketing of the ANDA product or a court decision holding the patent invalid, unenforceable or not infringed, whichever comes first. In addition, under the pre-MMA exclusivity provisions, exclusivity is awarded separately to the first applicant or applicants submitting an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification for each patent, resulting in the possibility that different ANDA applicants will hold different exclusivities on different patents, resulting in situations in which an applicant that holds an exclusivity on one patent is subject to another applicant&#8217;s exclusivity on a different patent. The FDA has addressed these situations through policies involving exclusivity sharing. The pre-MMA exclusivity provisions do not provide for exclusivity forfeiture. 

ANDA approvals can be delayed by exclusivities awarded to the holder of the NDA for the reference drug. The FFDCA provides five-year exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, or NCE, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other drug containing the same active moiety. This exclusivity 

&#160;

generally prohibits the submission of an ANDA for any drug product containing the same active moiety during the five-year exclusivity period. However, submission of an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification is permitted after four years, and if a patent infringement lawsuit is brought within 45 days after such certification, FDA approval of the ANDA is delayed until 7.5 years after the NCE approval date. The FFDCA also provides three-year exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs for product changes that require new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant. These changes include, among other things, new indications, dosage forms, routes of administration or strengths of an existing drug and new uses. 

ANDA approvals can also be delayed by orphan drug exclusivity, pediatric exclusivity and exclusivity for certain new antibiotic drugs. The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. Seven-year orphan drug exclusivity is available to a product that has orphan drug designation and that receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which the drug has such designation. Orphan drug exclusivity prevents approval of another application for the same drug, for the same orphan indication, for a period of seven years, regardless of whether the application is a full NDA or an ANDA, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to an existing exclusivity or statutory delay in approval resulting from a patent certification. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent delay, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued written request for such a study. The FFDCA also provides exclusivity for certain antibiotic drugs for serious or life-threatening infections that FDA designates as &#8220;qualified infectious disease products.&#8221; This exclusivity extends other exclusivities for the same drug by five years, but does not extend patent-related delays in approval. 

The NDA Approval Process 

The NDA approval process is generally far more demanding than the ANDA process, depending on whether the applicant is submitting a &#8220;full NDA&#8221; containing all of the data and information required for approval of a new drug or a &#8220;Section 505(b)(2) NDA&#8221; which is a more limited submission that is generally utilized for modifications to previously approved products. 

The &#8220;Full NDA&#8221; 

The approval process for a full NDA generally involves: 

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must satisfy the FDA and become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use; 

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations; and 

&#183; 

submission to and approval by the FDA of an NDA. 

Before human clinical trials can begin on a new drug, the results of preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND and the FDA must permit the IND to become effective. Each clinical trial under an IND must be reviewed and approved by an independent Institutional 

&#160;

Review Board, or IRB. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. These phases generally include: 

&#183; 

Phase 1, during which the drug is introduced into healthy human subjects or, on occasion, patients and is tested for safety, stability, dose tolerance and metabolism; 

&#183; 

Phase 2, during which the drug is introduced into a limited patient population to determine the efficacy of the product in specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and 

&#183; 

Phase 3, during which the clinical trial is expanded to a larger and more diverse patient group at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites to further evaluate the drug and ultimately to demonstrate effectiveness. 

The IND sponsor, the FDA or the IRB may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including failure to follow appropriate ethical trial protocols, failure to provide adequate protections for trial participants or a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. 

The results of preclinical animal studies and human clinical studies, together with other detailed (e.g., information relating to pharmaceutical formulation, stability, manufacturing, processing, packaging, labeling, quality control) are submitted to the FDA in the NDA. 

The Section 505(b)(2) NDA 

For modifications to products previously approved by the FDA, an applicant may file an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA. This section permits the filing of an NDA where some or all of the data required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Under this section, an applicant may rely on the approval of another NDA or on studies published in the scientific literature. The applicant may be required to conduct additional studies or provide additional information to fully demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of its modification to the approved product. 

Where a Section 505(b)(2) applicant relies on the FDA&#8217;s approval of another NDA, the applicant is required to submit the same types of patent certifications as are required for an ANDA. As in the case of an ANDA, a Paragraph IV certification challenging one or more of the patents listed for the reference drug will require notice to the patent owner(s) and NDA holder and will permit a patent infringement suit that may result in a 30-month stay in the approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA. The approval of a Section 505(b)(2) NDA may also be delayed by the NCE, three-year, orphan drug, pediatric and new antibiotic exclusivities that are applicable to ANDAs as discussed above. 

The Biosimilar Application Approval Process 

The BPCIA, passed by Congress in 2010, amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for follow-on biologics. This approval pathway is available for &#8220;biosimilar&#8221; products, which are products that are highly similar to biologics that have been approved in BLAs under the PHSA notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components. A biosimilar application must contain information demonstrating (1) biosimilarity to the reference product, (2) sameness of strength, dosage form, route of administration and mechanism(s) of action with the reference product (where known), (3) approval of the reference product for the indication(s) proposed for the biosimilar product and (4) appropriate manufacturing facilities. FDA will approve the application based on a finding of biosimilarity or interchangeability with the reference product. A finding of biosimilarity must be based on (1) a demonstration that the products are &#8220;highly similar&#8221; notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, (2) animal studies, including an assessment of toxicity, and (3) a clinical study or studies (including an assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) sufficient to show the safety, purity and potency of the proposed product for one or more &#8220;appropriate&#8221; conditions of use for which licensure is sought and for which the reference product is licensed, unless FDA waives a specific requirement. The definition of &#8220;biosimilar&#8221; requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and reference product with regard to safety, purity and potency. 

&#160;

An applicant with a pending or approved biosimilar application may seek an FDA determination that its product is interchangeable with the reference drug. In addition to demonstrating biosimilarity to the reference product, the biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that its product can be expected to yield the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient. If the biosimilar product may be administered more than once to a patient, the applicant must demonstrate that the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between the biosimilar and reference products is not greater than the risk of continued administration of the reference product. The PHSA provides that a determination of interchangeability means that the biosimilar product may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. The first biosimilar determined to be interchangeable with a particular reference product for any condition of use is protected by an exclusivity that delays an FDA determination of interchangeability with regard to any other biosimilar application. The exclusivity delays the subsequent interchangeability determination until the earlier of: (1) one year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable product; (2) 18 months after resolution of a patent infringement suit based on a final court decision regarding all of the patents in the litigation or dismissal of the litigation with or without prejudice; (3) 42 months after approval of the first interchangeable biosimilar biological product, if an expedited patent action was commenced against the applicant under section 351(l)(6) and the litigation is still pending; or (4) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable product if the reference product sponsor did not sue the biosimilar applicant for infringement under the patent resolution provisions of the PHSA. 

The PHSA provides a number of exclusivity protections for reference products that may delay submission and approval of biosimilar applications. The PHSA delays submission of a biosimilar application until four years after the date on which the reference product was first licensed and delays final approval of a biosimilar application until twelve years after the first licensure of the reference product. The first-licensure requirement precludes an additional period of exclusivity for a supplement to the original application for the reference product. It also precludes exclusivity for an entirely new BLA in certain circumstances. A new BLA submitted by a sponsor or manufacturer of a previously approved biologic would not be protected by exclusivity for (1) a non-structural change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or (2) a structural change that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. As in the case of NDAs approved under the FFDCA, BLAs may be entitled to orphan exclusivity and to pediatric exclusivity. 

The BPCIA amended the definition of biological product to include proteins (other than synthetic polypeptides). Applications for biological products, including proteins, must now be approved under the PHSA rather than under the FFDCA. The BPCIA provides a grandfather exception for biologics falling within a product class for which FDA has approved an application under the FFDCA. Applications for approval of these types of proteins may be submitted under the FFDCA until March 23, 2020 , unless there is a biological product licensed under the PHSA that could serve as a reference product for a biosimilar application. 

Under the PHSA, patents are not listed in the Orange Book and companies submitting biosimilar applications are not required to submit patent certifications. Patent disputes are resolved outside of the FDA regulatory process. The biosimilar applicant must share the contents of its biosimilar application and information on its manufacturing processes with counsel for the company holding the BLA for the reference drug. The biosimilar applicant and BLA holder must exchange information about relevant patents and seek agreement on patents to be litigated under an expedited litigation procedure. 

The BLA Approval Process 

The BLA approval process is similar to the &#8220;Full NDA&#8221; approval process and generally involves: 

&#183; 

completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s GLP regulations; 

&#183; 

submission to the FDA of an IND for human clinical testing, which must satisfy FDA and become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 

&#183; 

performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use; 

&#160;

&#183; 

satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations; and 

&#183; 

submission to and approval by the FDA of a BLA. 

&#183; 

A combination product is a product comprising of two or more regulated components (e.g., a drug and device) that are combined into a single product, co-packaged, or sold separately but intended for co-administration, as evidenced by the labeling for the products. A drug that is administered using an inhaler is an example of a combination drug/device product. 

&#183; 

T he FDA is divided into various Centers, which each have authority over a specific type of product. NDAs are reviewed by personnel within the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, while device applications and premarket notifications are reviewed by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH. When reviewing a drug/device combination product, the FDA must assign a lead Center to review the product, based on the combination product's primary mode of action, or PMOA, which is the single mode of a combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action of the combination product. The Center that regulates that portion of the product that generates the PMOA becomes the lead evaluator. If there are two independent modes of action, neither of which is subordinate to the other, the FDA makes a determination as to which Center to assign the product based on consistency with other combination products raising similar types of safety and effectiveness questions or to the Center with the most expertise in evaluating the most significant safety and effectiveness questions raised by the combination product. 

&#183; 

W hen evaluating an application, a lead Center may consult other Centers and apply the standards that would be applicable but still retain complete reviewing authority, or it may collaborate with another Center, by which the Center assigns review of a specific section of the application to another Center, delegating its review authority for that section. Typically, the FDA requires a single marketing application submitted to the Center selected to be the lead evaluator, although the agency has the discretion to require separate applications to more than one Center. One reason to submit multiple applications is if the applicant wishes to receive some benefit that accrues only from approval under a particular type of application, like new drug product exclusivity. If multiple applications are submitted, each may be evaluated by a different lead Center. 

&#183; 

O ur inhalers, which deliver a specific drug, are regulated by t he FDA as combination product. We believe the combination product will be regulated by the FDA as a drug (and not a device) because the primary mode of action of the comb ination will be a drug action. As such, we will need to submit a marketing application to the CD ER for our inhalers that deliver a specific drug. CDRH will provide input to CDER on the device aspects of the combination. We can provide no assurance that any of our combination products will be approved by FDA in a timely fashion, if at all. 

&#183; 

L ike their constituent products&#8212;e.g., drugs and devices&#8212;combination products are highly regulated and subject to a broad range of post marketing requirements including cGMPs, adverse event reporting, periodic reports, labeling and advertising and promotion requirements and restrictions, market withdrawal and recall. 

FDA Action on an Application for Approval 

If applicable statutory or regulatory requirements are not satisfied, the FDA may deny approval of an NDA, ANDA, BLA, or biosimilar application, or the FDA may require additional data or information. After approval of the application, the FDA may suspend or withdraw the approval based on various criteria, including new information related to safety or effectiveness or failure to comply with post-approval requirements. In addition, the FDA may in some instances require post-marketing studies on approved products and may take actions to limit marketing of the product based on the results of those studies. 

&#160;

The new drug and biological product approval processes may take years, and the time may vary substantially based upon the type of application and the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon a manufacturer&#8217;s activities. Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be subject to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product receives regulatory approval, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal of the product from the market. 

Manufacturing (cGMP) Requirements 

We and our contract manufacturers and other suppliers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA&#8217;s cGMP regulations. These cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. The manufacturing facilities for our products must meet cGMP requirements to the satisfaction of the FDA before FDA will approve our products and we must continue to meet these requirements after our products are approved. We and our third-party manufacturers and other suppliers are subject to periodic inspections of facilities by the FDA and other authorities to assess our compliance with applicable regulations. 

Other Regulatory Requirements 

Maintaining substantial compliance with appropriate federal, state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Drug manufacturers are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. After approval, the FDA and these state agencies conduct periodic unannounced inspections to ensure continued compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements. 

In addition, after approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. The FDA may require post-approval testing and surveillance programs to monitor safety and effectiveness of approved products that have been commercialized. Any drug products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including: 

&#183; 

record-keeping requirements; 

&#183; 

reporting of adverse experiences with the drug; 

&#183; 

providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; 

&#183; 

reporting on advertisements and promotional labeling; 

&#183; 

drug sampling and distribution requirements; and 

&#183; 

complying with electronic record and signature requirements. 

In addition, the FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. There are numerous regulations and policies that govern various means for disseminating information to health-care professionals, as well as consumers, including industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, information provided to the media and information provided over the Internet. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. 

&#160;

FDA Enforcement Authority 

The FDA has very broad enforcement authority and the failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in administrative or judicial sanctions being imposed on us or on the manufacturers and distributors of our approved products, including warning letters, refusals of government contracts, clinical holds, civil penalties, injunctions (which may in some circumstances involve restitution, disgorgement or profits, recalls and/or total or partial suspension of production or distribution), seizure of products, withdrawal of approvals, refusal to approve pending applications and criminal prosecution of the company and company officials that may result in fines and incarceration. FDA has authority to inspect manufacturing facilities as well as other facilities in which drug products are held, packaged or stored, to determine compliance with cGMP and other requirements under the FDCA. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. In addition, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. 

We are also subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on us. 

From January 19 through January 22, 2015, our facility in &#201;ragny-Sur-Epte, France was subject to an inspection by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (Agence nationale de s&#233;curit&#233; du m&#233;dicament et des produits de sant&#233;), or ANSM. The inspection included a review of current EU Good Manufacturing Practices, or EU-GMP for Medicinal Products for Human and Veterinary Use (EU-GMP Part II for Active Substances) and Manufacture of Biological Active Substances and Medicinal Products for Human Use (EU-GMP Annex 2). The inspections resulted in various observations issued formally to the facility. We responded to those observations on March 13, 2015, with a minor follow up response on April 3, 2015. We received acknowledgment from ANSM that our responses to the observations were satisfactorily addressed and was issued a certificate of EU-GMP compliance from the Agency dated April 9, 2015, that is valid until January 2018. 

&#160; 

From July 22, 2015 through August 10, 2015, our IMS facility in South El Monte, CA was subject to an inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of our compliance with cGMP regulations and preapproval inspections for abbreviated new drug applications currently being reviewed by the FDA. The inspections resulted in multiple observations on Form 483. We responded to those observations on August 31, 2015. &#160; We believe that our responses to the Form 483 will satisfy the FDA and that no significant further actions will be necessary. 

&#160; 

From February 29, 2016 through March 4, 2016, our facility in &#201;ragny-sur-Epte, France was subject to an inspection by the FDA. The inspection included a review of Quality Systems, Production Controls, Laboratory Controls, Material Management, and Facilities and Equipment Maintenance. The inspection resulted in multiple observations on Form 483. We plan to respond to those observations by March 25, 2016. 

&#160; 

Foreign Regulatory Requirements 

&#160; 

Outside the U.S., our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the European Union registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one European Union member state. The regulatory authority generally will grant marketing authorization if it is satisfied that we have presented it with adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Prescription Drug Wrap-Up 

&#160; 

When Congress passed the FFDCA in 1938, it required that &#8220;new drugs&#8221; be approved based on their safety. In 1962, Congress amended the FFDCA to require that sponsors demonstrate that new drugs are effective, as well as safe, in order to receive FDA approval. We refer to these provisions as the &#8220;1962 Amendments.&#8221; The 1962 Amendments also required the FDA to conduct a retrospective evaluation of the efficacy of the drug products that the FDA approved between 1938 and 1962 on the basis of safety alone. The FDA contracted with the National Academy of Science/National Research Council, or the NAS/NRC, to make an initial evaluation of the efficacy of many of these drug products. The FDA&#8217;s administrative implementation of the NAS/NRC reports was called the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation, or the DESI. 

Drugs that were not subject to applications approved between 1938 and 1962 were not subject to DESI review. For a period of time, the FDA did not challenge the marketing of these drugs without approval. In 1984, however, spurred by serious adverse reactions to one of these products and concerns expressed by Congress, FDA undertook an assessment of the products under an initiative known as the &#8220;Prescription Drug Wrap-Up.&#8221; Most of these drugs contain active ingredients that were first marketed prior to the enactment of the FFDCA. Several of our marketed pharmaceutical products fall within this category. 

The FDA has asserted that all drugs subject to the Prescription Drug Wrap-Up are on the market illegally unless they fall within two &#8220;grandfather&#8221; exceptions to the new drug definition. The first is a provision in the new drug definition exempting drugs that were on the market prior to the passage of the FFDCA and that contain the same representations concerning the conditions of use as they did prior to passage of the FFDCA. The 1962 Amendments also exempt drugs that were not new drugs prior to the passage of the 1962 Amendments and that have the same composition and labeling as they had prior to the passage of the 1962 Amendments. The FDA and the courts have interpreted these two exceptions very narrowly. Therefore, the FDA could commence enforcement action at any time regarding any or all of our unapproved prescription products. 

The FDA has adopted a risk-based enforcement policy that prioritizes enforcement of new drug requirements for these and other unapproved drugs that pose safety concerns, lack evidence of efficacy, prevent patients from pursuing effective therapies, are marketed fraudulently, violate other provisions of the FFDCA, such as cGMP requirements, or directly compete with approved drugs. The FDA has indicated that approval of an NDA for one drug within a class of drugs marketed without FDA approval may trigger agency enforcement of the new drug requirements. Once the FDA issues an approved NDA for one of the drug products at issue or completes the efficacy review for that drug product, it may require other manufacturers to also obtain approval for that same drug in order to continue marketing it in the U.S. While the FDA generally provides sponsors a one-year grace period, the agency is not statutorily required to do so. 

Fraud and Abuse Laws 

Because of the significant federal funding involved in Medicare and Medicaid, Congress and the states have enacted, and actively enforce, a number of laws to eliminate fraud and abuse in federal health care programs. Our business is subject to compliance with these laws. 

Federal False Claims Act 

Another development affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and in particular, action s brought pursuant to the False Claims Act&#8217;s &#8220;whistleblower&#8221; or &#8220;qui tam&#8221; provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal health care program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government and to share in any monetary recovery. In recent years, the number of suits brought against health care providers by private individuals has increased dramatically. In addition, various states have enacted false claims law s analogous to the False Claims Act, and many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a federal or other governmental health care program. 

&#160;

When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate instance of a false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability arises, primarily, when an entity knowingly submits, or causes another to submit, a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The federal government has used the False Claims Act to assert liability on the basis of inadequate care, kickbacks and other improper referrals, and improper use of Medicare numbers when detailing the provider of services, in addition to the more predictable allegations of misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. In addition, the federal government has prosecuted companies under the False Claims Act in connection with off-label promotion of products. Our current and future activities relating to the reporting of wholesale or estimated retail prices of our products, the reporting of discount and rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement of our products , and the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. While we are unaware of any current matters, we are unable to predict whether we will be subject to actions under the False Claims Act or a similar state law, or the impact of such actions. However, the costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance. 

The Sunshine Act 

The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers that participate in Medicare, Medicaid or the Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third party as directed by that entity, to physicians and teaching hospitals or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals. The payments required to be reported include the cost of meals provided to a physician, travel reimbursements and other transfers of value provided as part of contracted services , including speaker programs, advisory boards, consultation services and clinical trial services. The statute requires the federal government to make reported information available to the public. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 for each payment or other transfer of value that is not reported (up to a maximum per annual report of $150,000) and from $10,000 to $100,000 for each knowing failure to report (up to a maximum per annual report of $1.0 million). Additionally, there are criminal penalties if an entity intentionally makes false statements in such reports. We are subject to the Sunshine Act and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering adopting similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. 

Environmental Considerations 

We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, both U.S. and foreign , including those promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Air Quality Management District, which govern activities and operations that may have adverse environmental effects such as discharges to air, soil and water, as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes. Because we own and operate real property, t hese laws impose strict liability for the costs of cleaning up, and for damages resulting from, sites of past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous substances and materials . These laws and regulations may also require us to pay for the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at properties operated by us and at off-site locations where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. If it is determined that our operations or facilities are not in compliance with current environmental laws, we could be subject to fines and penalties, the amount of which could be material. 

The costs of complying with various applicable environmental requirements, as they now exist or as may be altered in the future, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, as a result of environmental concerns about the use of CFCs, the FDA issued a final rule on January 16, 2009 that required the phase-out of the CFC version of our Primatene &#174; Mist product by December 31, 2011. This phase out caused us to halt sales of the CFC version of our Primatene &#174; Mist product subsequent to December 31, 2011 and write off our inventory for the product, which had an adverse effect on our financial results. 

&#160;

We have made and will continue to make expenditures to comply with current and future U.S. and foreign environmental laws and regulations . We anticipate that we will incur additional capital and operating costs in the future to comply with existing environmental laws and new requirements arising from new or amended statutes and regulations. We cannot accurately predict the impact and costs that future regulations will impose on our business. 

Other Regulations 

We also must comply with data protection and data privacy requirements. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations regarding privacy, security and protection of employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs for us, as well as significant fines, penalties and damage to our global reputation and our brand as a result of non-compliance. 

Intellectual Property 

Our success depends on our ability to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. However, we cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties will have a materially adverse effect on our ability to make, use, or sell any products. A number of pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover aspects of our, or our licensors&#8217; products, product candidates, or other technologies. 

We primarily rely on trade secrets, unpatented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to protect our products and technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. Although in some cases we seek patent protection to preserve our competitive position, our current patent portfolio does not cover the majority of our existing products and product candidates. We own several U.S. and foreign patents covering processes and equipment used in the manufacture of a few of our products. The expiration dates of these patents range from 2020 to 202 8 . 

W e own a U .S. patent covering Primatene &#174; HFA: U .S. Patent Number 8,367,734, or the &#8220;&#8216;734 patent,&#8221; which was issued on February 5, 2013, and expires in January 2026. W e have several patent applications that are currently pending. The majority of our significant products or product candidates are not covered by any U .S. or foreign patents related to formulations or compositions. Indeed, many of our products and product candidates are generic products, and therefore may not be eligible for patent protection. For example, our enoxaparin product is a generic product, and as such, it is not covered by any U .S. or foreign patents. Other of our products, including Amphadase &#174; , are based on compounds for which any applicable patents have expired, or which were not patented by Amphastar in the first instance because they are older compounds. As for the remainder of our product candidates that are not intended to be generic products , we may seek to obtain patent rights or rely on trade secret protection (but , in any case, the majority of our products and product candidates are not currently covered by any U .S. or foreign patents). 

We may not be able to obtain patent or other forms of protection for inventions or other intellectual property developed by our officers, employees, or consultants because we might not have been the first to file or to invent the patentable technology or others may have independently developed similar or alternative technology. We also own several trademarks registered with the USPTO and one trademark registered with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office. 

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary information through the use of confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Other parties may also independently develop know-how or obtain unauthorized access to our technologies. 

Intellectual property protection is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Our patents and those for which we have or will license rights may be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, and the rights granted in those patents may not provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us. We and our licensors may not be able to develop patentable products. Even if a patent application is filed, some or all of the patent claims may not be allowed, the patent itself may not issue, or in the event of issuance, the issued claims may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us. 

&#160;

Third-party patent applications and patents could reduce the coverage of the patents licensed, or that may be licensed to, or owned by us. If patents containing competitive or conflicting claims are issued to third parties, we may be enjoined from the commercialization of products or be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology. In addition, other parties may duplicate, design around or independently develop similar or alternative technologies to ours or those of our licensors. 

Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of another party&#8217;s proprietary rights. USPTO interference proceedings may be necessary if we and another party both claim to have invented the same subject matter. Even if we ultimately prevail, we could incur substantial costs and our management&#8217;s attention would be diverted if: 

&#183; 

litigation is required to defend against patent suits brought by third parties; 

&#183; 

we participate in patent suits brought against or initiated by our licensors; 

&#183; 

we initiate suits against third parties who are infringing on our patents; or 

&#183; 

we participate in an interference or other similar USPTO proceeding. 

However, even if we pursue litigation or other action to protect our intellectual property rights, we may not prevail in any of these actions or proceedings.
