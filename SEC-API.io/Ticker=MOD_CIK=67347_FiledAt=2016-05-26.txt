History

Modine was incorporated under the laws of the State of Wisconsin on June 23, 1916 by its founder, Arthur B. Modine. Mr. Modine&#8217;s &#8220;Turbotube&#8221; radiators became standard equipment on the famous Ford Motor Company Model T. When he died at the age of 95, A.B. Modine had personally been granted more than 120 U.S. patents for his heat transfer innovations. On the cusp of our 100th year in business, the standard of innovation exemplified by A.B. Modine remains the cornerstone of Modine today.

Our fiscal year ends on March 31 and, accordingly, all references to a particular year mean the fiscal year ended March 31 of that year, unless indicated otherwise.

Business Strategy and Results

We focus on thermal management leadership and highly engineered product and service innovations for diversified, global markets and customers. We create value by focusing on customer partnerships and providing innovative solutions for our customers' thermal management challenges using cost-effective designs and material technology.

&#160; 

During fiscal 2016, we launched our Strengthen, Diversify and Grow strategic transformation in order to position our business for long-term success. We aim to strengthen our business by, among other things, i) right-sizing our cost structure and ii) implementing a more global, product-based organization to capture synergies across our core business, effectively meet the needs of our global customers, and improve our speed to market. In addition, we aim to diversify through expanding our non-vehicular businesses, and grow through both organic and inorganic opportunities.

&#160; 

Our top five customers are in three different markets &#8211; automotive, commercial vehicle, and off-highway &#8211; and our ten largest customers accounted for 63 percent of both our fiscal 2016 and 2015 sales. In fiscal 2016, 63 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 54 percent of total sales generated by foreign operations and 9 percent generated by exports from the U.S. In fiscal 2015, 64 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 55 percent of total sales generated by foreign operations and 9 percent generated by exports from the U.S. In fiscal 2014, 66 percent of our total sales were generated from customers outside of the U.S., with 56 percent of total sales generated by foreign operations and 10 percent generated by exports from the U.S.

&#160;

During fiscal 2016, our consolidated sales were $1.35 billion, a 10 percent decrease from $1.50 billion in fiscal 2015. The decrease from fiscal 2015 was primarily due to a $110 million unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes associated with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and lower sales volume to off-highway customers due to market weakness. During fiscal 2016, we completed a voluntary lump-sum payout program offered to certain eligible former employees participating in our U.S. pension plans. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. As a result of lump-sum payouts during fiscal 2016, we recorded $42 million of non-cash pension settlement losses to costs of sales ($9 million) and selling, general, and administrative (&#8220;SG&#38;A&#8221;) expenses ($33 million). Gross profit decreased $23 million to $224 million in fiscal 2016 compared with the prior year, primarily due to the pension settlement losses and an unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. SG&#38;A expenses increased to $205 million in fiscal 2016, compared with $184 million in fiscal 2015, primarily due to the pension settlement losses.

In an effort to optimize our cost structure and improve efficiency of our operations, we have engaged in various restructuring activities in recent years, including in fiscal 2016, in support of our Strengthen, Diversify and Grow strategic platform. As a result, we recorded $17 million of restructuring expenses during fiscal 2016. In addition, we recorded a $10 million asset impairment charge related to a manufacturing facility in Germany. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Also during fiscal 2016, we recorded a $10 million gain within other income related to an insurance settlement for equipment losses resulting from a fire at a manufacturing facility in the U.K. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Our operating loss was $8 million in fiscal 2016, which compares to operating income of $53 million in the prior year. This decline in earnings was primarily due to $42 million of pension settlement losses, higher restructuring expenses, and an unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

A key metric by which we measure our performance is return on average capital employed (&#8220;ROACE&#8221;). We define ROACE as operating income, less restructuring expenses, impairment charges, certain other adjustments, income tax at a 30 percent rate, and earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest; divided by the average of debt plus Modine shareholders&#8217; equity. We have established a long-term goal of achieving ROACE of 15 percent. Our ROACE improved 60 basis points in fiscal 2016 to 8.4 percent compared with 7.8 percent in fiscal 2015. The increase in ROACE in fiscal 2016 primarily resulted from a decrease in the shareholders&#8217; equity component of capital employed. This decrease in shareholders&#8217; equity was primarily attributable to $68 million of foreign currency translation losses, most of which occurred in late fiscal 2015.

&#160;

ROACE is not a measure derived under generally accepted accounting principles (&#8220;GAAP&#8221;) and should not be considered as a substitute for any measure derived in accordance with GAAP. We believe that ROACE provides investors with helpful information about our performance, our ability to provide an acceptable return on capital, and our ability to fund future growth. This measure may not be comparable with similar measures presented by other companies. The following schedule provides a reconciliation of ROACE to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP:

Competitive Position

We compete with many manufacturers of heat transfer and HVAC products, some of which are divisions of larger companies. The markets for our products continue to be very dynamic. Our traditional OEM customers are faced with dramatically increased international competition and have expanded their global manufacturing footprints to compete in local markets. In addition, consolidation within the supply base and vertical integration have introduced new or restructured competitors to our markets. Some of these market changes have caused us to experience competition from suppliers in other parts of the world that enjoy economic advantages such as lower labor costs, lower healthcare costs, and lower tax rates. As a result, we have expanded and continue to expand our geographic footprint, in part to provide more flexibility to serve our customers around the globe. Our customers also continue to ask us, as well as their other primary suppliers, to provide research and development (&#8220;R&#38;D&#8221;), design, and validation support for new potential projects. This combined work effort often results in stronger customer relationships and more partnership opportunities for us. It can also introduce risk, to the extent that these requests may require the reallocation of resources at times when actual business awards are pending.

&#160;

Business Segments

We have assigned specific operations to segments based principally on defined markets and geographic locations. Each operating segment is managed by a vice president and has separate financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision maker. These results are used by management in evaluating the performance of each business segment and in making decisions on the allocation of resources among our various businesses. During fiscal 2016, we combined our North America and South America segments into the Americas segment to streamline operations, gain synergies and improve our cost structure. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements as a result. Financial information related to our operating segments is included in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Americas, Europe, and Asia Segments

The continued globalization of our OEM customer base requires us to manage our strategic approach, product offerings and the competitive environment on a global basis. This trend offers significant opportunities for us with our market positioning, including our presence in key global markets (U.S., Europe, Brazil, China, India, South Korea, Japan, and Mexico) and a global product-based organization with the expertise to solve technical challenges. We are recognized for having strong technical support, product breadth, and the ability to support global standard designs for our customers.

Each of our main vehicular competitors, AKG Group, BorgWarner, Dana Corporation, Delphi Corporation, Denso Corporation, Mahle Behr, Tata Toyo, TitanX, T. Rad Co. Ltd., Valeo SA, Visteon Corporation, and Zhejiang Yinlun Machinery Co. Ltd., have a multi-regional or worldwide presence. Increasingly, we face heightened competition as these competitors expand their product offerings and manufacturing footprints through expansion into low-cost countries or low-cost sourcing initiatives. In addition, competitors from some low-cost regions are beginning to expand into new geographic OEM markets.

The Americas, Europe, and Asia segments represent our original equipment segments and serve the commercial vehicle, automotive, and off-highway markets. In addition, our Americas segment provides custom-designed heat exchangers, utilizing microchannel, heat recovery, and round tube plate fin coils, to the commercial refrigeration, residential heating, and commercial heating and air conditioning markets. The Americas segment also serves Brazil&#8217;s automotive and commercial vehicle aftermarkets. The following summarizes the primary markets served by our original equipment segments: 

Commercial Vehicle 

Market Overview &#160; &#8211; During fiscal 2016, the North America commercial vehicle market remained relatively flat compared with the prior year. We expect this market will weaken in fiscal 2017, particularly the market for heavy-duty trucks. Slow economic growth conditions and soft freight fundamentals suggest uneven demand in fiscal 2017; this, coupled with an expectation of continued governmental focus on emissions reductions and fuel efficiency improvements, is causing uncertainty for truck fleets. In South America, the commercial vehicle market has experienced significant volume declines in the past two fiscal years, and we expect this market to remain depressed in fiscal 2017. In Europe, the commercial vehicle market experienced moderate growth in fiscal 2016, and we expect this trend to continue in fiscal 2017. In Asia, we anticipate continued market growth during fiscal 2017.

Other trends influencing the commercial vehicle market include a call by global commercial vehicle manufacturers to standardize U.S., Canadian, and Eurozone emission regulations. Global standardization would likely lead to further consolidation of our customer base and competitors, as they leverage higher volumes, consolidate development costs, and rationalize distribution channels. Additionally, truck manufacturers are evaluating alternative powertrains and fuels, electrification, waste heat recovery, and other technologies aimed to improve vehicle efficiency, all of which could present opportunities for us.

&#160;

OEMs continue to expect greater supplier support and seek new technology solutions at lower prices for their thermal management needs. In general, this creates a challenge to us and the entire supply base, but also provides an opportunity for suppliers, like Modine, who develop innovative solutions at a competitive cost. Global standardization, fuel economy, and emissions regulations are driving the advancement of product development worldwide and are creating demand for incremental improvements to thermal transfer products that we are well positioned to support.

Products &#160; &#8211; Powertrain cooling (engine cooling modules, radiators, charge air coolers, condensers, oil coolers, fan shrouds, and surge tanks); on-engine cooling (EGR coolers, engine oil coolers, fuel coolers, charge air coolers and intake air coolers); and auxiliary coolers (transmission and retarder oil coolers and power steering coolers).

Customers &#8211; Commercial, medium- and heavy-duty truck and engine manufacturers; bus and specialty vehicle manufacturers.

Primary Competitors &#160; &#8211; Mahle Behr; TitanX; T. Rad Co. Ltd.; BorgWarner; and Tata Toyo.

Automotive 

Market Overview &#160; &#8211; The global automotive market improved in most regions during fiscal 2016. We expect this trend to continue in fiscal 2017, supported by favorable oil prices and monetary policies. The automotive market is gradually beginning to move away from traditional internal combustion engines towards alternative powertrains, such as electric, hybrid, and fuel cell. This shift is expected to increase the thermal management requirements for these vehicles, and we are capitalizing on this trend by applying our base heat transfer components to new applications. We expect our global automotive market production to increase in fiscal 2017, with modest market improvements in North America and Europe and stronger improvement in Asia.

Products &#160; &#8211; Powertrain cooling (engine cooling assemblies, radiators, condensers and charge air coolers); auxiliary cooling (power steering coolers and transmission oil coolers); component assemblies; radiators for special applications; on-engine cooling (EGR coolers, engine oil coolers, fuel coolers, charge air coolers and intake air coolers); and battery cooling (layered core battery chillers).

Customers &#160; &#8211; Automobile, light truck, and power sports vehicle and engine manufacturers.

Primary Competitors &#8211; Mahle Behr; Dana Corporation; Delphi Corporation; Denso Corporation; Visteon Corporation; BorgWarner; and Valeo SA.

Off-Highway 

Market Overview &#160; &#8211; Many global off-highway markets declined during fiscal 2016. The construction market was mixed in fiscal 2016, as some regions began to show signs of improvement during the year while others remained depressed. The U.S. agricultural market remains under pressure from low commodity prices and associated demand, a trend that we expect to continue in fiscal 2017. We expect this market will continue to be negatively impacted by higher used equipment inventories, which could suppress new equipment sales, and the uncertain interest rate environment. The mining equipment markets are showing little signs of improving in fiscal 2017, especially in the U.S. Many mining equipment buyers continued to cut capital investment plans in fiscal 2016, as the market progressed through a multiple-year cycle of demand declines. The European construction and agricultural equipment markets experienced modest improvement in fiscal 2016 as Eurozone economic conditions slowly improved, aided by monetary stimulus efforts. We expect these markets will be flat or slightly down in fiscal 2017. In South America, we anticipate continued declines in the agricultural market in fiscal 2017. In Asia, we expect the China and Korea excavator markets to stabilize, as these markets have progressed through a multiple-year cycle of declining demand since the construction peak in fiscal 2011.

Products &#160; &#8211; Powertrain cooling (engine cooling modules, radiators, condensers, charge air coolers, fuel coolers and oil coolers); auxiliary coolers (power steering coolers and transmission oil coolers); and on-engine cooling (EGR coolers, engine oil coolers, fuel coolers, charge air coolers and intake air coolers).

Customers &#160; &#8211; Construction, agricultural, and mining equipment and engine manufacturers, and industrial manufacturers of material handling equipment, generator sets and compressors.

&#160;

Building HVAC Segment

Market Overview &#160; &#8211; After two consecutive years of strong growth, the North America heating market contracted slightly in fiscal 2016, primarily due to warmer-than-normal winter temperatures. We expect modest improvement in the North America heating market in fiscal 2017. We anticipate market demand for our data center cooling, ventilation, and geothermal heat pump products to increase in fiscal 2017. We expect continued growth in demand for data and connected devices, coupled with increasing requirements for energy-efficient and green solutions, will continue to drive increased demand for our data center cooling products and, in particular, our high-density and free-cooling solutions. Likewise, we expect improvement in construction markets and energy efficiency legislation to drive increased demand for our ventilation and geothermal products.

Products &#8211; Unit heaters (gas-fired, hydronic, electric and oil-fired); duct furnaces (indoor and outdoor); infrared units (high- and low-intensity); hydronic products (commercial fin-tube radiation, cabinet unit heaters, and convectors); roof-mounted direct- and indirect-fired makeup air units; commercial packaged rooftop ventilation units; unit ventilators; single packaged vertical units; geothermal and water-source heat pumps; precision air conditioning units for data center applications; air-handling units; chillers; ceiling cassettes; and condensing units.

Customers &#8211; Mechanical contractors; HVAC wholesalers; installers; and end users in a variety of commercial and industrial applications, including banking and finance, data center management, education, hospitality, telecommunications, entertainment arenas, hotels, restaurants, hospitals, warehousing, manufacturing, and food and beverage processing.

&#160;

Foreign and Domestic Operations

Financial information relating to our foreign and domestic operations is included in Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Customer Dependence

Our ten largest customers, certain of which are conglomerates, accounted for 63 percent of our sales in fiscal 2016. These customers, listed alphabetically, were: BMW; Caterpillar; Daimler AG (including Daimler Trucks, Mercedes- Benz, Mitsubishi Fuso Trucks, Thomas Buses and Western Star Trucks); Deere &#38; Company; Denso Corporation; FCA Italy S.p.A. (including Chrysler, CNH, Fiat, Iveco, and VM Motori); Ford Motor Co.; Navistar; Volkswagen AG (including Audi, MAN, Porsche, and Scania); and Volvo. In both fiscal 2016 and 2015, Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG each accounted for 10 percent or more of our sales. In fiscal 2014, Daimler AG was the only customer that accounted for 10 percent or more of our sales. Generally, we supply products to our customers on the basis of individual purchase orders received from them. When it is in the mutual interest of Modine and our customers, we utilize long-term sales agreements to minimize investment risks and provide the customer with a proven source of competitively-priced products. These contracts are typically three to five years in duration and may include provisions that adjust sales prices in the future.

Backlog of Orders

Our operating segments maintain their own inventories and production schedules. We believe that our current production capacity is capable of handling the sales volume expected in fiscal 2017 and beyond.

Raw Materials

We purchase aluminum, nickel and steel from several domestic and foreign suppliers. In general, we do not rely on any one supplier for these materials, which are, for the most part, available from numerous sources in quantities required by us. The supply of copper and brass material is highly concentrated between two global suppliers. We normally do not experience material shortages and believe that our suppliers&#8217; production of these metals will be adequate throughout the next fiscal year. We typically adjust metals pricing with our raw material and major fabricated component suppliers on a quarterly basis. When possible, we have made material pass-through arrangements with key customers, which allow us to pass material cost increases and decreases to our customers. When utilized, however, these pass-through arrangements are typically limited to the underlying cost of the material based upon the London Metal Exchange, and do not include related premiums or fabrication costs. In addition, there can often be a three-month to one-year lag between the time of the material price increase or decrease and the time that we adjust the price with our customer.

Patents

We own or license numerous patents related to our products and operations. These patents and licenses have been obtained over a period of years and expire at various times. Because we have many product lines, we believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. We consider each of our patents, trademarks and licenses to be of value and aggressively defend our rights throughout the world against infringement. We have been granted and/or acquired more than 2,200 patents worldwide over the life of our company.

Research and Development

We remain committed to our vision of creating value through technology and innovation. We focus our engineering and R&#38;D efforts on solutions that meet challenging heat transfer needs of OEMs and other customers within the commercial vehicle, automotive, construction, agricultural, industrial, and building HVAC markets. Our products and systems are typically aimed at solving difficult and complex heat transfer challenges requiring advanced thermal management. Typical market demands are for products and systems that are lighter weight, more compact, more efficient and more durable to meet customer standards as customers work to ensure compliance with increasingly stringent global emissions and energy efficiency requirements. Our heritage includes a depth and breadth of expertise in thermal management that, combined with our global manufacturing presence, standardized processes, and state-of-the-art technical resources, enables us to rapidly bring customized solutions to our customers.

&#160;

R&#38;D expenditures, including certain application engineering costs for specific customer solutions, totaled $61 million in fiscal 2016 and $62 million in both fiscal 2015 and 2014. Over the last three years, R&#38;D expenditures have been between 4 and 5 percent of sales. This level of investment reflects our continued commitment to R&#38;D in an ever-changing market. To achieve efficiencies and lower development costs, our R&#38;D groups work closely with our customers on special projects and system designs. Projects include next generation aluminum radiators, charge air coolers and waste heat recovery systems for the automotive, commercial vehicle, agricultural and construction markets; and EGR technology, which enable our customers to efficiently meet tighter regulatory emission standards. Most of our current R&#38;D activities are focused on internal development in the areas of powertrain cooling, engine, building HVAC, and coils products. We also collaborate with several industry, university, and government-sponsored research organizations that conduct research and provide data on technical topics of interest to us for practical applications in the markets we serve. We continue to identify, evaluate and engage in external research projects that complement our strategic internal research initiatives in order to further leverage our significant thermal technology expertise and capability.

Quality Improvement

Through our global Quality Management System (&#8220;QMS&#8221;), our manufacturing facilities in our Americas, Europe and Asia segments are registered to ISO 9001:2008 or ISO/TS 16949:2009 standards, helping to ensure that our customers receive high quality products and services from every facility. While customer expectations for performance, quality and service continue to rise, our QMS has allowed us to drive improvements in quality performance and has enabled the ongoing delivery of products, service and value that meet or exceed customer expectations.

The global QMS operates within the context of the Modine Operating System (&#8220;MOS&#8221;), which focuses on well-defined improvement principles and leadership behaviors to engage our teams in facilitating rapid improvements. We drive sustainable and systematic continuous improvement throughout all functional areas and operating segments of the organization by utilizing the principles, processes and behaviors that are core to these systems.

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters

We are committed to preventing pollution, eliminating waste and reducing environmental risks. Our facilities maintain Environmental Management System (&#8220;EMS&#8221;) certification to the international ISO14001 standard through independent third-party audits. All of our locations have established specific environmental improvement targets and objectives for the upcoming fiscal year.

In fiscal 2016, our carbon emissions, resulting from our on-site use of natural gas and propane and from our use of electricity generated by off-site sources, decreased 6 percent compared with the prior year, representing our lowest emissions level over the past five years. We will continue to identify and implement carbon reduction opportunities when feasible over the upcoming fiscal year.

During fiscal 2016, our water consumption was relatively flat compared with fiscal 2015. Over the past five years, we have realized a cumulative 31 percent decrease in our water usage, using approximately 38 million fewer gallons in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2011. As in previous years, we continue to systematically identify opportunities and implement measures to reduce waste and conserve natural resources within the EMS structure.

Manufacturing by-products consisting of solid wastes and volatile organic air emissions were relatively flat year-over-year. We are actively pursuing alternative manufacturing processes that use more environmentally-friendly materials.

Our commitment to environmental stewardship is reflected in our reporting of chemical releases, as monitored by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Chemical Release Inventory program. Our U.S. locations decreased their reported chemical releases by 98 percent over the 10-year period from 2004 to 2014. This long-term improvement is the result of manufacturing efficiencies and a transition to more environmentally-friendly manufacturing technologies and raw materials.

Our product portfolio reflects our sense of environmental responsibility. We continue our development and refinement of environmentally-friendly product lines, including oil, fuel, and EGR coolers for diesel applications, light-weight and high-performance powertrain cooling heat exchangers, and our Advanced Cooling System technology. These products provide increased fuel economies and enable combustion technologies that reduce harmful gas emissions. Our Building HVAC product offerings, including the Airedale SchoolMate geothermal heat pump; the Effinity TM , a condensing gas-fired unit heater with industry-leading efficiencies; and the Atherion TM Commercial Packaged Ventilation System, are helping commercial, industrial and residential users achieve high energy efficiencies and reduce utility costs. Our geothermal products feature innovative heat pump technologies, providing energy savings and reduced carbon emissions in both heating and cooling seasons.

Obligations for remedial activities may arise at our facilities due to past practices, or as a result of a property purchase or sale. These expenditures most often relate to sites where past operations followed practices that were considered acceptable under then-existing regulations, but now require investigative and/or remedial work to ensure appropriate environmental protection, or where we are a successor to the obligations of prior owners and current laws and regulations require investigative and/or remedial work to ensure sufficient environmental compliance. Two of our currently-owned manufacturing facilities and three formerly-owned properties have been identified as requiring soil and/or groundwater remediation. Environmental liabilities for investigative work and remediation at sites in the United States, Brazil, and the Netherlands totaled $5 million at March 31, 2016.

We recorded a fiscal 2016 global Recordable Incident Rate (&#8220;RIR&#8221; as defined by OSHA) of 1.63, which was unchanged compared with our RIR in fiscal 2015. Our long-term safety performance, as indicated by RIR, improved 20 percent over the past five years. We have consistently out-performed the private-industry RIR average for the manufacturing sector, which, by comparison was 4.0 in 2014.

For our U.S. locations, annual workers&#8217; compensation claims reported in fiscal 2016 decreased for the second consecutive year, representing a 70 percent improvement over the past five years. We attribute these lower claims to the continued strengthening of our safety culture.

Our behavior-based safety program is a proactive global effort under which we seek to correct at-risk behaviors, and positively reinforce safe behaviors. Building further on behavior-based safety, we introduced process stream safety to our Americas segment facilities this past fiscal year. This in-depth evaluation and correction of workplace conditions further engages employees to eliminate safety risks. Our focus on behavior-based safety and process stream safety are part of our long-term commitment to strengthen our safety culture.

Employees

We employed approximately 7,100 persons worldwide as of March 31, 2016.

Seasonal Nature of Business

Our overall operating performance is generally not subject to a significant degree of seasonality, as sales to OEM customers are dependent upon market demand for new vehicles. However, our second fiscal quarter production schedules are typically impacted by customer summer shut downs and our third fiscal quarter is affected by holiday schedules. Additionally, our Building HVAC segment experiences some seasonality as demand for HVAC products can be affected by heating and cooling seasons, weather patterns, construction, and other factors. Generally, sales volume within the Building HVAC segment is stronger in our second and third fiscal quarters, corresponding with demand for heating products.

Working Capital

We manufacture products for the original equipment markets on an as-ordered basis, which makes large inventories of finished products unnecessary. In our Building HVAC segment, we maintain varying levels of finished goods inventory due to seasonal demand and certain sales programs. In these areas, we make use of extended payment terms, not to exceed 90 days, for our Building HVAC customers on a limited basis. In Brazil, within our Americas segment, we maintain higher levels of aftermarket product inventory in order to timely meet customer needs in the Brazilian automotive and commercial vehicle aftermarkets. We do not experience a significant number of returned products within any of our operating segments.
