 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

&#160;

Overview

&#160;

We manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of safety garments and accessories for the industrial and public protective clothing market. Our products are sold by our in-house customer service group, our regional sales managers and independent sales representatives to a network of over 1,200 North American safety and mill supply distributors. These distributors in turn supply end user industrial customers, such as integrated oil, chemical/petrochemical, utilities, automobile, steel, glass, construction, smelting, munition plants, janitorial, pharmaceutical, mortuaries and high technology electronics manufacturers, as well as scientific and medical laboratories. In addition, we supply federal, state and local governmental agencies and departments, such as fire and law enforcement, airport crash rescue units, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and the Centers for Disease Control. Internationally, sales are to a mixture of end users directly and to industrial distributors depending on the particular country market. Sales are made to more than 40 foreign countries but are primarily in China, European Economic Community (&#8220;EEC&#8221;), Canada, Chile, Argentina, Russia, Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador and Southeast Asia. In FY16 we had net sales of $99.6 million and $93.4 million in FY15. For purposes of this Form 10-K, FY refers to a fiscal year ended January 31; for example, FY16 refers to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016.

&#160;

FY16 was a year of significant involvement by Lakeland in combatting both the Ebola epidemic in Africa and the major outbreak of the avian virus (bird flu) in the US. The Company continued to ship chemical protective clothing on the large Ebola-related contract with an EEC member through April 2015. We were able to win this contract due to our ability to rapidly scale up production and tripling our capacity in a matter of a few weeks. This ability was a direct result of our controlling our own production facilities rather than relying exclusively on contractors. 

&#160;

The bird flu struck poultry farms in the upper Midwest of the US hard in May 2015. Due to the Company&#8217;s rapid increases to manufacturing capacity for its response to the Ebola crisis, we were able to win major contracts for similar garments as we could commit to large quantity orders the same day we were called by customers. Not only did the Company win these large contracts, but we believe our ability to respond immediately and decisively made a significant impression on these customers, as evidenced by the increases in orders from many of these same customers during the balance of the fiscal year vs. the previous year. We feel both of these large scale viral emergencies materially enhanced Lakeland&#8217;s reputation and image within the industry, which should continue to benefit the Company going forward. Meanwhile smaller emergencies, such as oil and chemical spills from train derailments, occur regularly and are considered part of our baseline business. No company can predict when very large scale events like Ebola and the bird flu outbreaks will occur, but historically the Company has found that the large events tend to occur every two to three years. In Q4 FY16 demand for the Company&#8217;s products softened worldwide reflecting macroeconomic conditions. Industrial production declined in the US due to the strength of the dollar and job losses in the Energy sector, the continuing decline of the growth rate in China and the European growth rate hovering near zero. However, the Company expects, but there can be no assurance, demand for its products to increase in the US in the next two years as federal money appropriated for infectious disease preparedness in the 2015 Omnibus Appropriations Bill is allocated to the states and put out to bid in the marketplace. In addition, management believes, but there can be no assurance, that the Company will resume its growth trajectory as it continues to implement its strategy of adding sales people world-wide and takes advantage of its ability to compete in the industry by quickly scaling up production to meet event-driven opportunities. 

1&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

A key factor in our business model is having the labor intensive sewing operation for our limited use/disposable protective clothing lines in our facilities in Mexico and China. Our facilities and capabilities in China and Mexico allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the United States and permit us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than is available domestically. As we have increasingly shifted production to our facilities in Mexico and China, we have experienced improvements in the profit margins for these products.

&#160;

On July 31, 2015, Lakeland and its then Brazilian subsidiary (&#8220;Lakeland Brazil&#8221;), completed a conditional closing of a Shares Transfer Agreement with Zap Com&#233;rcio de Brindes Corporativos Ltda, a company owned by an existing Lakeland Brazil manager, entered into on June 19, 2015. Pursuant to the Shares Transfer Agreement, the Transferee has acquired all of the shares of Lakeland Brazil owned by the Company (see Note 15).

&#160;

Our major product categories and their applications are described below:

&#160;

&#183; Limited Use/Disposable Protective Clothing. We manufacture a complete line of limited use/disposable protective garments offered in coveralls, lab coats, shirts, pants, hoods, aprons, sleeves, smocks and shoe covers. These garments are made from several nonwoven fabrics, such as our trademarked Micromax&#174;, Micromax NS, HBF&#174;, SafeGard&#174;, Pyrolon XT&#174;, Pyrolon Plus 2&#174;, Zonegard&#174; and ChemMax&#174; 1 and 2. These garments provide protection from low-risk contaminants or irritants such as chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers, paint, grease and dust and from limited exposure to hazardous waste and toxic chemicals, including acids, asbestos, lead and hydro-carbons (or PCBs) that pose health risks after exposure for long periods of time. Additional applications include protection from viruses and bacteria, such as AIDS, streptococcus, SARS, Ebola, bird and swine flu and hepatitis at international hospitals, clinics and emergency rescue sites and use in clean room environments to prevent human contamination in the manufacturing processes. &#160;

&#183; High-End Chemical Protective Suits. We manufacture heavy duty chemical suits made from our Pyrolon&#174; CRFR and ChemMax&#174; 3, 4 and Interceptor product lines. These suits are worn by individuals on hazardous material teams to provide protection from powerful, highly concentrated, hazardous and potentially lethal chemical and biological toxins, such as toxic wastes at Super Fund sites, toxic chemical spills, biological discharges, chemical or biological warfare agents (such as sarin gas, anthrax or ricin), and hazardous chemicals and petro-chemicals present during the cleaning of refineries and nuclear facilities. These suits can be used in conjunction with a fire protective shell that we manufacture to protect the user from both chemical and flash fire hazards. We believe Homeland Security measures and government funding of personal protective equipment for first responders to terrorist threats or attack could result in increased demand for our high-end chemical suits, and we believe a reasonable demand for these suits will continue in the future as annual state and local bioterrorism grants are spent. Our suits have been tested and certified to most major international standards to include National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), ASTM International (ASTM), European Conformity (CE) and International Standards Organization (ISO) certifications. As a result of these certifications, our Pyrolon CRFR, ChemMAX and Interceptor suits are well positioned to be specified by other countries around the world with similar concerns regarding terrorist threats and/or chemical or biological events. &#160;

&#183; Firefighting, FR PPE (Flame Resistant Personal Protective Equipment) and Heat Protective Apparel. We manufacture both domestically and internationally an extensive line of FR PPE to include firefighting and heat protective apparel for use by firefighters, first responders and other individuals that require FR Protective Clothing or work in extreme heat environments. Our firefighting and PPE apparel is sold to domestic and international municipalities and industrial firefighting teams. Our Structural, Aluminized Proximity and Heat Protective fire suits are manufactured from fibers such as Nomex&#174;, a fire and heat resistant material, and Kevlar&#174;, a cut and heat resistant, high-strength, lightweight, flexible and durable fiber produced by DuPont and woven by Tencate, Springs and other fabric manufacturers. The Aluminized Heat Protective Apparel is used for maintenance of extreme high temperature equipment such as coke ovens, kilns, glass furnaces, refinery installations and smelting plants, while our Aluminized Proximity gear is used by military and airport crash and rescue teams. &#160;

2&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Reusable Woven Garments. We manufacture a full line of reusable and washable woven garments that complement our firefighting and heat protective apparel offerings and provide alternatives to our limited use/disposable protective clothing lines. Product lines include electrostatic dissipative apparel used in the pharmaceutical and automotive industries for control of static electricity in the manufacturing process, clean room apparel to prevent human contamination in the manufacturing processes, flame resistant Nomex&#174; and fire resistant (FR) cotton coveralls used in chemical and petroleum plants and for Wildland firefighting, and Extrication suits for emergency responders. &#160;

&#183; High Visibility Clothing. We manufacture a line of high visibility clothing. This line includes flame retardant, arc flash resistant, and static dissipative reflective garments for the Electric and Gas Utility industry, Oil/Gas exploration, production, and Petrochemical refining industries, Emergency/Fire Services, and various heavy manufacturing and Transportation industries. &#160;

&#183; Glove and Sleeves . We manufacture gloves and arm guards from Kevlar&#174; and Spectra&#174; cut resistant fibers made by DuPont, Honeywell and similar yarns made by other manufacturers, as well as engineered composite yarns and our Microgard antimicrobial yarns for food service markets. These gloves are used primarily in the automotive, glass, metal fabrication and food service industries to protect the wearer&#8217;s hands and arms from lacerations and heat without sacrificing manual dexterity or comfort. &#160;

We maintain manufacturing facilities in Alabama, Mexico, Brazil (through July 31, 2015), India, Argentina and China. We also have relationships with sewing subcontractors in Mexico, Argentina, and China which we can utilize for unexpected sales surges. Our international facilities allow us to take advantage of favorable labor and component costs, thereby increasing our profit margins on products manufactured in these facilities. These facilities also allow us to sell in those domestic markets, thereby avoiding high import tariffs in countries like Argentina, India and China. The Company discontinued operations in its India glove manufacturing facility in FY12 but maintains a small sales and manufacturing facility in Delhi, India and may continue to experiment with manufacturing costs at this facility. As more fully described in Note 15, on July 31, 2015, the Company transferred shares of its Brazilian subsidiary to an officer of that company and no longer maintains operations in that country.

&#160;

Industry Overview

&#160;

The industrial work clothing market includes our limited use/disposable protective or safety clothing, our high-end chemical protective suits, our firefighting and heat protective apparel, gloves and our reusable woven garments.

&#160;

The industrial protective safety clothing market in the United States has evolved over the past 46 years as a result of governmental regulations and requirements and commercial product development. In 1970, Congress enacted the Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, which requires employers to supply protective clothing in certain work environments. Certain states have also enacted worker safety laws that further supplement OSHA standards and requirements.

&#160;

The advent of OSHA coincided with the development of light disposable fabrics, such as SMS (a three layered nonwoven) and Polypropylene which, for the first time, allowed for the economical production of lightweight, disposable protective clothing. The attraction of disposable garments grew in the late 1970s as a result of increases in labor and material costs of producing cloth garments and the promulgation of federal, state and local safety regulations. Also, in order to comply with World Trade Organization (&#8220;WTO&#8221;) entry requirements, foreign countries are beginning to adopt and imitate OSHA regulations, American National Standards Institute (&#8220;ANSI&#8221;) and Committee European de Normalization (&#8220;CE&#8221;) standards. Thus, these developing international markets are growing much more rapidly than the US markets.

&#160;

International and Domestic Standards

&#160;

Standards development, within both the US and global markets, continues to challenge manufacturers as the pace of change and adoption of new standards increase. This dynamic has been further complicated by the collapse of WTO talks to revise General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (&#8220;GATT&#8221;). This is leading to the establishment of new barriers to trade within WTO requirements and an increase in bilateral trade agreements. Complex and changing international standards play to Lakeland&#8217;s strengths when compared to most multinationals or smaller manufacturers.

&#160;

3&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Globally, standards for lower levels of protection are also changing rapidly. In 1996, the European Committee for Standardization (&#8220;CEN&#8221;) adopted a group of standards that collectively comprised the only standards available for chemical protective clothing for general industry. Because these standards established performance requirements for a wide range of chemical protective clothing, these standards have been adopted by many countries and multinational corporations outside of the European Union (&#8220;EU&#8221;) as minimum requirements. This is especially true in the Asian and Pacific markets where compliance with occupational health and safety standards is being driven by WTO membership. In addition to CE, ASTM International and the National Fire Protection Association (&#8220;NFPA&#8221;) are increasing the numbers of &#8220;Memorandums of Understanding&#8221; (&#8220;MOUs&#8221;) they have in place with foreign countries as they vie for relevance on the international stage. Developing nations that want WTO membership must establish worker safety laws as the USA did in 1970 with its OSHA laws. This trend is driving demand for our products internationally, particularly in fast Gross Domestic Product (&#8220;GDP&#8221;) growth countries, such as China, Chile, Australia and India.

&#160;

A number of developing nations are now becoming active in their own standards development based on existing international standards. However, the primary goal of their standards writing activity is not focused on worker protection (that is provided for by the use of international standards), rather they are attempting to establish their own certification criteria that will protect their domestic markets or favor specific regional suppliers. This presents a new challenge in that now not only are we faced with multiple test methods and standards, but we have the potential for multiple certification processes. While this adds to product development and sales expenses, the additional cost is only incremental. The real challenge is in navigating the certification process itself. Lakeland, by virtue of its international manufacturing and sales operations, is in a unique position to capitalize on this complex dynamic.

&#160;

The international standards environment remains volatile. Canada has adopted its own version of ISO 16602 and EN/ISO 13982 for disposable and chemical protective clothing, CEN is currently in the process of revising its suite of standards and a number of countries continue efforts to bring their own national standards into harmony with International Standards Organization (&#8220;ISO&#8221;) standards. While standards harmonization is laudable, it is failing to make the standards landscape easier to navigate globally. Harmonization of standards and test methods does not necessarily translate into harmonization of certification and therein lays the problem. Europe with its PPE Directive, along with NFPA and ASTM Standards, have clearly defined processes for independent, third-party certification. Unfortunately, ISO Standards have no equivalent to the European PPE Directive and do not contain certification process requirements within the standards themselves as NFPA and ASTM Standards do. Unfortunately, countries seeking to comply with GATT provisions against &#8220;Technical Barriers to Trade&#8221; that select ISO Standards as their national standards have no guidance as to the certification process itself. Many of the countries are unwilling to accept certifications or test data from laboratories or notifying bodies that do not have operations within the boundaries of their own countries. As a result, more and more countries are developing their own certification protocols requiring use of domestic test houses and labs. The result of this movement is that while standards are being harmonized, the industry is not realizing the benefits of this harmonization in terms of testing and certification, cost reduction, or simplicity in labeling. While the WTO and ISO have been successful in removing national standards as technical barriers to trade, the national certification requirements have replaced standards as an equally formidable barrier to trade. We believe that Lakeland&#8217;s global footprint provides us with a sustainable advantage in selling Personal Protective Equipment (&#8220;PPE&#8221;) within this increasingly complex global market.

&#160;

Business Strategy

&#160;

Key elements of our strategy include:

&#160;

&#183; Increase International Sales Opportunities . In the past, we aggressively increased our penetration of the international markets for our product lines. Starting in FY07 and through FY08, we opened sales offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangzhou and Weifang, China; Santiago, Chile and Buenos Aires, Argentina and in FY11, we opened sales offices in Russia, India and Kazakhstan. The Company acquired Qualytextil, a Brazilian manufacturer, in FY09, with the intent of penetrating this market but due to extreme challenges transferred the shares of this subsidiary to an officer of that company on July 31, 2015 and no long maintain operations in Brazil. While the challenges in Brazil resulted in our decision to exit Brazil, we continue to believe in this strategy of aggressively penetrating international markets. Aiding our focus is the fact that many countries have adopted legislation similar to the 1970 US OSHA in order to facilitate their entry into the WTO which has, as a requisite for entry, worker safety laws (like OSHA), social security, environmental and tax laws similar to that of the USA and Europe. These new worker safety laws have driven the demand for our products in these rapidly growing economies. &#160;

&#183; Improve Marketing in Existing Markets . We believe significant growth opportunities are available to us through the better positioning, marketing and enhanced cross-selling of our reusable woven protective clothing, glove and arm guards, reflective clothing, high-end chemical suit product lines and our limited use/disposable lines as a bundled offering. This allows our customers one-stop shopping using combined freight shipments. &#160;

4&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; Continued Emphasis on Customer Service . We continue to offer a high level of customer service to distinguish our products and to create customer loyalty. We offer well-trained and experienced sales and support personnel, on-time delivery and accommodation of custom and rush orders. We also seek to advertise our Lakeland branded trade names and trademarks. &#160;

&#183; Introduce New Products; Focus on Energy Sector. We continued our history of product development and innovation by introducing new proprietary products across all our product lines. Our innovations have included Micromax&#174; disposable protective clothing line, our ChemMax&#174; line of chemical protective clothing, several patented glove designs, superior quality innovative products protecting against electrical hazards, and industry-leading fire suit designs. We own 13 patents on fabrics and production machinery, with two foreign applications in process, and continue to work on developing fabrics that could potentially lead us into new markets and channels. In North America, our growth strategy is to focus on key target sectors where we have advantages, and to increase our involvement at the end user level by adding sales personnel and enhancing our marketing and product training tools to make it easier for the sales teams of our distributors to be successful promoting our products. Though the Energy sector has been down and exploration and field development have mostly ground to a halt, low oil prices are giving refineries the opportunity to go off line after several years of high prices and running at full capacity and perform long-deferred maintenance - our primary sector target. The Company continues to experience demand growth in the utility industry- both electric and gas- for our Reflective clothing division. The reflective division is already a steadily growing area for Lakeland, as we add new static dissipative and arc flash protection garments, and OSHA enforces broader requirements for their use, we expect to see continued growth. The recent investment in a stronger sales team in Mexico is beginning to pay off with sales growth as the impact of low oil prices on the gas industry is offset by strong growth in manufacturing, particularly noticeable in the number of new automobile factories locating in that country. We believe that as this growth continues and as and when oil prices recover, Mexico will become a very important region for the Company, building on our competitive advantage of local manufacturing. We have recently integrated the US, Canadian, and Mexican sales teams into one coordinated unit. With this strategic recognition the three countries have become one market with the same inter-related industries and companies throughout and our sales teams are sharing opportunities with each other. We have experienced situations in which we could not break through with a company in one country, but the team in another country was able to get in and make a conversion to our products. Then, after successful use of our products in that one country, the doors open to us in the other. We continue to pursue conversions to our products from DuPont product end users, based on our overall performance and prices. We believe the inevitable disruptions to DuPont surrounding its proposed mega merger with Dow Chemical, followed by planned spin offs over the next several years, gives us additional openings for which we are gearing up to take advantage. Our marketing is being significantly upgraded in terms of resources applied, more and better collateral materials, and increasingly effective use of social media. An example of this is an on-going Fire Division campaign driven by Lakeland sponsorships of several top-ranked participants in the &#8220;Combat Challenge&#8221; (an international skills and fitness competition) that netted significant numbers of followers, who as a result expressed interest in our gear. Similar campaigns are being planned for other product lines, including to support the adoption of an exclusive new proprietary technology that we believe may have a significant impact on how end users select chemical suits and suppliers. &#160;

&#183; Decrease Manufacturing Expenses by Moving Production to International Facilities . We continued to identify opportunities to take advantage of our low cost production capabilities in China and Mexico. Beginning in 1995, we successfully moved the labor-intensive sewing operation for our limited use/disposable protective clothing lines to facilities in Mexico and China. Beginning January 1, 2005, pursuant to the United States World Trade Organization Treaty with China and the 1995 North American Free Trade Agreement (&#8220;NAFTA&#8221;), the reduction in quota requirements and tariffs imposed by the US and Canada on textile goods, such as our reusable woven garments, have made it more cost effective to move production for some of these product lines to our assembly facilities in China and Mexico. Additionally, &#160;

&#183; We continue to press our raw material and component suppliers for price reductions and better payment terms. &#183; We are sourcing more raw materials and components from our China based operations as opposed to sourcing from Europe and North America. &#183; We are re-engineering many products to reduce the amount of raw materials used and reduce the direct labor required. &#160;

5&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; In FY13, we relocated the operations in our facility in Missouri and moved the production into our Alabama facility and to our newly expanded facility in Mexico. This move resulted in a significant net overhead reduction in FY14. &#183; During FY14, the Company's plant in Qingdao China was closed and sold. All production operations were relocated from this plant to other Lakeland facilities. &#183; During Q1 FY15, the Company&#8217;s Reflective facility in Pennsylvania was vacated with production moved to Mexico, and warehousing consolidated into the Alabama facility. Significant fixed and variable costs reductions have resulted. &#160;

Our Competitive Strengths

&#160;

Our competitive strengths include:

&#160;

&#183; Industry Reputation . We devote significant resources to creating customer loyalty and brand integrity by accommodating custom and rush orders and focusing on on-time delivery. Additionally, our ISO 9001 and 9002 certified facilities manufacture high-quality products. As a result of these factors, we believe that we have an excellent reputation in the industry. &#160;

&#183; International Manufacturing Capabilities . We have operated our own manufacturing facilities in Mexico since 1995 and in China since 1996. Our facilities in China in FY16 totaled 162,286 sq. ft. of manufacturing, warehousing and administrative space, and our facility in Mexico totaled 74,000 sq. ft. of manufacturing, warehousing and administrative space. Our facilities and capabilities in China and Mexico allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the US and permits us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than are available domestically. &#160;

&#183; International Sales Offices . We have sales offices around the world to service various major markets, including offices in Toronto, Canada; Hull, UK; Beijing, Weifang, Chongqing and Shanghai, China; Australia; Southeast Asia; Santiago, Chile; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Jerez, Mexico; Moscow, Russia; and Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan. &#160;

&#183; Comprehensive Inventory . We have a large product offering with numerous specifications, such as size, styles and pockets, and maintain a large inventory of each in order to satisfy customer orders in a timely manner. Many of our customers traditionally make purchases of industrial protective gear with expectations of immediate delivery. We believe our ability to provide timely service for these customers enhances our reputation in the industry and positions us strongly for repeat business, particularly in our limited use/disposable protective clothing lines. &#160;

&#183; Manufacturing Flexibility . By locating labor-intensive manufacturing processes, such as sewing, in Mexico and China, and by utilizing sewing subcontractors, we have the ability to increase production without substantial additional capital expenditures. Our manufacturing systems allow us flexibility for unexpected production surges and alternative capacity in the event any of our independent contractors become unavailable. &#160;

Limited Use/Disposable Protective Clothing

&#160;

We manufacture a complete line of limited use/disposable protective garments, including coveralls, laboratory coats, shirts, pants, hoods, aprons, sleeves, arm guards, caps and smocks. Limited use garments can also be coated or laminated to increase splash protection against harmful inorganic acids, bases and other hazardous liquid and dry chemicals. Limited use garments are made from several nonwoven fabrics, including our premium lines, our own trademarked fabrics, such as Pyrolon&#174; Plus 2, XT, Micromax&#174;, Micromax NS, Safegard&#174;, Zonegard&#174;, ChemMax&#174; 1 and 2 and TomTex&#174;, which are made of spunlaced polyester, polypropylene, laminates, microporous films and derivatives. We incorporate many seaming, heat sealing and taping techniques depending on the level of protection needed in the end use application.

&#160;

Typical users of these garments include integrated oil/petrochemical refineries, chemical plants and related installations, automotive manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, construction companies, coal, gas and oil power generation utilities and telephone utility companies, laboratories, mortuaries and governmental entities. Numerous smaller industries use these garments for specific safety applications unique to their businesses. Additional applications include protection from viruses and bacteria, such as AIDS, streptococcus, SARS and hepatitis, at international hospitals, clinics and emergency rescue sites and use in clean room environments to prevent human contamination in the manufacturing processes.

&#160;

Our limited use/disposable protective clothing products range in unit price from $0.19 for shoe covers to approximately $6.00-$14.00 for a light duty ChemMax&#174; 1 serged or sealed seam laminated hood and booted coverall. Our largest selling item, a standard white Micromax NS ANSI standard or CE standard coverall, sells for approximately $2.00 to $3.75 per garment. By comparison, similar reusable cloth coveralls range in price from $35.00 to $90.00, exclusive of laundering, maintenance and shrinkage expenses.

&#160;

We warehouse and sell our limited use/disposable garments primarily at our Alabama and China manufacturing facilities and secondarily from warehouses in Hull, United Kingdom; Toronto, Canada; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; Moscow, Russia; Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan; and Las Vegas, Nevada. The Pennsylvania plant was closed in FY15 and all production was moved to Mexico, and the sales and administrative functions were moved to Alabama. The fabric is cut and sewn into required patterns at our two Chinese and one Mexican plant and shipped to all our sales points around the world. Our assembly facilities in China and Mexico cut, sew and package the finished garments and return them primarily to our Alabama plant, normally within 1 to 10 weeks, for immediate shipment to our North American customers.

&#160;

In FY16 and FY15, there was no independent sewing contractor that accounts for more than 10% of our production of the limited use disposable garments or any of our other divisions. We believe that we can obtain adequate alternative production capacity in a normal situation should any of our independent contractors become unavailable.

&#160;

High-End Chemical Protective Suits

&#160;

We manufacture and sell heavy duty protective chemical suits and protective apparel from our proprietary CRFR, ChemMax&#174; 3, 4, Interceptor and other fabrics. These suits are worn by individuals on hazardous material teams and within general industry to provide protection from powerful, highly concentrated and hazardous or potentially lethal chemical and biological toxins, such as toxic wastes at Superfund sites, toxic chemical spills or biological discharges, chemical or biological warfare weapons (such as sarin, anthrax or ricin and mustard gas) and chemicals and petro-chemicals present during the cleaning of refineries and nuclear facilities and protection from infectious disease agents such as Ebola. Our line of chemical protective clothing ranges in price from about $22-$1,300 per garment. The chemical suits can be used in conjunction with a fire protective shell that we manufacture to protect the user from both chemical and flash fire hazards. We have also introduced two patented garments approved by the National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) for varying levels of protection:

&#160;

&#183; Interceptor&#174;, two multilayer films laminated on either side of durable nonwoven substrate. This garment provides a broad spectrum chemical barrier to gases, vapors and liquids. This garment is of an encapsulating design and is available in NFPA 1991 with flash fire for escape option and CE Type 1 certified configurations. &#183; ChemMax&#174; 4 is a multilayer barrier film laminated to a durable nonwoven substrate. This garment is a broad spectrum chemical barrier, but its greatest advantage is that the material is strong enough to hold an airtight zipper and to withstand reuse. As a result, it provides a low cost option for encapsulating garments and is durable enough for multiple reuse provided the garment is not exposed to chemical hazards. It is available in CE type 4 and 3 certified garments. &#160;

8&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The addition of Interceptor and ChemMax&#174; 4 to our product line provides Lakeland with, we believe, the most complete and cost-effective line of chemical protective garments available on the market today. Garments are certified to NFPA standards where applicable in the Americas, and versions of all of these garments are also CE certified for European and Pan Asian markets.

&#160;

We manufacture higher end chemical protective clothing with taped seams at our facilities in Alabama, Mexico and China. Using fabrics, such as ChemMax&#174; 1, ChemMax&#174; 2, ChemMax&#174; 3, ChemMax&#174; 4 and Interceptor, we design, cut, sew and seal these materials to meet customer purchase orders.

&#160;

Firefighting and Heat Protective Apparel

&#160;

We manufacture an extensive line of UL/NFPA-certified structured firefighter protective apparel for domestic and foreign fire departments, available both in standard stock form and custom configurations.

&#160;

We offer basic firefighter turnout/bunker gear in the Attack (A10) and Battalion (B1) styles. Introduced in 2013 are the Battalion (&#8220;B2&#8221;) style with advanced ergonomic features and the Stealth style, with innovative features new to the fire industry.

&#160;

We also manufacture each of the above styles in our UL/NFPA-certified Proximity line for Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (&#8220;ARFF&#8221;) with aluminized shells.

&#160;

We manufacture full lines of Fire service extrication suits in FR cotton, UL/NFPA-certified Wild land firefighting apparel in multiple fabrics and Aluminized Kiln entry/Approach suits to protect industrial workers from extreme heat.

&#160;

We manufacture fire suits at our facilities in China, Mexico and Alabama. Our fire suits range in price from about $800 for standard fire department turnout gear to $2,000 for custom gear. Our Lakeland Fire&#174; brand of firefighting apparel continues to benefit from ongoing research and development investment, as we seek to address the ergonomic needs of stressful occupations.

&#160;

Reusable Woven Garments

&#160;

We manufacture and market a line of reusable and washable woven garments that complement our firefighting and heat protective apparel offerings and provide alternatives to our limited use/disposable protective clothing lines and give us access to the much larger woven industrial and health care-related markets. Cloth reusable garments are favored by customers for certain uses or applications because of familiarity with and acceptance of these fabrics and woven cloth&#8217;s heavier weight, durability, longevity and comfort. These products allow us to supply and satisfy a wider range of safety and customer needs.

&#160;

Our product lines include the following:

&#160;

&#183; Electrostatic dissipative apparel used by electric and gas utilities. &#183; Flame resistant Nomex&#174;/FR and FR Cotton coveralls/pants/jackets used in petrochemical and refining operations. &#183; Cotton and Polycotton coveralls, lab coats, pants and shirts. &#160;

Our reusable woven garments range in price from $30 to $200 per garment. We manufacture woven cloth garments at our facilities in China, Mexico and Argentina. We are continuing to relocate highly repetitive sewing processes for our high volume, standard product lines, such as woven protective coveralls and fire retardant coveralls, to our facilities in China and Mexico where lower fabric and labor costs allow increased profit margins.

&#160;

High Visibility Clothing

&#160;

Lakeland Reflective manufactures and markets a comprehensive line of reflective apparel meeting the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) requirements. The line includes vests, T-shirts, sweatshirts, jackets, coats, raingear, jumpsuits, hats and gloves.

&#160;

Fabrics available, including solid and mesh fluorescent, polyester, both standard and FR treated, Modacrylic materials, which meet ASTM 1560 Test method for standard 70 Electric Arc Protection, are part of our offering. We introduced a breathable Modacrylic fabric and believe this fabric should have strong appeal in states where very hot weather affects utility workers working outside during spring and summer (heat prostration).

&#160;

9&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In FY14, we released a new series of High Vis Polyurethane FR/ARC rated rainwear. This ARC rated rainwear is light in weight, soft, flexible and provides a breathable, cooler garment. This product is intended for the Gas and Electrical Utility markets. The Lakeland ARC TECH FR/PU garment exceeds all of the required ASTM ARC and Flash fire ratings for the large Electric and Gas Utility market.

&#160;

Our domestic vest production occurs in Alabama and is focused on custom vest requirements. Much of the manufacturing at this facility is focused on custom vest requirements. Many corporations and agencies, such as State Departments of Transportation, develop custom specifications which they feel are more efficient in meeting their specific needs versus an off-the-shelf product. We also can import a significant amount of product from China to meet the demand for items in high volume commodity markets.

&#160;

In addition to ANSI Reflective items, Lakeland Hi-Visibility manufactures Nomex and FR cotton garments which have reflective trim as a part of their design criteria. These garments typically are used in rescue operations, such as those encountered with a vehicular crash. Garments in this group are not as price sensitive as those in the reflective categories. Consequently, they are made in our Alabama facility where we can react to customized needs and offer quicker customer response. Garments in this group can range in price from $200-$350.

&#160;

Gloves and Sleeves

&#160;

We manufacture and sell specially designed glove and sleeve protective products made from Kevlar&#174;, a cut and heat resistant fiber produced by DuPont, Spectra&#174;, a cut resistant fiber made by Honeywell and our proprietary patented engineered yarns. We are one of only nine companies licensed in North America to sell 100% Kevlar&#174; gloves, which are high strength, lightweight, flexible and durable. Kevlar&#174; gloves offer a better overall level of protection and lower worker injury rate, and are more cost effective than traditional leather, canvas or coated work gloves. Kevlar&#174; gloves, which can withstand temperatures of up to 400&#176;F and are cut resistant enough to allow workers to safely handle sharp or jagged unfinished sheet metal, are used primarily in the automotive, glass and metal fabrication industries. Our higher end string knit gloves range in price from about $40 to $170 for a dozen pair. We manufacture these string knit gloves primarily at our Mexican facility, enabling lower production and labor costs.

&#160;

We have received patents for our Despro&#174; and Despro&#174; Plus products on manufacturing processes that provide greater cut and abrasion hand protection to the areas of a glove where it wears out prematurely in various applications. For example, the areas of the thumb crotch and index fingers are made heavier than the balance of the glove, providing increased wear protection and longer glove life, reducing overall glove costs. This proprietary manufacturing process allows us, we believe, to produce our gloves more economically and provide a greater value to our end user.

&#160;

Quality

&#160;

All of our manufacturing facilities are ISO 9001 or 9002 certified. ISO standards are internationally recognized quality manufacturing standards established by the International Organization for Standardization based in Geneva, Switzerland. To obtain our ISO registration, our factories were independently audited to test our compliance with the applicable standards. In order to maintain registration, our factories receive regular announced inspections by an independent certification organization. While ISO certification is advantageous in retaining CE certification of products, we believe that the ISO 9001 and ISO 9002 certifications make us more competitive in the marketplace, as customers increasingly recognize the standard as an indication of product quality.

&#160;

As we are increasingly sourcing fabrics internationally, we installed a quality control laboratory at our China facility in 2012. This laboratory is critical for ensuring that our incoming raw materials meet our quality requirements, and we continue to add new capabilities to this facility to further guarantee product quality and to aid in new product development.

&#160;

We have also added a new test lab in Decatur, Alabama. This lab was completed in FY16 and will be the primary facility to pre-test all NFPA certified garments. This lab includes an industrial washer and dryer, home washer and dryer, shower tester, Martindale abrasion tester, Crestron microscope, flame cabinet, and convection oven. This lab will ensure that garments submitted to Underwriter&#8217;s Laboratories (&#8220;UL&#8221;) for certification are assured to pass certification, thus reducing overall certification costs. 

&#160;

&#160;

Marketing and Sales

&#160;

Domestically, we employ a field sales force in order to better support customers and enhance marketing. We further leverage our in-house sales team with 60 independent sales representatives. These employees and representatives call on over 1,000 industrial safety and fire service distributors nationwide to promote and sell our products. Distributors buy our products for resale and typically maintain inventory at the local level in order to assure quick response times and the ability to serve their customers properly. Our sales employees and independent representatives have consistent communication with end users and decision makers at the distribution level, thereby allowing us valuable feedback on market perception of our products, as well as information about new developments in our industry.

&#160;

As a key competitive and marketing advantage, we manufacture nearly all the garments we sell in our own factories for better control of costs, quality and delivery. Our competitors rely largely on contractors, which is a major selling point in our favor, as customers are more comfortable dealing with the actual manufacturer. 

&#160;

We seek to maximize the efficiency of our established distribution network through direct promotion of our products at the end user level. We advertise primarily through trade publications, and our promotional activities include sales brochures, emails and our website. We exhibit at both regional and national trade shows, such as the National Safety Congress, the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), the American Society of Safety Engineers (ASSE), the CIOSH, the COS+H and the A+A show in Dusseldorf, Germany.

&#160;

Product line expansion to higher value products is progressing in all global markets and is contributing to increased brand recognition, sales growth and profitability. We believe that future international growth is still sustainable in the coming year, based on our current estimates of market penetration, the introduction of higher value products and the opportunity to open new markets in which we do not yet have a presence.

&#160;

Lakeland has salespeople in 18 countries outside of the US and product sales in more than 40 countries. Internationally, our sustainable market advantages continue to be our knowledge of global standards, the diversity of our product offering and the fact that we manufacture our own products. This provides our customers with high level product selection, quality, delivery and customer service. There are no customers who accounted for 10% of sales or more in FY16 and in FY15.

&#160;

Suppliers and Materials

&#160;

Our largest supplier was Precision Fabric Group from whom we purchased 9.5% and 7.8% of our total purchases in FY16 and FY15. We do not have long-term, formal trademark use agreements with any other suppliers of nonwoven fabric raw materials used by us in the production of our limited use/disposable protective clothing product lines. Materials, such as polypropylene, polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, spunlaced polyester, melt blown polypropylene and their derivatives and laminates, are available from 30 or more major mills. FR fabrics are also available from a number of both domestic and international mills. The accessories used in the production of our disposable garments, such as thread, boxes, snaps and elastics, are obtained from unaffiliated suppliers. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining our requirements for these commodity component items.

&#160;

We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining materials, including cotton, polyester and nylon, used in the production of reusable nonwovens and commodity gloves. We obtain Honeywell Spectra&#174; yarn, used in our super cut-resistant Dextra Guard gloves, and Kevlar&#174;, used in the production of our specialty safety gloves, from independent mills that purchase the fibers from DuPont.

&#160;

Materials used in our fire and heat protective suits include glass fabric, aluminized glass, Nomex&#174;, aluminized Nomex&#174;, Kevlar&#174;, aluminized Kevlar&#174; and polybenzimidazole, as well as combinations utilizing neoprene coatings. Traditional chemical protective suits are made of Viton&#174;, butyl rubber and polyvinyl chloride, all of which are available from multiple sources. Advanced chemical protective suits are made from our proprietary ChemMax&#174; 1, 2, 3, 4 and Interceptor&#174;. We have not experienced difficulty obtaining any of these materials.

&#160;

Competition

&#160;

Our business is highly competitive due to large competitors who have monopolistic positions in the fabrics that are standards in the industry in disposable and high-end chemical suits. We believe that the barriers to entry in the reusable garments and gloves industries are relatively low. We face competition in some of our other product markets from large established companies that have greater financial, research and development, sales and technical resources. Where larger competitors, such as DuPont, Kimberly Clark, Ansell Edmont and Honeywell offer products that are directly competitive with our products, particularly as part of an established line of products, there can be no assurance that we can successfully compete for sales and customers. Larger competitors outside of our Disposable and Chemical Suit Lines also may be able to benefit from economies of scale and technological innovation and may introduce new products that compete with our products.

&#160;

11&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Seasonality

&#160;

Our operations have historically been moderately seasonal, with higher sales generally occurring in March, April and May when scheduled maintenance on nuclear, coal, oil and gas fired utilities, chemical, petrochemical and smelting facilities, and other heavy industrial manufacturing plants occurs, primarily due to moderate spring temperatures and low energy demands. Sales decline during the warmer summer vacation months and gradually increase from Labor Day through February with slight declines during holidays, such as Christmas. As a result of this seasonality in our sales, we have historically experienced a corresponding seasonality in our working capital, specifically inventories, with peak inventories occurring between December and May, coinciding with lead times required to accommodate the spring maintenance schedules. We believe that by sustaining higher levels of inventory, we gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Certain of our large customers seek sole sourcing to avoid sourcing their requirements from multiple vendors whose prices, delivery times and quality standards differ.

&#160;

In recent years, due to increased demand by first responders for our chemical suits and fire gear, our historical seasonal pattern has shifted. Governmental disbursements are dependent upon budgetary processes and grant administration processes that do not follow our traditional seasonal sales patterns. Due to the size and timing of these governmental orders, our net sales, results of operations, working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between different reporting periods. As a result, we expect to experience increased variability in net sales, net income, working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis.

&#160;

Patents and Trademarks

&#160;

We own 19 patents and have three patents in the application and approval process with the US Patent and Trademark Office. We own 22 Trademarks and have six Trademarks in the application and approval process. Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets, trademarks and, to a lesser extent, copyrights. We maintain an active program to protect our technology by ensuring respect for our intellectual property rights.

&#160;

Employees

&#160;

As of January 31, 2016, we had 1,211 full-time employees, 1,090, or 91%, of who were employed in our international facilities, and 121, or 9%, of who were employed in our domestic facilities. An aggregate of 1,100 of international employees are members of unions in their respective countries. We are not currently a party to any collective bargaining agreements or any other contracts with these unions. We believe our employee relations to be excellent.

&#160;

Environmental Matters

&#160;

We are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection, chemical control, and health and safety laws and regulations, and we incur costs to comply with those laws. We own and lease real property, and certain environmental laws hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property responsible for contamination on or originating from property, even if they did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination. The presence of hazardous substances on any of our properties or the failure to meet environmental regulatory requirements could affect our ability to use or to sell the property or to use the property as collateral for borrowing, and could result in substantial remediation or compliance costs. If hazardous substances are released from or located on any of our properties, we could incur substantial costs and damages.

&#160;

Although we have not in the past had any material costs or damages associated with environmental claims or compliance, and we do not currently anticipate any such costs or damages, we cannot guarantee that we will not incur material costs or damages in the future as a result of the discovery of new facts or conditions, acquisition of new properties, the release of hazardous substances, a change in interpretation of existing environmental laws or the adoption of new environmental laws.
