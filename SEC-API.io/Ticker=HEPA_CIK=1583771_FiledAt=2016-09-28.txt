Overview 

&#160; 

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of antiviral drugs with a primary emphasis on the treatment of Hepatitis B virus (&#147;HBV&#148;) infections. We are developing two compounds to treat HBV infection, CMX157 and CRV431. CMX157 is a highly potent oral prodrug of tenofovir. Prodrugs are designed to improve the characteristics of drugs, such as better efficacy, lower pill burden, improved safety, etc. Another prodrug of tenofovir, Viread&#174;, is approved for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections. CRV431 is a novel drug candidate also designed or the treatment of HBV infection. We are also developing an antiviral asset known as FV-100. FV-100 is an orally available, small molecule compound being developed for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and treatment of herpes zoster infection and acute zoster-associated pain. Herpes zoster, otherwise known as shingles, is an infection caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus or VZV, the cause of Chickenpox. We were incorporated in Delaware on May 15, 2013. 

&#160; 

On December 18, 2014, we, and Chimerix, Inc.(&#147;Chimerix&#148;), entered into a Licensing Agreement pursuant to which we licensed CMX157 from Chimerix for further clinical development and commercialization. CMX157 is a highly potent lipid analog of the antiviral drug tenofovir DF (Viread&#174;). CMX157 is an oral prodrug of tenofovir. Prodrugs are designed to improve the characteristics of drugs, such as better efficacy, lower pill burden, improved safety, etc. Another prodrug of tenofovir, Viread&#174;, is licensed for the treatment of HIV and HBV. 

&#160; 

On June 10, 2016, we completed an acquisition of Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;Ciclofilin&#148;), in accordance with certain Agreement and Plan of Merger dated May 26, 2016. At the closing of the Merger we acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in Ciclofilin in exchange for Ciclofilin having the right to receive future milestone payments. These milestone payments, if received, will be allocated among the holders of Ciclofilin common stock and certain creditors who converted their debt into equity immediately prior to the Closing. The milestone payments will consist of up to $17 million cash and up to 10% of ContraVir&#146;s issued and outstanding common stock as of June 10, 2016, and will be paid upon the achievement of certain developmental and/or regulatory milestones related to CRV431, Ciclofilin&#146;s lead development candidate. 

&#160; 

CMX157 

&#160; 

CMX157 is a lipid prodrug of tenofovir that utilizes a proprietary technology developed by Chimerix. The proprietary technology is utilized to covalently modify a drug molecule with a lipid side-chain that mimics a naturally occurring phospholipid component of cell membranes. The lipid-conjugated molecule can then utilize natural uptake pathways to achieve oral bioavailability, enhance uptake into cells, avoid many toxicities, and yield higher intracellular concentrations of drug with lower levels of free drug circulating in the blood. Chimerix tested CMX157 in a Phase 1 trial in 2010. It was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, single dose escalation study conducted in healthy volunteers. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CMX157. 

&#160; 

Data from the Phase 1 study showed that CMX157 was both safe and well tolerated. The data generated from the study support the notion that CMX157 may have a better safety profile than Viread&#174; as the novel structure of CMX157 resulted in a high intracellular concentration of the active antiviral agent tenofovir diphosphate and decreased levels of circulating tenofovir, which means there is decreased potential for the renal and bone side effects associated with Viread&#174; (TDF). 

&#160; 

We have licensed CMX157 from Chimerix in exchange for an upfront payment of 120,000 shares of our preferred stock, valued at $1.2 million (time of the deal). We intend to develop CMX157 for the treatment of chronic HBV infection. A recently issued composition of matter patent for CMX157 provides intellectual property protection to at least 2031. 

&#160; 

The decision to develop CMX157 for Hepatitis B has been taken because we do not see a large opportunity to grow the HIV market with new compounds, even though CMX157 is 200 times more potent than tenofovir in vitro. We believe the Hepatitis B market is poised for exceptional growth. CMX157 is 97 times more potent than TDF in vitro and thus potentially allows for a lower dose to achieve similar results in future head to head clinical studies. The lower dose may also 

&#160; 

&#160; 

allow for a better safety profile than TDF. The strategy for CMX157 is to develop the compound to serve as a critical backbone therapy in future HBV curative combination therapies. 

&#160; 

We have completed a Phase 1b safety and pharmacokinetic study in 2016. Data from the Phase 1b study demonstrate that CMX157 was safe and well tolerated by healthy volunteers in all five dosing groups, receiving 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg orally per day. In addition to demonstrating an excellent safety profile, plasma levels of CMX157 and tenofovir showed a favorable, dose-dependent pharmacokinetic profile. In 2016 we have also initiated a Phase 2a multiple ascending dose clinical trial. The study will enroll 60 treatment-na&#239;ve patients with chronic HBV infection and compare CMX157 to TDF. The sequential dose escalation consists of 10 patients per cohort receiving four weeks of a once-daily dose of either 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 mg of CMX157, and two patients per cohort receiving 300 mg of TDF, the standard dose of TDF. 

&#160; 

We will be seeking to submit an Investigational New Drug application (&#147;IND&#148;) to support initiation of our HBV clinical development program at the beginning of 2017. 

&#160; 

CRV431 

&#160; 

CRV431 is a novel drug candidate designed to target a class of proteins called cyclophilins, of which there are many types. Cyclophilins play a role in health and in the pathogenesis of certain diseases, and are known as peptidyl prolyl isomerases. The isomerase activity plays an important role in a number of biological processes including, for example, folding of proteins to confer certain 3-dimensional configurations. And, specific host cyclophilins (e.g., cyclophilin A, B, C, D) play a role in the life cycle of certain viruses, including for example, HBV, HIV, and hepatitis C virus (&#147;HCV&#148;) infections. CRV431 has been developed to inhibit the role of host cyclophilins and therefore interfere in the propagation of these viruses. CRV431 does not directly target the virus and, as such, should be less susceptible to drug resistance, borne from viral mutations. 

&#160; 

Thus far, in vitro testing of CRV431 has been conducted in-house and in collaboration with external groups including for example, the Scripps Research Institute (&#147;Scripps&#148;). Data in various cell lines of either transfected or infected HBV demonstrates nanomolar efficacy (EC50 values) and micromolar toxicity (CC50 values). The selective index (SI), therefore, is wide and suggests that CRV431 presents a viable clinical drug candidate for the treatment of viral infections, including HBV. Additional testing in a transgenic mouse model of HBV indicated that CRV431 reduced HBV DNA in the liver. In a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mouse model, CRV431 demonstrated anti-fibrotic potential, thus addressing an important concern of the downstream effects of chronic HBV infection and liver disease. Both animal models confirmed that CRV431 is orally active and appeared to be well tolerated. 

&#160; 

Market Opportunities 

&#160; 

The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a member of the hepadnavirus family that causes both acute and chronic liver infections. Transmission of the virus occurs by exposure to infected blood or bodily fluids, with the most typical modes being sexual contact, blood transfusion, re-use of contaminated syringes, and transmission from mother to child during childbirth.

&#160; 

Acute infection with the hepatitis B virus typically results in a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, body aches, mild fever, and jaundice. More than 90% of adults infected with the hepatitis B virus will recover and be completely free of the virus within six months. A vaccine to prevent hepatitis B infection has been available in the U.S. for over 30 years. It is administered as a series of three shots and is now believed to offer indefinite protection against infection (Van Damme et al ., 2007). The vaccine is both safe and effective, with over one billion doses administered worldwide since its introduction, with less than 1% of vaccinated children developing chronic infection. 

&#160; 

Nevertheless, it is estimated that approximately 350-400 million people worldwide have a chronic, lifelong infection. According to the World Health Organization, the likelihood of developing a chronic hepatitis B infection is highly dependent upon the age when the infection occurs (WHO fact sheet N&#176;204): 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; 80-90% of infants infected during the first year of life develop chronic infections;

&#183; &#160; 30-50% of children infected before the age of six develop chronic infections;

&#183; &#160; Less than 5% of otherwise healthy adults will develop chronic infection;

&#160; 

Chronic HBV infection is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. If left untreated, 15-40% of chronically infected individuals will develop serious complications, such as hepatitis B associated liver cirrhosis or cancer (AASLD, 2009). Globally, there were 750 thousand HBV-related deaths in 2010 (Lavancy 2004), primarily due to end stage liver disease and liver cancer. Complications due to chronic HBV infection currently represent 5% to 10% of cases of liver transplantation. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Limitations of current therapies 

&#160; 

Two different types of drugs are utilized in the treatment of chronic HBV infection: conventional or pegylated interferon alpha (INF or PEG-INF) and nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NAs). Treatment is dependent upon: serum HBV DNA levels, serum ALT levels, and severity of liver disease. NAs available for the treatment of chronic HBV infection include: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Nucleoside analogs: clevudine, emtricitabine, entecavir, lamivudine, telbivudine

&#183; &#160; Nucleotide analogs: adefovir and tenofovir.

&#160; 

NAs are quite effective at inhibiting HBV replication; however, these treatments are not curative and require lifelong dosing. With the exception of tenofovir and entecavir, long-term treatment with these NAs is associated with a high risk of developing drug resistance. Entecavir is less effective in patients who had previously been treated with lamivudine (PI), a widely used treatment for HBV. Long-term treatment with the currently licensed prodrug of tenofovir, Viread&#174;, is associated with kidney and bone and toxicity (Scaglione et al., 2012)(PI). 

&#160; 

Tenofovir is a NA inhibitor of reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that has diverse functions during HBV replication (Jones et al., 2013). Tenofovir was originally synthesized in the mid 1980&#146;s and was initially shown to have anti-HIV activity. However, due to its very limited bioavailability, the compound did not have the potential for widespread use. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a prodrug of tenofovir that was developed to allow for oral administration. TDF was approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV in 2001 and for the treatment of chronic HBV infection in 2008. The drug is marketed under the name Viread&#174; by Gilead Sciences, or Gilead. Gilead has developed tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) as a follow-on compound to TDF. In both HIV and HBV clinical studies, TAF exhibits similar antiviral activity to TDF but at much lower concentrations of tenofovir in the blood. The lower blood concentration of tenofovir following metabolism of TAF supports the notion that kidney and bone toxicity will be reduced compared to treatment with TDF (Ruane et al., 2013, Agarwal et al., 2015 and Sax et al., 2015). Gilead has tested TAF in clinical trials for chronic HBV and its NDA is currently under review with the FDA. 

&#160; 

A critical limitation of current therapies is the inability to achieve control of the infection in the vast majority of patients without lifelong treatment. HBV exists in the liver as viral cccDNA. The infected person is unable to eliminate this persistent form of the virus despite available therapies. This underscores the need for combination therapy with new classes of agents to eradicate HBV. New mechanisms of action are being identified to attack the virus at different parts of its lifecycle. Combinations of agents with complimentary mechanisms of action that attack the virus at different parts of its lifecycle will be needed to achieve a cure. It is our intention to develop CMX157, the prodrug of a well established anti-HBV nucleotide analog, tenofovir, to be a pivotal component of a curative combination therapy for HBV. 

&#160; 

The drive to find meaningful combination therapy for the treatment of chronic HBV infection stems from the generally accepted principle that a functional cure should address: 1) reduction of HBV DNA; 2) reduction in expression of HBeAg and HBsAg; 3) development of anti-HBsAg antibodies; and 4) reduction/elimination of cccDNA. CMX157 has been primarily developed to reduce HBV DNA (viral load). Layering CRV431 on top of CMX157 is a strategy that begins to address this need for combination therapy to target multiple stages of the HBV life cycle, as preliminary findings indicate CRV431 suppresses HBV DNA and suppresses both HBeAg and HBsAg. 

&#160;

We may also terminate the License Agreement without cause on a country by country basis upon sixty (60) days&#146; prior written notice to Chimerix. 

&#160; 

FV-100 

&#160; 

FV-100 is an orally available, small molecule nucleoside analogue prodrug of CF-1743 that we are developing for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and treatment of herpes zoster infection and acute zoster-associated pain. Herpes zoster, otherwise known as shingles, is an infection caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus or VZV. VZV is responsible for producing the infectious disease known as chicken pox in individuals upon initial exposure to the virus. After the initial infection, the virus can remain dormant in nerve cells for many years and if reactivated, causes a painful rash 

&#160; 

&#160; 

called shingles. FV-100 is being developed specifically for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and treatment of acute herpes zoster associated pain. Nucleoside analogs are capable of disrupting replication of the virus. FV-100 is a pro-drug of CF-1743, which enables us to take advantage of FV-100&#146;s more rapid absorption compared to CF-1743 when taken orally. Published preclinical studies demonstrate that FV-100 is significantly more potent against VZV than currently marketed compounds acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, the FDA-approved drugs used for the treatment of shingles. Preclinical studies, including wash-out studies in VZV-infected human embryonic lung cells following exposure to FV-100 or acyclovir, conducted by Inhibitex Inc., or Inhibitex, and specific cellular antiviral activity experiments comparing FV-100 to acyclovir conducted by Balzarini et al (Biochim Biophys Acta . 2002 Jul 18; 1587(2-3):287-95. Chemotherapy of varicella-zoster virus by a novel class of highly specific anti-VZV bicyclic pyrimidine nucleosides (Balzarini J 1, McGuigan C.) further demonstrate that FV-100 has a more rapid onset of antiviral activity, and may fully inhibit the replication of VZV more rapidly than these drugs at significantly lower concentration levels. In addition, pharmacokinetic data from completed Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials suggest that FV-100 has the potential to demonstrate antiviral activity when dosed orally once-a-day at significantly lower blood levels than valacyclovir, acyclovir, and famciclovir. 

&#160; 

A Phase 2 clinical trial for FV-100 in shingles patients was conducted by Inhibitex and completed in December 2010. This trial represented the first evaluation of FV-100 in shingles patients, and was a well-controlled double blind study comparing two different doses of FV-100 to an active control dose of valacyclovir. A total of 350 patients, aged 50 years and older, were enrolled in one of three treatment arms: 200 mg FV-100 administered once daily; 400 mg FV-100 administered once daily; and 1,000 mg valacyclovir administered three times per day. In addition to further evaluating its safety and tolerability, the main objectives of the trial were to evaluate the potential therapeutic benefit of FV-100 in reducing the severity and duration of shingles-related pain, the incidence of PHN (pain that follows healing of the shingles rash), and the time to lesion healing. 

&#160; 

We conducted an extensive review of the clinical data from the completed Phase 2 trial. We also conducted additional market research (including unmet medical need), reimbursement, pricing, and competitive landscape analyses, etc. Based upon these comprehensive analyses, we had an End of Phase 2 (EoP2) meeting with the FDA from which we were allowed to have FV-100 enter a Phase 3 clinical trial without the need to conduct any additional dose-range finding Phase 2 studies. In parallel to the Phase 3 initiation during the second quarter of 2015, Study 008, a drug-drug interaction trial was conducted during January-March, 2015. The study&#146;s objective was to highlight any potential drug interactions with compounds which are metabolized using the liver&#146;s CYP450 pathway. This is a very common trial in virology and in drug development overall. 

&#160; 

We are currently conducting a Phase 3 study that will compare FV-100 to valacyclovir (Valtrex &#174;) with the reduction in the incidence of shingles-associated pain, PHN, as a primary endpoint. It is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, comparative study in up to 200 centers in the U.S. The study is comprised of three arms: FV-100 400mg QD, FV-100 400mg BID, and valacyclovir 1000mg TID. Approximately 825 patients are expected to be analyzed for a seven-day treatment period, and follow up through day 120.

&#160; 

Market Opportunity for the Treatment of Shingles 

&#160; 

VZV, a DNA virus and a member of the herpes virus group, is the virus that causes both chickenpox and herpes zoster, or shingles. Chickenpox, the initial infection caused by VZV in an individual, generally occurs during childhood and it is caused by exposure to another individual with an active infection. After the chickenpox infection subsides, VZV remains latent in the individual&#146;s nerves including dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia, and can re-emerge later in life. The majority of shingles patients experience pain for several weeks in connection with their active infection. For many patients, the shingles-associated pain does not resolve when the lesions heal and continues for months, possibly years. Shingles-associated pain that persists more than three months is referred to as post-herpetic neuralgia (&#147;PHN&#148;) which is the most common and clinically relevant complication of shingles. Approximately 15-20% of all shingles patients experience PHN, although the incidence of PHN is more prevalent in patients over 50 years of age. 

&#160; 

Although shingles can occur in any individual with a prior VZV infection, its incidence varies with key risk factors, which are advanced age, immune status and being female. Shingles is largely a disease of the aged or aging, with over 50% of all cases occurring in individuals over the age of 60, and approximately 80% occurring in individuals over the age of 40. A study in 2007 based upon data from 2000 implied that there were approximately 1 million new shingles cases that year. Due to the aging of the population in many industrialized countries, as well as the increasing use of immunosuppressive agents in transplant patients, patients receiving immune suppressants for autoimmune diseases such rheumatoid arthritis and the increased numbers of immunosuppressed patients from cancer therapy, the incidence of shingles has increased and is expected to continue to rise. A recent study from the Centers for Disease Control investigating medical claims data from MarketScan &#174; databases from 1993-2006 indicated that the crude incidence of shingles cases increased 259% over that period

&#160; 

&#160; 

of time. Furthermore, a study conducted by the Mayo Clinic suggests that the recurrence rate for shingles is approximately 6.2%, which reflects a much higher rate than prior studies which assessed a shorter follow-up period. It is estimated that approximately 20-30% of all persons in the U.S. will suffer from shingles at some point during their lifetime. 

&#160; 

Valacyclovir, acyclovir and famciclovir are oral antivirals currently approved by the FDA, and regulatory agencies in many other countries, for the treatment of shingles. These generically available drugs are referred to as &#147;pan-herpetic&#148; drugs, as they are used to treat infections caused by various herpes viruses, including herpes simplex 1 and 2, and VZV. Unlike those drugs, FV-100 only demonstrates antiviral activity against VZV, and not the other herpes viruses. Based upon an analysis by data compiled by IMS Health, Inc. (&#147;IMS&#148;) on our behalf, and a recent utilization study of the use of Valtrex &#174; from 1994-2009 conducted by the FDA as well as other market research we have independently conducted, we estimate that 15-30% of the nearly 17 million retail prescriptions written for valacyclovir, acyclovir and famciclovir combined in 2009 were for the treatment of herpes zoster.

&#160; 

Limitations of Current Therapies 

&#160; 

Data from various clinical trials conducted in the 1990&#146;s demonstrate that a seven day administration of valacyclovir, acyclovir, or famciclovir, beginning within 72 hours from the first appearance of a shingles-related rash or lesion, can lessen the duration of the dermatological symptoms associated with shingles and the average duration of shingles-related pain. However, these currently approved antiviral drugs, when used to treat shingles, have a number of limitations, including the following: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; No Approved Label for the Reduction of shingles-Associated Pain and PHN. Currently, there are no antiviral therapies indicated for the reduction of shingles-related pain or the prevention PHN. There is also no cure for PHN per se ; rather, treatment of PHN is accomplished through analgesics, narcotics and pain management. The most commonly prescribed medications to treat PHN are opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, or topical lidocaine or capsaicin patches. Previously published clinical data demonstrate that antiviral therapy can reduce the duration of shingles-related pain, and we believe a more potent, faster acting anti-VZV compound, such as FV-100, has the potential to more rapidly inhibit the replication of VZV, thus reducing shingles-related nerve damage and further reducing shingles-associated pain and PHN. We believe an antiviral therapy that can further reduce the severity and/or duration of shingles-associated pain and the prevalence of PHN may have a competitive advantage relative to the currently available shingles therapies.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Inconvenient Dosing. Due to their pharmacokinetic properties and lower potency against VZV, current pan-herpetic oral antiviral therapies require shingles patients to take three to five oral doses each day for seven to ten days. Specifically, current dosing regimens for the treatment of shingles are as follows: valacyclovir&#151;1,000 mg, three times per day; famciclovir&#151;500 mg, three times per day; and acyclovir&#151;800 mg, five times per day. Such dosing regimens are inconvenient and can result in non-compliance since patients tend to forget to take multiple doses, particularly if more frequent than twice daily, resulting in less than optimal treatment outcomes. We believe that an effective therapy that can be administered via a more convenient, once-a-day oral administration may have a competitive advantage relative to current shingles therapies.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; The Dosage of Currently Available Antiviral Drugs for shingles Must be Adjusted for Patients with Insufficient Renal Function. Although current pan-herpetic oral antiviral therapies have been shown to be generally safe and well tolerated in shingles patients, dosing of valacyclovir, famciclovir and acyclovir must be adjusted for certain patients with insufficient renal (kidney) function to avoid potential adverse events. Preclinical and clinical data to-date suggests that FV-100 is primarily metabolized and excreted via the liver and not through the kidney. Accordingly, we currently believe that the dosing of FV-100 will not need to be adjusted for patients with insufficient renal function. We believe that an oral antiviral therapy that has a similar or better safety profile to valacyclovir, famciclovir and acyclovir, and is not required to be adjusted for patients with insufficient renal function, may have a competitive advantage over currently approved shingles therapies.

&#160; 

We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for a more potent, faster acting, low dose once-daily oral antiviral agent, such as FV-100, which has the potential to further reduce the incidence, severity, and duration of shingles-associated pain and prevent PHN. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

FV-100 Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

Prior to the formation of our company, the following clinical trials were completed. 

&#160; 

Phase 1. 

&#160; 

In August 2008, a FV-100 Phase 1 single-ascending-dose clinical trial was completed in August 200. The blinded, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of four doses of FV-100 in six cohorts of healthy volunteers (100, 200, 400, and 800 mg, as well as a two 400 mg food effect groups). Each cohort consisted of six subjects that received FV-100 and two that received placebo. There were no serious adverse events observed and the compound appeared to be generally well tolerated in the trial. In addition, pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that all doses evaluated in the trial maintained plasma levels of CF-1743, the active form of FV-100, which exceeded its EC50 for at least 24 hours. The EC 50 represents the concentration of drug that is required for 50% inhibition of viral replication in vitro 

&#160; 

In January 2009, a blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 1 trial conducted by Inhibitex was completed to evaluate single and multiple doses of FV-100 in healthy subjects 65 years of age and older. One dose cohort consisted of 12 healthy subjects, ten of whom received a single administration of 400 mg of FV-100 and two of whom received placebo, and the second cohort also consisted of 12 healthy subjects, ten of whom received 400 mg of FV-100 administered twice daily for seven consecutive days and two of whom received placebo. The results of this trial demonstrated no significant safety differences between these subjects and those from the multiple ascending dose trial. 

&#160; 

In February 2009, a Phase I trial was completed by Inhibitex. The trial, a blinded, placebo-controlled multiple-ascending-dose study, was designed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of five oral doses of FV-100 (100, 200, 400 and 800 mg administered once daily and 400 mg administered twice daily, each for seven days) in healthy subjects aged 18 to 55. Each dose cohort consisted of six subjects that received FV-100 and two that received placebo. The results of the trial demonstrated that there were no serious adverse events and FV-100 appeared to be generally well tolerated at all dose levels. Further, pharmacokinetic data demonstrated that all doses studied maintained mean plasma levels of CF-1743, the active form of FV-100, which exceeded its EC 50 for at least 24 hours, supporting the evaluation of once-daily dosing of FV-100 in future clinical trials. 

&#160; 

Phase 2. 

&#160; 

A Phase 2 clinical trial of FV-100 was completed by Inhibitex in December 2010. The trial was a well-controlled, double-blind study comparing two different doses of FV-100 to an active control (valacyclovir). A total of 350 patients, aged 50 years and older who had shingles-associated pain and presented to the clinic within 72 hours of appearance of their first shingles lesion, were equally randomized to one of three treatment arms: 200 mg FV-100 administered once-daily for seven days; 400 mg FV-100 administered once-daily for seven days; or 1,000 mg valacyclovir administered three times per day for seven days. In addition to further evaluating its safety and tolerability, the objectives of the trial were to evaluate the potential therapeutic benefit of FV-100 in reducing: (i) the severity and duration of shingles-associated pain, (ii) the incidence of PHN, (iii) the time to lesion crusting and healing, and (iv) the use of concomitant pain medications, as compared to valacyclovir. 

&#160; 

The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was a 25% reduction in the severity and duration of shingles-related pain during the first 30 days as compared to valacyclovir. The results obtained from the study did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction. Shingles patients who received 200 mg or 400 mg FV-100 experienced numerically favorable treatment differences as compared to patients treated with valacyclovir. Both doses of FV-100 resulted in lower incidences of PHN when compared to valacyclovir. For patients receiving valacyclovir, the time to lesion crusting was faster than those patients receiving FV-100; however, no differences were noted among the treatment arms on time to full lesion healing. The three treatment arms were well-balanced with regard to demographics and baseline shingles-associated pain levels. 

&#160; 

FV-100 Safety Summary 

&#160; 

Adverse events, (&#147;AE&#148;), means any reported sign or symptom reported by the patient that began following the initiation of therapy. Serious adverse events (&#147;SAE&#148;) means any adverse event that is life threatening, requires hospitalization or is considered a significant clinical event according to the treating physician. 

&#160; 

A comparison of AE and SAE among the three treatment arms in the Phase 2 trial demonstrated that the overall tolerability and side effect profile of both doses of FV-100 was comparable to valacyclovir.

The FV-100 assets acquired from BMS are licensed from Cardiff pursuant to the terms of that certain Patent and Technology License Agreement, dated as of February 2, 2005, between Cardiff and CRI, an entity with no prior relationship with us, as amended March 27, 2007, or the Cardiff Agreement. 

&#160; 

The Cardiff Agreement shall remain in full force and effect until the date upon which the last of the last patent or the last continuation or extension to any patents within the Patent Rights (as defined in the Cardiff Agreement) expires. Any milestone and/or royalty payment under the Cardiff Agreement shall be payable for as long as the Cardiff Agreement is in effect. The Cardiff Agreement may be terminated in its entirety, for among other reasons and in the following manner as set forth below: (a) automatically by Cardiff, if we become bankrupt or insolvent and/or if our business shall be placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee, or trustee; (b) upon ninety (90) calendar days written notice from Cardiff, if we breach or default (i) on the payment or report obligations or use of name obligations or (ii) on any other obligation under the Cardiff Agreement, subject to a ninety (90) calendar-day cure period; (c) if we have defaulted or been in excess of one (1) month late on its payment obligations pursuant to the terms of the Cardiff Agreement on any two (2) occasions in a twelve (12) month period, subject to a cure period; (d) upon one hundred twenty (120) calendar days written notice from us if any particular patent or patents included in Patent Rights and which account for at least thirty (30%) percent of the total royalty to Cardiff, is or are irrevocably adjudicated to be invalid; or (e) upon ninety (90) calendar days written notice from us if Cardiff is in breach of Section 11.1 (Confidential Information and Publication) unless, before the end of the such ninety (90) calendar-day notice period, Cardiff has cured the default or breach to our reasonable satisfaction and so notifies us, stating the manner of the cure. 

&#160; 

The terms of the Cardiff Agreement provided in consideration for a license of all of Cardiff&#146;s rights in any technical information, know-how, processes, procedures, compositions, devices, methods, formulae, protocols, techniques related to the FV-100 Assets, or the Patent Rights. The Cardiff Agreement provided for an initial base payment of $270,000, which has previously been paid by CRI, subsequent milestone payments covering (i) initiation of a clinical trial at each phase, (ii) marketing (FDA) approval and (iii) on achieving the milestone of aggregate net sales in three different tiers, as well as a low single digit royalty based on net sales. The total aggregate amount of milestone payments that could be payable to Cardiff by us under the Cardiff Agreement is equal to $400,000. 

&#160; 

The terms of the BMS Agreement provided for an initial base payment of $1 million, subsequent milestone payments covering (i) marketing (FDA) approval and (ii) on achieving the milestone of aggregate net sales equal to or greater than $125 million, as well as a single digit royalty based on net sales. The total aggregate amount of milestone payments that could be payable to BMS under the BMS Agreement is equal to $9 million. The duration of any milestone payment obligation owed to BMS shall continue until the earliest of (i) payment, in full, of all milestone payments as required under the BMS Agreement, (ii) our determination using commercially reasonable standards consistent with the exercise of prudent scientific and business judgment and consistent with those standards used by us for its other therapeutic products at a similar stage of development and with similar commercial potential, to terminate the development of the FV-100 assets, and (iii) the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of the BMS Agreement, The duration of any royalty payment obligation to BMS shall commence on the date of the first commercial sale of the FV-100 assets in a country until the expiration of any claim of an issued and unexpired patent which has not been held permanently revoked, unenforceable or invalid by a decision of a court or other governmental agency of competent jurisdiction of any of our patents or any other patent covering the use or sale of the FV-100 assets in such country. The transactions contemplated by the BMS Agreement closed on August 17, 2012 and neither party can terminate the remaining obligations owed under the BMS Agreement. 

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

Patents and other proprietary intellectual rights are crucial in our business, and establishing and maintaining these rights are essential to justify the development of our product candidate. We have sought, and intend to continue to seek, patent protection for our inventions and rely upon patents, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain a competitive advantage for our product candidate. In order to protect these rights, know-how and trade secrets, we typically require employees, consultants, collaborators and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements with us, generally stating that they will not disclose any confidential information about us to third parties for a certain period of time, and will otherwise not use confidential information for anyone&#146;s benefit but ours. 

&#160; 

As patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy until patents are published or issued, unless earlier publication is required under applicable law or in connection with patents filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#147;PCT&#148;) or as publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind the actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions described in our pending patent applications or that we 

&#160; 

&#160; 

or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for such inventions. Furthermore, the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions, and therefore, the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents or their enforceability cannot be predicted. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the terms of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, patents filed on or after June 8, 1995 have a term of 20 years from the date of filing, irrespective of the period of time it may take for the patent to ultimately issue. This may shorten the period of patent protection afforded to our products as patent applications in the biopharmaceutical sector often take considerable time to issue. Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, a sponsor may obtain marketing data exclusivity for a period of time following FDA approval of certain drug applications, regardless of patent status, if the drug is a new chemical entity or if new clinical studies were used to support the marketing application for the drug. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 also allows a patent owner to obtain an extension of applicable patent terms for a period equal to one-half the period of time elapsed between the filing of an IND and the filing of the corresponding New Drug Application (&#147;NDA&#148;) plus the period of time between the filing of the NDA and FDA approval, with a five year maximum patent extension. We cannot be sure that we will be able to take advantage of either the patent term extension or marketing data exclusivity provisions of this law. 

&#160; 

Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, entered into between us and Synergy on August 5, 2013, Synergy transferred ownership of all intellectual property rights acquired from BMS, including all historical research, clinical study protocols, data, results and patents related to the FV-100 assets as well as assumed the obligations of Synergy, including all liabilities of Synergy, under the BMS Agreement. These obligations include among other things, (i) all liabilities of BMS and Synergy related to the FV-100 assets, including all accounts payable, legal, environmental, tax, or warranty claims and all other liabilities of Synergy of whatever kind and nature, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, known or unknown, whether or not accrued, arising out of or relating to the FV-100 assets or the ownership, sale or lease of any of the FV-100 assets, including any claim, action, suit, arbitration, inquiry, proceeding or investigation by or before any governmental entity, and (ii) the payment of any milestone or royalty payment to BMS under the BMS Agreement. During the period August 17, 2012 through June 10, 2013, there were no material liabilities assumed by Synergy under the BMS Agreement and subsequently transferred to us pursuant to the Contribution Agreement. 

&#160; 

The FV-100 assets acquired by us from Synergy are licensed from Cardiff pursuant to the terms of the Cardiff Agreement which we assumed from Synergy. Cardiff and Rega Foundation (&#147;Rega&#148;) were originally the joint owners of the Patent Rights. Pursuant to the terms of an agreement, dated September 24, 1998, as amended December 23, 2004, Cardiff received from Rega an exclusive, irrevocable worldwide license to manufacture, use, sell, or otherwise deal in or with products utilizing the Patent Rights, including the right to grant sublicenses thereunder. Synergy assumed the obligations under the Cardiff Agreement from BMS pursuant to the terms of the BMS Agreement. BMS assumed the obligations under the Cardiff agreement from Inhibitex upon its acquisition of Inhibitex in January 2012. Inhibitex assumed the obligations under the Cardiff Agreement upon its acquisition of FermaVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;FermaVir&#148;) in September 2010. FermaVir was the successor to CRI in a merger consummated in August 2005. As of June 30, 2014, we currently license from Cardiff the three issued United States patents related to FV-100 which we acquired from Synergy pursuant to the Contribution Agreement. One of these patents covers the composition-of-matter of FV-100 and was issued on December 11, 2012 and will expire in 2028. The other two cover the precursor and close analogs of FV-100 and were issued on October 26, 2001 and June 3, 2003 and will both expire in 2018. In addition we currently license from Cardiff 38 granted foreign patents which cover composition-of-matter of FV-100 and expire in 2027. These foreign patents cover Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom and the Russian Federation. We also own 5 pending foreign applications which cover the composition of matter of FV-100. We also own 45 additional foreign patents that cover the precursor and close analogs of FV-100. We also currently license from Cardiff 6 foreign applications and 1 US application pending, which cover the FV-100 process and polymorph composition. 

&#160; 

The CMX-157 assets acquired by us from Chimerix are licensed pursuant to the terms of the December 18, 2014 Agreement (&#147;Agreement&#148;). Per the Agreement, we received from Chimerix a license to develop, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, export and import CMX-157. Per the Agreement, we acquired patented rights owned by Chimerix, including rights licensed to Chimerix by Regents of the University of California pursuant to the terms of an agreement, dated May 12, 2002, by and between Chimerix and the Regents of the University of California (&#147;UC Agreement&#148;), as amended on September 11, 2002, December 17, 2010, September 14, 2011, and July 19, 2012. 

&#160; 

As of the date of this report, we currently license directly from Chimerix two issued United States patents related to CMX-157. One of these patents covers a composition of matter of a stable crystalline salt of CMX-157 and was issued on 

&#160; 

&#160; 

April 14, 2015 and will expire in 2031. The other United States patent covers methods of use of CMX-157 and was issued on March 31, 2015 and will expire in 2030. In addition, we currently directly license from Chimerix one granted Australian patent which covers the composition of matter of a stable crystalline salt of CMX-157 which will expire in 2031. We also directly license ten foreign granted patents (Australia, China, Europe, Japan, Mexico, and South Africa) which cover methods of use of CMX-157 and expire between 2028 and 2030. We directly license five pending foreign patent applications and one pending US patent application which cover the composition of matter of a stable crystalline salt of CMX-157. We also directly license from Chimerix 21 additional pending foreign patent applications and 4 pending US patent applications which cover methods of use of CMX-157. The US patent applications, if allowed, will expire in 2030, 2031 and 2033, non-inclusive of any time awarded by the United States Patent Office for Patent Term Adjustment. The foreign patent applications, if allowed, will expire between 2028 and 2033. 

&#160; 

As of the date of this report, we currently license from Chimerix, pursuant to the terms of the UC Agreement, five issued United States patents and one allowed patent application related to CMX-157. Four of the issued patents cover a composition of matter of CMX-157 and were issued between 2004 and 2012 and will expire between 2020 and 2021. The allowed patent application also covers compositions of matter and will likely expire in 2020, non-inclusive of any time awarded by the United States Patent Office for Patent Term Adjustment. 

&#160; 

The other United States patent covers methods of use of CMX-157 and was issued on September 7, 2010 and will expire in 2020. 

&#160; 

In addition, we currently license from Chimerix, via the UC Agreement, 36 granted foreign patents covering the composition of matter of CMX-157 in Australia, Canada, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Cyprus, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, United Kingdom, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, and Turkey, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, China, Russia, and South Africa. We also license two additional pending patent applications covering the composition of matter in Japan and India. All foreign patents and pending patent applications will expire in 2020. 

&#160; 

On June 13, 2016 we completed our merger with Ciclofilin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (&#147;CPI&#148;) acquiring all of its outstanding equity interests. Ciclofilin&#146;s lead asset is CPI-431-32, which is in development against hepatitis B virus (HBV). CPI-431-32 strengthens ContraVir&#146;s HBV portfolio, which also contains CMX157, a highly potent HBV antiviral that works through a complementary mechanism. On February 14, 2014, CPI, through its wholly owned subsidiary entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement to acquire Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (&#147;Aurinia&#148;) entire interest in CRV431. There was no upfront consideration. There are future milestone payments of up to CAD $2.9 million, which are to be paid within 30 days of achieving such milestone. In addition to the milestone payments future payment obligations (in Canadian Dollars &#147;CAD&#148;) including a royalty of 2.5% of net sales by CPC or its licensee(s). The amount payable under the foregoing royalty obligation is uncapped. 

&#160; 

Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 

&#160; 

While trade secret protection is an essential element of our business and we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, we cannot give assurance that our unpatented proprietary technology will afford us significant commercial protection. We seek to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in intellectual property arising from their work for us. All employees sign an agreement not to engage in any conflicting employment or activity during their employment with us and not to disclose or misuse our confidential information. However, it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated, and if so, there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that employees, consultants or third parties will not breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts, infringe or misappropriate our trade secrets and other proprietary rights or that measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate. 

&#160; 

In the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. If we are forced to defend ourselves against such claims, whether they are with or without merit and whether they are resolved in favor of, or against, our licensors or us, we may face costly litigation and the diversion of management&#146;s attention and resources. As a result of such disputes, we may have to 

&#160; 

&#160; 

develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may be unavailable n terms acceptable to us, or at all. 

&#160; 

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

We currently do not have any commercialization or sales and marketing capabilities, and currently have no plans to invest in or build such capabilities internally. At this time, we anticipate partnering or collaborating with, or licensing certain rights to, other larger pharmaceutical or biopharmaceutical companies to support the development of our antiviral product candidate through late-stage clinical development and, if successful, commercialization. However, we may decide not to license any development and commercialization rights to our product candidate in the future. 

&#160; 

Manufacturing 

&#160; 

We do not own or operate any facilities in which we can formulate and manufacture our product candidates. We intend to rely on contract manufacturers to produce all materials required to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials under current good manufacturing practices (&#147;cGMP&#148;), with management and oversight of these activities by our management team. We have identified alternate sources of supply and other contract manufacturers that can produce materials for our preclinical and clinical trial requirements on a timely basis. However, if an existing or future contract manufacture fails to deliver on schedule, or at all, it could delay or interrupt the development process for our product candidate and affect our operating results and estimated time lines. 

&#160; 

We intend to use contract manufacturers to produce clinical trial material for use in the clinical trials of FV-100, CMX157, and CRV431. 

&#160; 

Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement 

&#160; 

In the U.S. and most foreign markets, any revenue associated with the sale of our product candidate, if approved for sale, will depend largely upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include various government health authorities such as The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (&#147;CMS&#148;), which administers Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., managed-care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, including pharmaceuticals. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products. Our products may ultimately not be considered cost-effective, and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to support a profitable operation or generate an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 

&#160; 

The U.S. and foreign governments periodically propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare and pharmaceutical products. Accordingly, legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change before our product candidate is ever approved for sale. In addition, the adoption of new legislation could further limit reimbursement for pharmaceuticals. Further, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. The marketability of our products may suffer if the government and other third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement rates for our product candidate. 

&#160; 

We, and our existing collaborators, intend to obtain coverage and reimbursement from these third-party payers for any of our products that may be approved for sale; however, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining adequate coverage, reimbursement, or pricing, if any. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Matters 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

The preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, distribution, promotion, sale, export, reporting and record-keeping of drug products and product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S., principally the FDA and corresponding state agencies, and regulatory agencies in foreign countries. 

&#160; 

Non-compliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of the clinical development of a product candidate, manufacturing and marketing, failure of the FDA or similar 

&#160; 

&#160; 

regulatory agency in other countries to grant marketing approval, withdrawal of marketing approvals, fines, injunctions, seizure of products and criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

U.S. Regulatory Approval 

&#160; 

Pursuant to FDA regulations, we are required to successfully undertake a long and rigorous development process before our product candidate can be marketed or sold in the U.S. This regulatory process typically includes the following steps: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the completion of satisfactory preclinical studies under the FDA&#146;s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the submission and acceptance of an IND that must be reviewed by the FDA or Clinical Trial Application that must be reviewed by similar regulatory agencies in other countries and become effective before human clinical trials may begin;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; obtaining the approval of an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or Ethics Committee, or EC, at each site where we plan to conduct a clinical trial to protect the welfare and rights of human subjects in clinical trials;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the successful completion of a series of adequate and well- controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, potency, efficacy and purity of any product candidate for its intended use, which conform to the FDA&#146;s good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations;

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the development and demonstration of manufacturing processes that conform to FDA-mandated current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs; and

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; the submission to, and review and approval by, the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, or a Biologic License Application, or BLA, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of a product.

&#160; 

Successfully completing this development process requires a substantial amount of time and financial resources. We cannot assure you that this process will result in the granting of an approval for our product candidate on a timely basis, if at all, or that we will have sufficient financial resources to see the process for our product candidate through to completion. 

&#160; 

Preclinical Studies 

&#160; 

Preclinical studies generally include laboratory, or in vitro, evaluation of a product candidate, its chemistry, formulation, stability and toxicity, as well as certain in vivo animal studies to assess a product&#146;s potential safety and biologic activity. We must submit the results of these preclinical studies, together with other information, including manufacturing records, analytical data and proposed clinical trial protocols, to the FDA as part of an IND, which must be reviewed and become effective before we may begin any human clinical trials. An IND generally becomes effective approximately 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within this 30-day time period, raises material concerns or questions about the intended conduct of the trials and imposes what is referred to as a clinical hold. If our product candidate is placed on clinical hold, we may be required to resolve any outstanding issues to the satisfaction of the FDA before we could begin, or continue, clinical trials of such product candidate. Preclinical studies supportive of an IND generally take a year or more to complete, and there is no guarantee that an IND based on those studies will become effective, allowing human clinical testing to begin. 

&#160; 

Certain preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the FDA&#146;s GLP regulations and the U.S. Department of Agriculture&#146;s Animal Welfare Act. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of the studies, requiring such studies to be conducted again. 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160; 

This clinical trial phase of drug development follows a successful IND submission and involves the activities necessary to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, biologic activity, efficacy and dosage of an investigational new drug substance in humans, as well as the ability to produce the drug substance in accordance with the FDA&#146;s cGMP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study and the parameters to be used in assessing the safety and the activity or efficacy of the product candidate. Each clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND prior to beginning the trial. Each trial and the clinical protocol must be reviewed, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

approved and conducted under the auspices of an IRB and, with limited exceptions, requires the patient&#146;s informed consent to participate in the trial. Sponsors, investigators, and IRBs also must satisfy extensive GCPs, including regulations and guidelines for obtaining informed consent from the study subjects, complying with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitoring the clinical trial, and reporting any serious adverse events on a timely basis. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health or safety risk. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials to support a NDA or BLA for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases: Phase 1, 2 and 3, with Phase 4 clinical trials often conducted after marketing approval has been granted. The FDA may require sponsors to conduct Phase 4 clinical trials to study certain safety issues or other patient populations. Data from these activities are compiled in a NDA or a BLA for submission to the FDA requesting approval to market the drug. These phases may be compressed, may overlap, or may be omitted in some circumstances. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Phase 1: After an IND becomes effective, Phase 1 human clinical trials can begin. A product candidate is typically introduced either into healthy human subjects or in some cases, patients with the medical condition for which the product candidate is intended to be used. Generally, the purpose of a Phase 1 trial is to assess a product candidate&#146;s safety and the ability of the human body to tolerate it at different dose levels. Absorption, metabolism, distribution and pharmacokinetic trials are also generally performed at this stage. Phase 1 trials typically evaluate these aspects of the investigational drug in both single doses, as well as multiple doses.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Phase 2: During Phase 2 clinical trials, a product candidate is generally studied in an exploratory trial or trials in a limited number of patients with the disease or medical condition for which it is intended to be used in order to (i) further identify any possible adverse side effects and safety risks, (ii) assess the preliminary or potential efficacy or biologic activity of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases or medical conditions, and (iii) assess dose tolerance and determine the optimal dose for a subsequent Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial. Phase II trials generally involve patients who are divided into one or more groups that will get one of several dose levels of the product candidate, and a control group that is not treated with the product candidate but either receives a placebo or a drug already on the market for the same indication. Typically, two or more Phase 2 studies will be conducted for a product candidate prior to advancing to Phase 3.

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Phase 3: If and when one or more Phase 2 trials demonstrate that a specific dose or range of doses of a product candidate is potentially effective and has an acceptable safety profile, one or more Phase 3 trials may be undertaken to further demonstrate or confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of the investigational drug in an expanded patient population, with the goal of evaluating its overall risk-benefit relationship. Phase 3 trials are generally designed to reach a specific goal or endpoint, the achievement of which is intended to demonstrate the product candidate&#146;s clinical efficacy. The successful demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety in one or more Phase 3 trials is typically a prerequisite to the filing of a NDA or BLA for a product candidate.

&#160; 

In the case of product candidates being developed for serious or life- threatening diseases, such as HBV, Phase 1 trials may be conducted in patients with the respective disease rather than in healthy volunteers. These studies may provide initial evidence of activity or efficacy traditionally obtained in Phase II clinical trials, and therefore these trials may be referred to as Phase 1/2 or Phase 1b clinical trials. 

&#160; 

A company may request an &#147;end-of-Phase 2 Meeting&#148; with the FDA to assess the safety of the dose regimen to be studied in the Phase 3 clinical trial, to evaluate the planned design of a Phase 3 trial, and to identify any additional information that will be needed to support a NDA. If a Phase 3 clinical trial has been the subject of discussion at an &#147;end- of-Phase2 Meeting,&#148; the trial sponsor may be eligible for a Special Protocol Assessment (&#147;SPA&#148;), by the FDA, a process by which the FDA, at the request of the sponsor, will evaluate the trial protocol and issues relating to the protocol within 45 days to assess whether it is deemed to be adequate to meet the scientific and regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor. If the FDA and the sponsor reach agreement on the design and size of a Phase 3 clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in a NDA or BLA, the FDA may reduce the understanding to writing. The SPA, however, is not a guarantee of product approval by the FDA, or approval of any permissible claims about the product. 

&#160; 

Throughout the various phases of clinical development, samples of the product candidate made in different batches are tested for stability to establish any shelf life constraints. In addition, large-scale production protocols and written standard operating procedures for each aspect of commercial manufacture and testing must be developed. Phase 1, 2, and 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified time period, if at all. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical development that are conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate further evaluation or trials based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA&#146;s assessment of 

&#160; 

&#160; 

the risk/benefit ratio to the subject or patient. The FDA, the sponsor, or an IRB may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health or safety risk. The FDA can also request additional clinical trials be conducted as a condition to product approval or advancement to the next stage of development. Additionally, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of products under development. Furthermore, IRBs, which are independent entities constituted to protect human subjects in the institutions in which clinical trials are being conducted, have the authority to suspend clinical trials in their respective institutions at any time for a variety of reasons, including safety issues. A Data Safety Monitoring Board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health or safety risk. 

&#160; 

Clinical trials performed outside the U.S. under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies conducted in the U.S. The FDA may accept a foreign clinical study not conducted under an IND only if the study is well- designed, well-conducted, performed by qualified investigators, and conforms to the ethical principles contained in the Declaration of Helsinki, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research was conducted, whichever provides greater protection of the human subjects. 

&#160; 

Certain information about clinical trials, including a description of the study, participation criteria, location of study sites, and contact information, is required to be sent to the National Institutes of Health, (&#147;NIH&#148;) for inclusion in a publicly-accessible database that is available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Sponsors also are subject to certain state laws imposing requirements to make publicly available certain information on clinical trial results. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 directed the FDA to issue regulations that will require sponsors to submit to the NIH the results of all controlled clinical studies, other than Phase 1 studies. 

&#160; 

New Drug and Biologics License Applications 

&#160; 

If and when we believe that all the requisite clinical trials for a product candidate have been completed with satisfactory and supporting clinical data, we must submit a NDA or BLA to the FDA in order to obtain approval for the marketing and sale of a product candidate in the U.S. Among many other items, a NDA or BLA typically includes the results of all preclinical and toxicology studies and human clinical trials and a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods. The FDA must approve the NDA or BLA prior to the marketing and sale of the related product. The FDA may deny a NDA or BLA if it believes all applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional data, including clinical, toxicology, safety or manufacturing data prior to approval. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a NDA or BLA to review the application to ensure that it is sufficiently complete for a substantive review before accepting it for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept a NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be amended with the additional information. The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. 

&#160; 

A NDA or BLA can receive either standard or priority review. A product candidate representing a potentially significant improvement in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a life threatening or serious disease may receive a priority review. In addition, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may also receive accelerated approval on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing Phase 4 clinical trials. Priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the approval process. 

&#160; 

If the results of the FDA&#146;s evaluation of the NDA or BLA, and inspection of manufacturing facilities and clinical sites are favorable, the FDA will issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 trials, and surveillance to monitor the drug&#146;s safety or efficacy and may impose other conditions, including labeling or distribution restrictions which can materially impact the potential market and profitability of the drug. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 

&#160; 

If the FDA determines that it cannot approve the application in its present form, it generally issues what is referred to as a complete response letter. A complete response letter will describe all of the specific deficiencies that the agency has 

&#160; 

&#160; 

identified in an application that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA. If and when those conditions are met to the FDA&#146;s satisfaction, the FDA will typically re-review the application and possibly issue an approval letter. However, even after submitting this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. It can take several years for the FDA to approve a NDA or BLA once it is submitted, and the actual time required for any product candidate to be approved may vary substantially, depending upon the nature, complexity and novelty of the product candidate. 

&#160; 

We cannot assure you that the FDA, or any other similar regulatory agency in another country, will grant approval for our product candidate on a timely basis, if at all. Success in preclinical or early-stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. 

&#160; 

Post-Approval Regulations 

&#160; 

If and when a product candidate receives regulatory approval to be marketed and sold, the approval is typically limited to a specific clinical indication or use. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, subsequent discovery of previously unknown safety problems with a product may result in restrictions on its use, or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. Any FDA-approved products manufactured or distributed by us are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and reporting of adverse events or experiences. Further, drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations, which impose rigorous procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our contract manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we, or our present or future contract manufacturers or suppliers, will be able to comply with cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in, among other things, total or partial suspension of production activities for our current and future product candidates, failure of the FDA to grant approval for marketing of such product candidate, and withdrawal, suspension, or revocation of marketing approvals. 

&#160; 

If the FDA approves our product candidate, we, or our collaborators if applicable, and our contract manufacturers must provide the FDA with certain updated safety, efficacy and manufacturing information. Product changes, as well as certain changes in the manufacturing process or facilities where the manufacturing occurs or other post-approval changes may necessitate additional FDA review and approval. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the formulation and manufacture of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. 

&#160; 

The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of an approved drug or biologic product must also comply with FDA and Federal Trade Commission (&#147;FTC&#148;) requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. The FDA and FTC have very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a Warning Letter directing the company to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

The FDA&#146;s policies may change in the future and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our product candidate. Moreover, increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the U.S. and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad, or the impact such changes could have on our business. 

&#160; 

Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and in some circumstances the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 

&#160; 

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, 

&#160; 

&#160; 

FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will change or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 

&#160; 

Foreign Regulatory Approval 

&#160; 

In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 

&#160; 

Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application, or CTA, must be submitted to each country&#146;s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country&#146;s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. 

&#160; 

The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

&#160; 

To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the U.S. is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 

&#160; 

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Centralized procedure . The EMA implemented the centralized procedure for the approval of human medicines to facilitate marketing authorizations that are valid throughout the European Union. This procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and officially designated orphan medicines. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; National authorization procedures. There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for investigational drug products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure: 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 

&#160; 

&#183; &#160; Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
