Spin-off 

&#160; 

On May 5, 2014, the board of directors of Oil States International, Inc. (Oil States) approved the separation of its Accommodations Segment (Accommodations) into a standalone, publicly traded Delaware corporation, which we refer to herein as Civeo US. In accordance with the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the two companies were separated by Oil States distributing to its stockholders all 106,538,044 shares of common stock of Civeo US it held after the market closed on May 30, 2014 (the Spin-Off). Each Oil States stockholder received two shares of Civeo US common stock for every one share of Oil States stock held at the close of business on the record date of May 21, 2014. In conjunction with the Spin-Off, Oil States received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the effect that, based on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings set forth in the ruling, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Oil States&#8217; distribution of Civeo US common stock was not taxable to Oil States or U.S. holders of Oil States common stock. Following the Spin-Off, Oil States retained no ownership interest in Civeo US, and each company now has separate public ownership, boards of directors and management. On June 2, 2014, Civeo US stock began trading the &#8220;regular-way&#8221; on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the &#8220;CVEO&#8221; stock symbol. Pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement with Oil States, on May 28, 2014, we made a special cash distribution to Oil States of $750 million.

Redomiciling to Canada 

&#160; 

On July 17, 2015, we completed our change in place of incorporation from Delaware to British Columbia, Canada (the Redomicile Transaction). In the Redomicile Transaction, Civeo Corporation, a British Columbia, Canada limited company formerly named Civeo Canadian Holdings ULC (Civeo Canada), became the publicly traded parent company of the Civeo group of companies, and Civeo US, our former publicly traded Delaware parent, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Civeo Canada. Each issued share of Civeo US common stock, other than those shares of Civeo US common stock held by Civeo US in treasury, was effectively transferred to Civeo Canada and converted into one common share, no par value, of Civeo Canada. An aggregate of approximately 107.5 million Civeo Canada common shares were issued in the Redomicile Transaction. The Civeo Canada common shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol &#8220;CVEO&#8221;, the same symbol under which the Civeo US common stock traded prior to the effective time. 

&#160; 

The Redomicile Transaction qualified as a &#8220;self-directed redomiciling&#8221; of the Company as permitted under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. U.S. federal income tax laws permit a company to change its domicile to a foreign jurisdiction without corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes provided that such company has &#8220;substantial business activity&#8221; in the relevant jurisdiction. &#8220;Substantial business activity&#8221; is defined as foreign operations consisting of over 25% of the company&#8217;s total (i) revenues, (ii) assets, (iii) employees and (iv) employee compensation. With approximately 50% or more of our operations in Canada based on these metrics, we qualified for a self-directed redomiciling.

Our Company 

&#160; 

We are one of the largest integrated providers of longer-term and temporary remote site accommodations, logistics and facility management services to the natural resource industry. We operate in some of the world&#8217;s most active oil, coal, natural gas and iron ore producing regions, including Canada, Australia and the U.S. We have established a leadership position in providing a fully integrated service offering to our customers, which include major and independent oil and natural gas companies, mining companies and oilfield and mining service companies. Our Develop, Own and Operate model allows our customers to focus their efforts and resources on their core development and production operations. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Using our Develop, Own, Operate business model, we provide accommodations solutions which span the lifecycle of customer projects from the initial exploration and resource delineation to long-term production. Initially, as customers assess the resource potential and determine how they will develop it, they typically need accommodations for a limited number of employees for an uncertain duration of time. Our fleet of temporary accommodation assets is well-suited to support this initial exploratory stage as customers evaluate their development and construction plans. As development of the resource begins, we are able to serve their needs through either our open camp model or through our scalable lodge or village model. As projects grow and headcount needs increase, we are able to scale our facility size to meet our customers&#8217; growing needs. By providing infrastructure early in the project lifecycle, we are well positioned to continue to service our customers throughout the production phase, which typically lasts decades. 

&#160;

The initial component of our Develop, Own, Operate business model is site selection and permitting. We believe that there are benefits created by investing early in land in order to gain the strategic, early mover advantage in an emerging region or resource play. Our business development team actively assesses regions of potential future customer demand and pursues land acquisition and permitting, a process we describe as &#8220;land banking.&#8221; We believe that having the first available accommodations solution in a new market allows us to win contracts from customers and gives us an early mover advantage as competitors may be less willing to invest in undeveloped land in the expectation of future demand without firm customer commitments. The strength of our land banked locations allowed us to secure contract growth in our most recent Canadian lodge location, McClelland Lake in the Canadian oil sands region and our Sitka Lodge in the British Columbia liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. &#160; &#160; &#160; Our scalable modular facilities provide workforce accommodations where, in many cases, traditional accommodations and related infrastructure is not accessible, sufficient or cost effective. Our services allow for efficient development and production of natural resources found in areas without sufficient housing, infrastructure or local labor. We believe that many of the more recently discovered mineral deposits and hydrocarbon reservoirs are in remote locations. We support the development of these natural resources by providing lodging, catering and food services, housekeeping, recreation facilities, laundry and facilities management, as well as water and wastewater treatment, power generation, communications and personnel logistics where required. Our accommodations services allow our customers to outsource their accommodations needs to a single supplier, maintaining employee welfare and satisfaction while focusing their investment on their core resource production efforts. Our primary focus is on providing accommodations to leading natural resource companies at our major properties, which we refer to as lodges in Canada and villages in Australia. We have nineteen lodges and villages in operation, with an aggregate of more than 23,000 rooms. Additionally, in the U.S. and Canada we have nine smaller open camp properties as well as a fleet of mobile accommodation assets. We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, many of whom are, or are affiliates of, large, investment grade energy and mining companies. 

&#160; 

Demand for our accommodations and related services is influenced by three primary factors: commodity prices, workforce requirements and competition. Our customers&#8217; expectations for future commodity prices influence their spending on current productive assets, maintenance on current assets, expansion of existing assets and development of greenfield or new assets. In addition to commodity prices, different types of customer activity require varying workforce sizes, influencing the demand for accommodations. Lastly, competing locations and services will influence demand for our assets and services. 

&#160; 

In the Canadian oil sands region, demand for our accommodations is influenced by oil prices. Spending on construction and the development of new projects has historically decreased as the outlook for oil prices decreases. However, spending on current operations and maintenance has historically reacted less quickly to changes in oil prices as customers consider their cash operating costs, rather than overall full cycle returns. Likewise, construction and expansion projects underway have also been less sensitive to commodity price decreases as customers focus on completion and incremental costs. Natural gas prices influence oil sands activity as an input cost; so as natural gas prices fall, our customers&#8217; operating costs fall as well. 

&#160; 

Another factor that influences demand for our rooms and services is the type of customer project we are supporting. Generally speaking, Canadian customers require larger workforces during construction and expansionary periods, and therefore have higher demand for accommodations. Operational and maintenance headcounts are typically a fraction, 20-25%, of the headcounts experienced during construction. 

&#160; 

Lastly, proximity to customer activity and availability of customer-owned rooms influences occupancy. Typically, customers prefer to first utilize their own rooms on location, and if such customer-owned rooms are insufficient, customers prefer to avoid busing their workforces to housing more than 45 kilometers away. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

A number of multinational energy companies believe there is a potential to export LNG from Canada to meet the increasing global demand, particularly in Asia, for LNG. Currently, Canada does not have any operational LNG export facilities. However, as of December 2015, seventeen proposed LNG export facilities in Canada have entered the regulatory review process &#8211; sixteen in British Columbia and one in Nova Scotia. We expect LNG customer spending habits to largely follow those seen in the Canadian oil sands region. LNG activity in Western Canada will be influenced by the global prices for LNG, which are largely tied to global oil prices, as well as wellhead prices for natural gas. Should our customers decide to invest in these LNG projects, demand for accommodations over the next three years will be driven by (i) the construction of the LNG facilities on the coast of British Columbia and (ii) the construction of the related pipeline infrastructure across British Columbia. Facility construction will create demand for permanent lodge accommodations, while pipeline construction activity will drive demand for mobile fleet accommodations. 

&#160; &#160;

Our Australian villages support similar activities for the natural resources industry. Our customers are typically developing and producing metallurgical (met) coal and other mines which have resource lives that are measured in decades. As such, their spending levels tend to react similarly to commodity prices as those of our Canadian customers. Spending on producing assets is less sensitive to commodity price decreases in the short and medium term, assuming the projects remain cash flow positive. However, new construction projects and expansionary projects are typically cancelled or deferred during periods of lower prices. During 2011 through 2013, roughly half of our occupancy was driven by construction or expansion activity, while the other half supported operation activities of resource production. Currently, our occupancy is primarily driven by production and operating activities. With the reduction in met coal prices over the past three years, much of the demand for rooms from construction activity has ceased, and our current and expected occupancy is primarily driven by production and operational activity. Workforce requirements and competition in the Australian market are comparable to those in the Canadian market. New project construction activity typically requires larger workforces than day-to-day operations, where proximity and availability of customer&#8211;owned rooms influences the demand for workforce accommodations. 

&#160; 

Our U.S. operations are primarily tied to activity in the U.S. shale formations in the Bakken, the Rockies and West Texas. Given the shorter investment horizon and decision cycle of our U.S. customers, on a well-by-well basis, U.S. customers&#8217; spending habits react more quickly to changes in oil and natural gas prices. These spending dynamics were clearly demonstrated over the past three years. With oil prices near $100 per barrel from 2012 to late 2014, drilling and completion activity levels grew; however, as oil prices fell beginning in August 2014 and throughout 2015 and 2016, activity in the U.S. reacted swiftly, with the U.S. rig count falling over 50% in six months from its peak in the third quarter of 2014. Unlike the Canadian and Australian markets, headcount requirements for drilling and completion activity are fairly uniform in the U.S. market. Given the U.S. market for accommodations is primarily supported by mobile assets, competition is primarily driven by the availability of assets and price. 

&#160; &#160;

&#160; 

For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we generated $518.0 million, $942.9 million and $1.0 billion in revenues and $(145.0) million, $(142.9) million and $259.5 million in operating income (loss), respectively. The majority of our operations, assets and income are derived from lodge and village facilities which have historically been contracted by our customers on a take-or-pay basis for periods ranging from several months to several years. These facilities generate more than 75% of our revenue. Important performance metrics include average available rooms, average rentable rooms, revenue related to our major properties, occupancy and average daily rate (in local currency). &#8220;Other Revenue,&#8221; shown below, consists of our revenue related to our open camp facilities and mobile fleet as well as third party sales related to our manufacturing division. The chart below summarizes these key statistics for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

&#160; &#160; 

Our History 

&#160; 

Our Canadian operations, founded in 1977, began by providing modular rental housing to energy customers, primarily supporting drilling rig crews. Over the next decade, the business acquired a catering operation and a manufacturing facility, enabling it to provide a more integrated service offering. Through our experience with Syncrude&#8217;s Mildred Lake Village, a 2,100 bed facility that we built and sold to Syncrude in 1990 and operated and managed for them for nearly twenty years, we recognized a need for a premium, and more permanent, solution for workforce accommodations in the Canadian oil sands region. Pursuing this strategy, we opened PTI Lodge in 1998, one of the first independent lodging facilities in the region. 

&#160; 

With an integrated business model, we are able to identify, solve and implement solutions and services that enhance the guests&#8217; accommodations experience and reduce the customer&#8217;s total cost of housing a workforce in a remote operating location. Through our experiences and integrated model, our accommodation services have evolved to include fitness centers, water and wastewater treatment, laundry service and many other advancements. As our experience in the region grew, we were the first to introduce to the Canadian oil sands market suite-style accommodations for middle and upper level management working in the oil sands region with our Beaver River Executive Lodge in 2005. Since then, we have continued to innovate our service offering to meet our customers&#8217; growing and evolving needs. From that entrepreneurial beginning, we have developed into Canada&#8217;s largest third-party provider of accommodations in the oil sands region. 

&#160; 

Today, in addition to providing accommodations services, we endeavor to support customers&#8217; logistical efforts in managing the movement of large numbers of personnel efficiently. At our Wapasu Creek location, we have introduced services that improve the customer&#8217;s efficiency in transporting personnel to the mine site on a daily basis as well as efficiency in rotating personnel when crews change. These logistical services have generated cost efficiencies for our customer. 

&#160; 

During 2015, we entered the Canadian LNG market with our latest lodge location, Sitka Lodge. Most of the Sitka Lodge&#8217;s 436 rooms are under contract to LNG Canada, a large LNG export project proposed by a joint venture between Shell Canada Energy, an affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell plc &#8211; (50 percent), and affiliates of PetroChina (20 percent), Korea Gas Corporation (15 percent) and Mitsubishi Corporation (15 percent). 

&#160; 

With the acquisition of our Australian business in December 2010, we began to support the Australian natural resources industry through ten villages located in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. Like Canada, our Australian business has a long-history of accommodating customers in remote regions beginning with its initial Moranbah Village in 1996, and has grown to become Australia&#8217;s largest integrated provider of accommodations services for people working in remote locations. Our Australian business was the first to introduce resort style accommodations to the mining sector, adding landscaping, outdoor kitchens, pools, fitness centers and, in some cases, taverns. In all our operating regions, our business is built on a culture of continual service improvement to enhance the guest experience and reduce customer remote housing costs. 

&#160; 

We take an active role in minimizing our environmental impact of our operations through a number of sustainable initiatives. Our off-site building manufacturing process in Canada allows us to minimize waste that arises from the construction process. We also have a focus on water conservation and utilize alternative water supply options such as recycling and rainwater collection and use. By building infrastructure such as waste-water treatment and water treatment facilities to recycle grey and black water on some of our sites, we are able to gain cost efficiencies as well as reduce the use of trucks related to water and wastewater hauling, which in turn, reduces our carbon footprint. In our Australian villages, we utilize passive solar design principles and smart switching systems to reduce the need for electricity related to heating and cooling. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our Industry 

&#160; 

We provide services for the oil and gas and mining industries. Our scalable modular facilities provide long-term and temporary work force accommodations where traditional accommodations and related infrastructure is often not accessible, sufficient or cost effective. Once facilities are deployed in the field, we also provide catering and food services, housekeeping, laundry, facility management, water and wastewater treatment, power generation, communications and personnel logistics. Demand for our services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels, particularly our customers&#8217; willingness to spend capital on the exploration for, development and production of oil, coal, natural gas and other resource reserves. Our customers&#8217; spending plans are generally based on their view of commodity supply and demand dynamics as well as the outlook for near-term and long-term commodity prices. As a result, the demand for our services is highly sensitive to current and expected commodity prices. 

&#160; 

We serve multiple projects and multiple customers at most of our sites, which allows those customers to share the costs associated with their peak construction accommodations needs. Our facilities provide customers with cost efficiencies as they are able to share the costs of accommodations related infrastructure (power, water, sewer and IT) and central dining and recreation facilities with other customers operating projects in the same vicinity. 

&#160; 

Our business is significantly influenced by the level of production of oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, activity levels in support of natural resources production in Australia and oil and gas production in Canada and the U.S. Our two primary activity drivers are development and production activity in the Canadian oil sands region in Western Canada and the met coal region of Australia&#8217;s Bowen Basin. During 2015, we entered into a new market with our Sitka Lodge, which currently serves LNG Canada&#8217;s potential project on the west coast of British Columbia. Should our customer&#8217;s project ultimately move forward, British Columbia LNG activity could become a material driver of future activity for our Sitka Lodge, as well as for our mobile fleet assets which are well suited for the related pipeline construction activity. However, should the project, and other potential projects in the area, not move forward, the resulting impact may negatively affect our future results of operations, value of long-lived assets and cash flows. 

&#160; 

Historically, oil sands developers and Australian mining companies built, owned and in some cases operated the accommodations necessary to house their personnel in these remote regions because local labor and third-party owned rooms were not available. Over the past 20 years and increasingly over the past 10 years, some customers have moved away from the insourcing business model for some of their accommodations as they recognize that accommodations are non-core investments for their business. 

&#160; 

Civeo is one of the few accommodations providers that service the entire value chain from site identification to long-term facility management. We believe that our existing industry divides accommodations into three primary types: lodges and villages, open camps and mobile assets. Civeo is principally focused on lodges and villages. Lodges and villages typically contain a larger number of rooms and require more time and capital to develop. These facilities typically have dining areas, meeting rooms, recreational facilities, pubs and landscaped grounds where weather permits. Lodges and villages are generally built supported by multi-year, take-or-pay contracts. These facilities are designed to serve the long-term needs of customers in constructing and operating their resource developments. Open camps are usually smaller in number of rooms and typically serve customers on a spot or short-term basis. They are &#8220;open&#8221; for any customer who needs lodging services. Finally, mobile camps are designed to follow customers and can be deployed rapidly to scale. They are often used to support conventional and in-situ drilling crews as well as pipeline and seismic crews and are contracted on a project-by-project, well-by-well or short term basis. Oftentimes, customers will initially require mobile accommodations as they evaluate or initially develop a field or mine. Open camps may best serve smaller operations or the needs of customers as they expand in a region. These open camps can also serve as an initial, small foothold in a region until the demand for a full-scale lodge or village is required. 

&#160;

The accommodations market is segmented into competitors that serve components of the overall value chain, but has very few integrated providers. We estimate that customer-owned rooms represent over 50% of the market. Engineering firms such as Bechtel, Fluor and ColtAmec often design accommodations facilities. Many public and private firms, such as ATCO Structures &#38; Logistics Ltd. (ATCO), WesternOne Inc.&#8217;s modular building division (Britco), Horizon North Logistics Inc. (Horizon North), Alta-Fab Structures Ltd. (Alta-Fab) and Northgate Industries Ltd. (Northgate) will build the modular accommodations for sale. Horizon North, Black Diamond Group Limited (Black Diamond), ATCO, Royal Camp Services Ltd. and Algeco Scotsman will primarily own and lease the units to customers and in some cases provide facility management services, usually on a shorter-term basis with a more limited number of rooms, similar to our open camp and mobile fleet business. Facility service companies, such as Aramark Corporation (Aramark), Sodexo Inc. (Sodexo) or Compass Group PLC (Compass Group), typically do not invest in and own the accommodations assets, but will manage third-party or customer-owned facilities. We believe the integrated model provides value to our customers by reducing project timing and counterparty risks. In addition, with our holistic approach to accommodations, we are able to identify efficiency opportunities for the customers and execute them. With our focus on large-scale lodges and villages, our business model is most similar to a developer of multi-family properties, such as Camden or Post, or a developer of lodging properties who is also an owner operator, such as Hyatt Hotels Corporation or Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc.

Overview 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated approximately 66% of our revenue from our Canadian operations. We are Canada&#8217;s largest integrated provider of accommodations services for people working in remote locations. We provide our accommodation services through lodges, open camps and mobile assets. Our accommodations support workforces in the Canadian oil sands and in a variety of oil and natural gas drilling, mining and related natural resource applications as well as disaster relief efforts. 

&#160; &#160; 

Canadian Market 

&#160;

Demand for our oil sands accommodations is primarily influenced by the longer-term outlook for crude oil prices rather than current energy prices, given the multi-year production phase of oil sands projects and the costs associated with development of such large scale projects. Utilization of our existing Canadian capacity and our future expansions will largely depend on continued oil sands spending related to existing production efforts, maintenance thereon and potential future expansion of existing projects. 

&#160; 

The Athabasca oil sands are located in northern Alberta, an area that is very remote with a limited local labor supply. Of Canada&#8217;s 33.5 million residents, nearly half of the population lives in ten cities, only 10% of the population lives in Alberta and less than 1% live within 100 kilometers of the oil sands. The local municipalities, of which Fort McMurray is the largest, have grown rapidly over the last decade stressing their infrastructure and are challenged to respond to large-scale changes in demand. As such, the workforce accommodations market provides a cost effective solution to the problem of staffing large oil sands projects by sourcing labor throughout Canada to work on a rotational basis. 

&#160;

A number of multinational energy companies believe there is the potential to export LNG from Canada to meet the increasing global demand, particularly in Asia, for LNG. Currently, Canada does not have any operational LNG export facilities. However, as of December 2015, seventeen proposed LNG export facilities in Canada have entered the regulatory review process &#8211; sixteen in British Columbia and one in Nova Scotia. We expect customer spending habits to largely follow those seen in the oil sands region. LNG activity in Western Canada will be influenced by the global prices for LNG, which are largely tied to global oil prices, as well as wellhead prices for natural gas. Should our customers decide to invest in these LNG projects, demand for accommodations over the next three years will be driven by (i) the construction of the LNG facilities on the coast of British Columbia and (ii) the construction of the related pipeline infrastructure across British Columbia. Facility construction will create demand for permanent lodge accommodations while pipeline construction activity will drive demand for temporary mobile workforce accommodations. However, should the project, and other potential projects in the area, not move forward, the resulting impact may negatively affect our future results of operations, value of long-lived assets and cash flows.

&#160; 

Canadian Oil Sands Lodges 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, activity in the Athabasca oil sands region generated over three-fourths of our Canadian revenue. The oil sands region of northern Alberta, Canada continues to represent one of the world&#8217;s largest reserves for heavy oil. Our McClelland Lake, Wapasu, Athabasca, Henday and Beaver River Lodges are focused on the northern region of the Athabasca oil sands, where customers primarily utilize surface mining to extract the bitumen, or oil sands. Oil sands mining operations are characterized by large capital requirements, large reserves, large personnel requirements, very low exploration or reserve risk and relatively lower cash operating costs per barrel of bitumen produced. Our Conklin and Anzac lodges as well as a portion of our mobile fleet of assets are focused in the southern portion of the region where we primarily serve in situ operations and pipeline expansion activity. In situ methods are used on reserves that are too deep for traditional mining methods. In situ technology typically injects steam to the deep oil sands in place to separate the bitumen from the sand and pumps it to the surface where it undergoes the same upgrading treatment as the mined bitumen. Reserves requiring in situ techniques of extraction represent 80% of the established recoverable reserves in Alberta. In situ operations generally require less capital and personnel and produce lower volumes of bitumen per development, with higher ongoing operating expense per barrel of bitumen produced. 

&#160; 

Most recently, we opened our McClelland Lake Lodge in the summer of 2014 at an initial capacity of 1,561 rooms and reached our full initial capacity of 1,997 rooms in the first quarter of 2015. McClelland Lake Lodge currently supports a new oil sands mining project in the region under a three-year contract for the majority of the rentable rooms. During the third quarter of 2015, we also redeveloped our Mariana Lake location and reclassified the location as an oil sands lodge. The Mariana Lake Lodge has 526 rooms and is focused on the southern portion of the region. 

&#160; 

Our oil sands lodges support construction and operating personnel for maintenance and expansionary projects as well as ongoing operations associated with surface mining and in situ oil sands projects generally under short and medium-term contracts. All of our oil sands lodge properties are located on land with leases obtained from the province of Alberta with initial terms of ten years. Our leases have expiration dates that range from 2016 to 2026. Currently, only 9% of our Canadian lodge rooms are on land with leases expiring prior to December 31, 2017. Thus far, we have successfully renewed or extended all expiring land leases, with the exception of the Lakeside lease, and expect we will be able to in the future. We provide a full service hospitality function at our lodges including reservation management, check in and check out, catering, housekeeping and facilities management. Our lodge guests receive the amenity level of a full-service hotel plus three meals a day. Since mid-year 2006, we have installed over 13,700 rooms in our oil sands lodge properties supporting oil sands activities in northern Alberta. Our growth plan for this part of our business includes the expansion of these properties where we believe there is durable long-term demand. During 2015, we added 635 rooms (net of retirements) to our major oil sands lodges. Our Wapasu Creek Lodge is equivalent in size to the largest hotels in North America. 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, over 75% of our Canadian revenue was generated by our eight major lodges. We provide our lodge services on a day rate or monthly rental basis and our customers typically commit for short to medium term contracts (from several months up to 10 years). Customers make a minimum nightly or monthly room commitment for the term of the contract, and the multi-year contracts typically provide for inflationary escalations in rates for increased food, labor and utilities costs. 

&#160; 

Canadian LNG Lodge 

&#160; 

During the fourth quarter of 2015, in Kitimat, British Columbia, we built 436 rooms during the initial development of our Sitka Lodge. Most of these rooms are under contract to LNG Canada, a large LNG export project proposed by a joint venture between Shell Canada Energy, an affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell plc (50 percent), and affiliates of PetroChina (20 percent), Korea Gas Corporation (15 percent) and Mitsubishi Corporation (15 percent). The initial phase of this location features catering services and recreational facilities and the ability to expand should demand for rooms in the region warrant.

&#160;

&#160; 

Open Camps 

&#160; 

In addition to our lodges, we have five open camps in Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The major differentiator between lodges and open camps is the size of the facility. Open camps are generally smaller facilities that provide a level of amenity similar to that of one of our larger lodges including quality accommodation and food services, satellite television, fitness facilities and on-site laundry. We own the land where all of our open camp assets are located except for Geetla Lodge, which is on leased land. In early 2015, we renewed our Mariana Lake Lodge lease for a term through 2025, and this location was reclassified as an oil sands lodge in the third quarter of 2015. In March 2015, we vacated the Redvers Lodge lease due to the negative outlook for future occupancy. Open camps are typically utilized for exploratory, seasonal or short-term projects. Therefore, customer commitments for open camps tend to be shorter in initial duration (six to eighteen months). Open camps may be operational for twelve months or several years or transition into lodges depending on customer demand. Over time, room counts may fluctuate up or down depending on demand in the region. If the demand in a region decreases, open camps can be relocated to areas of greater activity. We provide accommodation services at our open camps on a day rate basis. Open camp revenue comprises a portion of &#8220;Other Revenue&#8221; in our Canadian segment. 

&#160; 

Our Alberta open camps service the Athabasca and Peace River oil sands as well as conventional and shale play oil and gas developments and infrastructure expansions. Geetla Lodge services the Horn River Basin in British Columbia.

Mobile Fleet 

&#160; 

Our mobile fleet consists of modular, skid-mounted accommodations and central facilities that can be configured to quickly serve a multitude of short to medium term accommodation needs. The dormitory, kitchen and ancillary assets can be rapidly mobilized and demobilized and are scalable to support 200 to 800 people in a single location. In addition to asset rental, we provide catering, cleaning and housekeeping as well as camp management services, including fresh water and sewage hauling services. Our mobile fleet services the traditional oil and gas sector in Alberta and British Columbia and in situ oil sands drilling and development operations in Alberta as well as pipeline construction crews throughout Western Canada. The assets have also been used in the past in disaster relief efforts, the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games and a variety of other non-energy related projects. 

&#160; 

Our mobile fleet assets are rented on a per unit basis based on the number of days that a customer utilizes the asset. In cases where we provide catering or ancillary services, the contract can provide for per unit pricing or cost-plus pricing. Customers are also typically responsible for mobilization and demobilization costs. Our focus on ancillary service contracts has allowed us to successfully pursue catering only opportunities. Due to the business nature of servicing client-owned facilities, this business easily fits into our overall business. Aside from the traditional workforce accommodations, we are expanding our target markets to areas such as institutional, educational and entertainment facilities. Mobile fleet revenue comprises a portion of &#8220;Other Revenue&#8221; in our Canadian segment.

Australia 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated 26% of our revenue from our Australian operations. As of December 31, 2015, we had 9,296 rooms across ten villages, of which 7,392 rooms service the Bowen Basin region of Queensland, one of the premier metallurgical (met) coal basins in the world. We provide accommodation services on a day rate basis to mining and related service companies (including construction contractors) typically under medium-term contracts (three to five years) with minimum nightly room commitments. During 2015, no further rooms were added (net of retirements) to our Australian villages. 

&#160; 

Australian Market 

&#160; 

As the largest contributor to exports and a major contributor to the country&#8217;s gross domestic product, employment and government revenue, the Australian natural resources sector plays a vital role in the Australian economy. Australia has broad natural resources, including met and thermal coal, conventional and coal seam gas, base metals, iron ore and precious metals such as gold. The growth of Australian natural resource commodity exports over the last decade has been largely driven by strong Asian demand for coal, iron ore and LNG. Australia&#8217;s resources are primarily located in remote regions of the country that lack infrastructure and resident labor forces to develop these resources. Approximately 60% of the Australian population is located in five cities, which are all located on the coast of Australia, and over 90% of the population lives in the southern half of the country. Sufficient local labor is lacking near the major natural resources developments, which are primarily inland and in the central and northern parts of the country. As a result, much of the natural resources labor force works on a rotational basis, which often requires a commute from a major city or the coast and a living arrangement near the resource projects. Consequently, there is substantial need for workforce accommodations to support resource production in the country. Workforce accommodations have historically been built by the resource developer/owner, typical of an insourcing business model. 

&#160; 

Since 1996, our Australian business has sought to change the insourcing business model through its integrated service offering, allowing customers to outsource their accommodations needs and focus their investment on resource production operations. Our Australian accommodations villages are strategically located in proximity to long-lived, low-cost mines operated by large mining companies. The current activities of our Australian segment are primarily related to supplying accommodations in support of met coal mining in the Bowen Basin region of Queensland. 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, our five villages in the Bowen Basin of central Queensland generated 81% of our Australian revenue. The Bowen Basin contains one of the largest coal deposits in Australia and is renowned for its premium met coal. Met coal is used in the steel making process and demand has largely been driven by global demand for steel finished goods and steel construction materials. More recently, growth in construction demand for steel products in emerging economies, particularly China, has slowed significantly, negatively impacting demand for the commodity. Australia is the largest exporter of met coal in the world, in addition to being in close proximity to the largest steel producing country in the world. Our villages are focused on the mines in the central portion of the basin and are well positioned for the active mines in the region. 

&#160; 

Beyond the Bowen Basin, we serve several emerging markets with our four additional villages. At the end of 2015, we had two villages with over 1,000 combined rooms in the Gunnedah Basin, an emerging thermal and met coal as well as coal seam gas region of New South Wales. In Western Australia, we serve workforces related to iron ore port expansions and LNG facilities operations on the Northwest Shelf through our Karratha villages.

Our Australian segment operated ten villages with 9,296 rooms as of December 31, 2015 and has a significant development portfolio in Australia. Our Australian business provides accommodation services to mining and related service companies under short- and medium-term contracts. Our Australian accommodations villages are strategically located near long-lived, low-cost mines operated by large mining companies. Our growth plan for this part of our business continues to include the expansion of these properties where we believe there is durable long-term demand. 

&#160; 

Our Coppabella, Dysart, Moranbah, Middlemount and Nebo villages are located in the Bowen Basin. Coppabella, at over 3,000 rooms, is our largest village and provides accommodation to a variety of customers. The village supports both operational workforce needs and contractor needs with resort style amenities, including swimming pools, gyms, a walking track and a tavern. Our Nebo, Dysart, Moranbah and Middlemount Villages have a long history of providing service in the region. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In 2011, we opened Narrabri Village, the first village of its kind in New South Wales, to service met and thermal coal mines and coal seam gas in the Gunnedah Basin. Our newest village, Boggabri, opened in the third quarter of 2013. Boggabri Village, whose first stage, consisting of 508 rooms, opened in 2013, services the operating workforce of two customers with approved mines in the Gunnedah Basin. Karratha, in Western Australia, services workforces related to iron ore port expansions and LNG facilities operations on the Northwest Shelf. 

&#160; 

U.S. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, our U.S. business generated 7% of our revenue. Our U.S. business has operational exposure to the Rocky Mountain corridor, the Bakken Shale region, the Permian Basin region of Texas and offshore locations in the Gulf of Mexico. The business provides open camp facilities and highly mobile smaller camps that follow drilling rigs and completion crews as well as accommodations, office and storage modules that are placed on offshore drilling rigs and production platforms. 

&#160; 

U.S. Market 

&#160; 

Onshore oil and natural gas development has historically been supported by local workforces traveling short to moderate distances to the worksites. With the development of substantial resources in regions such as the Bakken, Rockies and Permian Basin, labor demand has exceeded the local labor supply and accommodations infrastructure to support the demand. Consequently, demand for remote, scalable accommodations has developed in the U.S. over the past five years. Demand for accommodations in the U.S. has historically been tied to the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity, which is primary driven by oil and natural gas prices. Activity levels have been, and we expect will continue to be, highly correlated with hydrocarbon commodity prices.

Mobile Fleet 

&#160;

Our business in the U.S. consists primarily of mobile fleet assets, both in the lower 48 states, including the Rocky Mountain corridor, the Bakken Shale region, the Permian Basin region of Texas and in the Gulf of Mexico. We provide a variety of sizes and configurations to meet the needs of drilling contractors, completion companies, infrastructure construction projects and offshore drilling and completion activity. We provide quality catering and housekeeping services as well. 

&#160;

Our mobile fleet is rented on a per unit basis based on the number of days that a customer utilizes the asset. In cases where we provide catering or ancillary services, the contract can provide for per unit pricing or cost-plus pricing. Customers are also typically responsible for mobilization and demobilization costs.

&#160; 

We had four open camps in the U.S. comprised of 976 rooms as of December 31, 2015. We sold one of our camps in January 2016. Our Stanley House and Killdeer Lodge, which we opened in October 2013, provide accommodations support to the Bakken Shale region in North Dakota. Our West Permian Lodge supports the Permian Basin in West Texas. 

&#160; 

Modular Construction and Manufacturing 

&#160; 

As part of our integrated business model in North America, we utilize a flexible modular construction and manufacturing strategy that combines internal manufacturing capabilities and outsourced manufacturing partners to allow us to respond quickly to changing customer needs and timing. As of December 31, 2015, we own one modular construction and manufacturing plant near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Our U.S. modular construction facility in Johnstown, Colorado was closed during the first quarter of 2015 and sold in the fourth quarter of 2015. In Australia, accommodation rooms are sourced from third-party manufacturers. Our Canadian facility specializes in the design, engineering, production, transportation and installation of a variety of modular buildings, predominately for our own use. In Canada, we have a staff of engineers and architects who have designed and delivered large and small projects. We are capable of taking highly replicable and well-designed manufactured buildings and our expertise in site layout combined with site-built components including landscaping, recreational facilities and certain common facilities to create a comfortable community within a community. We design accommodations facilities to suit the climate, terrain and population of a specific project site. 

&#160; 

While we have traditionally focused our manufacturing efforts on our internal needs, from time to time we sell units to third parties. Revenues from the sale of accommodation units to third parties has been a small portion of our revenue and is included in &#8220;Other Revenue&#8221; in our Canadian and U.S. segments. We have not historically sold units to third parties in Australia. 

&#160; 

Community Relations 

&#160; 

Partnering with local and aboriginal communities is part of our long term strategy. In our Canadian operations, we have worked proactively with local aboriginal communities to develop mutually beneficial and long-term partnerships focused on employment, training, business development and community investments. For over a decade, our Canadian operations have supported two joint ventures, Buffalo Metis Catering and Metis Catering JV, with five Metis communities in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, to provide catering and housekeeping services at our lodges. Our efforts in this area were recognized in 2011 and 2012 through Alberta Chamber of Commerce industry awards of recognition for excellence in aboriginal relations business practices. During 2015, Civeo entered into partnerships with two First Nations in the northern Athabasca oil sands region and one in the southern Athabasca oil sands region. 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; &#160; 

In Australia, our community relations program also aims to build and maintain a social license to operate in regional communities by delivering consultation and engagement from project inception, through development, construction and operations. This is a major advantage for our business model as it ensures consistent communication, engenders trust and builds relationships to last throughout the resource lifecycle. There is an emphasis on developing partnerships that create a long-term sustainable outcome to address specific community needs. To that end, we partner with local municipalities to improve and expand municipal infrastructure. These improvements provide necessary infrastructure, allowing the local communities an opportunity to expand and improve. 

&#160; 

Customers and Competitors 

&#160; 

Our customers primarily operate in oil sands mining and development, drilling, exploration and extraction of oil and natural gas and coal and other extractive industries. To a lesser extent, we also support other activities, including pipeline construction, forestry, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, and support for military operations. Our largest customers in 2015 were Imperial Oil Limited (a company controlled by ExxonMobil Corporation), Fort Hills Energy LP (a partnership between Suncor Energy Inc., Total E&#38;P Canada Ltd and Teck Resources Limited) and BM Alliance Coal Operations Pty Ltd (an alliance between BHP Billiton and Mitsubishi), who each accounted for more than 10% of our 2015 revenues. 

&#160; 

Our primary competitors in Canada in the open and mobile camp accommodations include ATCO, Black Diamond, Horizon North, Noralta Lodge and Clean Harbors, Inc. Some of these competitors have one or two locations similar to our oil sands lodges; however, based on our estimates, these competitors do not have the breadth or scale of our lodge operations. In Canada, we also compete against Aramark and Compass Group for facility management services. 

&#160; 

Our primary competitors in Australia to our village accommodations are Ausco Modular (a subsidiary of Algeco Scotsman) and Fleetwood Corporation. We also compete against Aramark, Sodexo and Compass Group for facility management services. 

&#160; 

In the U.S., we primarily offer our open camp and mobile camps accommodations and compete against Stallion Oilfield Holdings, Inc., Target Logistics Management LLC (a subsidiary of Algeco Scotsman Global S.a.r.l.), HB Rentals (a subsidiary of Superior Energy Services) and Black Diamond. 

&#160; 

Historically, many customers have invested in their own accommodations. Management estimates that our existing and potential customers own approximately 50% of the rooms available in the Canadian oil sands and 60% of the rooms in the Australian coal mining regions. 

&#160; 

Our Lodge and Village Contracts 

&#160; 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, revenues from our lodges and villages represented over 75% of our consolidated revenues. Our customers typically contract for accommodations services under take-or-pay contracts with terms that most often range from several months to five years. Our contract terms generally provide for a rental rate for a reserved room and an occupied room rate that compensates us for services, including meals, utilities and maintenance for workers staying in the lodges and villages. In multi-year contracts, our rates typically have annual contractual escalation provisions to cover expected increases in labor and consumables costs over the contract term. Over the term of the contract, the customer commits to a minimum number of rooms over a determined period. In some contracts, customers have a contractual right to terminate rooms, for reasons other than a breach, in exchange for a termination fee. As of December 31, 2015, we had 36% of our rentable rooms committed for 2016 and 19% of our rentable rooms committed for 2017, respectively. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had 7,019 rooms under contract, or 38% of our rentable rooms, respectively. The table below details the expiration of those contracts: 

&#160;

The contracts expire throughout the year, and for many of the near term expirations, we are in the process of negotiating extensions or new commitments. We cannot assure that we can renew existing contracts or obtain new business on the same or better terms, if at all. 

&#160; 

Seasonality of Operations 

&#160; 

Our operations are directly affected by seasonal weather. A portion of our Canadian operations is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for customers&#8217; activity to occur. The spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the second quarter and adversely affects our operations and our ability to provide services. Our Canadian operations have also been impacted by forest fires and flooding in the past five years. During the Australian rainy season between November and April, our operations in Queensland and the northern parts of Western Australia can be affected by cyclones, monsoons and resultant flooding. In the U.S., winter weather in the first quarter and the resulting spring break up in the second quarter have historically negatively impacted our Bakken and Rocky Mountain operations. Our U.S. offshore operations have historically been impacted by the Gulf of Mexico hurricane season from July through November. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 1,900 full-time employees on a consolidated basis, 72% of whom are in Canada, 21% of whom are in Australia and 7% of whom are in the U.S. We were party to collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 900 employees located in Canada and 140 employees located in Australia as of December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160;

Our business is significantly affected by foreign and U.S. laws and regulations at the federal, provincial, state and local levels relating to the oil, natural gas and mining industries, worker safety and environmental protection. Changes in these laws, including more stringent regulations and increased levels of enforcement of these laws and regulations, and the development of new laws and regulations could significantly affect our business and result in: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions associated with our operations or our customers&#8217; operations; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

other increased costs to our business or our customers&#8217; business; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

reduced demand for oil, natural gas, and other natural resources that our customers produce; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#9679; 

reduced demand for our services. 

&#160; 

To the extent that these laws and regulations impose more stringent requirements or increased costs or delays upon our customers in the performance of their operations, the resulting demand for our services by those customers may be adversely affected, which impact could be significant and long-lasting. Moreover, climate change laws or regulations could increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas, which could reduce our customers&#8217; demand for our services. We cannot predict changes in the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how these laws and regulations may be interpreted or the effect changes in these laws and regulations may have on us or our customers or on our future operations or earnings. We also are not able to predict the extent to which new laws and regulations will be adopted or whether such new laws and regulations may impose more stringent or costly restrictions on our customers or our operations. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

Our operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous stringent and comprehensive foreign, federal, provincial, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the release or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, for which compliance is often costly yet critical. The violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, modification or cessation of operations, assessment of administrative and civil penalties, and even criminal prosecution. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and we do not anticipate that future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, there can be no assurance that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance with these existing requirements will not be incurred in the future by us or our customers. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies or more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, could result in additional costs or liabilities upon us or our customers that we cannot currently quantify. 

&#160; 

Canadian Environmental Regulations 

&#160; 

In Canada, the Federal Government in September 2010 appointed an Oil Sands Advisory Panel to review and comment upon existing scientific studies and literature regarding water monitoring in the Lower Athabasca region and provide recommendations for improving such monitoring. The Oil Sands Advisory Panel presented its final report to the Minister of the Environment in December 2010. In response to this report, Environment Canada, with input from the government of Alberta through Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development, developed an environmental monitoring plan specific to the oil sands with respect to water, air quality and biodiversity. Further, in January 2011, the Province of Alberta established a Provincial Environmental Monitoring Panel with a mandate to recommend a world class environmental evaluation, monitoring and reporting system, generally for the Province and specifically for the lower Athabasca Region where oil sands are produced. This panel issued its recommendations to the Alberta Minister of the Environment in July 2011. In February 2012, the governments of Canada and Alberta released the Joint Canada-Alberta Implementation Plan for Oil Sands Monitoring. Implementation of the plan commenced in 2012 and will be completed in 2015. The costs of implementing this plan are funded by industry members to a maximum of $50 million annually, some of whom are our customers. The Oil Sands Environmental Monitoring Program Regulation came into force in 2013, enabling the collection of monitoring fees from certain of our customers for the plan. In 2013-2014, enhancements to the environmental monitoring system were made and processes and governance structures and funding mechanisms to support oil sands monitoring were successfully established. As this monitoring regime continues to be implemented, the increased levels of monitoring and enforcement may increase costs for us and our customers and could reduce activity and demand for our services. 

&#160; 

Further, the Province of Alberta released its new Renewed Clean Air Strategy in October 2012, which it is in the process of implementing for, at minimum, a 10-year period, beginning in 2013. The implementation of this strategy along with Alberta&#8217;s continued implementation of its regulatory changes to oil and oil sands regulation may result in additional costs or liabilities for our customers&#8217; operations. 

&#160; 

In June 2014, the Canadian government announced proposed new regulations to impose mandatory emissions standards for industry. The proposed standards will impact nitrous oxide (NOx) and Sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from regulated boilers and stationary engines. These regulations have not yet been passed but if passed, could affect the oil and gas sector as they will impact emission performance standards for compressors and boilers used in conventional and steam assisted gravity operations in the oil sands. 

&#160; 

Scientific studies have suggested that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere and other climatic changes. On January 29, 2010, Canada affirmed its desire to be associated with the Copenhagen Accord that was negotiated in December 2009 as part of the international meetings on climate change regulation in Copenhagen. The Copenhagen Accord, which is not legally binding, allows countries to commit to specific efforts to reduce GHG emissions, although how and when the commitments may be converted into binding emission reduction obligations, if ever, is currently uncertain. Pursuant to the Copenhagen Accord process, Canada has indicated an economy-wide GHG emissions target that equates to a 17 per cent reduction from 2005 levels by 2020, and the former Canadian Conservative federal government indicated an objective of reducing overall Canadian GHG emissions by 60% to 70% from 2006 levels by 2050. However, with current climate change measures in place, Canada&#8217;s GHG emissions are forecast to be almost exactly at 2005 levels by 2020 and federal regulations for the oil and gas sector have yet to be introduced. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

In December 2015, 195 nations, including Canada, Australia, and the U.S., adopted the Paris Agreement at the 21st &#8220;Conference of the Parties&#8221; (COP 21). The Paris Agreement does not set legally binding emission reduction targets but does set a goal of limiting global temperature increases to less than 2&#176; Celsius. Canada announced that it is in favor of the decision of the COP 21 to endeavor to take action to further limit global temperature increases to less than 1.5&#176; Celsius. The Paris Agreement also requires parties to submit Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) which set out their emission reduction targets and to renew these INDCs, with the goal of increasing the reductions, every five years. The Paris Agreement does not legally bind the parties to reach their INDCs, nor does it prescribe the measures it must take to achieve them. These measures are left to each participating nation. However, participating nations must submit their INDCs every five years. Canada has not implemented any new regulations to achieve its INDC and is scheduled to meet with representatives of the provincial governments by mid-March 2016 to determine an agreed upon approach for Canada to obtain its INDC. It is expected that the new liberal federal government may commit to a more ambitious INDC than the preceding conservative federal government. Without new regulation from the federal government yet in place, it is not possible to determine the impact that implementation of new federal or provincial regulatory changes could have, but they may result in additional costs or liabilities for our customers&#8217; operations. 

&#160; 

Additionally, GHG regulation can take place at the provincial and municipal level. For example, Alberta&#8217;s Climate Change and Emissions Management Act provides a framework for managing GHG emissions by reducing specified gas emissions, relative to total production from facilities that emit over 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The accompanying regulation, the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation, requires mandatory emissions reductions through the use of emissions intensity targets, and a company can meet the applicable emissions limits by making emissions intensity improvements at regulated facilities, offsetting GHG emissions by purchasing offset credits or emission performance credits in the open market or acquiring &#8220;fund credits&#8221; (akin to allowances) by making payments for each ton of GHG emissions over the required reduction target to the Alberta Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund. In June, 2015, the government of Alberta amended the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation to increase the price per fund credit from $15 to $20 per credit in 2016 and to $30 per credit in 2017. In addition, the amended Specified Gas Emitter Regulation also increased the required emission reductions for regulated facilities from 12% below an established baseline in 2015 to 15% in 2016 and 20% in 2017. These amendments are likely to significantly increase the cost of compliance for our customers. There are financial penalties for non-compliance for every ton of carbon dioxide equivalent over a facility&#8217;s net emission intensity limit as well as for contraventions of other provisions contained in the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation. Further, the Specified Gas Reporting Regulation imposes GHG emissions reporting requirements on a company that has GHG emissions of 50,000 tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent from a facility in a calendar year. In addition, Alberta facilities must currently report emissions of industrial air pollutants and comply with obligations in approvals and under other environmental regulations. 

&#160; 

In addition to the amendments to the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation discussed above, the government of Alberta announced a new Climate Leadership Plan (the CLP) in November 2015 that is intended to replace the current Specified Gas Emitter Regulation in 2018. It has broader application than the Specified Gas Emitters Regulation and is intended to cover 78-90% of emissions, largely by putting a levy on emissions from the combustion of all fossil fuels, with limited exceptions. This is expected to be implemented at the fuel distributor level, so that it will add to the cost of most fossil based fuels. The CLP also targets the phasing out of coal generated electricity (or the emissions therefrom) by 2030. It also targets a 45% reduction in methane emissions from oil and gas operations by 2025. It is not certain how this will be achieved, but it is contemplated that new performance standards emissions from equipment will be incentivized and potentially mandated. Lastly, the CLP contemplates a cap on oil sands emissions at 100 million tonnes a year. The regulations to implement the CLP are anticipated in late 2016 and expected to be effective in 2017. The combination of the announced carbon levy and coal phase out is expected to increase fuel and electricity prices, which could have an impact on our operating costs. The direct and indirect costs of these regulatory changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results as well as those of our customers with whom we conduct business. 

&#160; 

In July 2008, the province of British Columbia implemented a revenue neutral carbon tax of $10 per tonne, which graduated to the final scheduled increase to $30 per tonne in July 2012. The carbon tax is imposed at the fuel distributor level to encourage fuel consumers to use less fossil fuel and reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The government of British Columbia has not announced any intentions to increase the carbon tax, but could do so in the future. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

To ensure that it meets its INDC commitments under the Paris Agreement, the Canadian federal government may elect to impose further regulation on GHG emissions and may wish to enter into equivalency agreements with provinces to establish a consistent regulatory regime for GHGs. However, the federal government&#8217;s determination is currently uncertain and could possibly result in overlapping levels of regulation. The direct and indirect costs of these regulations may adversely affect our operations and financial results as well as those of our customers. 

&#160;

Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as higher sea levels, increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160; 

The Canadian Species at Risk Act is intended to prevent wildlife species in Canada from disappearing and to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that no longer exist in the wild in Canada, or that are endangered or threatened as a result of human activity, and to manage species of special concern to prevent them from becoming endangered or threatened. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas of Canada where our customers&#8217; oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are conducted could cause them to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on their exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse impact on demand for our services. 

&#160;

Other Canadian Regulations &#160; 

&#160; 

In June 2015, the government of Alberta announced that it would strike a panel to review and recommend changes to Alberta&#8217;s oil and gas royalty framework. The government released the panel&#8217;s report on January 29, 2016. The four overarching recommendations made by the panel were to (1) establish guiding principles and design criteria for Alberta&#8217;s royalty framework; (2) modernize the royalty framework for crude oil, liquids and natural gas; (3) enhance the royalty process for oil sands; and (4) seize opportunities for value-added processing. It is expected that the government will implement legislation and regulatory changes in the coming months to give effect to the panel&#8217;s recommendations. Until these legislative and regulatory changes are implemented, the panel&#8217;s recommendations will not have the effect of law. Until the legislative and regulatory changes are announced, it is difficult to say what the impact on our customers will be and how it will affect our business. 

&#160; 

On July 1, 2015, the government of Alberta increased Alberta&#8217;s corporate tax rate from 10% to 12%. This increase is expected to have a commensurate impact on our financial results and that of our customers in relation to previous years. 

&#160; 

Australian Environmental Regulations 

&#160;

Our Australian segment is regulated by general statutory environmental controls at both the state and federal level which may result in land use approval and compliance risk. These controls include: land use and urban design controls; the regulation of hard and liquid waste, including the requirement for tradewaste and/or wastewater permits or licenses; the regulation of water, noise, heat, and atmospheric gases emissions; the regulation of the production, transport and storage of dangerous and hazardous materials (including asbestos); and the regulation of pollution and site contamination. Some specified activities, for example, sewage treatment works, may require regulation at a state level by way of environmental protection licenses which also impose monitoring and reporting obligations on the holder. There is an increasing emphasis from state and federal regulators on sustainability and energy efficiency in business operations. Federal requirements are now in place for the mandatory disclosure of energy performance under building rating schemes. These schemes require the tracking of specific environmental performance factors. Carbon reporting requirements currently exist for corporations which meet a reporting threshold for greenhouse gases or energy use or production for a reporting (financial) year under national legislation. 

&#160;

U.S. Environmental Regulations 

&#160; 

The Clean Water Act, as amended, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the U.S. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited unless the discharge is permitted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or authorized state agencies. Many of our U.S. properties and operations require permits for discharges of wastewater and/or storm water, and we have developed a system for securing and maintaining these permits. In addition, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (OPA), imposes a variety of requirements on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages, including natural resource damages, resulting from such spills in waters of the U.S. A responsible party under OPA includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the OPA, require the development and implementation of spill prevention and response plans and impose liability for the remedial costs and associated damages arising out of any unauthorized discharges. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

The EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including, offshore and onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. In addition, the EPA has proposed new regulations that would further restrict GHG emissions, such as new standards for methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from oil and gas sources, which the EPA proposed in September 2015. In February 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposed new regulations to reduce &#8220;waste&#8221; of natural gas&#8212;of which methane is a primary constituent&#8212;from venting, flaring and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian lands. In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, which imposes additional obligations on the power generation sector to reduce GHG emissions. However, on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of legal challenges to the rule. While our operations are not directly affected by these actions, their impact on our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers could result in a decreased demand for the services that we provide. 

&#160;

While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of federal climate legislation in the U.S., a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emission allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which could reduce our customers&#8217; demand for our services. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

&#160;

Our operations as well as the operations of our customers are also subject to various laws and regulations addressing the management, disposal and releases of regulated substances. For example, in the U.S., the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (RCRA) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Federal and state regulatory agencies can seek to impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for alleged non-compliance with RCRA and analogous state requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. Moreover, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons considered to be responsible for the release of a &#8220;hazardous substance&#8221; into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In addition, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. In the event of mismanagement or release of regulated substances upon properties where we conduct operations, we could become subject to liability and/or obligations under CERCLA, RCRA and/or analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial operations to prevent future contamination.

The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (ESA), restricts activities in the U.S. that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. If endangered species are located in areas of the U.S. where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, such operations could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. Moreover, as a result of a settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in 2011, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to make a determination on listings of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA before the end of the agency&#8217;s 2017 fiscal year.

The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas of the U.S. where our customers&#8217; oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are conducted could cause them to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on their exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse impact on demand for our services.

Hydraulic fracturing is a process sometimes used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas regulators, but EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) over, and issued permitting guidance in February 2014 for, certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels. In May 2014, EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. In March 2015, BLM issued a final rule that imposes requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands, including new requirements relating to public disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water; similar rules have been proposed for hydraulic fracturing activities on National Park and National Wildlife Refuge System lands. However, in September 2015, the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming issued a preliminary injunction staying effectiveness of the BLM rule pending resolution of legal challenges to the rule. In addition, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Some states and local governments also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations to restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. Moreover, ongoing governmental reviews of the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing by EPA and other agencies could lead to further regulation of hydraulic fracturing. While our operations are not directly affected by these actions, their impact on our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers could result in a decreased demand for the services that we provide.
