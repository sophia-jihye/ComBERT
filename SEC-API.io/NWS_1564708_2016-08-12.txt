&#160; &#149; &#160; Mobile/Digital: NAM&#146;s digital marketing solutions include SmartSource Digital, which encompasses secure printable couponing, load-to-card couponing, targeted email campaigns and programmatic digital display, and the Checkout 51 mobile application, a leading receipt recognition app that enables packaged goods companies and brands to reach consumers with highly personalized marketing campaigns. 

NAM believes its programs have key advantages when compared to other marketing options available to packaged goods companies, retailers and other marketers. NAM offers effective and targeted programs that reach a national audience of consumers who are actively seeking incentives or information at critical points along the path to purchase. 

The Company&#146;s News and Information Services products compete with a wide range of media businesses, including print publications, digital media and information services. 

The Company&#146;s newspapers, magazines and digital publications compete for readership and advertising with local and national newspapers, web and application-based media, social media sources and other media such as television, magazines, outdoor displays and radio. Competition for subscriptions and circulation is 

&#160; 

based on the news and editorial content, subscription pricing, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. Competition for advertising is based upon advertisers&#146; judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates and advertising effectiveness results. As a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies, distribution platforms and business models, the consumer-focused businesses within the Company&#146;s News and Information Services segment, including its newspaper businesses, continue to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue from a variety of alternative news and information sources. These include both paid and free websites, digital applications, news aggregators, blogs, search engines, social media platforms, digital advertising networks and exchanges, bidding and other programmatic advertising buying channels, as well as other emerging media and distribution platforms. Shifts in consumer behavior, including the widespread adoption of mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers and other portable devices as platforms through which news and information is consumed, require the Company to continually innovate and improve upon its own products, services and platforms in order to remain competitive. The Company believes that these changes will continue to pose opportunities and challenges, and that it is well positioned to leverage its global reach, brand recognition and proprietary technology to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these changes. 

Dow Jones professional information products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers and global financial newswires, including Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg L.P., LexisNexis, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data. 

NAM competes against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and services, including those that provide promotional or advertising inserts, direct mailers of promotional or advertising materials, providers of point-of-purchase and other in-store programs and providers of savings and/or grocery-focused digital applications, as well as other marketing products and services. Competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, rate of coupon redemption, store coverage and other factors. The Company believes that based on the scale of NAM&#146;s home-delivered products, the reach of its in-store marketing products and the growing audience for its digital marketing platform, NAM provides broader consumer access than many of its competitors. 

Book Publishing 

The Company&#146;s Book Publishing segment consists of HarperCollins Publishers (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, &#147;HarperCollins&#148;), the second largest consumer book publisher in the world based on global revenue, with operations in 18 countries. HarperCollins publishes and distributes consumer books globally through print, digital and audio formats. Its digital formats include e-books for devices such as tablets and e-book readers, as well as audio downloads for smartphones and MP3 players. HarperCollins owns more than 120 branded imprints, including Avon, Harper, HarperCollins Children&#146;s Books, William Morrow, Harlequin and Christian publishers Zondervan and Thomas Nelson. 

HarperCollins publishes works by well-known authors such as Harper Lee, Mitch Albom, Veronica Roth, Rick Warren, Sarah Young and Agatha Christie and popular titles such as The Hobbit , Goodnight Moon , To Kill a Mockingbird , Jesus Calling and the Divergent series. Its print and digital global catalog includes more than 200,000 publications in different formats, in 17 languages, and it licenses rights for its authors&#146; works to be published in more than 50 languages around the world. HarperCollins publishes fiction and nonfiction, with a focus on general, children&#146;s and religious content. Additionally, in the U.K., HarperCollins publishes titles for the equivalent of the K-12 educational market. 

As of June 30, 2016, HarperCollins offered approximately 100,000 publications in digital formats, and nearly all of HarperCollins&#146; new titles, as well as the majority of its entire catalog, are available as e-books. Digital sales, comprising revenues generated through the sale of e-books as well as digital audio books, 

&#160; 

represented approximately 19% of global consumer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. With the widespread adoption of electronic formats by consumers, HarperCollins is publishing a number of titles in digital formats before, or instead of, publishing a print edition. 

During fiscal 2016, HarperCollins U.S. had 239 titles on the New York Times print and digital bestseller lists, with 30 titles hitting number one, including Go Set a Watchman by Harper Lee, The Pioneer Woman Cooks: Dinnertime by Ree Drummond , The English Spy by Daniel Silva , The Glass Sword by Victoria Aveyard and Pax by Sara Pennypacker. 

HarperCollins derives its revenue from the sale of print and digital books to a customer base that includes global technology companies, traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including Amazon, Apple, Barnes &#38; Noble and Tesco. Revenues at the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of HarperCollins&#146; books in the marketplace, and are typically highest during the Company&#146;s second fiscal quarter due to increased demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. 

The book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations. HarperCollins competes with other large publishers, such as Penguin Random House, Simon &#38; Schuster and Hachette Livre, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants as barriers to entry in book publishing are low. In addition, HarperCollins competes for readership with other media formats and sources. The Company believes HarperCollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies. Furthermore, HarperCollins is a leader in children&#146;s and religious books, categories which have been less impacted by the transition to digital consumption. 

Digital Real Estate Services 

The Company&#146;s Digital Real Estate Services segment consists primarily of its 61.6% interest in REA Group Limited (&#147;REA Group&#148;), a publicly-traded company listed on ASX (ASX: REA), and its 80% interest in Move, Inc.

Revenue from this business is generated primarily from agents and commercial developers, which benefit from being able to target REA Group&#146;s substantial audience base. 

REA Group&#146;s international operations include property sites in Asia and Europe. In Asia, REA Group increased its interest in iProperty Group Limited (&#147;iProperty&#148;) to 86.9% in February 2016. iProperty operates leading property sites throughout Southeast Asia, including Malaysia and Hong Kong, and prominent portals in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia.

Move 

Move is a leading provider of online real estate services in the U.S. Move primarily operates realtor.com &#174; , a premier real estate information and services marketplace, under a perpetual agreement and trademark license with the National Association of Realtors &#174; (&#147;NAR&#148;). Through realtor.com &#174; , consumers have access to over 100 million properties across the U.S., including the most complete collection of homes and properties listed with Multiple Listing Services (&#147;MLS&#148;) and displayed for sale among the competing national online portals and an extensive database of &#147;off-market&#148; properties. Realtor.com &#174; and its related mobile applications display approximately 98% of all MLS-listed, for-sale properties in the U.S., which are primarily sourced directly from relationships with MLSs across the country. Over 90% of its for-sale listings are updated at least every 15 minutes, on average, with the remaining listings updated daily. Realtor.com &#174; &#146;s substantial content advantage attracts a highly engaged consumer audience. Based on internal data, realtor.com &#174; and its mobile sites had 53 million average monthly unique users during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. These users viewed an average of over 1.8 billion pages and spent an average of over 1.1 billion minutes on the realtor.com &#174; website and mobile applications each month. 

Realtor.com &#174; generates the majority of its revenues through the sale of listing advertisement products, including Connection for Co-Brokerage, Showcase SM Listing Enhancements and Featured Homes SM , which allow real estate agents, brokers and franchises to enhance, prioritize and connect with consumers on for-sale property listings within the realtor.com &#174; website and mobile applications. Listing advertisements are typically sold on a subscription basis. Realtor.com &#174; also derives revenue from sales of non-listing advertisement, or Media, products to real estate, finance, insurance, home improvement and other professionals that enable those professionals to connect with realtor.com &#174; &#146;s highly engaged and valuable consumer audience. Media products include sponsorships, display advertisements, text links, directories, and Digital Advertising Package. Non-listing advertisement pricing models include cost per thousand, cost per click, cost per unique user and subscription-based sponsorships of specific content areas or targeted geographies.

&#160; 

and distributes that content to an array of web sites. Listing syndication pricing includes fixed- or variable-pricing models based on listing counts, while ListHub TM &#146;s advanced reporting products are sold on a monthly subscription basis. 

Move competes primarily with other real estate websites focused on the U.S. real estate market, including zillow.com and trulia.com. 

Cable Network Programming 

The Company&#146;s Cable Network Programming segment consists of FOX SPORTS Australia, the leading sports programming provider in Australia based on total viewing hours as of June 30, 2016. FOX SPORTS Australia is focused on live national and international sports events and provides featured original and licensed premium sports content tailored to the Australian market, including live sports such as National Rugby League, the domestic football league, international cricket, as well as the Australian Rugby Union.

FOX SPORTS Australia also operates foxsports.com.au, a leading general sports website in Australia, and offers several interactive mobile and tablet applications that extend the reach of its content across multiple platforms. FOX SPORTS Australia is distributed via longstanding carriage agreements with pay-TV providers (mainly Foxtel) in Australia and generates revenue primarily through affiliate fees payable under these carriage agreements, as well as advertising sales. Results at the Cable Network Programming segment can fluctuate due to the timing and mix of the Company&#146;s local and international sports programming, as expenses associated with licensing these programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event. 

FOX SPORTS Australia competes primarily with ESPN, beIN SPORTS, the Free-To-Air (&#147;FTA&#148;) channels and certain telecommunications companies in Australia. 

Other 

The Other segment includes the Company&#146;s general corporate overhead expenses, corporate Strategy and Creative Group and costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters.

Equity Investments 

Foxtel 

The Company and Telstra, an ASX-listed telecommunications company, each own 50% of Foxtel, the largest pay-TV provider in Australia. Foxtel had more than 2.9 million subscribing households throughout Australia as of June 30, 2016 through cable, satellite and IP distribution. 

&#160; 

Foxtel delivers 200 channels (including standard definition channels, high definition versions of some of those channels, and audio and interactive channels) covering news, sports, general entertainment, movies, documentaries, music and children&#146;s programming. Foxtel&#146;s premium content includes FOX SPORTS Australia&#146;s suite of sports channels such as FOX SPORTS 1, FOX SPORTS 2, FOX SPORTS 3, FOX SPORTS 4, FOX SPORTS 5, FOX FOOTY and FOX SPORTS NEWS, and TV content from HBO, FOX and Universal, among others. Foxtel also owns and operates 30 channels, including general entertainment and movie channels, and sources an extensive range of movie programming through arrangements with major U.S. studios. Foxtel&#146;s channels are distributed to subscribers via both Telstra&#146;s hybrid fibrecoaxial cable network and a long-term contracted satellite platform provided by Optus. Cable and satellite distribution is enabled by Foxtel&#146;s set-top boxes, including the iQ3, Foxtel&#146;s newest box. Foxtel also offers versions of its services via the Internet through Telstra&#146;s T-Box platform, Foxtel Play, an Internet television service available on a number of compatible devices (including the Sony PlayStation platform, select Samsung, LG and Sony televisions, select Samsung Blu-ray players and personal computers), and Foxtel Go, an Internet television service that allows subscribers to watch Foxtel channels via mobile devices and tablets. In addition, Foxtel has a subscription video-on-demand service called Presto that distributes movies and television programming to subscribers. Foxtel owns Presto Movies, while Presto TV is operated under a joint venture with a subsidiary of Seven West Media Limited. Foxtel also offers a triple play bundle product, which consists of Foxtel&#146;s existing pay-TV services, sold together with broadband and/or home phone services. 

Foxtel generates revenue primarily through subscription revenue as well as advertising revenue. For the year ended June 30, 2016, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;GAAP&#148;), Foxtel recorded revenues of $2.4 billion and earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of $604 million. Management believes that EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of this business for the reasons set forth in &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#151;Results of Operations&#151;Segment Analysis&#148; with respect to Segment EBITDA. In the year ended June 30, 2016, Foxtel&#146;s average broadcast residential recurring subscription revenue per user, or ARPU, was A$89 (US$65) per month (as calculated by Foxtel), and its annualized residential subscriber churn rate based on data for the year ended June 30, 2016 was 12.2% (as calculated by Foxtel). In addition, Foxtel had $1.8 billion of indebtedness outstanding as of June 30, 2016 (excluding $676 million of shareholder loans due to Telstra and the Company), and paid distributions of $26 million to the Company during the year ended June 30, 2016. The amount included for Foxtel in the Company&#146;s Equity earnings of affiliates was $38 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

The Company and Telstra each have the right to appoint one-half of the board of directors of Foxtel. In addition, the Company has the right to appoint the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Foxtel, while Telstra has the right to terminate these officers. 

Foxtel competes for audiences primarily with FTA TV operators in Australia, including the three major commercial FTA networks and two major government-funded FTA broadcasters, as well as other pay-TV operators, IP television providers and subscription video-on-demand services such as Fetch TV, Netflix and Stan. Foxtel provides a 200-channel selection with premium and exclusive content and a wide array of digital and mobile features that are not available to viewers on these alternative providers. Through innovations such as digital HD channels, the extension of pay-TV programming to mobile devices, the use of DVR and Electronic Program Guide technology, including the iQ3 set-top box, its investment in On Demand capability and programming and benefits through broadband bundling, the Company believes Foxtel offers subscribers a compelling alternative to its competitors. 

Governmental Regulation 

General 

Various aspects of the Company&#146;s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. The Company believes that it is in material compliance with the requirements imposed by those laws and 

&#160; 

regulations described herein. The introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Company&#146;s products and services are produced or distributed (and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries) could have a negative impact on the Company&#146;s interests. 

Australian Media Regulation 

The Company&#146;s subscription television interests are subject to Australia&#146;s regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry. The key regulatory body for the Australian broadcasting industry is the Australian Communications and Media Authority. 

Key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictions&#151;currently under the &#145;anti-siphoning&#146; provisions of the Australian Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the Olympic Games and certain Australian Rules football and cricket matches) unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the Australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of Australia&#146;s two major government-funded broadcasters; and (b) the Broadcasting Services Act also may impact the Company&#146;s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including, for example, preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area. 

Data Privacy and Security 

Our business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. For example, in the U.S., certain of the Company&#146;s websites, mobile applications and other online business activities are subject to the Children&#146;s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (the &#147;FTC&#148;) continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted Internet advertisements. Most states have also enacted legislation regulating data privacy and security, including laws requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. 

Similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including the European Union and Australia. Recently, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (&#147;GDPR&#148;), which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the European Union and to replace the existing Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC). Fully enforceable by May 25, 2018, the GDPR expands the regulation of the collection, processing, use and security of personal data, contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthens the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continues to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification, increases penalties for non-compliance and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. Also, in 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework, one of the legal mechanisms through which personal data could be transferred from the European Union to the United States, and the mechanism relied upon by the Company with respect to certain personal data transfers among the Company&#146;s businesses, and between the Company and some of its third party service providers. The Company has been putting into place, and working with its third party service providers to implement, alternative legal mechanisms for cross-border personal data transfers. In Australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers and placing restrictions on direct marketing practices, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. 

&#160; 

In response to such developments, industry participants in the U.S., Europe and Australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the Company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. The Company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the Company&#146;s data privacy and security compliance programs. 

U.K. Press Regulation 

As a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, which was established by Prime Minister David Cameron in mid-2011, a Royal Charter on Self-Regulation of the Press was granted in 2013, which established a Recognition Panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies. Once approved by the Recognition Panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. No such regulator has yet been approved by the Recognition Panel, although it is currently considering an application by a newly-formed independent body, IMPRESS. In addition to the Royal Charter and establishment of the new Recognition Panel, legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who do not participate in this new U.K. press regulatory system may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded. 

In late 2013, publications representing the majority of the industry in the U.K., including News UK, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead, which is referred to as the Independent Press Standards Organisation, or IPSO. IPSO, which began operating in September 2014, currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the Recognition Panel. IPSO has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. IPSO oversees the Editors&#146; Code of Practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the Editors&#146; Code and levy fines of up to &#163;1 million. IPSO is also considering the introduction of an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. IPSO imposes burdens on the print media, including the Company&#146;s newspaper businesses in the U.K., which may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance 

Intellectual Property 

The Company&#146;s intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. In addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. The Company derives value and revenue from these assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services, the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services. 

The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and other foreign territories. To protect these assets, the Company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Policing unauthorized use of the Company&#146;s products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Company&#146;s intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches, including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and 

&#160; 

international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. 

Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Company&#146;s intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Company&#146;s operations. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. 

Raw Materials 

As a major publisher of newspapers, magazines, free-standing inserts and books, the Company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. In order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the Company&#146;s paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. The Company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. 

Employees 

As of June 30, 2016, the Company had approximately 24,000 employees, of whom approximately 9,000 were located in the U.S., 4,000 were located in the U.K. and 8,000 were located in Australia. Of the Company&#146;s employees, approximately 5,000 were represented by various employee unions. The contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. The Company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good. 

&#160;
