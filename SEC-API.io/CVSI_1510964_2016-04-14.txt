 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160;

Overview 

&#160;

We were incorporated under the name Foreclosure Solutions, Inc. in the State of Texas on December 9, 2010. On July 25, 2013, the Company&#8217;s predecessor, CannaVest Corp., a Texas corporation (&#8220;CannaVest Texas&#8221;), merged with the Company, a wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary of CannaVest Texas, to effectuate a change in the Company&#8217;s state of incorporation from Texas to Delaware. On January 4, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, reflecting its corporate name change to &#8220;CV Sciences, Inc.&#8221;, effective on January 5, 2016. In addition, on January 4, 2016, the Company amended its Bylaws to reflect its corporate name change to &#8220;CV Sciences, Inc.&#8221; The Company previously operated under the corporate name of CannaVest Corp.

&#160;

The change in corporate name was undertaken in connection with the acquisition of CanX Inc., a Florida corporation (&#8220;CanX&#8221;). As more fully set forth in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 4, 2016 (the &#8220;CanX 8-K&#8221;), on December 30, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the &#8220;Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with CANNAVEST Merger Sub, Inc., a Florida corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Merger Sub&#8221;), CANNAVEST Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the &#8220;LLC&#8221;), CanX and the Starwood Trust, as the Shareholders&#8217; Representative (the &#8220;CanX Acquisition&#8221;). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into CanX with CanX surviving such merger. Immediately following effectiveness of the merger, CanX merged with and into the LLC with the LLC surviving such merger. Upon consummation of these transactions, CanX ceased to exist and all property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of CanX vested in the LLC, and all debts, liabilities and duties of CanX became the debts, liabilities and duties of the LLC. In consideration for the acquisition of CanX and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Cannabine, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, the Company paid and issued to the former shareholders of CanX at closing an aggregate sum of $250,000 in cash and 5,000,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock. Subject to the Company achieving certain post-closing milestones, the Company will pay and issue certain additional contingent consideration to the former shareholders of CanX, as more particularly set forth in the CanX 8-K.

&#160;

As a result of the CanX Acquisition, the Company is positioned both as a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapeutics utilizing synthetic Cannabidiol (&#8220;CBD&#8221;); and, to continue our existing consumer product business segment in manufacturing, marketing and selling plant-based CBD products to a range of market sectors.

&#160;

Pharmaceuticals 

We are a development stage, specialty pharmaceutical company developing synthetic cannabinoids to treat a range of medical conditions. Cannabinoids are compounds derived from the Cannabis sativa plant, which contain two primary cannabinoids, CBD, and undefined9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (&#8220;THC&#8221;). Clinical and preclinical data suggest that CBD has promising results in treating a range of medical indications. We acquired two product candidates in the CanX Acquisition, each utilizing synthetic CBD as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Both product candidates are currently in preclinical studies. The Company is hopeful to be in a position to file an Investigational New Drug application (&#8220;IND&#8221;) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#8220;FDA&#8221;) in the future. We expect to meet with the FDA during 2016 to determine the extent of any further required preclinical work prior to commencement of a clinical program. The Company&#8217;s product candidates are based on proprietary formulations, processes and technology that we believe are patent-protectable, and we plan to vigorously pursue patent protection on the Company&#8217;s two drug candidates.

&#160;

Consumer Products 

We manufacture, market and sell consumer products containing plant-based CBD under our PlusCBD&#8482; brand in a range of market sectors including nutraceutical, beauty care, specialty foods and vape. We expect to continue to add new products to our PlusCBD&#8482; portfolio to enhance our line of CBD and hemp-related consumer products. We also expect to develop and launch new brands to more effectively market and sell certain products. We also sell raw materials acquired by us through our supply relationships in Europe to various customers that produce products for resale into the market.

&#160;

We seek to take advantage of an emerging worldwide trend to re-energize the production of industrial hemp and to foster its many uses for consumers. Historically cultivated for industrial and practical purposes, hemp is used today for textiles, paper, auto parts, biofuel, cosmetics, animal feed, nutritional supplements and much more. The market for hemp-derived products is expected to increase substantially over the next five years, and CV Sciences is well positioned to be a significant player in the hemp industry. 

&#160;

We expect to realize revenue to fund a portion of our working capital needs through the sale of finished products and raw materials to third parties. However, in order to fund our drug development efforts, we will need to raise additional capital through either the issuance of equity and/or debt. In the event we are unable to maintain profitable operations or raise sufficient additional capital, our ability to continue as a going concern would be in jeopardy and investors could lose all of their investment in the Company.

Current Operations 

&#160; 

Consumer Products 

We utilize internal resources to manufacture, market, and sell products containing hemp-derived CBD primarily under our PlusCBD&#8482; brand. Hemp-derived CBD is one of at least 80 cannabinoids found in hemp, and is non-psychoactive. Our U.S. based operations oversee all raw material supply chain, raw material processing, product development and manufacturing, and sales and marketing. We are developing new products and we will continue to scale-up our processing capability to accommodate new products in our pipeline.

&#160;

Pharmaceuticals 

We currently contract with qualified parties and contract research organizations for our preclinical research and IND preparation and development. Commercialization of future pharmaceutical products in the United States and other territories may rely on licensing and co-promotion agreements with strategic partners. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could include a sales organization, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. 

&#160;

Description of our Subsidiaries 

&#160;

The Company owns 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of four subsidiaries: US Hemp Oil, LLC (&#8220;US Hemp Oil&#8221;), CannaVest Laboratories, LLC (formerly, PhytoSPHERE Systems, LLC) (&#8220;CannaVest Laboratories&#8221;), Plus CBD, LLC (formerly, Global Hemp Source, LLC) (&#8220;Plus CBD&#8221;), and the LLC. The Company also owns a 70% interest in CannaVest Europe, GmbH.

&#160; 

Inventory and Sales 

&#160; 

Currently, we have over 1,000 metric tons of hemp oil inventory on hand or that is being processed. Based on expected increasing demand, we have invested significant capital to develop and maintain relationships with growers on a global scale to ensure access to a significant percentage of the worldwide hemp crop. We source our raw materials from well-established and well-recognized hemp growers in Europe. We have arrangements with some of these growers for exclusive rights to their supply. Despite this already large footprint, we continue to explore and develop other relationships to ensure that we can meet the expected demand for bulk hemp products well into the future.

&#160;

Subject to applicable law, the Company plans to initiate growing operations in the U.S., initially on a pilot scale, with the goal of becoming a national grower of product.

&#160;

Changes in the Law and Development Programs 

&#160;

For the first time since 1937, industrial hemp has been decriminalized at the federal level and can be grown legally in the United States, but on a limited basis. A landmark provision passed in the Agricultural Act of 2014 recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana. Federal law now exempts industrial hemp from U.S. drug laws in order to allow for crop research by universities, colleges and state agriculture departments. The new Federal law allows for agricultural pilot programs for industrial hemp &#8220;in states that permit the growth or cultivation of hemp.&#8221;

&#160;

Under the jurisdiction of the Agricultural Act of 2014, we entered into two separate agreements during 2015. We entered an agreement with the Kentucky State Department of Agriculture to complete research under pilot studies with farmers and processors of CBD. In addition, we entered an agreement with the University of Kentucky to fund research regarding cultivation techniques to increase CBD production. We are also evaluating opportunities within Kentucky to invest in processing facilities and equipment in support of our consumer products business segment.

&#160;

Market, Customers and Distribution Methods 

&#160; 

The market, customers and distribution methods for hemp-based products are large and diverse. These markets range from hemp-based bio plastics to textiles. This is an ever-evolving distribution system that today includes early adopter retailers and ecommerce entities, and product development companies that use our PlusCBD&#8482; oil to develop consumer products for distribution. The number of &#8220;mainstream&#8221; commercial and retail stores that currently stock and sell our products is increasing primarily through customer awareness. We believe that as awareness grows for the &#8220;green,&#8221; environmentally-friendly products derived from hemp\cannabis, the consumer market will adapt its current product lines to integrate them with hemp-based additives or replace harmful components in their existing products with the components of hemp\cannabis.

&#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Our target customers are first and foremost end consumers via internet sales, direct-to-consumer health and wellness stores, collectives, cooperatives, affiliate sales and master distributors. Secondarily, we are targeting manufactures of products that can readily replace their raw base materials for our base materials, making the products more environmentally friendly and sustainable. Next, we will target national and regional broker networks and major distribution companies who have preexisting relationships with major retail chain stores. In addition, we are directly pursuing distribution opportunities with national retailers. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160; 

There are several companies developing cannabinoid therapeutics for a range of medical indications. The Cannabis therapeutic area currently includes formulated extracts of the Cannabis plant and synthetic formulations. These formulations include CBD and THC, or a combination of CBD/THC as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Certain companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC have focused on plant-based CBD formulations; while other companies such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Insys Therapeutics Inc. have focused on synthetic CBD formulations. 

&#160;

There are numerous CBD-based consumer product companies, many of which are under-capitalized which we consider to be viable acquisition targets. We routinely evaluate opportunities to purchase existing product lines, sources of CBD and other assets from certain competing companies. There are also large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based consumer products but may do so in the future.

&#160;

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We have filed trademark applications on our brands, logos and marks including, but not limited to CV Sciences and Plus CBD &#8482;. On January 30, 2016, we received a Notice of Allowance from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for our utility patent application number 14/791,184, &#8220;Novel Process for Generating Hemp Oil with a High Cannabidiol (CBD) Content.&#8221; This patent covers our solvent-free and highly repeatable process for producing hemp oil with higher concentrations of CBD. We plan to continue pursuing this patent.

&#160;

We review our intellectual property portfolio on a periodic basis and we will continue to broaden our portfolio in a fiscally prudent manner. We intend to file for patent protection on our pharmaceutical products based on proprietary formulations, processes and technology.

&#160;

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We opened a laboratory facility in San Diego, California in September 2013 to advance our CBD consumer products business. Our lab specializes in process development and product testing. We incurred research and development expenses of $1,320,003 and $999,280, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

&#160;

Source and Availability of Raw Materials 

&#160;

The Company sources its raw materials from well-established and well-recognized hemp growers in Europe. We have arrangements with some of these growers to have exclusive rights to their supply. The Company has two supply arrangements in place with European farmers to supply raw material in future years. The first arrangement contemplates growth and processing of 2,600 kilograms of product and the second contract provides up to 1 million kilograms of raw product to the Company. There is approximately $260,000 remaining to be paid under this second contract related to the 2015 crop. We have contractual rights for the growth and processing of hemp oil for delivery through October 2018 under both of these contracts. We anticipate the cost under both contracts will remain consistent with current year prices. We do not intend to purchase any inventory under these supply agreements from the 2016 crop.

&#160;

Environmental Matters 

&#160;

Compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160; 

As of April 14, 2016, we had a total of 45 employees; 37 full-time employees and 8 part-time employees. We are currently in discussions with qualified individuals to engage them for positions in sales and marketing, research and development, and operations. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and none are represented by labor unions. Management believes the Company has good relationships with its employees.
