 Item 1. Business 

&#160; 

MGT Capital Investments, Inc. (&#8220;MGT,&#8221; &#8220;the Company,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221;) is a Delaware corporation, incorporated in 2000. The Company was originally incorporated in Utah in 1977. MGT is comprised of the parent company, wholly&#8211;owned subsidiaries Medicsight, Inc. (&#8220;Medicsight&#8221;), MGT Sports, Inc. (&#8220;MGT Sports&#8221;), MGT Studios, Inc. (&#8220;MGT Studios&#8221;), and majority&#8211;owned subsidiary MGT Gaming, Inc. MGT Studios also owns a controlling minority interest in the subsidiary M2P Americas, Inc. Our corporate office is located in Harrison, New York. 

&#160; 

MGT and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the business of acquiring, developing and monetizing assets in the online and mobile gaming space as well as the social casino industry. MGT&#8217;s portfolio includes a social casino platform Slot Champ and minority stakes in the skill&#8211;based gaming platform MGT Play and fantasy sports operator DraftDay Gaming Group, Inc. (&#8220;DDGG&#8221;) (see September 8, 2015 development below). 

&#160; 

In addition, MGT Gaming owns three patents covering certain features of casino slot machines. Two of the patents were asserted against alleged infringers in various actions in federal court in Mississippi. In July 2014, MGT Gaming dismissed its lawsuits against WMS Gaming Inc., and in August 2015, the Company and defendants Aruze America and Penn National Gaming agreed to settle all pending litigation and all proceedings at the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. The Company received a payment of $90, which was recorded as licensing revenue. In an effort to monetize its gaming patent portfolio, the Company has engaged Munich Innovations GmbH, the patent monetization firm that sold MGT&#8217;s medical patent portfolio to Samsung in 2013 for $1.5 million. 

&#160; 

On September 8, 2015, the Company and MGT Sports entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Viggle, Inc. (&#8220;Viggle&#8221;) and Viggle&#8217;s subsidiary DDGG, pursuant to which Viggle acquired all of the assets of the DraftDay.com business (&#8220;DraftDay.com&#8221;) from the Company and MGT Sports. In exchange for the acquisition of DraftDay.com, Viggle paid MGT Sports the following: (a) 1,269,342 shares of Viggle&#8217;s common stock, since renamed Draftday Fantasy Sports, Inc. (NASDAQ: DDAY), (b) a promissory note in the amount of $234 paid on September 29, 2015, (c) a promissory note in the amount of $1,875 due March 8, 2016, and (d) 2,550,000 shares of common stock of DDGG (private entity). In addition, in exchange for providing certain transitional services, DDGG issued to MGT Sports a warrant to purchase 1,500,000 shares of DDGG common stock. Following consummation of the transaction, MGT Sports owns an 11% equity interest in DDGG, Viggle (since renamed Draftday Fantasy Sports, Inc.) owns 49%, and Sportech, Inc. owns 39%. As a result of the transaction, the Company has presented DraftDay.com as a discontinued operation. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to realize full value of the above consideration, the Company has taken a reserve of $300 against the March 8, 2016 promissory note and continues to monitor for further possible impairment.

Medicsight owns U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved medical imaging software and has designed an automated carbon dioxide insufflation device on which it receives royalties from an international manufacturer.

Strategy 

&#160; 

MGT and its subsidiaries are principally engaged in the business of acquiring, developing and monetizing assets in the online and mobile gaming space, as well as the casino industry. The Company&#8217;s acquisition strategy is designed to obtain control of assets with a focus on risk mitigation coupled with large potential upside. We plan to build our portfolio by seeking out large social and real money gaming opportunities via extensive research and analysis. Next, we will attempt to secure controlling interests for modest cash and/or stock outlays. MGT then budgets and funds operating costs to develop business operations and tries to motivate sellers with equity upside. While the ultimate objective is to operate businesses for free cash flow, there may be opportunities where we sell or otherwise monetize certain assets.

&#160;

&#160; 

There can be no assurance that any acquisitions will occur at all, or that any such acquisitions will be accretive to earnings, book value and other financial metrics, or that any such acquisitions will generate positive returns for Company stockholders. Furthermore, it is contemplated that any acquisitions may require the Company to raise capital; such capital may not be available on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. 

&#160; 

Following the sale of DraftDay.com, the Company has been considering all methods to create value for shareholders, including potential mergers, spin&#8211;offs, distributions and other strategic actions. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

MGT encounters intense competition in all its businesses, in most cases from larger companies with greater financial resources such as the daily fantasy sports operators FanDuel, Inc. and DraftKings, Inc. or Zynga, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZNGA) and Caesars Acquisition Company (NASDAQ: CACQ) which focus on social and real money online gaming. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

Currently, the Company and its subsidiaries have 2 full&#8211;time employees. None of our employees is represented by a union and we believe our relationships with our employees are good.
