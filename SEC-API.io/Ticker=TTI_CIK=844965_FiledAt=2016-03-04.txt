About TETRA 

TETRA Technologies, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is a leading, geographically diversified oil and gas services company, focused on completion fluids and associated products and services, water management, frac flowback, production well testing, offshore rig cooling, compression services and equipment, and selected offshore services including well plugging and abandonment, decommissioning, and diving. We also have a limited domestic oil and gas production business. We are composed of five reporting segments organized into four divisions - Fluids, Production Testing, Compression, and Offshore. 

&#160; 

Our Fluids Division &#32;manufactures and markets clear brine fluids, additives, and associated products and services to the oil and gas industry for use in well drilling, completion, and workover operations in the United States and in certain countries in Latin America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The division also markets liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third-party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry. The Fluids Division also provides domestic onshore oil and gas operators with a wide variety of water management services. 

Our Production Testing Division &#32;provides frac flowback, production well testing, offshore rig cooling, and other associated services in many of the major oil and gas producing regions in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, as well as in basins in certain regions in South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia. 

Our Compression Division &#32;is a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. The Compression Division's equipment and parts sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages, and oilfield pump systems designed and fabricated at the division's facilities, as well as the sale of compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. The Compression Division's aftermarket services business provides compressor package reconfiguration and maintenance services. The Compression Division provides its services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States as well as in a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada, and Argentina. 

Our Offshore Division &#32;consists of two operating segments: Offshore Services and Maritech. The Offshore Services segment provides: (1) downhole and subsea services such as well plugging and abandonment, and workover services; (2) decommissioning and certain construction services utilizing heavy lift barges and various cutting technologies with regard to offshore oil and gas production platforms and pipelines; and (3) conventional and saturation diving services. 

The Maritech &#32;segment is a limited oil and gas production operation. During 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, Maritech sold substantially all of its oil- and gas-producing property interests. Maritech&#8217;s operations consist primarily of the ongoing abandonment and decommissioning associated with its remaining offshore wells and production platforms. Maritech intends to acquire a portion of these services from the Offshore Division&#8217;s Offshore Services segment. 

&#160; 

We continue to pursue a long-term growth strategy that includes expanding our existing core businesses, with the exception of the Maritech segment, through internal growth and acquisitions, domestically and internationally. For financial information for each of our segments, including information regarding revenues and total assets, see &#8220;Note P - Industry Segments and Geographic Information&#8221; contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

2015 Strategic Capital Enhancement Restructuring 

Given the lower demand for certain of our products and services in the current oil and natural gas market environment, the expected levels of future consolidated operating cash flows, which we have historically used to fund our growth and liquidity needs, has become more uncertain. While remaining committed to a long-term growth strategy, our near-term focus during this period of reduced demand is to preserve and enhance liquidity through strategic operating and financial measures. In addition to cost structure rationalization and working capital management, we have focused on capital structure enhancements designed to strengthen our consolidated balance sheet. On November 20, 2015, pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement (the &#8220;2015 Senior Note Purchase Agreement&#8221;) with GSO Tetra Holdings LP, an unrelated third party, we issued and sold $125.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 11.0% Senior Notes due November 5, 2022 (the &#8220;Series 2015 Senior Notes&#8221;). Immediately after the closing and funding, we applied a portion of the $119.7 million net proceeds from the sale of the Series 2015 Senior Notes to repay all of the indebtedness for borrowed money outstanding under our bank revolving credit facility. In December 2015, we applied the remaining portion of the proceeds, together with other funds to (i) pay the $25.0 million purchase price pursuant to a tender offer that commenced on November 5, 2015 , (the &#8220;Tender Offer&#8221;) to purchase for cash up to $25.0 million &#32;aggregate principal amount of our outstanding Series 2010-A Senior Notes and Series 2010-B Senior Notes (collectively, the &#8220;2010 Senior Notes&#8221;), (ii) prepay in full all amounts owed in respect of our outstanding Series 2006-A Senior Notes, due April 30, 2016, and (iii) pay fees and expenses associated with the transactions contemplated under the 2015 Senior Note Purchase Agreement. In addition, we entered into an agreement with Wells Fargo Energy Capital, Inc. that extends the maturity date of the $50.0 million of the Senior Secured Notes due April 1, 2017, (the "Senior Secured Notes") from 2017 to 2019. As a result of these transactions, we have repaid or extended the maturity dates of a significant portion of TETRA's total long-term debt without significantly increasing the amount of TETRA's net borrowings. 

&#160; 

Products and Services 

&#160; 

Fluids Division 

Liquid calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, sodium bromide, and blends of such products manufactured by our Fluids Division are referred to as clear brine fluids ("CBFs") in the oil and gas industry. CBFs are salt solutions that have variable densities and are used to control bottomhole pressures during oil and gas completion and workover operations. Although they are used in many types of wells, demand for CBFs is greater in offshore well operations. The Fluids Division sells CBFs and various CBF additives to U.S. and foreign oil and gas exploration and production companies and distributes them to other companies that service customers in the oil and gas industry. 

&#160; 

The Fluids Division provides both stock and custom-blended CBFs based on our customers&#8217; specific needs and the proposed application. During 2015, the Fluids Division introduced a new CBF technology, TETRA CS Neptune TM &#32;completion fluids, for a niche completion fluid application for a customer's completion project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We also provide a broad range of associated services, including onsite fluids filtration, handling, and recycling; wellbore cleanup; fluid engineering consultation; fluid management services; and high-volume water management services for fracturing operations. We offer to repurchase (buyback) certain used CBFs from customers, which we are able to recondition and recycle. Selling used CBFs back to us reduces the net cost of the CBFs to our customers and minimizes our customers&#8217; need to dispose of used fluids. We recondition used CBFs through filtration, blending, and the use of proprietary chemical processes, and then market the reconditioned CBFs. 

&#160; 

By blending different stock CBFs and using various additives, we are able to modify the specific density, crystallization temperature, and chemical composition of the CBFs as necessary. The division&#8217;s fluid engineering personnel determine the optimal CBF blend for a customer&#8217;s particular application to maximize its effectiveness and lifespan. Our filtration services use a variety of techniques and equipment to remove particulates from CBFs at the customer&#8217;s site so that the CBFs can be reused. Filtration also enables recovery of a greater percentage of used CBFs for reconditioning. 

&#160; 

The Fluids Division provides domestic onshore oil and gas operators with a wide variety of frac water management services, including selection, analysis, treatment, storage, transfer, recycling, and environmental risk mitigation. These services include the division&#8217;s BioRid &#174; &#32;and other above-ground frac water treatment technologies, some of which are patented, and its proprietary TETRA STEEL TM &#32;1200 rapid deployment water transfer system. The Fluids Division's water management personnel seek to design environmentally friendly solutions for the unique needs of each customer&#8217;s wellsite in order to maximize operational performance and efficiency. 

&#160; 

The Fluids Division manufactures liquid and dry calcium chloride, liquid calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide for distribution, primarily into energy markets. Liquid and dry calcium chloride are also sold into water treatment, industrial, cement, food processing, road maintenance, ice melt, agricultural, and consumer products markets. Liquid sodium bromide is also sold into industrial water treatment markets, where it is used as a biocide in recirculated cooling tower waters and in other applications. 

Our liquid and dry calcium chloride manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Finland. We also acquire liquid and dry calcium chloride inventory from other producers. In the United States, we manufacture calcium chloride at five manufacturing plant facilities, the largest of which is our plant near El Dorado, Arkansas, which produces liquid and flake calcium chloride products. Liquid and flake calcium chloride are also produced at our Kokkola, Finland, plant. We operate our European calcium chloride operations under the name TETRA Chemicals Europe. We also manufacture liquid calcium chloride at our facilities in Parkersburg, West Virginia and Lake Charles, Louisiana, and we have two solar evaporation plants located in San Bernardino County, California, that produce liquid calcium chloride from underground brine reserves. All of our calcium chloride production facilities have a combined production capacity of more than 1.5 million equivalent liquid tons per year. 

Our Fluids Division manufactures liquid calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide at our West Memphis, Arkansas facility. A patented and proprietary process utilized at this facility uses bromine and zinc to manufacture zinc bromide. This facility also uses proprietary processes to manufacture calcium bromide and sodium bromide and to recondition and upgrade used CBFs that we have repurchased from our customers. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Production Testing Division 

&#160; 

Our Production Testing Division provides frac flowback services, early production facilities and services, production well testing services, offshore rig cooling, and other associated services. The Production Testing Division provides well flow management and evaluation services and data that enables operators to quantify reserves, optimize production, and minimize oil and gas reservoir damage. Early production services typically include sophisticated evaluation techniques for reservoir management, including unconventional shale reservoir exploitation and optimization of well workover programs. Frac flowback and production well testing services may include well control, well cleanup, and laboratory analysis. These services are utilized in the completion process after fracking and in the production phase of oil and gas wells. 

&#160; 

Our Production Testing Division maintains one of the largest fleets of high-pressure production testing equipment in the United States, including equipment designed to work in environments where high levels of hydrogen sulfide gas are present. The division has domestic operating locations in Colorado, Louisiana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The division also has locations in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Kurdistan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and certain countries in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

&#160; 

Through our Optima Solutions Holdings Limited subsidiary ("OPTIMA"), the Production Testing Division is a provider of offshore oil and gas rig cooling services and associated products that suppress heat generated by high rate flaring of hydrocarbons during offshore oil and gas well test operations. 

See &#8220;Note P - Industry Segments and Geographic Information&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about the Production Testing Division. 

Compression Division 

Our Compression Division is a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. The Compression Division fabricates and sells standard and custom designed compressor packages as well as oilfield fluid pump systems and provides aftermarket services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. The Compression Division provides its compression services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States as well as in a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada, and Argentina. 

The Compression Division is one of the largest providers of natural gas compression services in the United States. The compression and related services business includes a service fleet of approximately 6,000 compressor packages providing in excess of 1.1 million in aggregate horsepower, utilizing a full spectrum of low-, medium-, and high-horsepower engines. Low-horsepower compressor packages enhance production for dry gas wells and liquid-loaded gas wells by deliquifying wells, lowering wellhead pressure, and increasing gas velocity. Our low-horsepower compressor packages are also utilized in connection with oil and liquids production and in vapor recovery and casing gas system applications. Low- to medium-horsepower compressor packages are typically utilized in wellhead, gathering, and other applications primarily in connection with oil and liquids production.

Through our wholly owned subsidiary, CSI Compressco GP Inc., we manage and control CCLP, and accordingly, we consolidate CCLP results of operation in our consolidated results of operation. As of December 31, 2015, common units held by the public represent approximately a 56% ownership interest in CCLP. 

See &#8220;Note P - Industry Segments and Geographic Information&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about the Compression Division. 

Offshore Division 

&#160; 

Our Offshore Division consists of two operating segments: Offshore Services and Maritech. 

Offshore Services Segment. &#32;The Offshore Services segment provides: (1) downhole and subsea services such as well plugging and abandonment, and workover services; (2) decommissioning and certain construction services utilizing heavy lift barges and various cutting technologies with regard to offshore oil and gas production platforms and pipelines; and (3) conventional and saturation diving services. We provide these services to offshore oil and gas operators, primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We offer comprehensive, integrated services, including individualized engineering consultation and project management services. 

In providing services, our Offshore Services segment utilizes rigless offshore plugging and abandonment equipment packages, two heavy lift barges, several dive support vessels, and other dive support assets that we own. In addition, we lease other assets from third parties and engage third-party contractors whenever necessary. The Offshore Services segment provides a wide variety of conventional and saturation diving services to its customers through its Epic Diving &#38; Marine Services subsidiary ("EPIC"). Well abandonment, decommissioning, diving, and certain construction services are performed primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The Offshore Services segment provides offshore cutting services and tool rentals through its EOT Cutting Services ("EOT") subsidiary. The Offshore Services segment also utilizes specialized equipment and engineering expertise to address a variety of specific platform construction and decommissioning issues, including those associated with platforms that have been toppled or severely damaged by hurricanes and other windstorms. The Offshore Services segment provides services to major oil and gas companies and independent operators, including Maritech, through its facilities located in Broussard, Belle Chasse, Fourchon, and Houma, Louisiana. 

&#160; 

Our Offshore Services segment&#8217;s fleet of service vessels has expanded and contracted in size in recent years in response to changing demands for its services. With the TETRA Hedron, a 1,600-metric-ton heavy lift derrick barge, and the TETRA Arapaho, a 725-metric-ton heavy lift derrick barge, we perform heavy lift decommissioning and construction projects and integrated operations on oil and gas production platforms. The Offshore Services segment also performs contract diving operations, utilizing its owned dive service vessels, as well as vessels obtained under long- and short-term leases as needed. Diving services include saturation diving for up to 1,000 foot dive depths as well as mixed gas and surface diving for shallower dives. 

Among other factors, demand for our Offshore Service segment&#8217;s operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico is affected by federal regulations governing the abandonment and decommissioning of offshore wells, production platforms, and pipelines. These regulations include Notice To Lessees 2010-G05: &#8220;Decommissioning Guidance for Wells and Platforms&#8221; (NTL 2010-G05, known as the &#8220;Idle Iron Guidance&#8221;). The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE") issues offshore permits, regulates offshore contractors, and oversees the provisions of the Idle Iron Guidance. The Idle Iron Guidance became effective October 15, 2010, and requires that operators perform and report decommissioning and abandonment plans and activities in accordance with BSEE requirements. The Idle Iron Guidance provides specific guidelines for when an operator has to permanently plug and abandon wells and decommission platforms and related facilities after the occurrence of certain events, including the end of useful operations, cessation of commercial production, and expiration of the lease. 

&#160; 

Maritech Segment. &#32;The Maritech segment is a limited oil and gas production operation in the offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico. During 2011 and the first quarter of 2012, Maritech sold substantially all of its proved reserves. Maritech&#8217;s remaining operations consist primarily of the ongoing abandonment and decommissioning of its remaining offshore wells, facilities, and production platforms. Maritech intends to acquire a significant portion of these services with regard to such assets that it operates from the Offshore Division&#8217;s Offshore Services segment. 

&#160; 

The sales of substantially all of Maritech&#8217;s oil and gas producing properties during 2011 and 2012 have essentially removed us from the oil and gas exploration and production business, and significantly all of Maritech&#8217;s oil and gas acquisition, development, and exploitation activities have ceased. Following these sales, Maritech&#8217;s remaining oil and gas reserves and production are negligible. Maritech&#8217;s operations consist primarily of the well abandonment and decommissioning of its remaining offshore oil and gas platforms and facilities. During the three year period ended December 31, 2015, Maritech spent approximately $187.7 million &#32;on such efforts. Approximately $48.4 million &#32;of Maritech decommissioning liabilities remain as of December 31, 2015, and approximately $14.6 million &#32;of this amount is planned to be performed during 2016, with the timing of a portion of this work being discretionary. 

Maritech&#8217;s decommissioning liabilities are established based on what it estimates a third party would charge to plug and abandon the wells, decommission the pipelines and platforms, and clear the sites associated with its properties. We review the adequacy of Maritech&#8217;s decommissioning liabilities whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows underlying the liabilities have changed materially. The timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities being recorded. For a further discussion of Maritech&#8217;s adjustments to its decommissioning liabilities, see &#8220;Note H - Decommissioning and Other Asset Retirement Obligations&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

&#160; 

See &#8220;Note P - Industry Segments and Geographic Information&#8221; in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information about the Offshore Division. 

&#160; 

Sources of Raw Materials 

&#160; 

Our Fluids Division manufactures calcium chloride, calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide for sale to its customers. The Fluids Division also recycles used calcium bromide and zinc bromide CBFs repurchased from its oil and gas customers. 

&#160; 

The Fluids Division manufactures liquid calcium chloride, either from underground brine reserves or by reacting hydrochloric acid with limestone. The Fluids Division also purchases liquid and dry calcium chloride from a number of U.S. and foreign chemical manufacturers. Our El Dorado, Arkansas, plant produces liquid and flake calcium chloride, utilizing underground brine (tail brine) obtained from Chemtura Corporation ("Chemtura") that contains calcium chloride. We also produce calcium chloride at our two plants in San Bernardino County, California, by solar evaporation of pumped underground brine reserves that contain calcium chloride. The underground reserves of this brine are deemed adequate to supply our foreseeable need for calcium chloride at those plants. 

&#160; 

The Fluids Division's primary sources of hydrochloric acid are co-product streams obtained from chemical manufacturers. Substantial quantities of limestone are also consumed when converting hydrochloric acid into calcium chloride. Currently, hydrochloric acid and limestone are generally available from multiple sources. 

&#160; 

To produce calcium bromide, zinc bromide, zinc calcium bromide, and sodium bromide at our West Memphis, Arkansas, facility, we use bromine, hydrobromic acid, zinc, and lime as raw materials. There are multiple sources of zinc that we can use in the production of zinc bromide and zinc calcium bromide. We have a long-term supply agreement with Chemtura, under which the Fluids Division purchases its requirements of raw material bromine from Chemtura&#8217;s Arkansas bromine facilities. In addition, we have a long-term agreement with Chemtura under which Chemtura supplies the Fluids&#8217; El Dorado, Arkansas, calcium chloride plant with raw material tail brine from its Arkansas bromine production facilities. 

&#160; 

We also own a calcium bromide manufacturing plant near Magnolia, Arkansas, that was constructed in 1985. This plant was acquired in 1988 and is not operable. We currently lease approximately 33,000 gross acres of bromine-containing brine reserves in the vicinity of this plant. While this plant is designed to produce calcium bromide, it could be modified to produce elemental bromine or select bromine compounds. Development of the brine field, construction of necessary pipelines, and reconfiguration of the plant would require a substantial capital investment. The long-term Chemtura bromine supply agreement discussed above provides us with a secure supply of bromine to support the division&#8217;s current operations. We do, however, continue to evaluate our strategy related to the Magnolia, Arkansas, assets and their future development. Chemtura has certain rights to participate in future development of the Magnolia, Arkansas assets. 

&#160; 

The Fluids and Production Testing Divisions purchase their water management, production testing, and rig cooling equipment and components from third-party manufacturers. CCLP designs and fabricates its reciprocating 

and rotary screw compressor packages and pumps with components obtained from third party suppliers. These components represent a significant portion of the cost of the compressor packages and pump systems. Some of the components used in the assembly of compressor packages, well monitoring, sand separation, production testing, and rig cooling equipment are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. We do not have long-term contracts with these suppliers or manufacturers. Should we experience unavailability of the components we use to assemble our equipment, we believe that there are adequate alternative suppliers and that any impact to us would not be severe. CCLP occasionally experiences long-lead times for components from suppliers and, therefore, may at times make purchases in anticipation of future orders. 

Market Overview and Competition 

Our operations are significantly dependent upon the demand for, and production of, natural gas and oil in the various domestic and international locations in which we operate. Beginning in 2014 and continuing throughout 2015, the prices of natural gas and oil have dropped significantly. As a result, drilling activities and capital expenditure levels have declined in the domestic and international markets in which we operate. The decline in activity in the natural gas and oil exploration and production industry has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in a decline in demand for certain of our products and services. 

&#160; 

Fluids Division 

&#160; 

Our Fluids Division provides its products and services to oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States and certain foreign markets. Current areas of market presence include the onshore U.S., the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, Mexico, and certain countries in South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Customers with deepwater operations frequently utilize high volumes of CBFs, which can be subject to harsh downhole conditions, such as high pressure and high temperatures. Demand for CBF products offshore is generally driven by completion activity. 

&#160; 

During 2013 and 2014, a portion of the growth of the Fluids Division's U.S. operations has been due to increased industry demand for onshore water management services in unconventional shale gas and oil reservoirs. However, beginning in 2015, demand for certain Fluids Division products and services, particularly water management services, has been adversely affected by declining oil and natural gas pricing. The Fluids Division provides water management services to a wide-range of onshore oil and gas operators located in the most significant domestic shale gas and oil reservoirs, including the Bakken, Barnett, Cana Woodford, Eagle Ford, Fayetteville, Granite Wash, Haynesville, Marcellus, and Utica. 

&#160; 

Our Fluids Division&#8217;s principal competitors in the sale of CBFs to the oil and gas industry are Baker Hughes, Baroid, a subsidiary of Halliburton, and M-I Swaco, a subsidiary of Schlumberger. This market is highly competitive, and competition is based primarily on service, availability, and price. Major customers of the Fluids Division include Al Ghaith, Anadarko, BHP Billiton, Chesapeake, Devon, ENI Petroleum, ExxonMobil, LLOG Exploration, Saudi ARAMCO, Shell, Southwestern Energy, Tullow, TOTAL, and Whistler Energy. The Fluids Division also sells its CBF products through various distributors. Competitors for the division&#8217;s water management services include large, multinational providers as well as small, privately owned operators. 

&#160; 

Our liquid and dry calcium chloride products have a wide range of uses outside the energy industry. Non-energy market segments where these products are used include water treatment, industrial, food processing, road maintenance, ice melt, agricultural, and consumer products. We also sell sodium bromide into industrial water treatment markets as a biocide under the BioRid &#174; &#32;tradename. Most of these markets are highly competitive. The Fluids Division&#8217;s European calcium chloride operations market our calcium chloride products to certain European markets. Our principal competitors in the non-energy related calcium chloride markets include Occidental Chemical Corporation and Vitro in North America, and NedMag in Europe. 

&#160; 

Production Testing Division 

&#160; 

In certain gas producing basins, water, sand, and other abrasive materials commonly accompany the initial production of natural gas, often under high pressure and high temperature conditions and, in some cases, from reservoirs containing high levels of hydrogen sulfide gas. The division provides the specialized equipment and qualified personnel to address these impediments to production. The Production Testing Division also provides certain services designed to accommodate the unique frac flowback and testing demands of shale gas reservoirs. Through Greywolf, the division serves the western Canada market. In addition, the Production Testing Division 

continues to serve the continuing demand for services associated with many of the domestic shale gas reservoirs, including the Bakken, Barnett, Cana Woodford, Eagle Ford, Fayetteville, Haynesville, Marcellus, and Niobrara. In addition, through our OPTIMA subsidiary, the Production Testing Division offers offshore oil and gas rig cooling services and associated products that suppress heat generated by high-rate flaring of hydrocarbons during offshore well testing operations. OPTIMA primarily serves markets in the North Sea, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and South America. 

The U.S. and Canadian production testing markets are highly competitive, and competition is based on availability of appropriate equipment and qualified personnel, as well as price, quality of service, and safety record. We believe that our skilled personnel, operating procedures, and safety record give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The Production Testing Division plans to continue growing its foreign operations in order to serve major oil and gas markets worldwide, both organically and through additional strategic acquisitions. Competition in onshore U.S. production testing markets is primarily dominated by numerous small, privately owned operators. Expro International, Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Weatherford are major competitors in the foreign markets we serve. The major customers for this division include Apache, Cabot, Carrizo Oil and Gas, Chevron, COG Operating, ConocoPhillips, Consol Energy, Devon, Eclipse Resources, Encana, EOG Resources, EP Energy, Halliburton, HESS, Peak Energy, Peyto, Rice Energy, Saudi Aramco, Schlumberger, Shell, and TAQ Operating Company. 

&#160;

The Compression Division provides its products and services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, pipeline transmission, and storage companies, operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States. The Compression Division also has operations in Latin America and other foreign regions. While most of the Compression Division's services are performed throughout Texas, the San Juan Basin, the Rocky Mountain region, and the Midcontinent region of the United States, we also have a presence in other U.S. producing regions. The Compression Division continues to seek opportunities to further expand its operations into other regions in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. 

The division&#8217;s strategy is to compete on the basis of superior services at a competitive price. The Compression Division believes that it is competitive because of the significant increases in the value that results from the use of its services, its superior customer service, its highly trained field personnel, and the quality of the compressor packages it uses to provide services. The Compression Division&#8217;s major customers include Atlas Pipeline Mid-Continent, BP America Production Company, Cimarex Energy, ConocoPhillips, DCP Midstream, and Noble Energy. 

The compression services and compressor package fabrication business is highly competitive. The Compression Division experiences competition from companies that may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of available opportunities, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Primary competition for our low-horsepower compression services business comes from various local and regional companies that utilize packages consisting of a screw compressor with a separate engine driver or a reciprocating compressor with a separate engine driver. These local and regional competitors tend to compete with us on the basis of price as opposed to our focus on providing production enhancement value to the customer. Competition for the mid- and high-horsepower compression services business comes primarily from large national and multinational companies who may have greater financial resources than ours. Such competitors include ArchRock (formerly a part of Exterran), AXIP Energy Services, CDM Resource Management, Exterran, J-W Power, and USA Compression. Our competition in the standard compressor package fabrication and sales market includes several large companies and a large number of small, regional fabricators, including some of those who we compete with for compression services, as well as AG Equipment Company, SEC Energy Products &#38; Services, Enerflex, and others. The Compression Division's competition in the custom-designed market usually consists of larger companies with the ability to provide integrated projects and product support after the sale, including some of the competitors noted above. The ability to fabricate these large custom-designed packages at the Compression Division's facilities near the point of end-use of many customers is often a competitive advantage. 

Offshore Division 

&#160; 

Offshore Services Segment . Demand for the Offshore Services segment&#8217;s offshore well abandonment and decommissioning services in the Gulf of Mexico is primarily driven by the maturity and decline of producing fields, aging offshore platform infrastructure, damage to platforms and pipelines from hurricanes and other windstorms, 

and government regulations, among other factors. Demand for the Offshore Services segment&#8217;s construction and other services is driven by the general level of offshore activity of its customers, which is affected by oil and natural gas prices and government regulation. We believe that the enforcement of government regulations, including the Idle Iron Guidance, may accelerate the pace at which offshore Gulf of Mexico abandonment and decommissioning will be done in the future. 

&#160; 

Offshore activities in the Gulf of Mexico are seasonal, with the majority of work occurring during the months of April through October when weather conditions are most favorable. Critical factors required to compete in this market include, among other factors: (i) the proper equipment, including vessels and heavy lift barges; (ii) qualified, experienced personnel; (iii) technical expertise to address varying downhole, surface, and subsea conditions, particularly those related to damaged wells and platforms; and (iv) a comprehensive health, safety, and environmental program. Our Offshore Services segment's fleet of owned equipment includes two heavy lift derrick barges, the TETRA Hedron, which has a 1,600-metric-ton lift capacity, fully revolving crane, and the TETRA Arapaho, which has a 725-metric-ton lift capacity. We believe that the integrated services that we offer and our vessel and equipment fleets satisfy current market requirements in the Gulf of Mexico and allow us to successfully compete in that market. 

&#160; 

The Offshore Services segment markets its services primarily to major oil and gas companies and independent operators. One of the Offshore Services segment&#8217;s most significant customer during the past three years has been Maritech; however, the amount of work performed for Maritech has been reduced and the amount of work to be performed in the future for Maritech is expected to continue to decline. Other major customers include Chevron, Fieldwood Energy, Shell, Stone Energy, and W&#38;T Offshore. The Offshore Services segment&#8217;s services are performed primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, however, the segment is also seeking to expand its operations to international markets. Our principal competitors in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico market are Bisso, Express Energy, Harkand, Oceaneering, Offshore Specialty Fabricators, Inc., and Superior Energy Services, Inc. This market is highly competitive, and competition is based primarily on service, equipment availability, safety record, and price. 

Other Business Matters 

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160; 

The Fluids Division markets its CBF products through its distribution facilities located in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, the North Sea region of Europe, and certain other foreign markets, including Brazil, West Africa, and the Middle East. 

&#160; 

Non-oilfield calcium chloride products are also marketed through the Fluids Division&#8217; sales offices in California, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Texas, as well as through a network of distributors in the United States and northern and central Europe. In addition to production facilities in the United States and Finland, the division has distribution facilities strategically located to provide efficient product distribution. 

&#160; 

No single customer provided 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues during the year ended December 31, 2015. 

&#160; 

Backlog 

&#160; 

The Compression Division&#8217;s equipment and parts sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages, and oilfield fluid pump systems that are fabricated to customer specifications and standard specifications, as applicable. The Division's custom designed compressor packages are typically greater in size and scope than standard fabrication packages, requiring more labor, materials, and overhead resources. The fabrication and sales business requires diligent planning of those resources and project and backlog management in order to meet the customer's desired delivery dates and performance criteria, and achieve fabrication efficiencies. As of December 31, 2015, the Compression Division's fabrication and sales backlog was approximately $33.6 million, all of which is expected to be recognized through the year ended December 31, 2016. This fabrication and sales backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase or work order has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist, and delivery has been scheduled. Our fabrication and sales backlog is a measure of marketing effectiveness that allows us to plan future labor and raw material needs and to measure our success in winning bids from our customers. Excluding these Compression Division operations, our products and services either are not sold under long-term contracts or do not require long lead times to procure or deliver. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 3,000 employees. None of our U.S. employees are presently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Our foreign employees are generally members of labor unions and associations in the countries in which we operate. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 

&#160; 

Patents, Proprietary Technology and Trademarks 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we owned or licensed forty-four (44) issued U.S. patents and had twenty (20) patent applications pending in the United States. We also had forty-one (41) owned or licensed foreign patents and thirty-two (32) foreign patent applications pending in various other countries. The foreign patents and patent applications are primarily foreign counterparts to U.S. patents or patent applications. The issued patents expire at various times through 2032. We have elected to maintain certain other internally developed technologies, know-how, and inventions as trade secrets. While we believe that our patents and trade secrets are important to our competitive positions in our businesses, we do not believe any one patent or trade secret is essential to our success. 

&#160; 

It is our practice to enter into confidentiality agreements with key employees, consultants, and third parties to whom we disclose our confidential and proprietary information, and we have typical policies and procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of such information. There can be no assurance, however, that these measures will prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets and expertise, or that others may not independently develop similar trade secrets or expertise. 

&#160; 

We sell various products and services under a variety of trademarks and service marks, some of which are registered in the United States or other countries. 

&#160; 

Health, Safety, and Environmental Affairs Regulations 

&#160; 

We believe that our service and sales operations and manufacturing plants are in substantial compliance with all applicable U.S. and foreign health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations. We are committed to conducting all of our operations under the highest standards of safety and respect for the environment. However, risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in certain of our operations and in the development and handling of certain products and equipment produced or used at our plants, well locations, and worksites. Because of these risks, there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the future. Changes in environmental and health and safety regulations could subject us to more rigorous standards. We cannot predict the extent to which our operations may be affected by future regulatory and enforcement policies. 

We are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to health, safety, and the environment, including regulations regarding air emissions, wastewater and storm water discharges, and the disposal of certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. Compliance with laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities, and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or associated permits may result in the assessment of fines and penalties and the imposition of other obligations. 

&#160; 

Our operations in the United States are subject to various evolving environmental laws and regulations that are enforced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"); the BSEE of the U.S. Department of the Interior; the U.S. Coast Guard; and various other federal, state, and local environmental authorities. Similar laws and regulations, designed to protect the health and safety of our employees and visitors to our facilities, are enforced by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other state and local agencies and authorities. Specific environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations include: (i) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972; (ii) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976; (iii) the Clean Air Act of 1977; (iv) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"); (v) the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986; (vi) the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947; (vii) the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976; (viii) the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975; (ix) and the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. Our operations outside the United States are subject to various foreign governmental laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, and other regulated activities in the countries in which we operate. 

&#160; 

&#160; The EPA has determined that greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, because, according to the EPA, they contribute to global warming and climate change. As a result, the EPA has begun to regulate certain sources of greenhouse gases, including air emissions associated with oil and gas production, particularly as they relate to the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas wells. In addition, the EPA has issued regulations requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain sources which include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and gas processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. Reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from such facilities is required on an annual basis. The EPA&#8217;s rules relating to emissions of greenhouse gases from large, stationary sources of emissions are currently subject to a number of legal challenges, but the federal courts have thus far declined to issue any injunctions to prevent the EPA or state environmental agencies from implementing the rules. Further, Congress has considered, and almost one-half of the states have adopted, legislation that seeks to control or reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from a wide-range of sources. 

Offshore Operations 

&#160; 

During the past four years, several Notices to Lessees ("NTLs"), Safety and Environmental Management Systems ("SEMS") regulations, and other safety regulations implementing additional safety and certification requirements applicable to offshore activities in the Gulf of Mexico were issued. These NTLs and SEMS regulations include requirements by operators to: 

&#8226; 

submit well blowout prevention measures and contingency plans, including demonstrating access to subsea blowout containment resources; 

&#8226; 

abide by new permitting standards requiring detailed, independently certified descriptions of well design, casing, and cementing; 

&#8226; 

follow new performance-based standards for offshore drilling and production operations 

&#8226; 

enhance the safety of operations by reducing the frequency and severity of accidents; and 

&#8226; 

certify that the operator has complied with all regulations. 

&#160; 

&#32;The &#8220;Idle Iron Guidance&#8221; regulations, which were adopted in 2010 and govern the plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning of U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore wells and production platforms, are overseen by BSEE. This agency's scope of responsibility includes maintaining an investigation and review unit, providing for public forums, conducting comprehensive environmental analyses, and creating implementation teams to analyze various aspects of the regulatory structure and to help implement the reform agenda. 

&#160; 

We maintain various types of insurance intended to reimburse certain costs in the event of an explosion or similar event involving our offshore operations. Our insurance program is reviewed not less than annually with our insurance brokers and underwriters. As part of our insurance program for offshore operations, we maintain general liability and protection and indemnity policies that provide third-party liability coverage, up to applicable policy limits, for risks of an accidental nature, including but not limited to death and personal injury, collision, damage to fixed and floating objects, pollution, and wreck removal. We also maintain a vessel pollution liability policy that provides coverage for oil or hazardous substance pollution emanating from a vessel, addressing both Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA") and CERCLA obligations. This policy also provides coverage for cost of defense, fines, and penalties. 

&#160; 

We provide services and products to customers in the Gulf of Mexico, generally pursuant to written master services agreements that create insurance and indemnity obligations for both parties. If there was an explosion or similar catastrophic event on an offshore location where we are providing services and products, under the majority of our master services agreements with our customers: 

&#160; 

(1) 

We would be required to indemnify our customer for any claims for injury, death, or property loss or destruction made against them by us or our subcontractors or our subcontractor&#8217;s employees. The customer would be required to indemnify us for any claims for injury, death, or property loss or destruction made against us by the customer or its other subcontractors or the employees of the customer or its other subcontractors. These indemnities are intended to apply regardless of the cause of such claims, including but not limited to, the negligence of the indemnified party. Our insurance is structured to cover the cost of defense and any resulting liability from all indemnified claims, up to policy limits. 

&#160; 

(2) 

The customer would be required to indemnify us for all claims for injury, death, or property loss or destruction made against us by a third party that arise out of the catastrophic event, regardless of the cause of such claims, including but not limited to, our negligence or our subcontractors&#8217; negligence. Our insurance is structured to cover the cost of defense and any resulting liability from all such claims; however, our insurance would be applicable to the claim only if the customer defaulted or otherwise breached its indemnity obligations to us. 

&#160; 

(3) 

The customer would be required to indemnify us for all claims made against us for environmental pollution or contamination that arise out of the catastrophic event, regardless of the cause of such claims, including our negligence or the negligence of our subcontractors. Our insurance is structured to cover the cost of defense and any resulting liability from all such claims; however, our insurance would be applicable to the claim only if the customer defaulted or otherwise breached its indemnity obligations to us. 

Following the 2011 and 2012 sales of substantially all of Maritech&#8217;s offshore producing properties, we no longer participate in offshore drilling activities. However, Maritech and our Offshore Services segment engage contractors to provide well abandonment and related services and products on Maritech&#8217;s remaining offshore oil and gas production platforms and associated wells, generally pursuant to written master services agreements that create insurance and indemnity obligations for both parties. If there was an environmental event on an offshore Maritech location where a Maritech contractor was providing services and products, under a majority of Maritech&#8217;s master services agreements with its contractors, Maritech would be required to indemnify its contractor for any claims against the contractor for injury, death, or property loss or destruction brought by Maritech, its other subcontractors, or its or their respective employees. The contractor would be required to indemnify Maritech for any claims for injury, death, or property loss or destruction made against Maritech by the contractor or its subcontractors or the employees of the contractor or its subcontractors. These indemnities would apply regardless of the cause of such claims, including the negligence of the indemnified party. Maritech&#8217;s insurance is structured to cover the cost of defense and any resulting liability from all indemnified claims, up to policy limits. 

&#160; 

In accordance with applicable regulations, Maritech maintains an oil spill response plan with the BSEE and has designated contractors who are trained as qualified individuals and are prepared to coordinate a response to any spill or leak. Maritech also has contracts in place to assure that a complete and experienced resource team is available as required.
