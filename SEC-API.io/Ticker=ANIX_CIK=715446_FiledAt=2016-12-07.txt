 Item 1. Business. &#160; 

Overview &#160; 

&#160;

We were incorporated on November 5, 1982 under the laws of the State of Delaware. From inception through October 2012, our primary operations involved the development of patented technologies in the areas of thin-film displays and encryption. Beginning in October of 2012 under the leadership of a new management team, we recapitalized the Company, unencumbered the Company&#146;s assets, changed the Company&#146;s name and ticker symbol, relocated the Company&#146;s headquarters, and modernized its systems. In July of 2015, the Company&#146;s stock was accepted for listing and began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market. 

&#160;

In June of 2015, the Company announced the formation of a new subsidiary, Anixa Diagnostics Corporation (&#147;Anixa&#148;), to develop a platform for non-invasive blood tests for the early detection of cancer. That platform is called Cchek &#212; . In July of 2015, ITUS announced a collaborative research agreement with The Wistar Institute (&#147;Wistar&#148;), the nation&#146;s first independent biomedical research institute and a leading National Cancer Institute designated cancer research center, for the purpose of validating our cancer detection methodologies and establishing protocols for identifying certain biomarkers in the blood which we identified and which are known to be associated with malignancies. In August of 2016 ITUS announced the renewal and expansion of our relationship with Wistar. 

2 &#160;

&#160;

In October of 2015, ITUS and Wistar announced favorable results from initial testing of a small group of Breast Cancer patients and healthy controls. One hundred percent (100%) of the blood samples tested from patients with varying stages of breast cancer showed the presence of the biomarkers we identified, and none of the healthy patient blood samples contained the biomarkers. Breast Cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States and throughout the world. 

In April of 2016, ITUS announced that we had demonstrated the efficacy of our Cchek &#212; early cancer detection platform with Lung Cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death among cancers in the U.S. and throughout the world, accounting for approximately 27% of all cancer related deaths in the U.S. and 19% worldwide. In September of 2016, ITUS announced that we had demonstrated the efficacy of our Cchek &#212; early cancer detection platform with Colon Cancer. Colon Cancer is the third most common cancer in men and the second most common cancer in woman worldwide, with approximately 1.4 million new cases diagnosed each year, and approximately 700,000 deaths. At the end of September 2016 through the end of October 2016, the Company made similar announcements with respect to the efficacy of our Cchek &#212; early cancer detection platform for Melanoma, Ovarian Cancer, Liver Cancer, Thyroid Cancer, and Pancreatic Cancer. On November 15, 2016, ITUS announced that we had demonstrated the efficacy of our Cchek &#212; early cancer detection platform with six additional cancer types including Appendiceal Cancer (cancer of the appendix), Uterine Cancer, Osteosarcoma (cancer of the bone), Leiomyosarcoma (cancer of the soft tissue), Liposarcoma (cancer of the connective tissue), and Vulvar Cancer (cancer of the vulva), bringing the number of cancer types for which the efficacy of Cchek &#212; has been validated thus far to fourteen. 

Our Cchek &#212; cancer detection platform measures a patient's immune response to a malignancy by detecting the presence, absence, and quantity of certain immune cells that exist in and around a tumor and that enter the blood stream. These types of cells and the tumor micro-environment have been the focus of recent ground breaking published and reported research in immuno-oncology, enabling the development of revolutionary immunotherapies used for treating certain cancer types. Instead of seeking to alter or boost the body's immune system and its ability to destroy cancer cells, as is the case with immunotherapy drugs, we have developed proprietary techniques and protocols for measuring the subtle immunological changes that occur in the blood stream during tumor development. Specifically, we seek to identify a subset of myeloid cells that we believe are diagnostic. These cells, often referred to as Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), are identified by specific surface proteins enabling characterization. We generally refer to MDSC&#146;s and other cells of the immune system which we believe can be diagnostic in nature as biomarkers. Through our proprietary protocols, we have had early success and have demonstrated accuracy in detecting these biomarkers in the peripheral blood of biopsy verified cancer patients, and in distinguishing the blood of healthy patients from the blood of cancer patients. The goal is to establish Cchek&#153; as a non-invasive, inexpensive, cancer diagnostic blood test that can reduce or eliminate the need for traditionally expensive, invasive, painful, and often inaccurate cancer diagnostic procedures which are currently in use. 

3 &#160;

&#160;

In each instance where ITUS has demonstrated the efficacy of its cancer detection platform, fresh (utilized within 48 hours) blood samples from biopsy verified cancer patients have been tested at Wistar using a variety of experimental methodologies and protocols. Such un-blinded, non-uniform testing is common during the initial development stage of new technologies and diagnostic tests. Blood samples from patients with differing severities of cancers (with some cancers such as Breast Cancer stage 0 to stage 4) have been tested, including samples from both pre-treatment and post-treatment patients. In addition, Wistar has also tested blood from healthy donors. A critical aspect of any cancer diagnostic is the ability to accurately distinguish patients with cancer from healthy patients. Based upon our encouraging early results, our scientists are working with Wistar to finalize protocols and methodologies for identifying and classifying the immunologic biomarkers that are the foundation for our Cchek &#212; early cancer detection platform. Although our scientists, working in collaboration with Wistar, will continue to improve our processes and methodologies to achieve maximum performance, we expect our testing to become more uniform over time, and to eventually test patient samples in a double blinded manner. While studies comparing biopsy verified cancer patients have been compared to healthy donors, we have not yet evaluated benign conditions such as non-malignant neoplasias, systemic inflammatory conditions, infections, and other potential conditions that impact or may impact the immune system. Such testing will be necessary for regulatory approval. 

Based upon and following the results of the more extensive clinical study, we will determine what further studies are necessary and whether and when to begin the process of seeking regulatory approval for a cancer screening test or confirmatory diagnostic test based upon our Cchek &#212; technology. One manner of seeking regulatory approval is to have a lab certified to run our cancer tests pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1988 (&#147;CLIA&#148;). Among other things, CLIA requires clinical laboratories that perform diagnostic testing to be certified by the state in which the lab is located, as well as the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. If we seek regulatory approval pursuant to CLIA, only those laboratories that are certified under CLIA to run our diagnostic test would be able to process test samples. CLIA certification may or may not require additional studies. We could seek to establish our own CLIA certified laboratory to run the diagnostic tests, or we could potentially contract with an existing CLIA certified lab, and seek to have that laboratory certified to run our diagnostic test. 

&#160;

Another manner of obtaining regulatory approval would be to seek to have Cchek&#153; approved by The Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) pursuant to what are commonly referred to as either the 510(K) process, or the Premarket Application (&#147;PMA&#148;) process. The appropriate pathway for FDA approval would depend upon a variety of factors, including the intended use of the test, and the risks associated with such use. FDA approval can take several years and would entail additional clinical studies. 

&#160;

The decision of whether and when to seek CLIA certification or FDA approval of a diagnostic test or tests utilizing our Cchek &#212; technology will be dependent on a variety of factors, including the results from more extensive clinical studies, the capital requirements of each approval process, the landscape for competitive diagnostic testing, and the time and resources required by each approval process. It is possible that we may seek to have one or more diagnostic tests approved via CLIA certification, and other diagnostic test or tests approved by the FDA, or that we may seek simultaneous FDA approval and CLIA certification of a particular diagnostic test or tests.

&#160;

&#160;

Over the next several quarters, we expect Cchek&#153; to be the primary focus of the Company. As part of our legacy operations, the Company remains engaged in limited patent licensing activities in the area of encrypted audio/video conference calling. We do not expect these activities to be a significant part of the Company&#146;s ongoing operations. 

&#160;

Over the past several quarters, our revenue has been derived from technology licensing and the sale of patented technologies, including in connection with the settlement of litigation. In addition to Anixa, the Company may make investments in and form new companies to develop additional emerging technologies. 

&#160;

Preliminary Biomarker Results 

&#160; 

&#160; On December 7, 2016 we announced the preliminary results from our Cchek &#212; cancer patient efficacy study. Using our most recent protocols and methods for measuring a patients&#146; immunological response to a malignancy, the Company achieved Sensitivity of 92% and Specificity of 92% for 88 patient samples, including 54 samples from patients with multiple types and severities of cancer, and 34 healthy patients. During the initial phase of the study, which involved multiple experimental protocols and techniques for measuring immunological responses, the Company reviewed and analyzed data from a total of 315 patient samples, including 228 patients with varying stages of cancer, as well as blood samples from 87 healthy donors. 

&#160;

&#160; Patient samples representing 14 different types of cancer including Breast Cancer, Lung Cancer, Colon Cancer, Melanoma, Ovarian Cancer, Liver Cancer, Thyroid Cancer, Pancreatic Cancer, Appendiceal Cancer (cancer of the appendix), Uterine Cancer, Osteosarcoma (cancer of the bone), Leiomyosarcoma (cancer of the soft tissue), Liposarcoma (cancer of the connective tissue), and Vulvar Cancer (cancer of the Vulva) were included in the study. The study included samples from patients with early and late stage, biopsy-verified, drug-na&#239;ve (before therapy) tumors, as well as biopsy-verified, refractory (unresponsive to attempted chemotherapy) tumors. 

&#160;

&#160; Sensitivity and specificity are scientific measurements commonly used to determine the accuracy of a diagnostic test, where sensitivity measures how good a test is at identifying people with a particular disease, and specificity measures how good a test is at identifying people without the disease. Although published results vary widely, established diagnostic tests such as Low Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) , which is used by other companies to screen for Lung Cancer, has sensitivity of approximately 93% and specificity of approximately 73%, the Prostate Specific Antigen (&#147;PSA&#148;) test, which is used by other companies to screen for prostate cancer, has sensitivity of approximately 21% and specificity of approximately 91%, and Mammography, used by other companies to screen for breast cancer and considered to be the &#147;gold standard&#148; for breast cancer screening, has reported sensitivity as low as approximately 68% and specificity as low as approximately 75%. As these results indicate, current diagnostic testing is hampered by low sensitivity, low specificity or both, meaning that the tests miss a substantial portion of the cancers they are supposed to detect, or miss-diagnose a large number of healthy patients as having cancer. There is currently no inexpensive, non-invasive, diagnostic test that excels in both sensitivity and specificity. Our preliminary results, while extremely promising, will have to be confirmed in blinded clinical studies of sufficient size before we can seek marketing approval for Cchek &#212; from the FDA. 

&#160;

&#160; Initial samples in our study were tested utilizing immunostaining and fluorescent microscopic imaging. While results were promising, subjectivity in interpreting the imaging results together with labor intensive and time consuming sample processing hampered the commercial viability of this approach. Subsequently, patient samples were analyzed using flow cytometry, enabling more efficient processing and analysis. In addition, ITUS is developing a software application using a proprietary neural network, which currently relies on up to 13 quantitative parameters to analyze test results. This approach, which is highly data intensive and requires substantial computer processing power to develop, results in a test which can be performed using a desktop computer. An initial version of our neural network, which was trained to distinguish between the immunological responses from cancer patients and healthy patients, was responsible for the sensitivity and specificity results reported above. The Company expects to continue to improve its protocols, continue to upgrade its neural network-software by increasing the number of patient samples used to train the software and expanding the range of markers, increasing the data resolution, and enhancing the architecture of the software, which may enable better results. 

&#160;

&#160; Related to our collaborative research agreement, the Company and/or Wistar currently have collaborations with doctors from University of Pennsylvania Abramson Cancer Center, The Helen F. Graham Cancer Center and Research Institute at Christiana Hospital in Wilmington, Delaware, and Virtua Health System in southern New Jersey. In most cases, patients from participating doctors at these healthcare institutions who are beginning or in some cases, continuing cancer treatment are asked to consent to have an additional tube of blood drawn for the purpose of participating in the Cchek &#212; patients efficacy trials. Because the number of cancer patients treated by these hospitals varies over time, and the decision whether to participate in the Cchek &#212; patient studies is ultimately at the discretion of the patient, it is difficult to predict the number of patient samples that we will receive in any given week, or during any given month. ITUS is currently in discussions with additional doctors and healthcare providers about providing blood samples for our patient efficacy trials, and the Company has capacity available to process an additional quantity of samples. With the addition of these new sources of patient samples, the Company expects to process enough samples and generate enough data to begin its regulatory discussions in the next 6 to 12 month period. 

&#160;

The Market 

&#160;

&#160; There are four primary markets for a cancer diagnostic test: screening, confirmatory testing, treatment monitoring, and recurrence testing. 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Screening occurs when asymptomatic people are tested for indications of cancer. Examples of existing screening tests include the mammogram for Breast Cancer, Low Dose Tomography testing for Lung Cancer, and colonoscopy for Colon Cancer. All screening tests have their strengths and weaknesses, and for many cancers there are currently no recommended screening tests available. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Confirmatory testing is used to confirm the results of a screening test. In certain instances, existing confirmatory testing can be invasive, painful, expensive, and have relatively high risks of complications. For example, a positive mammogram is often followed up with additional imaging, which can lead to a biopsy during which a needle is inserted into the breast to sample suspicious tissue or lesions. For Lung Cancer, existing confirmatory diagnostics include bronchoscopies, during which a flexible tube is inserted through the nose or mouth and into the lung, and needle biopsies, during which a long needle is inserted between the ribs and into the lung. One potential side effect a lung biopsy is a pneumothorax (commonly referred to as a &#147;collapsed lung&#148;), which has been reported to occur in approximately fifteen percent (15%) of needle biopsies of the lung. A pneumothorax can lead to other complications and sometimes requires extended hospitalization. In addition to the potential side effects, biopsies of any sort can be extremely painful for the patient. 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Treatment monitoring includes follow-on testing to monitor the effectiveness of a specific regimen of treatment. For example, diagnostic monitoring testing may be used to monitor the effectiveness of a particular type of chemotherapy, to determine how the cancer is responding and whether such treatment should be continued. 

&#160;

&#183; &#160; Finally, recurrence diagnostic testing is used for cancer survivors to test for cancer recurrence. According to statistics published by the American Cancer Society, there are currently approximately fifteen million cancer survivors in the U.S., sixty-seven (67%) of which were diagnosed with cancer five or more years ago. Most cancer survivors live in fear of recurrence, and limitations of existing diagnostics, including repeated exposure to radiation from imaging tests, and invasiveness and costs and pain from tests such as traditional biopsies, prevent cancer survivors from being tested as often as they would like. 

&#160;

ITUS&#146;s long term vision is to have one or more tests based upon the Cchek &#212; platform to serve each of the markets identified above. At this stage, it is most likely that Cchek &#212; will begin as a confirmatory diagnostic test for one particular type of cancer, but our strategy for entering the market place will not be finalized until we have completed our developmental testing and analyzed all of our preliminary data. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

Background 

&#160;

Continuing scientific advances and discoveries, the ability to more quickly process and analyze large amounts of scientific data, and decreases in the cost of sophisticated equipment and technologies, have resulted in the potential for significant advances in cancer treatment, and in particular, cancer diagnostics. Cancer statistics gathered over the past several decades provide overwhelming evidence that the earlier that cancers are detected, the greater the survival rates. Up until now, doctors have primarily relied upon technologies such as imaging (x-rays, mammograms, CT Scans, MRI&#146;s, PET Scans, Ultrasounds) and biopsies and other invasive procedures for cancer detection and cancer diagnoses. In many cases, these diagnostic procedures were performed after patients exhibited one or more symptoms of cancer, at which point the cancer may likely no longer be at an early stage. Existing diagnostic technologies such as imaging have gotten better, and invasive diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopies have become more accurate and less risky, and we expect these types of traditional diagnostic tools to continue to predominate the cancer diagnostic market for the foreseeable future. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

We believe that with advancing medical knowledge, improvements in equipment and technologies, and reduction in costs of new technologies, new types of cancer diagnostics will be created and new types of cancer diagnostic testing that will outperform many of the traditional diagnostic tests, eliminate many of the negative consequences of existing diagnostic testing, and ultimately predominate the cancer diagnostic market. 

&#160;

We have identified a class and subclasses of biomarkers that we believe are present in the blood of patients with malignancies, and are perfecting a process and methodology for detecting those biomarkers. The goal is to create a platform, Cchek &#212; , that can be used to launch a series of simple and affordable blood tests that can be used to detect and monitor many of the most deadly forms of cancer, including lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and others. It is unlikely that the Company will initially simultaneously launch tests for each of the cancers identified above, and that specific and individual cancer tests for each of the four markets identified above (screening, confirmatory testing, treatment monitoring, recurrence) will be launched over time. 

&#160;

Statistics from The American Cancer Society indicate that one out of every two males, and one out of every three females that are born today, will develop some form of cancer during their lifetimes. With approximately 200 million adults in the United States alone, we believe that the market for new, non-invasive cancer diagnostic technologies and testing will be enormous, and that there will be sufficient demand to support many different technologies and tests. 

&#160;

Cancer Diagnostic Technologies 

&#160;

If successful, we believe Cchek &#212; will have several advantages over existing diagnostic technologies. For example, repeated exposure to radiation from x-ray technologies, such as mammograms, has become an increasing concern for the medical community, causing authorities to re-evaluate the recommended frequency of such x-ray based tests. Traditional biopsies are often impossible for some tumor based cancers depending on the location of the tumor, and are invasive, expensive, and painful enough to warrant only limited use for other cancers even when the tumor can be accessed. In addition, such biopsies are limited in their inability to detect the heterogeneity of many cancerous tumors, and the ongoing mutations that are often evident as the tumor progresses. False positives in existing testing such as the PSA test, result in otherwise healthy patients being misdiagnosed, and subject to unnecessary follow-on treatments and medical procedures. Patient inconvenience, risk of side effects from anesthesia, and risk of other complications result in low patient compliance with otherwise effective cancer screening tests such as the colonoscopy. These are just a few examples of the challenges with traditional diagnostic tests that we seek to eliminate with Cchek &#212; . This will be the foundation for the competitive advantages that we expect to have over existing diagnostic testing. We expect Cchek &#212; will be utilized as a component of multiple diagnostic technologies and patient background information to diagnose and manage the patient&#146;s condition. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160;

Many public and private companies have announced plans and ongoing research efforts to launch non-invasive cancer diagnostic tests and tools that can be used for non-invasive cancer testing. These companies include well established, and successful biotech companies, start-ups, and companies of all sizes. Almost every bodily fluid, including blood, plasma, urine, saliva, and excrement, are being studied for biomarkers or indicators of one or more types of cancer. The term that has been used to describe the category of this type of non-invasive cancer diagnostic testing is &#147;Liquid Biopsy&#148;. In general, most of these companies are focused on identifying and analyzing one of three types of biomarkers: circulating tumor cells (&#147;CTC&#146;s&#148;), circulating tumor DNA (&#147;ctDNA&#148;), and Exosomes. Each of these types of biomarkers has their advantages and disadvantages, and we expect that tests incorporating these and other biomarkers will make their way into the cancer diagnostic marketplace. 

&#160;

ITUS believes that its Cchek &#212; diagnostic platform has the potential for at least three distinct advantages over the types of biomarker tests referred to above. First, it appears that the biomarkers that we are using may be present in multiple types of and varying severities of cancers. As a result, we anticipate that Cchek &#212; will become a platform from which multiple tests could be launched for multiple types of cancers. Most biomarkers are associated with and useful for only one type or sub-type of cancer. Second, it appears that the biomarkers utilized by Cchek &#212; may be present in both advanced, and early stages of cancers. Third, we expect Cchek &#212; to be significantly less expensive than the technologies commonly used for tests based on CTC&#146;s, ctDNA, and Exosomes.
