 ITEM 1. BUSINESS. 

GENERAL 

&#160;

We were incorporated as Plandel Resources, Inc. under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 19, 2010. On March 24, 2014, we changed our name to Sports Asylum, Inc. and on September 30, 2014, we changed our name to Cell MedX Corp. to reflect our new business direction. 

&#160; 

On November 25, 2014, we completed the acquisition of a proprietary method for the application of bioelectric signaling to treat diabetes and related ailments (the &#8220;eBalance Technology&#8221;). With our acquisition of the eBalance Technology, we have shifted our business direction to the discovery, development and commercialization of therapeutic products for patients with diseases such as diabetes by developing technologies to help manage the illness and related complications. 

On November 26, 2014, we formed a subsidiary, Avyonce Cosmedics Inc., (the &#8220;Avyonce&#8221;) under the laws of the Province of British Columbia. Avyonce&#8217;s main business activity is channelled towards the resale and marketing of spa technology and equipment to the worldwide beauty and wellness industry. Avyonce is also instrumental in carrying out the observational studies using eBalance Technology. 

On April 26, 2016, we formed a subsidiary, Cell MedX (Canada) Corp., (the &#8220;Cell MedX Canada&#8221;) under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, in anticipation of increased business activity in Canada. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K this subsidiary remained dormant.

&#160;

eBalance Technology 

&#160;

eBalance Technology is based on the science of bioelectric signals, their affect on epigenetic events within human body, and ability to modify and affect the behavior of cells, tissue, and organs. Based on this technology Cell MedX is developing a radically different and very promising family of devices whose core technology demarcates it from the approaches currently in use and those in the &#8220;future advances&#8221; pipeline as reflected in current medical literature. 

&#160;

Microcurrent delivery devices used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and poor wound healing in diabetics have been in the marketplace for decades. However, the eBalance Technology can be distinguished from those devices, which have a limited utility and are not designed to treat diabetes at its core &#8211; the underlying metabolic disorder that leads to hyperglycemia and its sequelae. It is hoped that devices incorporating the eBalance Technology will effect changes much further &#8220;upstream&#8221; in the pathophysiology or natural history of diabetes. Not a &#8220;me too&#8221; device, nor an incremental improvement in an established realm, devices based on the eBalance Technology could, if proven through diligent research and development, open a new category of diabetes care. 

&#160;

The eBalance Technology is intended to expand the traditional healthcare model of diabetes management by enabling patients to manage their symptoms using a biosignal generating device that is simple to use, causes no discomfort, and can easily be incorporated into any lifestyle. 

&#160;

It is expected that the eBalance &#160; Technology, currently in the research and development stage, will form the basis for a product line that will be available to aid in the management of diabetes mellitus (both Type 1 and Type 2) and its complications, both as a professional clinic-based device and as a home use device. In the future, wearable devices may also be developed. 

&#160;

A research and development plan has been constructed that will perform a series of investigations that will move the product from a prototype stage through a series of refinements and enhancements to achieve the safety and efficacy objectives of the device(s) upon which a set of claims intended for FDA, Health Canada and European Medical CE approval through the rigorous Pre-Market Approval (PMA) process will be constructed. A series of pre-clinical and clinical trials are planned (see &#8220; Clinical Trials &#8221;, below). The final marketing claims for the product, which will become the foundation for sales &#38; marketing efforts in subsequent phases, will derive from the clinical trials. Such claims will likely focus on overall diabetes management, including reductions in average blood sugar (HbA1C) as well as other markers that denote the degree and quality of blood sugar control. Measures that track complications of the disease will also be in focus. 

&#160;

Market Opportunity &#8211; Diabetes and Its Complications 

&#160;

Diabetes is a severe and debilitating disease with profound consequences, both for the individual and for society. The complications of diabetes are devastating, and the economic costs of care comprise a substantial portion of health care budgets. Despite the best efforts of the scientific community to devise a cure, the incidence of diabetes is on the rise. According to the information published by International Diabetes Association (&#8220;IDA&#8221;) in its Diabetes Atlas 1 , in 2015 there were 415 million people living with diabetes worldwide and a further 318 million people were at high risk of developing diabetes. These numbers were expected to grow to 642 million and 481 million, respectively, by 2040. It is estimated that each year 86,000 new cases of juvenile diabetes are being diagnosed. 

&#160; 

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar levels) with impaired metabolism of carbohydrate, fat and proteins resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Diabetes is one of the world&#8217;s oldest diseases with the syndrome being discovered centuries ago. The worldwide increase in the prevalence of diabetes has highlighted the need for increased research efforts into treatment options for both the disease itself and its associated complications. 

&#160;

Type 1 diabetes is caused by destruction of the insulin secreting (beta) cells of the pancreas. The pathogenesis involves autoimmune processes that lead to an absolute insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors that result in insulin resistance and insulin deficiency. Non-genetic factors include increasing age, high caloric intake, obesity, central adiposity, sedentary lifestyle, and low birth weight. This group comprises approximately 90&#8211;95% of cases in the diabetes syndrome. 

&#160;

Chronic hyperglycemia leads to various metabolic, hormonal, and physiologic alterations in the body, which further develop a number of secondary complications, resulting in the major increases in morbidity and mortality seen with all types of diabetes. Diabetes dramatically increases the risk of cardiovascular problems, such as coronary artery disease, chest pain (angina), heart attack, stroke, narrowing of arteries (atherosclerosis) and high blood pressure.

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

High blood sugar over time can injure the walls of the tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that nourish nerves, especially in the legs, causing tingling, numbness, burning or pain. Gradually, all sensation can be lost. Nerve damage in the feet or poor blood flow to the feet increases the risk of various foot complications. In diabetics, minor wounds easily become serious infections, which may heal poorly. Severe damage might require toe, foot or leg amputation. 

&#160;

Diabetes can damage the blood vessels of the retina (diabetic retinopathy), potentially leading to blindness. It also increases the risk of other serious vision conditions, such as cataracts and glaucoma. Diabetic hypertension is a major contributor to kidney failure or irreversible end-stage kidney disease, which often requires dialysis or a kidney transplant. 

&#160;

Damage to the nerves that control digestion can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. For men, erectile dysfunction may be an issue. Diabetes may leave people more susceptible to a variety of skin disorders, including bacterial and fungal infections. Type 2 diabetes may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. 

&#160;

Diabetes Care and Management 

&#160;

In the absence of a cure, the goal of diabetes management is to reduce the likelihood of complications by eliminating the wide fluctuations in blood sugar that define the disease. The current toolset for managing blood sugar levels is limited. 

&#160;

Diabetes management entails the administration of insulin in combination with careful blood glucose monitoring (Type 1 diabetes) or involves adjustments to diet and exercise levels, use of oral anti-diabetic drugs and insulin administration to control blood sugar (Type 2 diabetes). 

&#160;

Blood sugars may be self-monitored using a portable, personal device that takes a small blood sample obtained with a tiny finger lancet. Using such a device, tight glycemic control becomes possible, as an adjunct to insulin therapy, either injected or delivered via a wearable insulin pump. This technology-enabled self-care model has been shown to reduce complications and improve the quality of life in Type 1 diabetes. Replicating these results in Type 2 diabetes has been challenging, largely reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the disease and the fact that it changes with increasing age and other factors. Implantable sensors that measure blood glucose continually have come into practice more recently. 

&#160;

The value of self-monitoring enablement using electronic devices, including the next generation of wearable health appliances, is aided by incorporating decision support algorithms and other intelligent information technology tools. The concept of the &#8220;artificial pancreas&#8221; combines glucose sensing technologies with automated insulin delivery by pump, with software based decision making interposed so that the former drives the latter (fully automated feedback loop). Such systems are under development but have not yet made their way to market. 

&#160;

Scientific Foundations 

&#160;

Ion flows and transmembrane gradients produced by ion channels and pumps are key regulators of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Instructive roles for bioelectrical gradients in embryogenesis, regeneration, and neoplasm are being revealed. 

&#160;

The application of electromagnetic forces to human tissues to effect biologic change has been explored since the 19 th century. A good deal of that was wishful thinking or deliberate deception. However, recent advances in molecular biology and imaging technology have allowed insight into the sources and downstream consequences of ion flows in complex organisms. In complement to the current focus on molecular genetics and stem cell biology, artificial modulation of bioelectrical signals in somatic tissues is a powerful modality that might result in profound advances in understanding and augmentation of regenerative capacity. Molecular bioelectricity and its role in cell-to-cell signaling and epigenetics (altering cell behavior without altering genes) provides a new pathway to discovery of technologies that can counteract the effects of many diseases. 

&#160;

Many cells in the human body are &#8220; electrically excitable &#8221; including those involved with production of chemical signals that affect blood sugar. One example of such a cell of the endocrine type is the L cell, which resides in the gut and secretes cell glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), peptide YY (PYY) and oxyntomodulin. GLP-1 is an enteric hormone that stimulates insulin secretion and improves glycaemia in Type 2 diabetes. There is evidence that in Type 2 diabetes these cells become &#8220; unsynchronized&#8221;. Growing these cells in tissue culture and subjecting them to specific electrical signals can act to resynchronize their chemical activity, and alter their behavior as a &#8220; dispersed &#8221; metabolic organ. This serves as an illustration of how endogenous ion flows may serve as key epigenetic regulators of cell behavior, and suggests that bioelectric mechanisms might be harnessed at a whole organism level to cause functional regenerative changes. It is possible that the eBalance Technology may affect these processes, although that has yet to be established. We intend to explore this hypothesis in greater detail during our clinical trials. 

&#160;

Empirical Modeling 

&#160;

The first-in-human observations took place over many years and were carefully documented. The results of these observations lead to the belief that a specific device with a specific set of bioelectric signals of known waveform, frequency, amplitude, pulse, and duration, accompanied by sensing circuits that respond to fluctuations in the body&#8217;s response, in a closed feedback loop, produced cumulative effects that led to remarkable global effects in functional aspects of living in a person who had lived with Type 1 diabetes since age 10. Casual trials in another person with longstanding diabetes, Type 2 in this case, yielded findings of a similar nature in a limited time frame. These observations were followed by broader observational studies by Cell MedX&#8217;s team. 

&#160;

Effects observed in these observational studies include subjective reports of diminished fatigue, improved cognition, diminished neuropathic limb pain, improved sleep, reduction in swelling of extremities, improved skin appearance in color and texture, and a reduction in visual disturbance. Objective measures included healing of wounds, control of blood pressure leading to discontinuation or reduction of medication, and greatly improved control of blood sugars with remarkable diminution in HbA1C (which reflects average blood sugar over months). Remarkably, in the context of Type 1 Diabetes with other potential variables remaining the same, insulin requirements diminished to a considerable degree. 

&#160;

&#160; 

&#160; 

Clinical Trials 

&#160;

On January 13, 2015, we appointed Dr. John Sanderson, MD, a stem cell researcher and former Johnson &#38; Johnson (LifeScan) medical director, our Chief Medical Officer. Prior to this appointment Dr. Sanderson acted as a member of our Scientific Advisory Board. 

&#160;

During January through March 2015, we carried out a preliminary Pilot Trial (the &#8220;Pilot Trial&#8221;), which was designed to examine the short term metabolic impact of a single treatment with eBalance Technology on two diabetic subjects. Pre- and post-treatment blood samples from each subject were sent for extensive metabolic pathway analysis at the University of Alberta Metabolomics Unit. From those studies we observed alterations in several pathways, which are known to be deficient in persons with diabetes. The results of the Pilot Trial are notable in that significant shifts in metabolites related to blood sugar handling and disposal occurred in a very short time frame, with the only intervening variable being a 20 minute treatment with eBalance Technology. 

&#160;

The findings from the Pilot Trial were then used to inform further experimentation, including selection of metabolic end points for testing during a Phase IB clinical trial, which we started preparations for in July 2015. Due to shortage in available funding, we decided to temporarily postpone the Phase IB clinical Trial. 

&#160;

During the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2016 we engaged Nutrasource Diagnostics Inc. (&#8220;Nutrasource&#8221;) to commence observational clinical trials in Canada (&#8220;Clinical Study&#8221;) to assess and quantify eBalance technology&#8217;s ability to alter key metabolic pathways while targeting improved blood sugar control. The trial has been designed to include a site in Ontario with possibility of an additional site in British Columbia. The protocol has been designed to include the following end points: 

&#160;

1) Reduction in HbA1c levels; 

2) Improvement in insulin sensitivity and a reduction in insulin resistance; 

3) Improvement in such complications directly related to diabetes as; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Diabetic neuropathy; 

&#183; 

Acceleration in wound healing; and 

&#183; 

Improvement in blood pressure control. 

The Clinical Study is expected to span a 3 to 8 month period at an estimated cost of CAD$345,000, payable in monthly instalments of CAD$20,242. 

&#160;

As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K we, with assistance of Nutrasource, have secured the main research facility in Hamilton, Ontario, completed an investigational protocol as well as Informed Consent and Ethics Board submission documentation. 

&#160;

Product Development 

&#160;

On October 1, 2015, we entered into a development agreement with Mr. Claudio Tassi (the &#8220;Development Agreement&#8221;) for the development of the first eBalance Professional Series Device (the &#8220;Prototype&#8221;). Based on the Development Agreement we agreed to pay Bioformed Aestetic SL (&#8220;Bio4Med&#8221;), a company Mr. Tassi is a director of, $12,848 (EURO &#8364;12,000) and, upon successful completion of the development of the first eBalance Prototype, issue to Mr. Tassi, 100,000 shares of our common stock. We received the first Prototype in November 2015. 

On December 4, 2015, we executed a non-binding letter of intent (&#8220;LOI&#8221;) with Mr. Tassi and Bio4Med. The LOI contemplates that (i) we will enter into a technology development and license agreements with Mr. Tassi and Bio4Med to continue development of therapeutic devices based on the eBalance Technology; (ii) upon approval of the first Prototype, we will place an order for the production of 25 devises; and (iii) Mr. Tassi will provide his services for an initial term of four months commencing on December 4, 2015. 

&#160; 

On December 15, 2015, as contemplated under the LOI, we placed an order for an additional 25 eBalance devices, which we received between March and June of 2016. We consider these devices test prototypes of our eBalance Professional Series model (eBalance Pro Prototype). As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have distributed most of our eBalane Pro Prototypes to clinical practitioners to augment our observational data bank. 

Several of eBalance Pro Prototypes will be used in our Clinical Study carried out by Nutrasource. 

In August of 2016 we commenced the work on designing a new generation of our eBalance Pro Devices, which are being designed for use by practitioners, however, will be more compact and easier to operate. We expect to receive these devices in the 2 nd quarter of our Fiscal 2017.

Based on our operating budget, our cash requirement for the next 12 month period is approximately $3,425,009. As at May 31, 2016, we had $27,561 cash on hand, a working capital deficit of $1,619,635 and cash flows used in operations of $421,572 for the year then ended. We will require additional capital to support our day-to-day operations and carry out the planned clinical trials and the development of the eBalance Technology. We are planning to raise this capital through debt or equity financing or through a combination of both. 

&#160;

Medical Device Regulations and Government Approvals 

&#160;

The manufacture, packaging, marketing and importing of medical devices is heavily regulated in the United States, Canada and Europe. Further, we expect that any other countries in which we may seek to sell or market devices based on the eBalance Technology will similarly have an extensive regulatory environment. 

&#160;

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is responsible for regulating firms that manufacture, repackage, re-label and/or import medical devices sold in the United States. Health Canada&#8217;s Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate is responsible for regulating the manufacture, labeling, packaging, distribution and import of medical devices sold in Canada. 

&#160;

Prior to selling any devices based on the eBalance Technology for the treatment in the United States or Canada, we will be required to make applications to obtain approval from the FDA and Health Canada, respectively. The type of application and complexity of the procedures for obtaining FDA and Health Canada approval will depend upon the classification of the devices that we develop under the provisions of the United States Food and Drugs Act of 1906, as amended, and the Food and Drugs Act (Canada), as amended, respectively, and related regulations. In addition, we may be required to apply to the FDA for an investigational device exemption (IDE) and/or Health Canada under the Investigational Testing Authorization (&#8220;ITA&#8221;) program for the use of any such devices in clinical trials that we sponsor to test the efficacy of the eBalance Technology in treating diabetes and related ailments. An application for an ITA has been submitted to Health Canada in July 2016 and is currently being reviewed by Health Canada. 

&#160;

Third Party Payers / Private Insurers 

&#160;

Reimbursement for medical devices through Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., and through health protectorates in other nations, is not guaranteed. Third party private payers or private insurers typically follow the lead of government healthcare providers. A decision as to whether a device or treatment is covered involves extensive negotiations and is typically predicated on the concept of health cost savings. If the device can be shown to reduce health care costs through prevention of expensive complications of diabetes, such applications for approvals would be more favorably reviewed. 

&#160;

Marketing Plans 

&#160;

Once approved for marketing, the intent is to market devices incorporating the eBalance Technology through authorized dealers and distributors of medical equipment, as well as directly to end users and to professional / institutional users. Devices targeted at end users are expected to be self-managed devices that can be used by individuals in the comfort of their own homes. Devices targeted at professional / institutional users are expected to be larger scaled devices that can be used in clinical settings. A professional sales force is also expected to be developed. Initially, the Company intends to focus on marketing any products that we develop based on the eBalance Technology in the United States and Canada. The North America and Caribbean include approximately 44.3 million patients suffering from diabetes mellitus and related complications of which 50% are struggling to keep their blood sugar levels within recommended ranges and therefore potentially benefitting from our eBalance Technology. 

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

The current market for treatments that assist in the control and management of diabetes and its complications is highly competitive. However, since our technology is based on the microcurrent therapy, which is not traditionally used for management of diabetes, direct competition for eBalance Technology is not well defined. 

&#160;

Indirect competitors include a multitude of pharmaceutical companies that produce insulin and other various drugs to maintain and prevent diabetes related complications; companies producing glucose monitoring &#160; devices. 

&#160;

Competitors in microcurrent therapy would include BodiHealth Systems, focusing on pain relief market in US; Electromedical Products International, Inc., the company that developed Alpha-Stim&#174; PPM, which treats and alleviates acute, chronic or postoperative pain using microcurrent therapy. 

&#160;

Patents/Trade Marks/Licenses/Franchises/Concessions/Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts 

&#160;

Our eBalance Technology is not protected by a patent or a trademark. 

As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are continuing our negotiations with Bio4Med on the licensing agreement for the microcurrent technology that underlies our eBalance Technology. When completed, we expect that the Licensing Agreement will also include royalty payable to Bio4Med for each device sold based on this technology. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Number of Total Employees and Number of Full Time Employees 

&#160;

We currently have no employees other than our executive officers, who provide their services as independent consultants. We contract for the services of medical and technical staff we require to administer our observational studies and the clinical trials, as well as other consultants on &#8220;as needed&#8221; basis. 

&#160;
