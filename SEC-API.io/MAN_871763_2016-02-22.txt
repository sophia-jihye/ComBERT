&#160; 

Our Operations 

&#160; 

Client demand for workforce solutions and services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility within each of the countries and territories in which we operate. Improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor, resulting in greater demand for our staffing services while demand for our outplacement services typically declines. Correspondingly, during periods of weak economic growth or economic contraction, the demand for our staffing services typically declines, while demand for our outplacement services typically accelerates. 

&#160; 

During the last several years, secular trends toward greater workforce flexibility have had a favorable impact on demand for our innovative workforce solutions and services around the world. As companies attempt to increase the variability of their cost base, the workforce solutions we provide help them to effectively address the fluctuating demand for their products or services. As the economy recovers, we plan to play an increasing role, as the need for a robust workforce strategy and talent acquisition plan will continue to be critical due to the deep staff cuts that many companies, particularly large organizations, have made during periods of slow economic growth. 

&#160; 

Our portfolio of recruitment services includes permanent, temporary and contract recruitment of professionals, as well as administrative and industrial positions. All of these services are provided under our Manpower and Experis brands. We have provided services under our core Manpower brand for over 65 years with a primary focus on the areas of office, call center and industrial services and solutions. We provide services under our Experis brand, particularly in the areas of IT, Engineering, Finance and Accounting, and Healthcare, that include high-impact solutions, and accelerate organizations&#8217; growth by attracting, assessing and placing specialized expertise to deliver in-demand talent for mission-critical positions. Our experience and expertise allow us to accurately assess candidates&#8217; workplace potential and technical skills to match them to the needs of our clients. We plan to continue to build our brand and attract the talent our clients need as skills shortages arise. 

&#160; 

ManpowerGroup Solutions specializes in the delivery of customized workforce strategies and outcome-based solutions. Through our RPO offering, we manage customized, large-scale recruiting and workforce productivity initiatives for clients through an exclusive outsourcing contract. We can manage a single element or all of a client's permanent recruiting and hiring processes, from job profiling to on-boarding, globally or in a single location. MSP services include overall program management, reporting and tracking, supplier selection and management and order distribution. The MSP and RPO offerings both provide specialty expertise in contingent workforce management and broader administrative functions. TBO and Proservia services also include management of financial and administrative processes, including call center and customer service activities and accounting and payroll. 

Americas 

&#160; 

We provide services as Manpower, Experis and ManpowerGroup Solutions through both branch and franchise offices. The total Americas segment had 674 &#32;branch and 180 &#32;franchise offices. In the United States, where we realized 67% &#32;of the Americas&#8217; revenue, we had 436 &#32;branch and 164 &#32;franchise offices as of December 31, 2015 , as well as on-site locations at clients with significant permanent, temporary and contract recruitment requirements. In Other Americas, the largest operations of which include Mexico and Argentina, we had 238 &#32;branch offices and 16 &#32;franchise offices. We provide a number of central support services to our branches and franchises, which enable us to maintain consistent service quality throughout the region regardless of whether an office is a branch or franchise. In the United States, we provide client invoicing and payroll processing of our contingent workers for all branch offices and some of our franchise offices through administrative centers managed by our Milwaukee headquarters. 

&#160; 

Our franchise agreements provide the franchisee with the right to use the Manpower&#174; service mark in a specifically defined exclusive territory. In the United States, franchise fees generally range from 2% to 3% of franchise sales. Our franchise agreements provide that in the event of a proposed sale of a franchise to a third party, we have the right to acquire the franchise at the same price and on the same terms as proposed by the third party. We have exercised this right in the past and may do so in the future if opportunities arise with appropriate prices and terms. 

&#160; 

Our Manpower and Experis operations provide a variety of workforce solutions and services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, assessment and selection and training. During 2015 &#32;in this segment, approximately 38% &#32;of temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 25% &#32;from placing office staff, and 37% &#32;from placing professional and technical staff. For our United States operations in 2015, approximately 43% &#32;of the temporary and contract recruitment revenues were derived from placing industrial staff, 16% &#32;from placing office staff, and 41% &#32;from placing professional and technical staff.

Competition 

&#160; 

We compete in the employment services industry by offering a broad range of services, including permanent, temporary and contract recruitment, project-based workforce solutions, assessment and selection, training, career and talent management, managed service solutions, outsourcing, consulting and professional services. 

&#160; 

Our industry is large and fragmented, comprised of thousands of firms employing millions of people and generating billions of United States dollars in annual revenues. In most areas, no single company has a dominant share of the employment services market. In addition to us, the largest publicly owned companies specializing in recruitment services are Adecco, S.A. (Switzerland) and Randstad Holding N.V. (Netherlands). We also compete against a variety of regional or specialized companies such as Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd., Kelly Services, Inc., Robert Half Inc., Kforce Inc., PageGroup, Korn/Ferry International and Alexander Mann. It is a highly competitive industry, reflecting several trends in the global marketplace such as the notably increasing demand for skilled people, employers&#8217; desire for more flexible working models and consolidation among clients and in the employment services industry itself. We manage these trends by leveraging established strengths, including one of the employment services industry&#8217;s most recognized and respected brands; geographic diversification; size and service scope; an innovative product mix; recruiting and assessment expertise; and a strong client base. While staffing is an important aspect of our business, our strategy is focused on providing both the skilled employees our clients need and high-value workforce management, outsourcing and consulting solutions. 

&#160; 

Our client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, which are based upon a local or regional relationship with our presence in each market, and large national/multinational client relationships, which comprised approximately 58% &#32;of our revenues in 2015. These large national and multinational clients will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, with the ultimate choice among them being left to the local managers. As a result, employment services firms with a large network of offices compete most effectively for this business which generally has agreed-upon pricing or mark-up on services performed. Client relationships with small- and medium-size businesses tend to rely less upon longer-term contracts, and the competitors for this business are primarily locally-owned businesses. 

Regulation 

&#160; 

The employment services industry is closely regulated in all of the major markets in which we operate, except the United States and Canada. Employment services firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulation: 

&#160; 

&#8226; regulation of the employer/employee relationship between the firm and its temporary and contract employees; 

&#160; 

&#8226; registration, licensing, record keeping and reporting requirements; and 

&#160; 

&#8226; substantive limitations on the operations or the use of temporary and contract employees by clients. 

&#160; 

In many markets, the existence or absence of collective bargaining agreements with labor organizations has a significant impact on our operations and the ability of clients to use our services. In some markets, labor agreements are structured on an industry-wide, rather than company-by-company, basis. Changes in these collective bargaining agreements have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future and may have a material impact on the operations of employment services firms, including us. 

&#160; 

In many countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, workforce solutions and services firms are considered the legal employers of temporary and contract workers. Therefore, laws regulating the employer/employee relationship, such as tax withholding or reporting, social security or retirement, anti-discrimination and workers&#8217; compensation, govern the firm. In other countries, employment services firms, while not the direct legal employer of temporary and contract workers, are still responsible for collecting taxes and social security deductions and transmitting such amounts to the taxing authorities. 

&#160; 

In many countries, particularly in continental Europe and Asia, entry into the employment services market is restricted by the requirement to register with, or obtain licenses from, a government agency. In addition, a wide variety of ministerial requirements may be imposed, such as record keeping, written contracts and reporting. The United States and Canada do not presently have any form of national registration or licensing requirement. 

&#160; 

In addition to licensing or registration requirements, many countries impose substantive restrictions on the use of temporary and contract workers. Such restrictions include regulations affecting the types of work permitted, the maximum length of assignment, wage levels or reasons for which temporary and contract workers may be employed. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of temporary and contract workers. For example, temporary and contract workers in France are entitled to a 10% allowance for the uncertain duration of employment, which is eliminated if a full-time position is offered to them within three days after assignment termination. In some countries, the contract of employment with temporary and contract employees must differ from the length of assignment. 

&#160; 

Our outplacement and consulting services generally are not subjected to governmental regulation in the markets in which we operate. 

&#160; 

In the United States, we are subject to various federal and state laws relating to franchising, principally the Federal Trade Commission&#8217;s Franchise Rules and analogous state laws which impact our agreements with our franchised operations. These laws and related rules and regulations impose specific disclosure requirements. Virtually all states also regulate the termination of franchises. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Trademarks 

&#160; 

We maintain a number of registered trademarks, trade names and service marks in the United States and various other countries. We believe that many of these marks and trade names, including ManpowerGroup &#174; , ManpowerGroup &#174; &#32;Solutions, Manpower &#174; , Experis &#174; , Right Management &#174; , Brook Street &#174; , and Proservia &#174; &#32;have significant value and are materially important to our business. In addition, we maintain other intangible property rights. The trademarks have been assigned an indefinite life based on our expectation of renewing the trademarks, as required, without material modifications and at a minimal cost, and our expectation of positive cash flows beyond the foreseeable future. 

Employees 

&#160; 

We had approximately 27,000 &#32;full-time equivalent employees as of December 31, 2015 . In addition, we estimate that we recruit on behalf of our clients approximately 3.4 million &#32;permanent, temporary and contract workers on a worldwide basis each year. 

&#160; 

As described above, in most jurisdictions, we, as the employer of our temporary and contract workers or as otherwise required by applicable law, are responsible for employment administration. This administration includes collection of withholding taxes, employer contributions for social security or its equivalent outside the United States, unemployment tax, workers&#8217; compensation and fidelity and liability insurance, and other governmental requirements imposed on employers. In most jurisdictions where such benefits are not legally required, including the United States, we provide health and life insurance, paid holidays and paid vacations to qualifying temporary and contract employees.
