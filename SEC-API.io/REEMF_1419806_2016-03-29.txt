 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

CORPORATE BACKGROUND 

Rare Element was incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada, on June 3, 1999 as Spartacus Capital Inc. Our executive office is located at 225 Union Blvd., Suite 250, Lakewood, Colorado 80228. The telephone number for our executive office is (720) 278-2460. We maintain a corporate website at www.rareelementresources.com. 

Effective as of October 8, 1999, we completed our initial public offering of 1,500,000 common shares at CDN$0.20 per share, raising CDN$300,000. The common shares began trading on the predecessor exchange to the TSX Venture Exchange (&#147;TSX-V&#148;) in Canada on November 15, 1999 under the ticker symbol &#147;SCI.&#148;

Originally organized as a &#147;capital pool&#148; company whose activities were focused on the identification and completion of a qualifying transaction as required by the rules of the TSX-V, we transitioned to a &#147;venture company&#148; on July 25, 2003, coincident with (1) the completion of a reverse takeover acquisition of Rare Element Holdings Ltd. (the qualifying transaction), (2) a name change of &#147;Spartacus Capital, Inc.&#148; to &#147;Rare Element Resources Ltd.,&#148; and (3) the completion of a CDN$551,000 private placement. Rare Element Holdings Ltd.&#146;s main asset, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Rare Element Resources, Inc., a Wyoming corporation, is the 100% interest in a group of unpatented mining claims and adjacent property owned in fee, together known as the Bear Lodge Property. 

On December 20, 2004, our authorized share capital was changed from 100,000,000 common shares to an unlimited number of common shares without par value. Our common shares began trading on the NYSE MKT on August 18, 2010 under the ticker symbol &#147;REE.&#148; On May 27, 2011, we graduated from a listing on the TSX-V to the Toronto Stock Exchange (&#147;TSX&#148;) and traded under the ticker symbol &#147;RES&#148; until December 31, 2015, when we voluntarily delisted from and ceased to trade on the TSX. Our common shares traded on the NYSE MKT through February 26, 2016. Since February 29, 2016, our common shares have been trading on the OTCQB Venture Marketplace under the ticker symbol &#147;REEMF.&#148; As of December 31, 2015, there were 52,941,880 common shares issued and outstanding.

SUBSIDIARIES 

We have one direct wholly owned subsidiary, incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada on July 12, 1996 under the name &#147;Rare Element Holdings Ltd.&#148; That subsidiary has one direct wholly owned subsidiary, Rare Element Resources, Inc., incorporated on August 21, 1997 in the state of Wyoming, USA, formerly known as Paso Rico (USA), Inc. 

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

We are focused on advancing the Bear Lodge Rare Earth Element (&#147;REE&#148;) Project located near the town of Sundance in northeast Wyoming. The Bear Lodge REE Project consists of several large, disseminated REE deposits and a proposed hydrometallurgical plant to be located near Upton, Wyoming. The Bear Lodge REE Project is one of the highest-grade REE deposits identified in North America and one of the highest-grade europium deposits in the world. In addition, the Bear Lodge REE Project has a favorable distribution of the remaining critical rare earth elements, which the Company defines as neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, terbium and yttrium. 

In its development efforts for the Bear Lodge REE Project, the Company has done extensive laboratory bench-scale and pilot plant testing on appropriate metallurgical processes to recover saleable rare earth products and has filed five patents on its metallurgical innovations. Among them, it has pilot tested and filed for patent protection on a rare earth separation technique that modifies conventional solvent extraction (&#147;SX&#148;) methods used for rare earth separation to be more efficient and environmentally sound, involving no waste effluents being discharged from the process. The Company believes that its innovations on conventional SX processing could also apply to other mineral commodities, and is currently investigating opportunities to apply its processing technology to such commodities including uranium, scandium, vanadium and others.

We have placed the Bear Lodge REE Project under care-and-maintenance, and all permitting activities have been suspended. At present, we are focused on raising capital and/or seeking strategic partners to resume our efforts to complete elemental separation test work and technical studies. Based on current permitting timetables and other factors, the Company anticipates it could receive all permits and licenses for the Bear Lodge REE project approximately 12 to 18 months after resuming permitting efforts. If we obtain the requisite financing, the Company&#146;s plan is to resume development activities, including working in parallel (with permitting activities) to advance engineering in preparation for the feasibility study, to gain strategic partners and off-take customers, to evaluate a modular approach to development beginning with a smaller initial production facility and to scale up its REE separation test work in further pilot plant testing. The Company&#146;s ability to begin construction activities on the Project will be subject to (i) the availability of adequate capital, (ii) a positive FS, (iii) securing off-take customers, (iv) obtaining necessary permits and licenses, (v) Board approval, and (vi) other factors.

The Bear Lodge REE Project deposit is located near excellent mining infrastructure, including good road access and a power line within two kilometers of the property. The project site is 100 kilometers east of Gillette, Wyoming, a major infrastructure, support and logistics center for coal mines in the Powder River Basin that should provide for ready access to the required production supplies and materials as well as skilled labor. The deposit is also situated 64 kilometers from the nearest railhead at Upton, Wyoming, allowing access to major distribution channels from the proposed hydrometallurgical plant. The Bear Lodge REE Project has favorable community acceptance, and Wyoming is one of the top-ranked mining jurisdictions globally (based on the Fraser Institute&#146;s 2015 ranking of 122 jurisdictions). 

Additional information regarding the Bear Lodge REE Project and the Bear Lodge Property is included under the section heading &#147;Item 2. Properties&#148; in this Annual Report.

RECENT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS 

Accomplishments in 2015 

In 2015, Rare Element continued to make progress on its Bear Lodge REE Project on several critical fronts. The Company achieved a number of major milestones, including:

&#183;

Supported the U.S. Forest Service (&#147;USFS&#148;) as the lead agency in its development of the Environmental Impact Statement (&#147;EIS&#148;) under the National Environmental Policy Act (&#147;NEPA&#148;) process for the Bear Lodge REE Project. The draft EIS was published in January 2016, a major permitting milestone for the Project. We also submitted the application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (&#147;NRC&#148;) for a license to possess source material and a mine permit application to the LQD-WDEQ.

&#183;

Received a unanimous support resolution from the Wyoming Legislature for the Bear Lodge REE Project, recognizing the significance of re-establishing a strong domestic rare earth production base and the importance and need for timely completion of the Bear Lodge REE Project EIS by the USFS. Further state support was received in a letter from the Chief Executive Officer of the Wyoming Business Council, the State&#146;s principal economic development agency, emphasizing the Project&#146;s status as a &#147;priority project&#148; for the Council and expressing the Council&#146;s commitment to continue discussions on future State financing assistance.

&#183;

Raised US$3.4 million in a registered direct equity offering of 5,230,770 common shares and warrants to purchase up to 2,615,385 common shares. The units, each consisting of one common share and one warrant to purchase half a common share, were priced at US$0.65 per unit. Proceeds from the offering were used for pre-development work at the Bear Lodge REE Project, including for progression of permitting, continued test work on rare earth element separation, engineering and optimization studies, and progression toward a feasibility study, as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

&#183;

Completed successful pilot plant tests of a modified, zero-waste SX process to separate rare earths in an efficient and environmentally sound manner. Following on from successful bench-scale tests, the initial pilot plant campaign exceeded expectations and validated the Company&#146;s ability to extract, at 

scale, 100% of the recoverable cerium (Ce) oxide (85% of the total Ce oxide) with a single SX mixer/settler. Two additional mixer/settlers then successfully removed thorium (Th) to below detection levels. The pilot plant produced cerium oxide and lanthanum oxide at purities (&#62;99.9%) that appear to be commercially saleable, and production samples were supplied to a potential customer for evaluation.

&#183;

Completed the 2015 condemnation drill program at the planned physical upgrade (&#147;PUG&#148;) plant site for the Bear Lodge REE Project. The drill program confirmed the absence of meaningful mineralized material under the site, while the geotechnical program identified the characteristics of the soils for foundation design as part of detailed engineering. Both programs helped progress the design of the site and related mine infrastructure.

Plans for 2016 

We have limited cash resources on hand and have announced measures to reduce staffing and conserve remaining cash. The Company has narrowed the focus of its activities to advance the Project concentrating on only the very highest priority items that we believe have the greatest potential to preserve the value of the Project and shareholder value, including seeking capital and actively pursuing potential strategic alternatives, including off-take agreements, joint ventures, mergers, acquisitions and asset sales. If we obtain sufficient financing, we plan to resume permitting, resume pilot plant testing and incorporate the design of a small-scale initial production facility into the planned Feasibility Study.

TRENDS AND DESCRIPTION OF THE REE MARKET 

Uses for REE products 

REEs are used in computers, cellular telephones, television screens, wind turbines, fuel cells, magnetic refrigeration technologies, energy-efficient lighting, petroleum-refining catalysts and numerous other modern specialty technologies. REEs are also used in hybrid-electric vehicles and all-electric vehicles, many of which contain REE-bearing nickel-metal-hydride batteries and REE &#147;super&#148; magnets within electrical motors and generators. Prices of REEs are affected by the supply and demand fundamentals of the market.

Trends affecting supplies of REE products 

Global REE supply continues to be dominated by production from China, which produced an estimated 87% of the world&#146;s REE output in 2015, according to the Industrial Minerals Company of Australia Pty Ltd (&#147;IMCOA&#148;) and Curtin University. Over the nine years through 2014, China reduced its export quotas for REEs by more than half (with a marked reduction in the summer of 2010) and increased related export taxes. The quota reductions resulted in significantly higher REE prices beginning in 2010, when quotas were reduced by approximately 40%. Since then, illegal or unauthorized Chinese REE production, the slowdown in global economic growth, demand destruction due to elevated REE prices in 2010 and 2011 and significant supply from accumulated REE stockpiles have caused dramatic REE price declines from 2012 through 2015.

After an initial adverse ruling from the World Trade Organization (&#147;WTO&#148;) in March 2014, and an affirmation of that ruling against China&#146;s trade practices on appeal in August 2014, China abolished export quotas as of January 1, 2015, on rare earths, tungsten and molybdenum. The quotas were replaced by an export licensing system that many industry sources believe has actually tightened China&#146;s control over REE exports. The WTO ruled against China in the case that was brought by the United States, Europe and Japan alleging that China&#146;s export quotas and export taxes on rare earths violated global trade rules.

China subsequently eliminated its export taxes on rare earths as of May 1, 2015, and replaced them with a system of ad valorem resource taxes on light, medium and heavy rare earth concentrates, in addition to tungsten and molybdenum. Resource tax rates were set at 7.5%, 9.5% and 11.5% on light rare earth concentrates from Shandong Province, Sichuan Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Baotou-Bayun Obo), respectively, and at 27% on medium and heavy rare earth concentrates regardless of production region. Because the new taxes are applied to concentrates and were not levied on downstream products already in the pipeline, REE export prices immediately declined to approximate Chinese domestic prices for most REEs. It remains to be seen what impact the new, ad valorem, resource taxes on production will have on pricing of China&#146;s REE exports in the longer term.

Global supply and demand for rare earths were estimated to be in oversupply in 2015, as demand for rare earth magnet materials like Nd and Pr drove overproduction of Ce, La and most other rare earths, and illegal or unauthorized REE production from China acted as the swing production in the market. Recent estimates indicate that illegal mine production of rare earths in China was perhaps as much as 45,000&#150;55,000 tonnes, or approximately 25%&#150;30% of global supply. Certainly, the continued decline of rare earth prices in 2015 and early 2016 indicated that REE consumers continue to find the needed rare earths readily available.

Chinese official domestic REE production is expected to increase at a rate of 4.4% per year from 2015 to 2020, while illegal mining is forecast to increase 6%&#150;8%, unless the government&#146;s measures to consolidate the rare earth industry and curtail illegal mining have some impact. These two factors together imply a future overall growth rate of around 6% for domestic Chinese production. Rare earth production in the rest of the world, though only 13% of estimated 2015 production, is expected to grow at a faster rate as Lynas Corporation (&#147;Lynas&#148;) expands production and a few other non-Chinese operations potentially come on-stream. In 2015, Lynas reached its Phase I design production capacity of 11,000 tonnes per annum while Molycorp&#146;s Mountain Pass operation was placed on care-and-maintenance while bankruptcy proceedings continue. 

Despite industry forecasts that indicate that the overall REE market might be oversupplied for the next few years (largely based on illegal mining in China), it is expected that certain lower-value REE elements (particularly Ce and La) will represent the largest portion of this oversupply, while other elements may be more in balance or even in deficit, particularly magnet materials and HREEs. Several market observers cite magnet materials especially as being at risk of short supplies in the near- to medium-term future.

As a result of increased investment in the REE industry outside of China since 2009, there are several new and refurbished REE projects that are being developed that could add to the non-Chinese supply of rare earths over the next two to five years. However, given the present state of the rare earth market, pricing and lack of support from strategic end-users or governments, it is difficult to forecast which other rare earth projects, if any, will be able to find the capital needed to construct their facilities. Some market observers believe that this new potential production may have a negative impact on the pricing of some REE products, especially the LREEs of La and Ce. We believe that current rare earth prices and the present lack of capital available for new rare earth projects are likely to temper this potential production growth. According to an IMCOA report dated September 2015 (the &#147;IMCOA Report&#148;), REE total supply is forecasted to increase from 175,000 tonnes in 2014 to 250,000 tonnes in 2020, an implied compound annual growth rate (&#147;CAGR&#148;) of 7.4%.

Trends affecting demand of REE products 

The global economy and the speed of technological innovation play key roles in the continuation and pace of increased demand for REEs. If the global economy experiences a prolonged period of slow growth, then the projected increase in REE product demand may not occur at the pace expected. In addition, the spike in REE prices in 2010 and 2011 to extremely high levels seems to have accelerated consumers&#146; efforts to economize on rare earth consumption or to use substitute materials and therefore slowed the expected pace of demand growth. Based on the IMCOA Report, REE total demand is forecasted to increase from 146,000 tonnes in 2015 to 200,000 tonnes in 2020, or an implied CAGR of 6.5%, driven mainly by demand for magnet materials, metal alloys, glass polishing materials and catalysts. Based on forecasted production levels, these figures would imply a significant oversupply of total rare earths in 2020. A more detailed analysis of the supply/demand balance by element suggests that the oversupply is largely driven by significant imbalances in the Ce, La and Y markets. In the IMCOA Report, the excess Ce and La production seems to be a result of (1) demand destruction caused by very high REE prices in 2011, and (2) overproduction driven by strong demand for magnet materials Nd, Pr, and Sm. Meanwhile, the Y imbalance may be driven by the transition from fluorescent lighting to LED technology in combination with overproduction driven by strong Dy demand for magnets. The projected imbalances in other more highly valued rare earth elements are generally much smaller, and in fact, Nd and Pr are expected to remain in relatively short supply for the next few years.

Certain market experts believe that demand growth for some REEs is supply constrained (e.g., magnet materials are often mentioned) and that an increase in global availability and production of these rare earths could actually accelerate demand growth. Since REEs are used for many new technologies, the pace of technology innovation should also continue to boost REE demand. According to the IMCOA report, annual global demand growth for REEs from 2015 to 2020 could average 6.5% p.a. overall. Within this forecast, however, there is a significant variation in demand by end-use. For instance, demand for REE magnets using Nd, Pr, Dy and Sm is expected to average annual growth of 8.8% p.a., while demand for REE phosphors, which include Eu, Tb and Y, is expected to experience almost no growth. Other REE uses that are projected by IMCOA to have the strongest demand growth from 2015 to 2020 are glass (8.9% CAGR) and metal alloys (6.2% CAGR). 

Trends affecting prices of REE products 

The prices of REEs are quoted in different forms, including oxides, metals, ferroalloys, and cerium carbonate concentrate (with approximately 45% TREOs). The marketability of REE concentrates will depend on the concentrate grade, the distribution of REEs in the concentrate and the types of impurities contained in the concentrate. Mixed REE concentrates are often then separated into individual REOs or groups of similar REOs that can be sold or can be tolled for further refinement. 

According to www.metal-pages.com (&#147;Metal Pages&#148;), weighted average quarterly prices in U.S. dollars of REOs of 99% purity, FOB China increased more than 1,100% from the end of 2009 through the third quarter of 2011. Since peaking in the third quarter of 2011, REO prices have fallen dramatically, with average quarterly prices for the fourth quarter of 2015 at a level 93% lower than the quarterly average peak in 2011. La oxide and Ce oxide decreased from highs exceeding $150 per kilogram in mid-2011 to around $2.00 per kilogram for 99% oxides as of December 31, 2015. Although several REE prices remain above their 2009 levels, financial losses reported by the rare earth operations of the major Chinese rare earth companies, continuing cost pressures from the new resource taxes, labor costs and environmental regulations, and China&#146;s ongoing consolidation of its rare earths industry may give prices the impetus to move higher.

Supply and demand factors for REE products that could positively impact REE prices include the following, among other factors:

&#183;

the use of Nd, Pr, Tb and Dy in high-strength magnets that are critical to hybrid and electric vehicles and the increased construction of wind power generation facilities, particularly large off-shore installations;

&#183;

the use of Sm in high-performance Sm-cobalt permanent magnets;

&#183;

the use of La and Ce for NiMH batteries that are utilized in hybrid and electric vehicles;

&#183;

the use of Eu, Tb, Y and Ce in the production of compact fluorescent and LED light bulbs;

&#183;

the use of high-strength NdFeB magnets in the miniaturization of electronic products;

&#183;

the use of La in FCCs by refineries processing lower quality crude oil that consumes greater quantities of the catalysts;

&#183;

the increased use of REEs in the drive to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gases, or GHGs, by the United States and the European Union;

&#183;

China consolidating its REE industry and closing small, inefficient and polluting REE producers;

&#183;

the stockpiling of certain REE products, tightening control of export volumes through licensing and increases in production taxes by China;

&#183;

the use of Ce in glass, ceramics, glass polishing, and advanced water filtration applications; 

&#183;

the continued research and commercialization of new applications for REE products; and

&#183;

the rising costs in China due to stricter environmental controls and rising wages.

Supply and demand factors for REE products that could negatively impact REE prices include the following, among other factors: 

&#183;

the potential for oversupply of certain REEs due to new production outside of China and/or increased exports from China;

&#183;

strong demand for selected REEs like magnet materials, driving overproduction of other co-product REEs and creating oversupply conditions for the less desired REEs;

&#183;

the potential substitution of other materials for high-priced REEs; 

&#183;

economization by intermediate and end-users to reduce their usage of REEs in end-products;

&#183;

the potential for increased recycling of high-priced REEs;

&#183;

continued low oil, gas and coal prices that could reduce the demand for technologies using REEs;

&#183;

static or lower global economic growth, reducing overall demand growth for REEs; and

&#183;

potential by-product production of REEs that may increase supply irrespective of the normal economics of REE production.

The feasibility of the Bear Lodge REE Project and our ability to raise additional funds to develop the Project may be impacted by global supply and demand and future prices of REEs.

SEASONALITY 

Seasonality in the state of Wyoming is not a material factor to exploration activities and any future development and operating activities on the Bear Lodge Property. Snowfall in the winter may temporarily limit our access to the Bear Lodge Property and our ability to drill or operate from approximately November through June, but it is not a material issue at this time.

COMPETITION 

The industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other mining and exploration companies in connection with the exploration and development of mineral properties. There is competition for the limited number of opportunities, some involving companies having substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities than we do. We also compete with other mining and exploration companies in our efforts to hire and retain experienced professionals. As a result, we may have difficulty attracting or retaining key personnel or securing outside technical resources.

In 2015, China accounted for an estimated 87% of global REE production and 66% of worldwide demand. While REE projects exist outside of China, current non-Chinese production is relatively limited. Further, even though one large mine outside of China is in production, it is likely that the Chinese will be able to dominate the market for REEs for the foreseeable future. This gives the Chinese producers a competitive advantage in controlling the supply and processing of REEs and an opportunity to reduce prices to discourage competition. Any increase in the amount of REEs exported from other nations increases competition and may result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of potential market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business. As a result of these factors, the Company may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#148; of this Annual Report.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSES 

We rely on a combination of trade secret protection, nondisclosure and licensing agreements, and patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property rights. We utilize trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rare earth technology. As of December 31, 2015, we had filed six U.S. provisional patent applications relating to processing methods, including (1) selective recovery of REEs from mixed chloride leach solutions using oxalic acid, (2) thorium extraction process technology and (3) separation of cerium from bulk REEs in an SX process. Two of these provisional applications were converted to a single utility application and an application under the international Patent Cooperation Treaty (&#147;PCT&#148;). This PCT application was nationalized in several foreign jurisdictions in 2015. Also during 2015, we converted another one of these provisional applications into a single utility application and an application under the PCT, and combined 

another three of these provisional patent applications into a single PCT application that also designates the United States as the jurisdiction for patent protection. If allowed, a U.S. patent granted from the utility patent application would have a term of 20 years measured from the filing date of the utility patent application. See &#147;Item 1A. Risk Factors&#148; of this Annual Report. Several of these technologies have potential value for application in other industries, and the Company is evaluating this potential.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 

Our exploration and planned development and mining activities are subject to extensive and costly environmental laws and regulations under various federal, state, county and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, which generally includes air and water quality, hazardous waste management, radionuclide handling and reclamation. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and/or criminal liability for non-compliance, fines and penalties, clean-up costs and other environmental damages. Also, unanticipated developments or changes in the law could require us to make environmental expenditures significantly greater than those we currently expect. Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner that will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Current and future laws, regulations and permits will impose significant costs, liabilities or obligations or could limit or prevent our ability to continue operations or undertake new operations. Environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which we hold interests that are unknown to us at present and that have been caused by previous owners of the properties.

Our Bear Lodge Property in Wyoming is subject to federal and state environmental laws, regulations, and permits. The federal agency with primary regulatory jurisdiction is the U.S. Forest Service, Bearlodge Ranger District, Sundance, Wyoming. The state agency with regulatory jurisdiction is the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality. We operate under approvals and permits granted by these two agencies and have established a surety bond to ensure environmental reclamation of areas disturbed. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a surety bond with the state of Wyoming totaling $439,600. Prior to operating, we will require several other permits and licenses including those issued by the NRC, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and others.

In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (&#147;EPA&#148;) announced that it would develop financial assurance requirements under Section 108(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, for the hardrock mining industry. The EPA had previously announced that it expected to publish its proposed financial responsibility regulations in 2016. On January 29, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued an order requiring that if the EPA intends to prepare such regulations, it must do so by December 1, 2016. The EPA&#146;s notice did not indicate what the anticipated scope of these requirements will be, or whether they will be duplicative of existing bonding and other financial assurance requirements applicable to the hardrock mining industry. However, the promulgation of regulations that require significant additional financial assurance could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.

MINERALS EXPLORATION REGULATION 

Mining operations and exploration and development activities are subject to various national, state, county and local laws and regulations in the United States that govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the regulations. There are no current orders or notices of violations relating to the Company under applicable laws and regulations.

Compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on the Company and could subject it to significant potential liabilities. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations, or changes to current requirements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.

MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH REGULATIONS 

Pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd&#150;Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd&#150;Frank Act&#148;), issuers that are operators, or that have a subsidiary that is an operator, of a coal or other mine in the United States are required to disclose in their periodic reports filed with the SEC information regarding specified health and safety violations, orders and citations, related assessments and legal actions, and mining-related fatalities. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our Bear Lodge Property was not subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.

EMPLOYEES 

At December 31, 2015, we had thirteen full-time employees. As part of the Company&#146;s cost containment measures, the number of full-time employees was reduced to seven as of January 1, 2016. Further reductions in employees were made in March 2016, as further described in Note 14 to the Financial Statements &#150; Subsequent Events. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
