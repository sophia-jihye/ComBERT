 Item 1. &#160; Business 

Overview 

Endo International plc is an Ireland-domiciled, global specialty pharmaceutical company focused on branded and generic pharmaceuticals. We aim to be the premier partner to healthcare professionals and payment providers, delivering an innovative suite of branded and generic drugs to meet patients&#8217; needs. Unless otherwise indicated or required by the context, references throughout to &#8220;Endo&#8221;, the &#8220;Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221; refer to financial information and transactions of Endo Health Solutions Inc. (EHSI) and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to February 28, 2014 and Endo International plc and its consolidated subsidiaries thereafter. 

The Company&#8217;s focus is on U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and International Pharmaceuticals and we target areas where we can build and maintain a leadership position. Endo uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, the rational allocation of capital, an emphasis on de-risked research and development and our ability to be better owners of assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy are enabling Endo to achieve sustainable growth and create shareholder value. 

We regularly evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through the acquisition of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities. 

In November 2010, we acquired Generics International (US Parent), Inc. (formerly doing business as Qualitest Pharmaceuticals (Qualitest)), a leading U.S.-based privately held generics company. Qualitest provided high-quality generic pharmaceuticals. The Company&#8217;s U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, which includes the legacy Qualitest business along with the acquisitions of Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (Par) in September 2015, Boca Pharmacal LLC (Boca) in February 2014 and DAVA Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (DAVA) in August 2014, is the fourth largest U.S. generics company based on market share. The product portfolio includes tablets, capsules, powders, injectables, liquids, nasal sprays, ophthalmics and patches. 

In June 2011, we acquired American Medical Systems Holdings, Inc. (AMS), a provider of devices and therapies for treating male and female pelvic health conditions. On February 24, 2015 , Endo&#8217;s board of directors approved a plan to sell the Company&#8217;s AMS business, which comprised the entirety of our former Devices segment. The AMS business was comprised of the Men&#8217;s Health and Prostate Health business as well as the Women&#8217;s Health Business (now doing business as Astora). On August 3, 2015, the Company sold the Men&#8217;s Health and Prostate Health business to Boston Scientific Corporation for $1.65 billion , with $1.6 billion &#32;paid in upfront cash and $50.0 million &#32;in cash contingent on Boston Scientific achieving certain product revenue milestones. 

In addition to selling the Men&#8217;s Health and Prostate Health business, as of December 31, 2015 and continuing into 2016, the Company was actively pursuing a sale of the Astora business with the Company in active negotiations with multiple buyers. 

The operating results of AMS are reported as Discontinued operations, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations &#32;for all periods presented. 

On February 24, 2016, the Company&#8217;s Board of Directors decided to wind down Astora business operations in order to begin bringing finality to the Company&#8217;s mesh-related product liability. The Company is now actively conducting a wind down process and working to efficiently transition physicians to alternative products. The Company will cease business operations for Astora by March 31, 2016. The majority of the remaining assets and liabilities of the AMS business, which are related to the Astora business, are classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015. Certain of AMS&#8217;s assets and liabilities, primarily with respect to its product liability accrual related to vaginal mesh cases, the related Qualified Settlement Funds and certain intangible and fixed assets, are not classified as held for sale based on management&#8217;s current expectation that these assets and liabilities will remain with the Company. Depreciation and amortization expense are not recorded on assets held for sale. Upon wind down of the Astora business, the Company will have entirely exited its AMS business. 

&#32;On October 31, 2013, Endo International plc was incorporated in Ireland as a private limited company and re-registered effective February 18, 2014 as a public limited company. Endo International plc was established for the purpose of facilitating the business combination between EHSI and Paladin Labs Inc. (Paladin). On February 28, 2014 (the Paladin Acquisition Date), the Company, through a Canadian subsidiary, acquired all of the shares of Paladin and a U.S. subsidiary of the Company merged with and into EHSI, with EHSI surviving the merger. As a result of these transactions, the former shareholders of EHSI and Paladin became the shareholders of Endo International plc and both EHSI and Paladin became our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries. 

Paladin is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring and in-licensing innovative pharmaceutical products for the Canadian and world markets. Paladin&#8217;s key products serve growing therapeutic areas, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), women&#8217;s health and oncology. Through the acquisition of Paladin, we acquired the Litha Healthcare Group Limited (Litha) in South Africa 

On February 28, 2014, we announced the commencement of reporting our diversified businesses in four key segments, U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals, Devices and International Pharmaceuticals. Our operation of the International Pharmaceuticals business commenced following the Paladin acquisition. As a result of the sale of the Men&#8217;s Health and Prostate Health components of the AMS business to Boston Scientific Corporation and the plan to sell the Astora business, the three remaining reportable business segments in which we now operate are U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and International Pharmaceuticals. The operating results of our HealthTronics and AMS businesses are reported as Discontinued operations, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations . The revenue associated with our HealthTronics and AMS businesses totaled $305.3 million , $510.9 million &#32;and $699.4 million &#32;in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In January 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell our HealthTronics business and the sale was completed on February 3, 2014. Our segments are further discussed in Note 6. Segment Results &#32;in the Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;included in Part IV, Item 15. of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" &#32;and in Part II, Item 7. of this report "Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" &#32;under the caption &#8220; Business Segment Results Review &#8221;. 

On January 29, 2015, we acquired Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Auxilium), a fully integrated specialty biopharmaceutical company with a focus on developing and commercializing innovative products for specific patients&#8217; needs. Auxilium, with a broad range of first- and second-line products across multiple indications, is an emerging leader in the men&#8217;s healthcare sector and strategically focuses its product portfolio and pipeline in orthopedics, dermatology and other therapeutic areas. 

On September 25, 2015, we acquired Par Pharmaceutical Holdings, Inc., which develops, licenses, manufactures, markets and distributes innovative and cost-effective pharmaceuticals that help improve patient quality of life. Immediately following the closing, Par Pharmaceutical Holdings, Inc. changed its name to Par Pharmaceutical Companies, Inc. (Par). Par focuses on high-barrier-to-entry products that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. Par has operated in two business segments, (i) Par Pharmaceutical, which includes generic products marketed under Par Pharmaceutical and sterile products marketed under Par Sterile Products, LLC; and (ii) Par Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which markets three branded products, Nascobal &#174; &#32;Nasal Spray, Megace &#174; &#32;ES and Cortisporin &#174; -TC Otic Suspension. 

We have a portfolio of branded pharmaceuticals offered by our U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals &#32; segment that includes established brand names such as Lidoderm &#174; , OPANA &#174; &#32;ER, Voltaren &#174; &#32;Gel, Percocet &#174; , BELBUCA&#8482;, Fortesta &#174; &#32;Gel, Testim &#174; , Aveed &#174; , Supprelin &#174; &#32;LA, and XIAFLEX &#174; , among others. Our branded pharmaceuticals comprised approximately 39% , 41% &#32;and 66% &#32;of our total revenues in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, with 4% , 7% &#32;and 28% &#32;of our total revenues coming from Lidoderm &#174; &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. Our non-branded U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals &#32;portfolio, which accounted for 51% , 48% &#32;and 34% &#32;of total revenues in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, currently consists of a differentiated product portfolio including tablets, capsules, powders, injectables, liquids, nasal sprays, ophthalmics and patches. The International Pharmaceuticals segment, which accounted for 10% &#32;and 11% &#32;of total revenues in 2015 &#32;and 2014 , respectively, includes a variety of specialty pharmaceutical products for the Canadian, Latin American, South African and world markets, which we acquired in the Paladin acquisition and in the Grupo Farmac&#233;utico Somar, Sociedad An&#243;nima Promotora de Inversi&#243;n de Capital Variable (Somar) acquisition in July 2014. Paladin&#8217;s key products serve growing therapeutic areas, including ADHD, pain, women&#8217;s health and oncology. Somar develops, manufactures and markets high-quality generic, branded generic and over-the-counter products across key market segments including dermatology and anti-infectives. Across all of our businesses, we generated total revenues of $3.27 billion , $2.38 billion &#32;and $2.12 billion &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively. 

The ordinary shares of Endo International plc are traded on The NASDAQ Global Market under the ticker symbol ENDP and on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ENL.

Our Strategy 

Our strategy is focused on continuing our progress in becoming a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company. Through a lean and efficient operating model, we are committed to serving patients and customers while continuing to innovate and provide products that make a difference in the lives of patients. We strive to maximize shareholder value by adapting to market realities and customer needs. 

We are committed to driving organic growth at attractive margins by improving execution, optimizing cash flow and leveraging our strong market position, while maintaining a streamlined cost structure throughout each of our businesses. Specific areas of management&#8217;s focus include: 

&#8226; 

U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals : Accelerating performance of organic growth drivers, increasing profitability from our mature brands and investing in key pipeline development opportunities. 

&#8226; 

U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals : Capitalizing on encouraging demand trends for a differentiated product portfolio and focusing on developing or acquiring high barrier to entry products, including first to file or first to market opportunities that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. We believe the acquisition and integration of Par will enhance and expand our existing generics platform, adding scale and diversity in products, capabilities and R&#38;D infrastructure. 

&#8226; 

International Pharmaceuticals : Investing in high growth business segments with durable revenue streams and where physicians play a significant role in choosing the course of therapy. 

We remain committed to strategic R&#38;D across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined regulatory pathways. We also seek to identify incremental development growth opportunities through acquisitions and product licensing. 

In addition to a focus on organic growth drivers, we are also actively pursuing accretive acquisitions that offer long-term revenue growth, margin expansion through synergies and the ability to maintain a flexible capital structure. Since 2013, we have completed a number of acquisitions. See Note 5. Acquisitions &#32;in the Consolidated Financial Statements &#32;included in Part IV, Item 15. of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" &#32;and Part II, Item 7. of this report "Management&#8217;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" &#32;for further discussion. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

To successfully execute our strategy, we must continue to capitalize on our following core strengths: 

Continuing proactive diversification of our business to become a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company. &#32;In light of the evolving healthcare industry, we have executed a number of corporate acquisitions to diversify our business and become a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company that includes both branded and generic prescription drugs. We regularly evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through acquisitions of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluating selective acquisition and license opportunities. Such acquisitions or licenses may be effected through the purchase of assets, joint ventures and licenses or by acquiring other companies. 

As a result of a series of strategic actions combined with strategic investments in our core business, we have redefined our position in the healthcare marketplace and successfully diversified our revenue base. Our acquisitions of Paladin, Auxilium and Par have also contributed to our diversification. Our acquisition of Auxilium enhanced our branded pharmaceutical research and development pipeline. The acquisition of Par created critical mass and added scale in our generics business while enhancing and expanding our capabilities in Paragraph IV products, complex dosage forms and research and development. These strategic acquisitions have also enabled us to expand our international presence. In 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , 9.5% , 11.4% &#32;and 0.0% , respectively, of our total revenues were from sources outside the U.S. 

Focus on our generics business differentiated products. We develop high-barrier-to-entry generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. We believe products with these characteristics will face a lesser degree of competition and therefore provide longer product life cycles and higher profitability than commodity generic products. Our business model continues to focus on being the lowest-cost producer of products in categories with high barriers to entry and lower levels of competition by leveraging operational efficiency. Our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals &#32;segment is focused in categories where there are fewer challenges from low-cost operators. 

Through our acquisition of Par, we have strategically expanded our technology, manufacturing, handling and development capabilities to a diversified array of dosage forms. We believe our comprehensive suite of technology, manufacturing and development capabilities increases the likelihood of success in commercializing high-barrier-to-entry products and obtaining first-to-file and first-to-market status on future products, yielding more sustainable market share and profitability. We plan to optimize our generic products 

pipeline and portfolio as part of a strategic assessment of our generic business. We will retain only those marketed products that deliver acceptable returns on investment, thereby leveraging our existing platform to drive operational efficiency. 

Established portfolio of branded products. &#32;We have assembled a portfolio of branded prescription products offered by our U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals &#32;segment to treat and manage pain and conditions in urology, urologic oncology, endocrinology and orthopedics. Our branded products include: Lidoderm &#174; , OPANA &#174; &#32;ER, Voltaren &#174; &#32;Gel, Percocet &#174; , BELBUCA&#8482;, Fortesta &#174; &#32;Gel, Testim &#174; , Aveed &#174; , Supprelin &#174; &#32;LA, XIAFLEX &#174; &#32;for the treatment of Peyronie&#8217;s disease and XIAFLEX &#174; &#32;for Dupuytren&#8217;s contracture, among others. For a more detailed description of each of our products, see &#8220; Products Overview .&#8221; 

Research and development expertise. &#32;Our research and development efforts are focused on the development of a balanced, diversified portfolio of innovative and clinically differentiated products. The acquisition of Auxilium added multiple, strategically-aligned programs to our branded pharmaceutical research and development pipeline with the addition of XIAFLEX &#174; . Through our Par and Qualitest businesses, we seek out and develop high-barrier-to-entry generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities. We remain committed to research and development across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined regulatory pathways. Our current research and development pipeline consists of products in various stages of development. In the United States, the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals &#32;segment has over 250 &#32;products in our pipeline, which include approximately 130 &#32;Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) pending with the FDA, including 38 &#32;potential first-to-file and first-to-market opportunities. In addition, we have submitted applications for regulatory approval of various products in our international markets. For a more detailed description of our development pipeline, see &#8220; Select Products in Development .&#8221; 

At December 31, 2015 , our research and development and regulatory affairs staff consisted of 597 &#32;employees, based primarily in Huntsville, Alabama, Chestnut Ridge, New York, Chennai, India, at our global headquarters in Dublin, Ireland and at our U.S. headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania. Our research and development expenses were $102.2 million , $112.7 million &#32;and $97.5 million &#32;in 2015 , 2014 &#32;and 2013 , respectively, including upfront and milestone payments of $9.2 million , $37.9 million &#32;and $11.4 million , respectively. 

Targeted sales and marketing infrastructure. &#32;We market our products directly to physicians through a dedicated and contracted sales force of over 1,200 &#32;individuals, the majority of which are in the United States. We market our products to primary care physicians and specialty physicians, including those specializing in pain management, orthopedics, neurology, rheumatology, surgery, anesthesiology, urology and pediatric endocrinology. Our sales force also targets retail pharmacies and other healthcare professionals. We distribute our products principally through independent wholesale distributors, but we also sell directly to retailers, clinics, government agencies, doctors, independent retail and specialty pharmacies and independent specialty distributors. Revenue related to independent specialty pharmacies during the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 3% of the Company&#8217;s overall 2015 revenue. &#32;Our marketing policy is designed to provide that products and relevant, appropriate medical information are immediately available to physicians, pharmacies, hospitals, public and private payers, and appropriate healthcare professionals. We work to gain access to healthcare authority, pharmacy benefit managers and managed care organizations&#8217; formularies (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products), including Medicare Part D plans and reimbursement lists by demonstrating the qualities and treatment benefits of our products within their approved indications. 

Cash flow from operations. &#32;We have historically generated significant cash flow from operations due to a unique combination of strong brand equity and attractive margins. While we expect our core business to continue to generate significant cash flow from operations, these cash flows have been adversely impacted and may continue to be adversely impacted by certain payments related to mesh legal settlements and other items. For the year &#32;ended December 31, 2015 , we generated $62.0 million &#32;of cash from operations. Significant non-core or infrequent pre-tax cash outlays made during 2015 include $699.3 million &#32;of previously accrued mesh-related product liability and other litigation matters payments; $78.4 million &#32;related to unused commitment fees paid associated primarily with financing for the Par acquisition; $73.7 million &#32;of cash paid related to restructuring initiatives; $31.5 million &#32;related to redemption fees paid in connection with debt retirements and $191.2 million &#32;of transaction costs and certain integration costs. Partially offsetting these cash outlays were U.S. Federal tax refunds received of $155.8 million . 

We expect to continue to maintain sufficient liquidity to give us flexibility to make strategic investments in our business and to service our liabilities. As of December 31, 2015 , we had $276.2 million &#32;of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and up to approximately $773.0 million &#32;of availability under the revolving credit facilities. In addition, at December 31, 2015 , our restricted cash and cash equivalents includes $579.0 million &#32;held in Qualified Settlement Funds for mesh product liability settlement agreements, which is expected to be paid to qualified claimants within the next twelve months. 

Experienced and dedicated management team. &#32;Our senior management team has a proven track record of building businesses, including through licensing and acquisitions. Their expertise has contributed to identifying, consummating and integrating such acquisitions. Since February 2013, members of our management team have led the consummation of over ten acquisitions. 

Our Areas of Focus 

Branded Pharmaceutical Products Markets 

Pain Management Market 

Endo has a number of key treatment offerings within the Pain Management Market. Our treatment offerings currently are in two key areas: Chronic Pain, which includes the launch of BELBUCA&#8482; and other products, including OPANA &#174; &#32;ER and Percocet &#174; , in the opioid analgesics segment and Lidoderm &#174; , which is marketed for the relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia; and Osteoarthritis (OA) Pain which is focused on Voltaren &#174; &#32;Gel. 

The total U.S. market for pain management pharmaceuticals, excluding over-the-counter products, totaled $38.2 billion &#32;in 2015 . This represents an approximate 11% &#32;compounded annual growth rate since 2011 . Our primary area of focus within this market is analgesics. In 2015 , analgesics were the third &#32;most prescribed medication in the U.S. with 288 million &#32;prescriptions written for this classification. The analgesic non-narcotic and anti-arthritic markets had over 166 million &#32;prescriptions written in 2015 , representing approximately 42% &#32;of the U.S. prescription pain management market. Opioid analgesics are a segment that comprised approximately 88% &#32;of the total analgesic prescriptions for 2015 &#32;and represented about 58% &#32;of the overall U.S. prescription pain management market. Total U.S. sales for the opioid analgesic segment were approximately $9.1 billion &#32;in 2015 , representing a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 1% &#32;since 2011 . The U.S. sales for the analgesic non-narcotic and anti-arthritic markets were approximately $29.2 billion &#32;with a compound annual growth rate of approximately 16% &#32;since 2011 . 

Specialty Pharmaceuticals Market 

Endo also commercializes a number of products within the market served by specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies, and in which healthcare practitioners (HCPs) can purchase and bill payors directly (the buy and bill market). Our treatment offerings currently are in two distinct areas: Urology, which focuses mainly on XIAFLEX &#174; &#32;for the treatment of Peyronie&#8217;s disease; and in Orthopedics/Pediatric Endocrinology, focusing on XIAFLEX &#174; &#32;for Dupuytren&#8217;s contracture and Supprelin &#174; LA for Central Precocious Puberty (CPP). 

Peyronie's Disease (PD)&#8212; PD is a condition that involves the development of collagen plaque, or scar tissue, on the shaft of the penis. The scar tissue, known as a Peyronie's plaque, may harden and reduce flexibility, which may cause bending or arching of the penis during erection. PD can result in varying degrees of penile curvature deformity and disease bother, which encompasses concern about erection appearance, erection pain and the impact of PD on intercourse and on frequency of intercourse. PD is a disease with an initial inflammatory component. This inflammatory phase is poorly understood with a somewhat variable disease course and spontaneous resolution occurring in an estimated 20% &#32;of cases. After approximately 12 months of disease, the disease is reported to often develop into a more chronic, stable phase. The incidence of PD is estimated between 3% &#32;and 9% &#32;of the population; however the disease is believed to be underdiagnosed and undertreated. 

Dupuytren's contracture (DC)&#8212; DC is a progressive condition that limits hand function, diminishes quality of life, and may ultimately disable the hand through the inability to move or straighten one&#8217;s finger or fingers. It is caused by an abnormal buildup of collagen. In people with DC, this collagen builds up over time and can thicken into a rope-like cord in the palm that contracts the finger. DC is a genetic condition and the incidence of DC is estimated to be between 3% &#32;and 9% &#32;of the population among adult Caucasians. DC is more common in men than in women, and increases in incidence with age. 

Central Precocious Puberty (CPP)&#8212; Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of developmental signs of sexual maturation earlier than would be expected based on population norms. This is typically delineated as puberty onset before eight years in girls and nine years in boys. In its most common form, central precocious puberty (CPP), sexual maturation proceeds from a premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. The HPG axis is active during infancy, dormant during childhood, and reactivated at the onset of puberty. 

The epidemiology of CPP is somewhat nebulous, with a commonly cited prevalence range of one in 5,000 to one in 10,000 children. CPP is known to occur more frequently in girls than in boys and has different predominant causes for each sex. Idiopathic CPP, without an identifiable predisposing condition, accounts for the majority of cases of precocious puberty in girls, but is less frequent in boys. Central nervous system findings such as tumors and congenital malformations are more frequently observed in boys who present with central precocious puberty. It is estimated that two thirds of precocious puberty cases in boys are due to neurological abnormalities. The likelihood of an organic cause for CPP is greater in patients who present at younger ages. 

Urology Market 

Endo has a number of key treatment offerings within the urology markets, specifically the men&#8217;s health sector with testosterone replacement therapies (TRT). 

In the U.S. alone, the prevalence of hypogonadism is approximately 8% of men above 50 years of age, however, only approximately 9% of those affected are currently being treated. By 2025, there will be approximately 6.5 million American men 30-80 years of age who are diagnosed with androgen deficiency. Hypogonadism, or low testosterone, is under diagnosed and under treated. 

Factors contributing to this include a lack of screening for low testosterone and the perceived risk of prostate cancer associated with current treatment strategies. In the U.S., TRT sales were approximately $1.9 billion &#32;in 2015. For TRT, our treatment offerings include the long-acting products Aveed &#174; , which was launched in March 2014 and TESTOPEL &#174; . In addition, our TRT treatment offerings include our gel products such as Fortesta &#174; &#32;Gel and the authorized generic of Fortesta &#174; &#32;Gel, which launched in September 2014, and Testim &#174; . 

Generic Pharmaceuticals Market 

Our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals &#32;segment consists of a differentiated product portfolio including high-barrier-to-entry products, first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. The product offerings of this segment include products in the pain management, urology, Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders, immunosuppression, oncology, women&#8217;s health and cardiovascular disease markets, among others. Additionally, in May 2014, we launched an authorized generic lidocaine patch 5% (referred to as Lidoderm &#174; &#32;authorized generic). 

International Pharmaceuticals Market 

Our International Pharmaceuticals segment includes a variety of specialty pharmaceutical products for the Canadian, Latin American, South African and world markets, which we acquired in the Paladin acquisition in February 2014, the Somar acquisition in July 2014 and the Aspen Holdings acquisition in October 2015. 

Medical Device Markets 

Through our Astora business, we offer a broad array of medical devices that deliver innovative medical technology solutions to physicians treating female incontinence and pelvic floor repair. 

Female incontinence&#8212; We estimate over 500 million &#32;women worldwide suffer from urinary or fecal incontinence. These diseases can lead to debilitating medical and social problems, ranging from embarrassment to anxiety and depression. There are three types of urinary incontinence: stress, urge, and mixed incontinence (a combination of stress and urge). Our current products in the market treat stress incontinence, which generally results from a weakening of the tissue surrounding the bladder and urethra which can be a result of pregnancy, childbirth and aging. Urge incontinence is more complex and currently not as well understood. Pads and diapers are often used to contain and absorb leaks, and may be acceptable for controlling mild incontinence. Drug therapy and electrical nerve stimulation are currently used to treat urge incontinence. We currently market the Monarc TM subfascial hammock as an option for patients with this condition. 

Pelvic floor repair&#8212; Pregnancy, labor, and childbirth are some of the primary causes of pelvic floor prolapse and other pelvic floor disorders. Prolapse and other pelvic floor defects may be treated with a variety of open, laparoscopic, and transvaginal surgeries. Procedures to repair pelvic floor prolapse in women have historically been performed through the use of suture and graft materials designed for other surgical applications. Astora offers less invasive solutions for pelvic floor repair, including the Elevate TM &#32;transvaginal pelvic floor repair system. 

The operating results of Astora are reported as Discontinued Operations, net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.

Pain Management 

Lidoderm &#174; . &#32;Lidoderm &#174; &#32;was launched in September 1999. A topical patch product containing lidocaine, Lidoderm &#174; &#32;was the first U.S. Food &#38; Drug Administration (FDA) approved product for the relief of the pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia, a condition thought to result after nerve fibers are damaged during a case of Herpes Zoster (commonly known as shingles). In May 2012, we entered into a settlement and license agreement with Allergan, plc (Allergan), formerly known as Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Watson) and Actavis plc (Actavis), which allowed Allergan to launch its lidocaine patch 5%, a generic version of Lidoderm &#174; &#32;on September 15, 2013. In May 2014, the Company's U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment launched its authorized generic of Lidoderm &#174; . In August 2015 Mylan launched a generic version of Lidoderm &#174; . 

OPANA &#174; &#32;ER . OPANA &#174; &#32;ER is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. OPANA &#174; &#32;ER represents the first drug in which oxymorphone is available in an oral, extended-release formulation and is available in 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg tablets. In December 2011, the FDA approved a new formulation of OPANA &#174; &#32;ER with INTAC &#174; &#32;technology. This formulation of OPANA &#174; &#32;ER with INTAC &#174; &#32;technology has the same dosage strengths, color and packaging and similar tablet size as original OPANA &#174; &#32;ER. Endo transitioned to this formulation in March 2012 upon successfully accelerating its production. Launches of competing generic versions of the non-crush-resistant formulation OPANA &#174; &#32;ER, which began in early 2013, adversely affected our results of operations. However, in August 2015 the U.S. District Court issued a ruling upholding two of the Company&#8217;s patents covering OPANA &#174; &#32;ER. As a result, it is expected that the generic version of non-crush resistant OPANA &#174; &#32;ER currently sold by Allergan will be removed from the market and additional approved but not yet marketed generic versions of the product developed by other generic companies will not be launched in the near term. &#32; 

Percocet &#174; . Launched in 1976, Percocet &#174; &#32;is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-moderately severe pain. 

Voltaren &#174; &#32; Gel. &#32;On March 4, 2008, the Company entered into the 2008 Voltaren &#174; &#32;Gel Agreement, which was a license and supply agreement with and among Novartis AG and Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. to obtain the exclusive U.S. marketing rights for the prescription medicine Voltaren &#174; &#32;Gel. On December 11, 2015, Endo, Novartis AG and Sandoz entered into the 2015 Voltaren &#174; &#32;Gel Agreement ) effectively renewing Endo&#8217;s exclusive U.S. marketing and license rights to commercialize Voltaren &#174; &#32;Gel through June 30, 2023. Voltaren &#174; &#32;Gel received regulatory approval in October 2007 from the FDA, becoming the first topical prescription treatment for the relief of joint pain of osteoarthritis in the knees, ankles, feet, elbows, wrists, and hands and became the first new product approved in the U.S. for osteoarthritis since 2001. It was the first prescription topical osteoarthritis treatment to have proven its effectiveness in 

both the knees and joints of the hands through clinical trials. Voltaren &#174; &#32;Gel delivers effective pain relief with a favorable safety profile as its systemic absorption is 94% &#32;less than the comparable oral diclofenac treatment. It is now the most prescribed FDA-approved topical NSAID for the relief of osteoarthritis pain. 

Specialty Pharmaceuticals 

Supprelin &#174; &#32;LA. &#32;Supprelin &#174; &#32;LA was launched in the U.S. in June 2007. Supprelin &#174; &#32;LA is a soft, flexible 12-month hydrogel implant based on our hydrogel polymer technology that delivers histrelin acetate, a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and is indicated for the treatment of CPP in children. CPP is the early onset of puberty in young children resulting in the development of secondary sex characteristics and, if left untreated, can result in diminished adult height attainment. The development of these secondary sex characteristics is due to an increase in the secretion of sex hormones, the cause of which is unknown. We market Supprelin &#174; &#32;LA in the U.S. through a specialty sales force primarily to pediatric endocrinologists. 

XIAFLEX &#174; . XIAFLEX &#174; &#32;was launched in 2010 for the treatment of adult patients with Dupuytren&#8217;s Contracture (DC) with an abnormal buildup of collagen in the fingers which limits or disables hand function. It is also indicated for the treatment of adult men with Peyronie&#8217;s Disease (PD) with a collagen plaque and a penile curvature deformity of thirty degrees or greater at the start of therapy. XIAFLEX &#174; &#32;was launched in the U.S. for PD in January 2014 and is the first and only FDA-approved non-surgical treatment for PD. 

Urology 

Fortesta &#174; &#32;Gel and Fortesta &#174; Gel Authorized Generic. &#32;Fortesta &#174; &#32;Gel is a patented two percent (2%) testosterone transdermal gel and is a treatment for men suffering from hypogonadism, also known as low testosterone (Low-T). The precision-metered dose delivery system can be accurately customized and adjusted to meet individual patient needs with the appropriate dose. In August 2009, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement (the ProStrakan Agreement) with Strakan International Limited, a subsidiary of ProStrakan Group plc (ProStrakan), for the exclusive right to commercialize Fortesta &#174; &#32;Gel in the U.S. Fortesta &#174; &#32;Gel was approved by the FDA in December 2010. We launched Fortesta &#174; &#32;Gel in the first quarter of 2011. During the third quarter of 2014, Endo announced that it had introduced the first and only generic 2% topical testosterone gel, an authorized generic of Fortesta &#174; &#32;Gel. 

Testim &#174; and Testim &#174; &#32;Authorized Generic. Testim &#174; &#32;is a topical gel indicated for TRT in conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. 

Actavis Royalty 

Actavis Royalty. Royalty income from Actavis, under the terms of the Watson Settlement Agreement, based on Actavis&#8217; gross profit generated on sales of its generic version of Lidoderm &#174; , which commenced on September 16, 2013 and ceased in May 2014, upon our launch of the Lidoderm &#174; &#32;authorized generic.

Sumavel &#174; &#32;DosePro &#174; is a needle-free injection that comes in two doses (4 mg and 6 mg) and is delivered subcutaneously to patients. 

Aveed &#174; . &#32;Aveed &#174; &#32;is a novel, long-acting testosterone undecanoate for injection for the treatment of Low-T. Aveed &#174; &#32;is dosed only five times per year after the first month of therapy. In a clinical trial, nearly all men who received Aveed &#174; &#32;maintained average testosterone levels within the normal range for 10 full weeks after the third injection. Aveed &#174; &#32;was approved by the FDA and launched in March 2014. 

TESTOPEL &#174; . &#32;TESTOPEL &#174; &#32;is a unique, long-acting implantable pellet indicated for TRT in conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. 

BELBUCA&#8482;. &#32;BELBUCA&#8482; was approved by the FDA in October 2015, for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. BELBUCA&#8482; became commercially available in the U.S. during February 2016. 

U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals 

Generic drugs are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of branded products and are generally marketed under their generic (chemical) names rather than by brand names. Typically, a generic drug may not be marketed until the expiration of applicable patent(s) on the corresponding branded product, unless a resolution of patent litigation results in an earlier opportunity to enter the market. Generic drugs are the same as branded products in dosage form, safety, efficacy, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use, but they are sold generally at prices below those of the corresponding branded products. Generic drugs provide a cost-effective alternative for consumers, while maintaining the same high quality, efficacy, safety profile, purity and stability of the branded product. An ANDA is required to be filed and approved by the FDA in order to manufacture a generic drug for sale in the United States. We sell generic products primarily in the United States across multiple therapeutic categories. 

We have a generics portfolio across an extensive range of dosage forms and delivery systems, including immediate and extended release oral solids (tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, capsules and powders), injectables, liquids, nasal sprays, ophthalmics (which are sterile pharmaceutical preparations administered for ocular conditions) and transdermal patches (which are medicated adhesive patches designed to deliver the drug through the skin). 

We have development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities in the rapidly growing U.S. market for sterile drug products, such as injectable products, ophthalmics, and sterile vial and hormonal handling capabilities. These capabilities afford us a broader and more diversified product portfolio and a greater selection of targets for potential development. We target products with limited competition for reasons such as manufacturing complexity or the market size, which make our sterile products a key growth driver of our generics portfolio and complementary to our other generic product offerings. 

Authorized generics are generic versions of branded drugs licensed by brand drug companies under a NDA and marketed as generics. Authorized generics do not face any regulatory barriers to introduction and are not prohibited from sale during the 180-day marketing exclusivity period granted to the first-to-file ANDA applicant. The sale of authorized generics adversely impacts the market share of a generic product that has been granted 180 days of marketing exclusivity. We believe we are a partner of choice to larger brand companies seeking an authorized generics distributor for their branded products. We have been the authorized generic distributor for such companies as AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Merck &#38; Co in the recent past. 

International Pharmaceuticals 

Our International Pharmaceuticals &#32;segment includes a variety of specialty pharmaceutical products for the Canadian, Mexican, South African and world markets.

Select Products in Development 

U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals 

XIAFLEX &#174; &#32;(collagenase clostridium histolyticum or CCH) is currently approved and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both Dupuytren&#8217;s Contracture and Peyronie&#8217;s Disease (two separate indications). We are progressing development programs in several other indications which are ongoing, including cellulite, Dupuytren&#8217;s Nodules, Adhesive Capsulitis and canine lipomas, and have recently opted into two additional new indications, Plantar Fibromatosis and Lateral Hip Fat, which we are planning to initiate Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) in 2016 pending discussions with the FDA. We are progressing the cellulite development program into Phase 2b following meetings held with the FDA in December 2014 and a subsequent follow-up meeting in December 2015, with the Phase 2b study anticipated to begin enrolling subjects in the first quarter of 2016. We are planning to progress the Dupuytren&#8217;s Nodules program following a meeting with the FDA in January 2016. In addition, we will be receiving written comments from FDA on its proposed Adhesive Capsulitis program by March 11, 2016. The Company has opted in to the development of CCH in canine lipomas. 

U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals 

Our primary approach to generic pharmaceuticals product development is to target high-barrier-to-entry generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities. A first-to-file product refers to an ANDA that is the first ANDA filed containing a Paragraph IV patent challenge to the corresponding branded product, which offers the opportunity for 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity if we are successful in litigating the patent challenge and receive final FDA approval of the product. A first-to-market product refers to a product that is the first marketed generic equivalent of a branded product for reasons apart from statutory marketing exclusivity, such as the generic equivalent of a branded product that is difficult to formulate or manufacture. Our potential first-to-file and first-to-market opportunities account for approximately a third &#32;of our pipeline of ANDAs. We expect that these potential first-to-file and first-to-market opportunities will result in product launches that are either exclusive or have two or fewer competitors, which we believe leads to more sustainable market share and profitability for our product portfolio. 

The timing of final FDA approval of ANDA applications depends on a variety of factors, including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the manufacturer of the reference listed drug is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which the FDA is prohibited from approving generic equivalents. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block ANDAs from being approved on the patent expiration date. The time required to obtain FDA approval of ANDAs is on average currently approximately 40 months after initial filing. 

As of December 31, 2015, we had over 250 &#32;products in our pipeline, which included approximately 130 &#32;ANDAs pending with the FDA representing $37.0 billion &#32;of combined annual sales for the corresponding branded products in 2015, including 38 &#32;potential first-to-file and first-to-market opportunities. We conduct our research and development activities in our New York and India facilities to concentrate internal generic research and development effort on completing generic products currently in development that are expected to yield future product launches into markets with limited projected competition. 

Planned 2016 product launches include ezetimibe tablets (generic version of Zetia &#174; ), which is a first-to-file product with an associated brand value of approximately $2.0 billion , quetiapine ER tablets (generic version of Seroquel &#174; &#32;XR), which is a first-to-file product with an associated brand value of approximately $1.0 billion , and rosuvastatin tablets (generic version of Crestor &#174; ) with an associated brand value of approximately $6.0 billion . 

International Pharmaceuticals 

We have submitted applications for regulatory approval of various products in our international markets, including RLX030 (serelaxin). RLX030 is a novel treatment for acute heart failure. Phase II and III studies suggested RLX030 helped patients with acute heart failure live longer. A second ongoing Phase III study follows a request from Canadian regulators for more evidence of the therapy&#8217;s efficacy, with results expected by 2017. 

Competition 

Branded Pharmaceuticals 

The branded pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Our products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the U.S. and internationally through our Paladin, Somar and Litha businesses. Our competitors vary depending upon therapeutic and product categories. Competitors include many of the major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceuticals. In the market for branded pharmaceuticals, our competitors, including Abbott Laboratories (Abbott), Allergan plc (Allergan), Purdue Pharma, L.P. (Purdue), Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Jazz), Shire plc (Shire), Horizon Pharma 

plc (Horizon), and Mallinckrodt plc (Mallinckrodt), among others , vary depending on product category, dosage strength and drug-delivery systems. 

We compete principally through our acquisition and in-licensing strategies and targeted product development. The competitive landscape in the acquisition and in-licensing of pharmaceutical products has intensified in recent years as there has been a reduction in the number of compounds available and an increase in the number of companies and the collective resources bidding on available assets. In addition to product development and acquisitions, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical industry include product efficacy, safety, ease of use, price, demonstrated cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, service, reputation and access to technical information. 

The competitive environment of the branded product business requires us to continually seek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively. However, some of our current branded products not only face competition from other brands, but also from generic versions. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than research-based pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. 

We are aware of certain competitive activities involving OPANA &#174; &#32;ER and other products. For a description of these competitive activities, including the litigation related to Paragraph IV Certification Notices, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies &#32;in the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in Part IV, Item 15. of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" . 

Generic Pharmaceuticals 

In the generic pharmaceutical market, we face intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand name pharmaceutical companies through authorized generics, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. In the market for generic pharmaceuticals, our competitors, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (Teva), Mylan, Inc. (Mylan), and Impax Laboratories, Inc. (Impax), vary depending on product category and dosage strength. 

Our primary strategy is to compete in the generic product market with a focus on high-value, first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities, regardless of therapeutic category, and products that present significant barriers to entry for reasons such as complex formulation, regulatory or legal challenges or difficulty in raw material sourcing. By specializing in high barrier to entry products, we endeavor to market more profitable and longer-lived products relative to commodity generic products. We believe that our competitive advantages include our integrated team-based approach to product development that combines our formulation, regulatory, legal, manufacturing and commercial capabilities; our ability to introduce new generic equivalents for brand-name drugs; our quality and cost-effective production; our ability to meet customer expectations; and the breadth of our existing generic product portfolio offering. 

We make a significant amount of our sales to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers and retail drug chains. These customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain of our pharmaceutical products. Drug wholesalers and retail drug chains have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation. This consolidation resulted in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and other drug distributors, and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions, enable those groups to demand larger price discounts on our products. For example, there has been a recent trend of large wholesalers and retailer customers forming partnerships, such as the alliance between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, the alliance between Rite Aid and McKesson Drug Company and the alliance between CVS and Cardinal Health. As a result of this consolidation among wholesale distributors as well as the growth of large retail drug store chains, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market. This has resulted in our customers gaining more purchasing power. Consequently, there is heightened competition among generic drug producers for the business of this smaller and more selective customer base. 

Newly introduced generic products with limited or no other generic competition typically garner higher prices. At the expiration of the exclusivity period, other generic distributors may enter the market, resulting in a significant price decline for the drug. Consequently, the maintenance of profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends, in part, on our ability to select, develop and launch new generic products in a timely and cost efficient manner and to maintain efficient, high quality manufacturing capabilities. 

Seasonality 

Although our business is affected by the purchasing patterns and concentration of our customers, our business is not materially impacted by seasonality. 

Major Customers 

We primarily sell our branded pharmaceuticals and generics directly to a limited number of large pharmacy chains and through a limited number of wholesale drug distributors who, in turn, supply products to pharmacies, hospitals, governmental agencies and physicians. Total revenues from customers that accounted for 10% &#32;or more of our total consolidated revenues during the years &#32;ended December 31 &#32;are as follows: 

&#160;

Revenues from these customers are included within our U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals , U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals &#32;and International Pharmaceuticals &#32;segments. 

As a result of consolidation among wholesale distributors as well as rapid growth of large retail drug store chains, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market, and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased. Some wholesale distributors have demanded that pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us, enter into distribution service agreements (DSAs) pursuant to which the wholesale distributors provide the pharmaceutical manufacturers with specific services, including the provision of periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels and other information. We have entered into certain of these agreements. 

Revenue related to independent specialty pharmacies during the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 3% of the Company&#8217;s overall 2015 revenue. 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Proprietary Property 

As of February 19, 2016 , we held approximately: 352 &#32;U.S. issued patents, 190 &#32;U.S. patent applications pending, 856 &#32;foreign issued patents, and 510 &#32;foreign patent applications pending. In addition, as of February 19, 2016 , we have licenses for approximately 81 &#32;U.S. issued patents, 56 &#32;U.S. patent applications pending, 334 &#32;foreign issued patents and 139 &#32;foreign patent applications pending.

* Our exclusive license agreements extend to or beyond the patent expiration dates. 

The effect of these issued patents is that they provide us with patent protection for the claims covered by the patents. The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Accordingly, we do not know whether any of the applications we acquire or license will result in the issuance of patents, or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated. Because unissued U.S. patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of eighteen months and U.S. patent applications filed prior to November 29, 2000 are not disclosed until such patents are issued, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference and other inter parties proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention, or in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office, either of which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that any patents, if issued, will be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using such technology. 

We believe that our patents, the protection of discoveries in connection with our development activities, our proprietary products, technologies, processes and know-how and all of our intellectual property are important to our business. All of our brand products and certain generic products, such as Endocet &#174; &#32;and Endodan &#174; &#32;are sold under trademarks. To achieve a competitive position, we rely on trade secrets, non-patented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation, where patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or attainable. In addition, as outlined above, we have a number of patent licenses from third parties, some of which may be important to our business. See Note 11. License and Collaboration Agreements &#32;in the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in Part IV, Item 15. of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" . There can be no assurance that any of our patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights will afford us any protection from competition. 

We rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties to protect, among other things, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that other third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and other intellectual property. 

We may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our intellectual property or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation is costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that we will prevail in any such litigation. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies &#32;in the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in Part IV, Item 15. of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" . 

Governmental Regulation 

United States Food and Drug Administration and Drug Enforcement Agency 

In the United States, the development, testing, manufacture, holding, packaging, labeling, distribution, marketing, and sales of our products and our ongoing product development activities are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, injunctions, refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts or to approve NDAs, ANDAs and Biologics License Applications (BLAs), civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 

FDA approval is typically required before any new drug can be marketed. An NDA or BLA is a filing submitted to the FDA to obtain approval of new chemical entities and other innovations for which thorough applied research is required to demonstrate safety and effectiveness in use. The process generally involves: 

&#8226; 

Completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA&#8217;s Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations; 

&#8226; 

Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.; 

&#8226; 

Approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) before each trial may be initiated, and continuing review during the trial; 

&#8226; 

Performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (GCPs) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use; 

&#8226; 

Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA; 

&#8226; 

Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the product&#8217;s manufacturing processes and facility or facilities to assess compliance with the FDA&#8217;s current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations, and/or review of the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) section of the NDA or BLA to require that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug&#8217;s identity, strength, quality, purity and potency; 

&#8226; 

Satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and 

&#8226; 

Approval by the FDA of the NDA or BLA. 

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. 

&#8226; 

Phase I generally involves testing the product for safety, adverse effects, dosage, tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and other elements of clinical pharmacology. 

&#8226; 

Phase II trials typically involve a small sample of the intended patient population to assess the efficacy of the compound for a specific indication, to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range as well as to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects. 

&#8226; 

Phase III trials are undertaken in an expanded patient population at typically dispersed study sites, in order to determine the overall risk-benefit ratio of the compound and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

Each trial is conducted in accordance with certain standards under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 

Data from preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in an NDA or BLA for marketing approval and to foreign government health authorities in a marketing authorization application, consistent with each health authority&#8217;s specific regulatory requirements. Clinical trials are also subject to regulatory inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory standards. The process of completing clinical trials for a new drug may take many years and require the expenditures of substantial resources. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;- &#8220; The pharmaceutical and medical device industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business ,&#8221; for further discussion on FDA approval. As a condition of approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require further studies, including Phase IV post-marketing studies or post-marketing data reporting. Results of post-marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of the products. 

For some drugs, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or other elements to make certain safe use. In February 2009, the FDA sent letters to manufacturers of certain opioid drug products, indicating that these drugs will be required to have a REMS designed to reduce risks 

and improve the safe use of certain opioid drug products. Three products sold by Endo were included in the list of affected opioid drugs: OPANA &#174; &#32;ER, morphine sulfate ER and oxycodone ER. In 2011, the FDA sent another letter requiring that the manufacturers of these drugs develop and submit to the FDA a post-market REMS plan. The FDA approved a class-wide extended-release/long-acting REMS in July 2012. The goal of this REMS is to reduce serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, misuse and abuse of extended-release or long-acting opioid analgesics while maintaining patient access to pain medications. The REMS includes a Medication Guide, Elements to Assure Safe Use and annual REMS Assessment Reports. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;- &#8220; The pharmaceutical and medical device industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business &#8221;, for further discussion. In recent years, the FDA has taken steps to reduce the maximum strength of acetaminophen in prescription combination drug products to help reduce or prevent the risk of liver injury from an unintentional overdose of acetaminophen. Among the Company&#8217;s products impacted by the FDA&#8217;s actions were three branded combination drug pain relief products: Percocet &#174; , Endocet &#174; &#32;and Zydone &#174; ; and the generic combination drug pain relief products: butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine, hydrocodone/acetaminophen and oxycodone/acetaminophen. 

In most instances, FDA approval of an ANDA is required before a generic equivalent of an existing or reference-listed drug can be marketed. The ANDA process is abbreviated in that the FDA waives the requirement of conducting complete preclinical and clinical studies and generally instead relies principally on bioequivalence studies. Bioequivalence generally involves a comparison of the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body with those of the previously approved drug. When the rate and extent of absorption of systemically acting test and reference drugs are the same, the two drugs are considered bioequivalent and are generally regarded as therapeutically equivalent, meaning that a pharmacist can substitute the product for the reference-listed drug. Under certain circumstances, an ANDA may also be submitted for a product authorized by approval of an ANDA suitability petition. Such petitions may be submitted to secure authorization to file an ANDA for a product that differs from a previously approved drug in active ingredient, route of administration, dosage form or strength. In September 2007 and July 2012, Congress re-authorized pediatric testing legislation, which may continue to affect pharmaceutical firms&#8217; ability to file ANDAs via the suitability petition route. The timing of final FDA approval of ANDA applications depends on a variety of factors, including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the manufacturer of the reference listed drug is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which the FDA is prohibited from approving generic products. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block ANDAs from being approved on the patent expiration date. 

Certain of our products are or in the future could be regulated and marketed as biologic products pursuant to BLAs. Our BLA-licensed products were licensed based on a determination by the FDA of safety, purity, and potency as required under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Although the ANDA framework referenced above does not apply to generics of BLA-licensed biologics, in 2010, Congress enacted the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), as part of the Healthcare Reform Law, which amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated licensure pathway for products deemed to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with FDA-licensed reference biological products. Under the BPCIA, following the expiration of a 12-year reference exclusivity period, FDA may license under section 351(k) of the PHSA a biologic that it determines is biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHSA. Biosimilarity is defined to mean that the section 351(k) product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the section 351(k) product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. To be considered interchangeable, a product must be biosimilar to the reference product, be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient, and, if administered more than once to an individual, the risks in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the product and its reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch. 

Once any reference exclusivity period for our BLA-licensed biologics expires, FDA may approve under section 351(k) of the PHSA another company&#8217;s BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our product. Although licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable under section 351(k) is generally expected to require less than the full complement of product-specific preclinical and clinical data required for innovator products licensed under section 351(a), FDA has considerable discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence required to demonstrate biosimilarity and interchangeability, and the agency has yet to issue regulations setting forth specific criteria for licensure of biosimilar or interchangeable products. Consequently, many questions remain about FDA&#8217;s interpretation of the BPCIA licensure framework, as well as about the potential commercial impact of biosimilar and interchangeable biologics licensed under section 351(k) of the PHSA. 

Based on scientific developments, post-market experience, or other legislative or regulatory changes, the current FDA standards of review for approving new pharmaceutical products are sometimes more stringent than those that were applied in the past, including to certain opioid products. As a result, the FDA does not have as extensive safety databases on these products as on some products developed more recently. Accordingly, we believe the FDA has expressed an intention to develop such databases for certain of these products, including many opioids. 

We cannot determine what effect changes in the FDA&#8217;s laws or regulations, when and if promulgated, or changes in the FDA&#8217;s legal or regulatory interpretations or requirements, may have on our business in the future. Changes could, among other things, require 

expanded or different labeling, additional testing, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, and additional record keeping. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;- &#8220; The pharmaceutical and medical device industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business &#8221;, for further discussion. In September 2013, the FDA announced class-wide safety labeling changes and new post-market study requirements for all extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioids. Among other things, the updated indication states that because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, even at recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death, these drugs should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain; ER/LA opioid analgesics are not indicated for as-needed pain relief. The FDA is also requiring drug companies that make these products to conduct further studies and clinical trials to further assess the known serious risks of misuse, abuse, increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia), addiction, overdose, and death. It is not presently known what impact, if any, these changes to the indications for use or results from the post-marketing studies may have on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

A sponsor of an NDA is required to identify in its application any patent that claims the drug or a use of the drug subject to the application. Upon NDA approval, the FDA lists these patents in a publication referred to as the Orange Book. Any person that files a Section 505(b)(2) NDA, the type of NDA that may rely upon the data in the application for which the patents are listed, or an ANDA to secure approval of a generic version of this first, or listed drug, must make a certification in respect to listed patents. The FDA may not approve such an application for the drug until expiration of the listed patents unless (1) the generic applicant certifies that the listed patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the proposed generic drug and gives notice to the holder of the NDA for the listed drug of the basis upon which the patents are challenged, and (2) the holder of the listed drug does not sue the later applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receipt of notice. Under the current law, if an infringement suit is filed, the FDA may not approve the later application until the earliest of: 30 months after submission; entry of an appellate court judgment holding the patent invalid, unenforceable or not infringed; such time as the court may order; or the patent expires. 

One of the key motivators for challenging patents is the 180-day market exclusivity period vis-&#225;-vis other generic applicants granted to the developer of a generic version of a product that is the first to have its application accepted for filing by the FDA and whose filing includes a certification that the applicable patent(s) are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed (a Paragraph IV certification) and that prevails in litigation with the manufacturer of the branded product over the applicable patent(s). Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (2003 Medicare Act), with accompanying amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act (Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act), this marketing exclusivity would begin to run upon the earlier of the commercial launch of the generic product or upon an appellate court decision in the generic company&#8217;s favor. In addition, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to certain non-patent exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a competing generic product or 505(b)(2) NDA product. 

Numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory agencies, regulate the development, clinical testing, design, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, marketing, distribution and servicing of our medical devices. In the U.S., under the FFDCA, medical devices, such as those manufactured by AMS are classified into Class I, II, or III depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide for safety and effectiveness. Generally, Class I includes devices with the least risk and Class III includes those with the greatest risk and that are subject to the most extensive controls. Class I medical devices are subject to the FDA&#8217;s general controls, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA&#8217;s Quality System regulations, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA&#8217;s general controls and may also be subject to other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to provide for the safety and effectiveness of the device. Class III medical devices are subject to the FDA&#8217;s general controls, special controls, and premarket approval prior to marketing. Uncleared or unapproved medical devices generally cannot be shipped within the U.S. unless they meet a specific regulatory exemption, such as shipments for clinical testing purposes which comply with the FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. 

Medical devices can be marketed as Class I, II and III. If a device is classified as Class I or II, and if it is not otherwise exempt, its manufacturer will have to undertake the premarket notification process in order to obtain marketing clearance, also referred to as the &#8220;510(k) process.&#8221; When a 510(k) is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to either a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, the date upon which the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 were enacted, or to another commercially available, similar device which was subsequently cleared through the 510(k) process. 

Class III devices are approved through a Premarket Approval Application (PMA), under which the applicant must submit data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to the FDA that demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use(s). All of our marketed devices have been approved or cleared for marketing pursuant to a PMA or the 510(k) process. The FDA also has authority under the FFDCA to require a manufacturer to conduct post-market surveillance of a Class II or Class III device. Further, pursuant to the March 2010 healthcare reform law, a medical device tax went into effect January 1, 2013, for devices listed 

with the FDA. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;- &#8220; The pharmaceutical and medical device industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business &#8221;, for further discussion. 

The FDA enforces regulations to require that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs and medical devices conform to cGMPs. The cGMP regulations the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations. The cGMP regulations for devices, called the Quality System Regulation, are also comprehensive and cover all aspects of device manufacture, from pre-production design requirements and validation to installation and servicing, insofar as they bear upon the safe and effective use of the device and whether the device otherwise meets the requirements of the FFDCA. Compliance with the regulations requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas. 

The FDA conducts pre-approval inspections of facilities engaged in the development, manufacture, processing, packing, testing and holding of the drugs subject to NDAs and ANDAs. In addition, manufacturers of both pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used to formulate the drug also ordinarily undergo a pre-approval inspection. Failure of any facility to pass a pre-approval inspection will result in delayed approval and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of drug and device facilities to assess the cGMP status of marketed products. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue an untitled letter as an initial correspondence that cites violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance for a Warning Letter. FDA guidelines also provide for the issuance of Warning Letters for violations of &#8220;regulatory significance&#8221; for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. Finally, the FDA could issue a Form 483 Notice of Inspectional Observations, which could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. If the FDA were to find serious cGMP non-compliance during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Imported API and other components needed to manufacture our products could be rejected by U.S. Customs. In respect to domestic establishments, the FDA could initiate product seizures or request or in some instances require product recalls and seek to enjoin or otherwise limit a product&#8217;s manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could support civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with cGMP requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying that company as an unacceptable supplier, thereby disqualifying that company from selling products to federal agencies. 

Certain of our subsidiaries sell products that are &#8220;controlled substances&#8221; as defined in the CSA and implementing regulations, which establish certain security and record keeping requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I and II substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. The active ingredients in some of our current products and products in development, including oxycodone, oxymorphone, buprenorphine, morphine, fentanyl and hydrocodone, are listed by the DEA as Schedule II or III substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation. Since October 2014, hydrocodone combination products have been rescheduled by the DEA as Schedule II, which imposes additional access restrictions of these products and could ultimately impact our sales. 

The DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development, as well as the production of these products, and we, or our contract manufacturing organizations, must annually apply to the DEA for procurement and production quotas in order to obtain and produce these substances. As a result, our quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Moreover, the DEA may adjust these quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;- &#8220; The DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development, as well as the production of these products, and, as a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials &#8221;, for further discussion on DEA regulations. To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, tests, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The facilities must have the security, control and accounting mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent loss and diversion of controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could eventuate in criminal proceedings. 

Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we, as well as our third-party API suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to such regulation by several states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of these products. 

Government Benefit Programs 

As described further in Item 1A. Risk Factors, statutory and regulatory requirements for Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE and other government healthcare programs govern access and provider reimbursement levels, and provide for other cost-containment 

measures such as requiring pharmaceutical companies to pay rebates or refunds for certain sales of products reimbursed by such programs, or subjecting sales of their products to certain price ceilings. In addition to the cost-containment measures described in Item 1A. Risk Factors, a final rule promulgated and reissued by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) in October 2010 subject drug sales to retail pharmacies under the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program to certain price ceilings. Specifically, under the final rule, manufacturers are required, among other things, to pay refunds for prescriptions filled beginning on January 28, 2008 and extending to future periods based on the applicable ceiling price limits. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, a provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 will also require drug manufacturers to pay additional rebates to State Medicaid programs if the prices of their non-innovator drugs rise at a rate faster than inflation. 

The federal and/or state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at containing or reducing payment levels for prescription pharmaceuticals paid for in whole or in part with government funds. We cannot predict the nature of this or other such measures or their impact on our profitability and cash flows. These efforts could, however, have material consequences for the pharmaceutical industry and the Company. 

From time to time, legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business. Congress continues to examine various Medicare and Medicaid policy proposals that may result in a downward pressure on the prices of prescription drugs in these programs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;- &#8220; The availability of third party reimbursement for our products is uncertain, and thus we may find it difficult to maintain current price levels. Additionally, the market may not accept those products for which third party reimbursement is not adequately provided &#8221;, for further discussion on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. 

In addition, in March 2010, President Obama signed into law healthcare reform legislation (Healthcare Reform Law) that has and will continue to make major changes to the healthcare system. One such change is the requirement that pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs must pay an annual fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer must pay a prorated share of the fee (the fee is $3 billion in 2016, and set to increase in subsequent years) based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to specified federal programs. The implementation of the Healthcare Reform Law has and will continue to result in a transformation of the delivery and payment for healthcare services in the U.S. 

Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws 

We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, violations of which can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to us as both a manufacturer and a supplier of products reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, and they also apply to hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of our products. 

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b(b)) prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, coupons, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute and implementing regulations provide for certain exceptions for &#8220;safe harbors&#8221; for certain discounting, rebating, or personal services arrangements, among other things. In addition, the recently enacted Healthcare Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1320a-7b, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Moreover, the lack of uniform court interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute makes compliance with the law difficult. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant criminal fines, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, and follow-on civil litigation, among other things, for both entities and individuals. 

Other federal healthcare fraud-related laws also provide criminal liability for violations. The Criminal Healthcare Fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1347 prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. Federal criminal law at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001, among other sections, prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. See Item 1A. Risk Factors &#32;- &#8220; We are subject to various regulations pertaining to the marketing of our products and services &#8221;, for further discussion on the Anti-Kickback Statute. 

The civil False Claims Act and similar state laws impose liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal government and to share in any monetary 

recovery. Finally, the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state laws impose reporting requirements for various types of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to comply with required reporting requirements under these laws could subject manufacturers and others to substantial civil money penalties. 

International Regulations 

Our growing international operations have increased our interaction with regulatory authorities in other countries and made the Company subject to laws and regulations that differ from those under which the Company operates in the United States. In most cases, these regulatory agencies evaluate and monitor the safety, efficacy and quality of pharmaceutical products and devices, govern the approval of clinical trials and product registrations, and regulate pricing and reimbursement. Many of these markets have differing product preferences and requirements, and operate in an environment of government-mandated, cost-containment programs, including price controls. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods of cost control. 

Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained for a product, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities of other countries must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries. The approval process may be more or less rigorous from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the United States. 

Service Agreements 

We contract with various third parties to provide certain critical services including manufacturing, supply, warehousing, distribution, customer service, certain financial functions, certain research and development activities and medical affairs. 

For a complete description of our significant manufacturing, supply and other service agreements, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies &#32;in the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in Part IV, Item 15. of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" . 

Acquisitions, License and Collaboration Agreements 

We continue to seek to enhance our product line and develop a balanced portfolio of differentiated products through product acquisitions and in-licensing, or acquiring licenses to products, compounds and technologies from third parties or through company acquisitions. The Company enters into strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements with third parties, which give the Company rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products, the rights to which are primarily owned by these third parties. These alliances and arrangements can take many forms, including licensing arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, co-promotion arrangements, research collaborations and joint ventures. Such alliances and arrangements enable us to share the risk of incurring all research and development expenses that do not lead to revenue-generating products; however, because profits from alliance products are shared with the counter-parties to the collaborative arrangement, the gross margins on alliance products are generally lower, sometimes substantially so, than the gross margins that could be achieved had the Company not opted for a development partner. For a full discussion, including agreement terms and status, see our disclosures in Note 5. Acquisitions &#32;and Note 11. License and Collaboration Agreements &#32;in the Consolidated Financial Statements , included in Part IV, Item 15. of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules" . 

Environmental Matters 

Our operations are subject to substantial federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances. Violation of these laws and regulations, which frequently change, can lead to substantial fines and penalties. Many of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and limit pollution of the environment. We believe that our facilities and the facilities of our third party service providers are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we do not believe that future compliance will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Employees 

As of February 19, 2016 , we have 6,406 &#32;employees, of which 592 &#32;are engaged in research and development and regulatory work, 1,033 &#32;in sales and marketing, 2,916 &#32;in manufacturing, 928 &#32;in quality assurance and 937 &#32;in general and administrative capacities. Our employees are generally not represented by unions, with the exception of certain production personnel in our Rochester, Michigan and Mexican manufacturing facilities. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
