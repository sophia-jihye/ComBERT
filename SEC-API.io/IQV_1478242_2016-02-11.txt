 Item 1. Business

Company Overview

We are the world&#8217;s largest provider of biopharmaceutical development services and commercial outsourcing services. We are positioned at the intersection of business services and healthcare and generated $4.3 billion of service revenues in 2015, conduct business in approximately 100 countries and have approximately 36,100 employees. We use the breadth and depth of our service offerings, our global footprint and our therapeutic, scientific and analytics expertise to help our biopharmaceutical customers, as well as other healthcare customers, to be more successful in an increasingly complex healthcare environment.

We were founded in 1982 by Dennis B. Gillings, CBE, Ph.D., who was a biostatistics professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Gillings and his cofounder pioneered the use of sophisticated statistical algorithms to improve the quality of data used to determine the efficacy of various drug therapies. We expanded internationally into Europe in 1987 and into Asia in 1993. In 1994, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, and in 2003 we exited the public markets through a going private transaction. In May 2013, we returned to the public markets by completing an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE.

We are a leader in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical therapies. Our Product Development segment is the world&#8217;s largest contract research organization, or CRO, based upon the most recently available public information of reported service revenues, and is focused primarily on Phase II-IV clinical trials and associated laboratory and analytical activities. Our Integrated Healthcare Services segment includes one of the leading global commercial pharmaceutical sales and service organizations, in addition to healthcare business services for the broader healthcare sector, such as real world and late phase research, market access and consulting, health information analytics and technology consulting, and other healthcare solutions. Product Development contributed approximately 74% and Integrated Healthcare Services contributed approximately 26% to our 2015 service revenues. Additional information regarding our segments is presented in Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our global scale and capabilities enable us to work with the leading companies in the biopharmaceutical sector. During each of the last 13 years, we have worked with the 20 largest biopharmaceutical companies ranked by 2014 reported revenues. We have provided services in connection with the development or commercialization of 98 of the top 100 best-selling biopharmaceutical products and the top 50 best-selling biologic products, from 2014 as measured by reported sales.

In 2015, our service revenues were $4.3 billion and our net income attributable to our shareholders was $387.2 million. In addition, our 2015 net new business was $5.3 billion, and we ended the year with $12.0 billion in backlog. Our backlog at December 31, 2015 was diversified with 28% from top 10 biopharmaceutical companies, 23% with biopharmaceutical companies ranked as 11-20, 24% with biopharmaceutical companies ranked as 21-50, and 25% with biopharmaceutical companies outside the top 50, in each case, as ranked by 2014 sales. See Part I, Item 1, &#8220;Business&#8212;Net New Business Reporting and Backlog&#8221; for more detail. During each of the last eight years, we have had at least eight customers from whom we earned more than $100 million in service revenues. No single customer represented more than 10% of our 2015 revenues.

Our Markets

The market served by Product Development consists primarily of biopharmaceutical companies, including medical device and diagnostics companies, that outsource services associated with the development of pharmaceutical products, such as clinical trials. We estimate that total research and development spending was approximately $143 billion in 2015 of which biopharmaceutical spending on drug development was approximately $97 billion, and we estimate that our addressable market (clinical development spending excluding preclinical spending) was approximately $54 billion. The portion of this $54 billion that was outsourced in 2015, based on our estimates, was approximately $22 billion. We estimate, based on industry data, analysis, and our own estimates, that the potential market for Product Development&#8217;s services should experience a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 6%-8% from 2015 through 2018 as a result of the increased outsourcing of research and development spending by biopharmaceutical companies in addition to increases over time in this overall spending as compared to 2014.

&#160;

Integrated Healthcare Services primarily addresses markets related to the use of approved biopharmaceutical products. We estimate that total spending related to approve d drugs, including biopharmaceutical spending on commercialization of these drugs and expenditures by participants in the broader healthcare market on real-world research, healthcare technology implementation analytics, and evidence-based medicine, exceede d $101 billion in 2015. Integrated Healthcare Services links product development to healthcare delivery. This segment&#8217;s services include commercial services such as recruiting, training, deploying and managing a global sales force, channel management, pati ent engagement services, market access consulting, brand communication, advisory services, and health information analytics and technology consulting. In addition, Integrated Healthcare Services offers real-world late phase services such as observational s tudies, comparative effectiveness studies and product and disease registry services, which are intended to help increase the quality and cost-effectiveness of healthcare and payer provider solutions. We believe that a combination of cost pressure in health care systems around the world and the increasing focus on the value and efficacy of pharmaceutical therapy provide us many opportunities to grow our revenues and expand our service offerings by improving the cost-effectiveness of drug therapies. 

We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from current trends in the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries that affect our markets, including:

Trends in Research and Development Spending. We estimate that research and development spending was approximately $143 billion in 2015 and will grow to approximately $155 billion in 2018, with drug development accounting for approximately 68% of total expenditures. Research and development spending trends are impacted as a result of several factors, including major biopharmaceutical companies&#8217; efforts to replenish revenues lost from the so-called &#8220;patent cliff&#8221; of recent years, increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry, and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities. In 2015, there were approximately 5,084 drugs in the Phase I-III development pipeline, an increase of 36% since 2010, and there were 45 new molecular entities approvals by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, which was the highest number of approvals in any of the past 19 years. We believe that further research and development spending, combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape, will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies, particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings, to help biopharmaceutical companies with their pre- and post-launch product development and commercialization needs. 

Growth in Outsourcing. We estimate that clinical development spending outsourced to CROs in Phases I-IV in 2015 was approximately $22 billion and will grow to approximately $28 billion by 2018. We expect outsourced clinical development to CROs to grow 6%-8% annually during this period, and believe this annual growth will be driven largely by increased outsourcing penetration, with up to 2% of this growth coming from increased research and development expenditures over 2015 to 2018. In estimating these growth rates, we monitor the ability of biopharmaceutical companies, including biotechnology companies, to raise capital, as well as the potential impact from merger and acquisition activity between biopharmaceutical companies. We estimate that overall outsourcing penetration of the addressable market in 2015 was 41%. The market served by Integrated Healthcare Services is diverse, which makes it difficult to estimate the current amount of outsourced integrated healthcare services and the expected growth in such services. However, based on our knowledge of these markets we believe that, while the rate of outsourcing penetration varies by market within Integrated Healthcare Services, the current outsourcing penetration of the estimated $101 billion market is approximately 23%. As business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector, we believe that the growth rate for outsourcing across the Integrated Healthcare Services markets will be similar to the growth in clinical development. 

We believe that we are well positioned for the future evolution of the healthcare sector as increasing demand from governments and other payers around the world for quality, accountability and value for money drive biopharmaceutical companies, providers and other healthcare organizations to transform their value chain away from a vertically integrated model to one that is more focused on their core competencies. In particular, we believe that the following trends will result in increased outsourcing to global biopharmaceutical services companies:

&#160;

&#183; 

Maximizing Productivity and Lowering Costs. Declining research and development productivity, increased development costs and diminished returns on marketing and sales have negatively impacted biopharmaceutical companies. We believe that the need for biopharmaceutical companies to maximize productivity and lower costs in their product development and commercial operations will cause them to look to partners as they enter into outsourcing arrangements to improve efficiency, increase sales force utilization and effectiveness, improve clinical success rates and turn fixed costs into variable costs across their research and development and commercial operations. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Managing Complexity. Biopharmaceutical companies face environments in which it has become increasingly difficult to operate. Improved standards of care in many therapeutic areas and the emergence of new types of therapies, such as biologics, genetically targeted therapies, gene and stem cell therapies, and other treatment modalities have led to more complex development and regulatory pathways, such as recently released guidelines in the United States and Europe for the development of &#8220;biosimilar&#8221; products. We believe that our global clinical development capabilities, including our expertise in biomarkers and genomics and our global laboratory network, position us well to help biopharmaceutical companies manage the complexities inherent in an environment where this type of expertise is important. 

&#160;

&#160;

&#183; 

Providing Enhanced Value for Patients. As healthcare costs rise globally, governments and third-party payers have looked for ways both to control healthcare expenditures and increase the quality, safety and effectiveness of drug therapies. Governments and regulatory bodies have adopt ed, and may continue to adopt, healthcare legislation and regulations that may significantly impact the healthcare industry by demanding more value for money spent and financial accountability for patient outcomes. Such legislation and regulations may tie reimbursement to the demonstrated clinical efficacy of a therapy, require payers and providers to demonstrate efficacy in the delivery of healthcare services and require more evidence-based decisions, all of which we believe will increase the demand for in novative and cost-effective commercialization strategies and outcome research and data analytics services. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increased Importance of Product Development in Local Markets. Increasingly, regulators require clinical trials involving local populations as part of the process for approving new pharmaceutical products, especially in certain Asian and emerging markets. Understanding the epidemiological and physiological differences in different ethnic populations and being able to conduct clinical trials locally in certain geographies will be important to pharmaceutical product growth strategies, both for multinational and local/regional biopharmaceutical companies. We believe that our global clinical development capabilities and unmatched presence in Asia and other emerging markets make us a strong partner for biopharmaceutical companies managing the complexities of international drug development. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increasing Number of Phase II-IV Clinical Trials. Based on the current and expected composition of the global drug development pipeline, we believe that spending on Phase II-IV clinical trials will continue to increase. As the complexity and cost of Phase II-IV clinical trials grow, clinical trial sponsors will continue to seek to recruit patients on a global basis. We believe that this increased spending and the demand for global patient recruitment will favor the limited number of biopharmaceutical services companies that have both the capabilities to administer large, complex global clinical trials and relationships with thought-leading investigators and clinical trial sites. In addition, as these drugs come to market, we believe that biopharmaceutical companies will also seek to outsource an increasing amount of the commercial and other integrated healthcare services necessary to effectively launch and market these drugs. 

&#160;

&#183; 

Increase in Strategic Collaborations. Larger CROs are able to provide a greater variety of services and therapeutic expertise to the biopharmaceutical community. Biopharmaceutical companies continue to enter into long-term strategic collaborations with global service providers. We believe that biopharmaceutical companies have historically preferred, and will continue to prefer, financially sound, global service providers with broad therapeutic and functional expertise such as our company when selecting strategic providers.

Clinical Solutions &#38; Services

Project Management and Clinical Monitoring

Drawing upon our years of experience, our site databases, our site relationships and our highly trained staff, Clinical Solutions &#38; Services enables the efficient conduct and coordination of multi-site clinical trials (generally Phase II-IV). Clinical Solutions &#38; Services&#8217; service offerings include protocol design, feasibility and operational planning, site start up, patient recruitment, project management and monitoring of the investigator sites and data from patient visits.

Study Design and Operational Planning. We assist our customers in preparing the study protocol, designing clinical report forms and identifying appropriate patients, sites and the optimal country mix to meet their objectives, among other key upfront decisions. The study protocol defines the medical hypotheses to be examined, the number of patients required to produce statistically valid results, the period of time over which they must be tracked, the frequency and dosage of drug administration and the study procedures.

Investigator/Site Recruitment. During clinical trials, the drug is administered to patients by physicians, referred to as investigators, at hospitals, clinics or other sites. The quality of a clinical trial is dependent on the quality of the investigators who perform the clinical trials. Through our global prime site and partner programs, we have established relationships with thousands of investigators who conduct our clinical trials worldwide. We provide our investigators the resources and tools they need to effectively conduct the clinical trials.

Site and Regulatory Start Up. The process of identifying, training and contracting with sites while also securing regulatory and ethics approval is a complex and time-consuming aspect of clinical trials. We have a dedicated unit that draws upon our experience from participating in clinical trials globally across multiple therapeutic areas for over 30 years. We utilize technology and analytics to simplify and streamline this process, reducing time to first patient in and laying the groundwork for successful clinical trial execution.

&#160;

Patient Recruitment. We assist our customers in recruiting patients for clinical trials through investigator relationships, media advertising, use of web-based techniques and other methods. We also help to ensure patients are retained for the duration of the clinical trials. We use informatics tools and media-based recruitment methods to identify, reach and recruit the appropriate patients. Our patient recruitment system includes informatics to ols and media-based recruitment methods to provide broad pools of prescreened patients as well as an efficient enrollment process and a call center. Through our global patient recruitment programs, we have enrolled on average over 100,000 patients in Phase I-III clinical trials annually during the last seven years. 

Clinical Monitoring. We deploy and manage clinical research associates, or CRAs, to work with and monitor sites to assure the quality of the data, which we gather according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and International Conference on Harmonisation, or ICH, regulations and guidelines, and to meet the customers&#8217; and regulatory authorities&#8217; requirements according to the study protocol. CRAs also assist with site initiation, training, patient enrollment and retention. Regulatory authorities are encouraging the use of innovative approaches in clinical trial monitoring, and we have deployed targeted, data-driven, risk-based, monitoring techniques to improve monitoring efficiency and effectiveness, focusing on the areas most likely to impact the quality of the data and safety of the patients in their particular clinical trial.

Project Management. Our project managers help customers navigate the complexity of the clinical trial process and coordinate all of the various activities, data streams and timelines associated therewith. Aligned by therapeutic experience, our project managers highlight risks before they become issues, while managing budgets and timelines. As clinical trials become more complex, project managers are becoming increasingly important in ensuring clinical trials are completed successfully.

Product Development Strategy Consulting. Our expert consultants support biopharmaceutical customers to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their product development operations. We provide objective, industry vetted recommendations to help customers bring safer, differentiated products to market faster and more cost effectively. We begin in the conceptualization phase of development with strategic market research to bring a commercially minded approach to clinical design. Through a combination of secondary data and clinical analytics, we support customers in making informed development decisions.

Regulatory and Compliance Consulting. We supply regulatory and compliance consulting services to the biopharmaceutical industry related to Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, GCP and GLP, global regulatory affairs, and quality systems engineering and validation. We assist customers in preparing for interactions with the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities or agencies, including inspections and resolution of enforcement actions, and complying with current GMP, and quality systems regulations, meeting process and software validation requirements and bringing new medical devices to market.

Process and IT Implementation Consulting. Realizing that strategy is only as good as how effectively it is implemented, we both design highly executable strategies and help implement them. Our consultants help customers optimize clinical and business processes to accelerate timelines and eliminate waste. Change management experts help implement new processes and organizational initiatives. Finally, we develop technology and information technology, or IT, strategies and help ensure their successful implementation.

Integrated Healthcare Services

Integrated Healthcare Services provides the healthcare industry with both broad geographic presence and commercial capabilities. Our customized commercialization services are designed to accelerate the commercial success of biopharmaceutical and other health-related products by promoting, delivering and proving value. When integrated with our product development services, our commercialization services enable solutions across the full lifecycle of a product.

Commercial Services

Contract Sales. Skilled primary care, specialty and multi-channel integrated sales teams provide our customers with a flexible resource that is able to respond quickly and effectively to the changing marketplace. We provide our customers with a variety of staffing options, including direct hire, flexible work arrangements, leave of absence and &#8220;strike force&#8221; arrangements (in which a team is deployed to a particular territory to capitalize on a market niche opportunity) in both full-time and flex-time solutions. We can supplement our sales forces with remote e-detailing capabilities. Our training and development services integrate traditional, distance-learning and web-based services. Our contract sales unit helps customers design or revamp their existing sales training programs to meet marketplace demands.

Market Entry/Market Exit. Market entry services help biopharmaceutical companies quickly and successfully launch products before or in lieu of establishing a long-term commercial infrastructure. Market exit services help biopharmaceutical companies manage the regulatory, quality and governance issues that arise when exiting unprofitable or less profitable markets. Market entry and market exit services are integrated solutions that can include assistance with regulatory compliance, market access, brand strategy, import and distribution logistics, and sales and marketing programs.

Integrated Multichannel Management. Integrated multichannel solutions leverage market-based analytics to help biopharmaceutical companies optimize channel mix (including sales force mix) so that the sales and marketing strategy for individual drugs can be effectively executed across multiple channels, including the use of sales representatives, e-detailing, video, mail, call center, webinars and online portals. Our integrated multichannel management services allow our customers to access key healthcare stakeholders and tailor the channels used to optimize results.

&#160;

Patient Engagement Services. Our health management services professionals offer customized clinical and educational solutions to bridge the gap be tween the clinical and commercial phases of product development and provide expertise across a broad range of pre-launch, launch and post-launch opportunities. We provide customers with solutions in a broad-based spectrum, from patient adherence programs t o clinical trial educators that assist in recruitment, education and retention of patients in clinical trials. We assist biopharmaceutical companies in evaluating the therapy from the perspective of the patient, not just the prescriber, supporting patient compliance and product dosing compliance therapy adherence and patient retention, which we believe can increase commercial success. Our professionals assist in the process of developing patient-centric strategies and implementing them for or side by side w ith customers. 

Market Access and Commercialization Consulting. Market access services support biopharmaceutical customers in the development and execution of a strategy for bringing products into the market based on value. Once a product proceeds from large scale clinical trials to commercialization, our consultants help customers create product positioning, pricing and formulary access and reimbursement strategies based on extensive primary research with providers, patients, payers and other decision-makers.

Real-World and Late Phase Research

Since 2011, our Real World and Late Phase Research group has provided clinical services for more than 415 patient registries and post-approval programs with expertise across approximately 100 countries and numerous therapeutic areas. We provide real-world and late phase research to monitor safety and evaluate benefit-risk, demonstrate effectiveness, gain market access and expand labeling and approved indications. Services offered include observational studies, product and disease registries, safety and surveillance, risk management and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, comparative and cost effectiveness, expanded labeling, health economics and outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, medical record review, and electronic medical record and EHR studies.

Communication and Health Engagement Services

Digital Patient Services. Our digital patient services are designed to find and mobilize patients into clinical research, observational studies and disease management programs, retain patients through engagement strategies, and generate evidence such as patient reported outcomes, laboratory data and device diagnostics directly from patients

Brand and Scientific Communications. Our communications group offers a range of pre-launch, launch and post-launch services, beginning in the early stages of product development and continuing until the product reaches peak penetration. Services include communications strategies and planning, product positioning and branding, opinion leader development, faculty training, symposia, promotional programs, sponsored publications, new media-based programs, patient education and clinical experience programs (either standalone or supporting their health management services). As early as Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, we can begin to develop and disseminate scientific information, and develop and present educational forums to help gain opinion leader support for a new drug.

Other Healthcare Solutions

We utilize our global integrated health service platform, together with our scientific and clinical expertise, to offer a range of specialized services to organizations and users across the care continuum, including governments, hospitals, physician offices and pharmacies. These services include comparative and cost-effectiveness research capabilities, clinical management analytics, decision support services, medication adherence and health outcome optimization services, and web-based systems for measuring quality improvement. Our July 2014 acquisition of Encore Health Resources, or Encore, enhanced our EHR expertise, which is becoming increasingly important as biopharmaceutical customers, payers, and providers focus on measuring outcomes based on real-world performance in terms of clinical effectiveness and value.

Our Customers and Marketing

We take a holistic customer-oriented view toward business development. Our integrated business development group is responsible for assessing our customers&#8217; current and future needs and helping to define the right service offerings to be delivered at the right time. We conduct business development efforts across our service offerings and within many individual service offerings, and in order to foster accountability in key service offering areas, each offering area has a designated leader who drives the financial contribution for that offering area. This management structure directs the selling and business development personnel in each of our major locations in the United States and throughout Europe, Asia, Japan, Canada and Latin America, providing coverage to both multinational and regional/domestic biopharmaceutical companies. We maintain dedicated customer teams that deliver customized solutions from the full breadth and depth of our service offerings for the world&#8217;s leading biopharmaceutical companies, and continue to evolve our relationships with our mid-size, small, and other biopharmaceutical customers outside the 20 largest biopharmaceutical companies based on 2014 reported revenues.

&#160;

In 2015, we earned service revenues of over $100 million each in six countries in North America, Europe and Asia. Please refer to Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detai ls regarding our foreign and domestic operations in 2015, 2014 and 2013. For a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Our business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could negatively aff ect our results of operations and financial condition.&#8221;

Additional information regarding our segments is presented in Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated service revenues in 2015, 2014 or 2013. In the past, we have derived, and may in the future derive, a significant portion of our service revenues from a relatively limited number of major projects or customers. As biopharmaceutical companies continue to outsource large projects and/or functions to fewer providers, this concentration of business could increase.

Our Competition

The market for our product development services is highly competitive, and we compete against traditional CROs, the in-house research and development departments of biopharmaceutical companies, universities and teaching hospitals. Among the traditional CROs, there are several-hundred small, limited-service providers, several medium-sized firms and only a few full-service companies with global capabilities. Consolidation among CROs likely will result in greater competition among the larger CROs for customers, clinical personnel and acquisition candidates. Product Development&#8217;s primary competitors include Pharmaceutical Product Development, Inc., PAREXEL International Corporation, ICON plc, inVentiv Health, Inc., or inVentiv, INC Research, PRA International, and Covance Inc., the drug development business of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, or LabCorp, among others. Competitive factors for product development services include:

&#160;

&#183; 

previous experience and relationships; 

&#160;

&#183; 

medical and scientific experience in specific therapeutic areas; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the quality of contract research; 

&#160;

&#183; 

speed to completion; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the ability to organize and manage large scale clinical trials on a global basis; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the ability to manage large and complex medical databases; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the ability to provide statistical, regulatory and consulting services; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the ability to recruit investigators and patients expeditiously; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the ability to deploy and integrate IT systems to improve the efficiency of contract research; 

&#160;

&#183; 

risk and reward sharing; 

&#160;

&#183; 

the ability to form strategic alliances; 

&#160;

&#183; 

a global presence with strategically located facilities and breadth of service offerings; 

&#160;

&#183; 

financial strength and stability; and 

&#160;

&#183;

&#160;

Integrated Healthcare Services competes in the post-approval and commercialization arenas. In the post-approval arena our solutions compete against real-world and late phase research providers including boutique firms, divisions of biopharmaceutical compa nies and divisions of traditional CRO&#8217;s (noted above). Our commercial solutions compete against the in-house sales and marketing departments of biopharmaceutical companies, other contract pharmaceutical sales and service organizations and consulting firms. Integrated Healthcare Services&#8217; primary commercial competitors in the United States include inVentiv, PDI, Inc., which sold its commercial services business to Publicis Healthcare Communications Group during the fourth quarter of 2015, and Publicis Sellin g Solutions. Outside of the United States, Integrated Healthcare Services commercial teams typically compete against single country or more regionally focused commercial service providers, such as United Drug plc, inVentiv, EPS Corporation and CMIC HOLDING S Co., Ltd in Japan. The primary competitive factors affecting Integrated Healthcare Services are breadth of service offering and ability to deploy in an integrated manner, quality and track record, i.e. the proven ability to quickly assemble, train and ma nage large qualified commercial teams on a global footprint and price. 

Notwithstanding these competitive factors, we believe that the synergies arising from integrating product development services with commercial services, supported by therapeutic and scientific expertise, global operations, data analysis and the ability to form long term strategic alliances with biopharmaceutical companies, differentiate us from our competitors.

Government Regulation

Many aspects of our businesses are regulated by federal and state laws, rules and regulations. Accordingly, we maintain a comprehensive compliance program and we believe we operate our business in substantial compliance with all existing legal requirements material to the operation of our businesses. There are, however, significant uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements, the violation of which could result in, among other things, sanctions. See &#8220;Part I &#8212; Item 1A &#8212; Risk Factors&#8221; for additional detail.

Good Clinical Practice

GCP regulations and guidelines contain the industry standards for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects. The FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, Japan&#8217;s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and many other regulatory authorities require that study results and data submitted to such authorities be based on clinical trials conducted in accordance with GCP provisions. Records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the FDA and other regulators. Significant non-compliance with GCP requirements can result in the disqualification by regulators of data collected during the clinical trial.

Our standard operating procedures related to clinical trials are written in accordance with regulations and guidelines appropriate to the region where they are used, thus helping to ensure compliance with GCP. FDA regulations and guidelines serve as a basis for our North American standard operating procedures. Within Europe, we perform our work subject to the EMA&#8217;s Note for Guidance &#8220;Good Clinical Practice for Trials on Medicinal Products in the European Community.&#8221; All clinical trials (other than those defined as non-interventional) to be submitted to the EMA must meet the requirements of the ICH&#8217;s GCP standards. Our offices in Asia and in Latin America have developed standard operating procedures in accordance with their local requirements and in harmony with our North American and European operations.

Regulation of Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices

In the United States, pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHS Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products. Failure to comply with applicable United States requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve a pending NDA for a new drug, a BLA for a new biological product, or PMA or clearance for a new medical device, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.

Before a new drug or biologic may be marketed, it must undergo extensive testing and regulatory review to determine that it is safe and effective and be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authority. Even after approval, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process.

&#160;

Regulation of Patient Information 

Our information management services relate to the diagnosis and treatment of disease and are, therefore, subject to substantial governmental regulation. In addition, the confidentiality of patient-specific information and the circumstances under which such patient-specific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily regulated. Federal, state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession, use and dissemination of personal data, such as personal health information and personal financial data, as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data. Additional legislation or regulation of this type might, among other things, require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or regulation de-identified health or other personal data, each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services.

In particular, personal health-related information is recognized in many countries such as the United States, the European Union, or EU, and several countries in Asia, as a special, sensitive category of personal information, subject to additional mandatory protections. Violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties, civil money penalties and criminal prosecution, including corporate fines and personal liability.

In order to comply with these evolving laws and regulations, we may need to implement new data protection, privacy and data security measures, which may require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to discontinue or limit the products and services we offer. In addition, if we violate applicable laws, regulations, contractual commitments or other duties relating to the use, privacy or security of health information, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions, civil liability or criminal prosecution or suffer reputational harm, and it may be necessary to modify our business practices.

Regulation of Promotion, Marketing and Distribution of Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices

Our integrated healthcare services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate. Such regulation relates, among other things, to the distribution of drug samples, the marketing and promotion of approved products, the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions.

In the United States, our integrated healthcare services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices, such as the FDA&#8217;s regulations against &#8220;off-label promotion,&#8221; which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved labeling for the product, and the Prescription Drug Marketing Act which imposes licensing, personnel record keeping, packaging, labeling, product handling and facility storage and security requirements. Other federal and state laws prohibit manufacturers, suppliers and providers from offering, giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services. The sale or distribution of pharmaceutical products and devices is also governed by the United States Federal Trade Commission Act and state consumer protection laws. We are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer integrated healthcare services.

We are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices, including, among others, various aspects of the Medicare program. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal and/or civil penalties, including possibly as an &#8220;aider and abettor.&#8221;

Regulation of Laboratories

Our United States laboratories are subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right-to-know regulations, and the safety and health of laboratory employees. Additionally, our United States laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste, radioactive materials and laboratory specimens, including the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Transportation, the National Fire Protection Agency and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA. The use of controlled substances in testing for drugs with a potential for abuse is regulated in the United States by the DEA and by similar regulatory bodies in other parts of the world. Our United States laboratories using controlled substances for testing purposes are licensed by the DEA. The regulations of the United States Department of Transportation, Public Health Service and Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens. Our laboratories also are subject to International Air Transport Association regulations, which govern international shipments of laboratory specimens. Furthermore, when the materials are sent to a foreign country, the transportation of such materials becomes subject to the laws, rules and regulations of such foreign country. Our laboratories outside the United States are subject to applicable national laws governing matters such as licensing, the handling and disposal of medical specimens, hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as the health and safety of laboratory employees.

&#160;

In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration has est ablished extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. Although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respe cts with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. 

Further, laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with CLIA, as well as requirements established by various states. The failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the CLIA certification.

Our Intellectual Property

We develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements, invention assignments and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have also registered or applied for trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of foreign countries, and our trademark &#8220;Quintiles &#174; &#8221; is of material importance to us. Although the duration of trademark and service mark registrations varies from country to country, trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. Although we believe the ownership of our patents, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our employees. Other than our Quintiles &#174; trademark, we do not have any material patents, trademarks, service marks, licenses, franchises or concessions.

Net New Business Reporting and Backlog

Net new business is the value of services awarded during the period from projects under signed contracts, letters of intent and, in some cases, pre-contract commitments, which are supported by written communications and adjusted for contracts that were modified or canceled during the period. Net new business under sole provider arrangements is recorded over the life of the arrangement as projects are awarded. Consistent with our methodology for calculating net new business during a particular period, backlog represents, at a particular point in time, future service revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts, letters of intent and, in some cases, pre-contract commitments that are supported by written communications. Once work begins on a project, service revenues are recognized over the duration of the project. Historically, net new business and backlog denominated in foreign currencies were valued each month throughout the year using foreign exchange rates that were in effect at the beginning of each fiscal year. Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, net new business and backlog denominated in foreign currencies are valued each month using the actual average foreign exchange rates in effect during the month. The application of this new approach to value foreign currency denominated net new business and backlog would not have had a significant impact to any prior period&#8217;s reported amounts; therefore historical amounts have not been restated to reflect this change in methodology. Included within backlog at December 31, 2015 is approximately $8,188 million of backlog that we do not expect to generate revenue in the next 12 months.

We believe that backlog and net new business may not be consistent indicators of future revenues because they have been and likely will be affected by a number of factors, including the variable size and duration of projects, many of which are performed over several years, cancellations, and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects. Projects that have been delayed remain in backlog, but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected. Additionally, pro jects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities. In the event that a customer cancels a contract, we typically would be entitled to receive payment for all services performed up to the cancellation date and subsequen t customer-authorized services related to terminating the canceled project. However, we typically do not have a contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog or net new business contracts in the event of cancellation. For mor e details regarding risks related to our backlog, see &#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;The relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time.&#8221; 

Employees

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 36,100 full-time equivalent employees in approximately 60 countries, comprised approximately of 12,800 in the Americas region, 10,900 in the Europe and Africa region and 12,400 in the Asia-Pacific region, with at least 500 employees in more than 10 countries around the world. As of December 31, 2015, Product Development and Integrated Healthcare Services had approximately 24,800 and 9,500 full-time equivalent employees, respectively. In addition, our centralized operations/corporate office had approximately 1,800 full-time equivalent employees.

The success of our business depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers in the United States and overseas for skilled personnel, particularly those with Ph.D., M.D. or equivalent degrees or training, is high. We believe that our brand recognition and our multinational presence are an advantage in attracting qualified candidates. In addition, we believe that the wide range of clinical trials in which we participate allows us to offer broad experience to clinical researchers. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. Employees in some of our non-United States locations are represented by works councils as required by local laws. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
