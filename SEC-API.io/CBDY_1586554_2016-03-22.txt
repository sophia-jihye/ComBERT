 Item 1. Business 

&#160;

Chess Supersite Corporation (formerly River Run Acquisition Corporation) (&#8220;Chess Supersite&#8221; &#8221; Company&#8221;, &#8220;we&#8221; ) was incorporated on July 2, 2013 under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. We have had limited operations to date. We were originally formed to provide a method for a foreign or domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

&#160;

We registered our common stock on a Form 10 registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#8220;Exchange Act&#8221;) and Rule 12(g) thereof. We file with the Securities and Exchange Commission &#8220;SEC&#8221;) periodic and current reports under Rule 13(a) of the Exchange Act, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports Form 10-K.

&#160;

In May, 2014, we effected a change in control by the redemption of the stock held by our original shareholders, the issuance of shares of our common stock to new shareholders, the resignation of its original officers and directors and the appointment of new officers and directors.

&#160;

We issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock pursuant to Section (a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 representing 66.7% of the total outstanding 1,500,000 shares of common stock as follows:

&#160;

&#160; 500,000 &#160; &#160; Rubin Schindermann &#160; 500,000 &#160; &#160; Alexander (Sasha) Starr &#160;

With the issuance of the 1,000,000 shares of stock and the redemption of 20,000,000 shares of stock, we completed a change in control, elected new management and changed our name to Chess Supersite Corporation.

&#160;

The Company is designed to become an online chess site featuring sophisticated playing zone, game broadcasts with software analyses and top analysts&#8217; commentaries, education and other chess oriented resources. With the availability of global high speed Internet access, we anticipate that we will be able to deliver high quality product featuring broadcasts of top worldwide games, education, interactivity, playing and other services.

&#160;

We believe that chess players have two major needs: (1) to play against each other and (2) to watch games of top players including Grandmasters. The viewing of chess games is particularly adaptable to the Internet to allow for real time or archived viewing while enjoying the comments, announcements and analyses of top experts. We anticipate that the playing zone will utilize two-level architecture allowing thousands of users to watch and play as individuals and/or as teams. Web-based services designed for browsers and table computers will be the project&#8217;s centerpiece and main point of focus. We anticipate that such an Internet site will have a great appeal to the vast worldwide chess playing population.

&#160;

We acquired certain assets (&#8220;Acquisition&#8221;) of Chess Supersite, Inc., a corporation existing under the laws of Ontario, Canada. The Acquisition was consummated pursuant to the terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement dated July 23, 2014 in consideration of the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of common stock to Chess Supersite, Inc. The purpose of the Acquisition was to develop the Company&#8217;s business and build substantive operations from this initial base of assets.. On December 11, 2014, we filed a report with the SEC on Form 8-K disclosing the Acquisition and disclosing, that as a result thereof, we were no longer a &#8220;shell company&#8221;.

&#160;

The Company had not generated revenues and had no income or cash flows from operations since inception. The Company&#8217;s independent auditors have substantial doubt about the Company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern. At present, the Company has no operations and the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders and its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue its operations.

&#160;

We are presently in the process of completing a comprehensive user- friendly website and have secured the domain name&#8220;Chesscoliseum.com&#8221; which is ready for Beta release. The portal is undergoing extensive testing by our professionals and public-at-large. The website is expected to be &#8220;live&#8221; sometime in the second quarter of 2016.
