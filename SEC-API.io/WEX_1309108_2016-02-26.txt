 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Our Company 

WEX Inc. is a leading provider of corporate payment solutions. WEX Inc. began operations in 1983 as a Maine corporation and was acquired in February 1996 by an entity that subsequently merged with HFS Incorporated to form Cendant Corporation in December 1997. In June 1999, our predecessor, Wright Express, was sold to Avis Group Holdings, Inc., which was acquired by Cendant Corporation in March 2001. In anticipation of our initial public offering, the Company&#8217;s operations were transferred to a Delaware LLC, which was converted into a Delaware corporation in 2005 in conjunction with our initial public offering. Over the past 30 years, we have expanded the scope of our business from a fleet payment provider into a multi-channel provider of corporate payment solutions. 

WEX Inc. has been publicly traded since February 16, 2005 (NYSE:WEX) and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, operates in three business segments: Fleet Solutions, Travel and Corporate Solutions and Health and Employee Benefit Solutions. Previously, the Company had reported two business segments, Fleet Payment Solutions and Other Payment Solutions. Fleet Solutions remains on the same basis as the historical Fleet Payment Solutions business segment. Travel and Corporate Solutions includes the Travel business as well as other verticals. Health and Employee Benefit Solutions includes the Healthcare and Employee related businesses. This change will enhance the Company's transparency and align our reporting with how we now operate our business. Financial reporting under this new structure is included within this report on Form 10-K and historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation. 

Our business model enables us to provide exceptional payment security and control across a wide spectrum of payment sectors. The Fleet Solutions segment provides customers with fleet vehicle payment processing services specifically designed for the needs of commercial and government fleets. During the year ended December 31, 2015 , Fleet Solutions revenue represented approximately 63 percent &#32;of our total revenue. As of December 31, 2015 , the Fleet Solutions segment services over 9.4 million &#32;vehicles. Management estimates that WEX fleet cards are accepted at over 90 percent of fuel locations in each of the United States and Australia. With the acquisition of ExxonMobil&#8217;s European commercial fleet card portfolio ("Esso portfolio in Europe") in December 2014, WEX fleet cards are now accepted at all ExxonMobil stations throughout Europe. The Travel and Corporate Solutions segment focuses on the complex payment environment of business-to-business payments, providing customers with payment processing solutions for their corporate payment and transaction monitoring needs. Travel and Corporate Solutions revenue, which represented approximately 23 percent &#32;of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 , is generated primarily in the online travel market. The Travel and Corporate Solutions segment has operations in North America, Europe, South America and Asia-Pacific. The Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment, which represented approximately 14 percent &#32;of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2015 , is generated primarily from the healthcare payment products and our software as a service ("SaaS") consumer directed platform. The Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment also provides payroll related benefits to customers in Brazil. 

The Company&#8217;s U.S. operations include WEX Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries WEX Bank, WEX FleetOne, Evolution1 and Benaissance. Our international operations include our wholly-owned subsidiaries, WEX Fuel Cards Australia, WEX Prepaid Cards Australia, WEX New Zealand, WEX Europe Limited, formerly CorporatePay Limited, UNIK S.A., a Brazil-based company, and a majority equity position in WEX Europe Services Limited and its subsidiaries. 

Prior to our initial public offering in 2005, the Company&#8217;s growth had primarily been organic. Our growth in the past several years has been supplemented by acquisitions. Our acquisitions over the last few years include: 

&#8226; 

On November 18, 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary Evolution1 acquired Benaissance, a leading provider of integrated SaaS technologies and services for healthcare premium billing, payment and workflow management, to complement our healthcare payments products and services. 

&#8226; 

On August 31, 2015, we acquired the remaining 49 percent ownership in UNIK S.A., a majority-owned subsidiary prior to this transaction. 

&#8226; 

On December 1, 2014, our majority owned subsidiary, WEX Europe Services Limited, acquired the assets of ExxonMobil's European commercial fuel card program, which includes operations, funding, pricing, sales and marketing in nine countries in Europe. 

&#8226; 

On July 16, 2014, we acquired Evolution1, a leading provider of payment solutions within the healthcare industry. 

&#8226; 

On October 15, 2013, our subsidiary UNIK S.A. acquired FastCred, a provider of fleet cards to the heavy truck or over-the-road segment of the fleet market in Brazil. 

&#8226; 

On October 4, 2012, we acquired FleetOne, a provider of fleet cards and fleet-related payment solutions to the over-the-road segment of the fleet market. 

&#8226; 

On August 30, 2012, we acquired a 51 percent controlling interest in UNIK S.A., a provider of payroll cards, private label and processing services in Brazil, specializing in the retail, government and transportation sectors. 

&#8226; 

On May 11, 2012, we acquired CorporatePay Limited, located in London, England, a provider of corporate prepaid solutions to the travel industry in the United Kingdom. CorporatePay offers direct, co-branded and private label solutions including virtual cards, currency cards and expense management solutions. 

In addition to the transactions described above, on October 18, 2015, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Electronic Funds Source LLC ("EFS"), a provider of customized corporate payment solutions for fleet and corporate customers with a focus on the large and mid-sized flee segments. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, at the closing of this acquisition, the Company will acquire all of the outstanding membership interests of WP Mustang Topco LLC, the indirect parent of EFS, and Warburg Pincus Private Equity XI (Lexington), LLC, an affiliated entity, from investment funds affiliated with Warburg Pincus LLC (the "EFS Sellers") for an aggregate purchase price comprised of $1.1 billion in cash and 4,011,672 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock, subject to certain working capital and other adjustments as described in the purchase agreement. The parties&#8217; obligations to consummate the acquisition are subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable antitrust waiting period under the Hart-Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. 

On July 29, 2014, we sold our Pacific Pride subsidiary for $49.7 million , which resulted in a pre-tax book gain of $27.5 million . The Company decided to sell the operations of Pacific Pride as it did not align with the long-term strategy of the core 

fleet business. The Company has entered into a multi-year agreement with the buyer that will continue to allow WEX branded card acceptance at Pacific Pride locations. 

On January 7, 2015, we sold the operations of rapid! PayCard for $20.0 million , which resulted in a pre-tax book gain of $1.2 million . Our primary focus in the U.S. continues to be in the fleet, travel, and healthcare industries. As such, we divested the operations of rapid! PayCard, which were not material to our annual revenue, net income or earnings per share. 

WEX Bank, a Utah industrial bank incorporated in 1998, is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (&#8220;FDIC&#8221;) insured depository institution. The functions performed at WEX Bank contribute to the operations of the Fleet Solutions and Travel and Corporate Solutions segments by providing a funding mechanism, among other services. With our ownership of WEX Bank, we have access to low-cost sources of capital. WEX Bank raises capital primarily through the issuance of brokered deposit accounts and provides the financing and makes credit decisions that enable the Fleet Solutions and Travel and Corporate Solutions segments to extend credit to customers. WEX Bank approves customer applications, maintains appropriate credit lines for each customer, is the account issuer, and is the counterparty for the customer relationships for most of our programs. Operations such as sales, marketing, merchant relations, customer service, software development and IT are performed as a service within our organization but outside of WEX Bank. WEX Bank&#8217;s primary regulators are the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. WEX Bank is required to maintain elements of independence from the rest of our business to comply with its charter and applicable banking regulations, and is required to file separate financial statements with the FDIC. The activities performed by WEX Bank are integrated into the operations of our Fleet Solutions and Travel and Corporate Solutions segments. 

Competitive Strengths 

We believe the following strengths distinguish us from our competitors: 

&#8226; 

Our closed-loop fuel networks in the U.S. and Australia are among the largest in each country. We describe our fleet payment processing networks as &#8220;closed-loop&#8221; as we have a direct contractual relationship with both the merchant and the fleet, and only WEX transactions can be processed on these networks. We have built networks that management estimates to provide coverage to over 90 percent of fuel locations in the U.S. and Australia, as well as wide acceptance in Canada and Brazil. This provides our customers with the convenience of broad acceptance. 

&#8226; 

Our proprietary closed-loop fuel networks provide us with access to a higher level of fleet-specific information and control as compared to what is typically available on an open-loop network. This allows us to improve purchase controls at the point of sale and to refine the information reporting we provide to our fleet customers and customers of our strategic relationships. 

&#8226; 

Our proprietary closed-loop network is a competitive strength because it enables us to establish a direct relationship with each of the merchants that comprise our network. 

&#8226; 

We offer a differentiated set of products and services, including security and purchase controls, to allow our customers and the customers of our strategic relationships to better manage their vehicle fleets. We provide customized analysis and reporting on the efficiency of fleet vehicles and the purchasing behavior of fleet vehicle drivers. We make this data available to fleet customers through both traditional reporting services and sophisticated web-based data analysis tools. 

&#8226; 

Our proprietary software facilitates the collection of information and provides us with a high level of control and flexibility in allowing fleets to restrict purchases and receive automated alerts. 

&#8226; 

Our long-standing strategic relationships, multi-year contracts and high contract renewal rates have contributed to the stability and recurring nature of our revenue base. We believe that we offer a compelling value to our customers relative to our competitors given the breadth and quality of our products and services and our deep understanding of our customers&#8217; operational needs. We have a large installed customer base, with more than 9.4 million &#32;vehicles serviced as of December 31, 2015 &#32;and co-branded strategic relationships with six of the largest U.S. fleet management providers and with numerous oil companies that use our private label solutions. Our wide site acceptance, together with our private-label portfolios and value-added product and service offerings, drive high customer satisfaction levels, with a U.S. fleet retention rate in excess of 97 percent &#32;(based on the 2015 &#32;rate of voluntary customer attrition). 

&#8226; 

Our capabilities in the over-the-road segment of the market enhance our ability to serve fleet customers who operate both heavy duty trucks and cars or light duty vehicles in the U.S. and Canada as well as to blend the small fleet and private label businesses for greater scale. 

&#8226; 

Our purchase of ExxonMobil's commercial fuel card program which uses a closed-loop network in Europe, combined with the long term supply agreement to serve the current and future Esso portfolio in Europe, provides us with a strong foundation in the large European fleet market. 

&#8226; 

Our travel and corporate payment products offer corporate customers enhanced security and control for complex payment needs. Our strategic relationships include three of the largest U.S. based online travel agencies, and our operations in the United Kingdom provide corporate payment solutions to the travel and healthcare industries. We continue to expand our online travel payment solution capabilities and geographies, which currently include North America, Europe, South America and Asia-Pacific. As of December 31, 2015, we settle transactions in 21 different currencies. 

&#8226; 

The demand for our payment processing, account servicing and transaction processing services combined with significant operating scale has historically driven strong revenue growth and earnings potential. We have an extensive history of organic revenue growth driven by our various marketing channels, our extensive network of fuel and service providers, and our growth in transaction volume. Further, we have completed a number of strategic acquisitions to expand our product and service offerings, which have contributed to our revenue growth and diversification. 

&#8226; 

We have an enterprise-wide risk management program that helps us to effectively address inherent risks related to funding and liquidity, our extension of credit and interest rates. Our ownership of WEX Bank provides us with access to low cost sources of capital, which provide liquidity to fund our short-term card receivables. We have maintained a long record of low credit losses due to the short-term, non-revolving credit issued to our customer base. Our credit risk management program is enhanced by our proprietary scoring models, managing credit lines and early suspension policy. Interest rate risk is managed through diversified funding sources at WEX Bank with significant non-interest bearing liabilities and merchant contracts that include some ability to raise rates if interest rates rise. 

&#8226; 

We have become a leading provider of cloud-based healthcare payments technology through the acquisitions of Evolution1 in 2014 and Benaissance in 2015. Our large partner network expands our opportunities in a growing healthcare payments market. 

&#8226; 

We have an experienced and committed management team that has substantial industry knowledge and a proven track record of financial success. The team has been successful in driving strong growth with consistent operating performance. We believe that our management team positions us well to continue successfully implementing our growth strategy and capture operating efficiencies. 

Strategy 

Our Company&#8217;s path forward will be shaped by the following three strategic priorities: 

&#8226; 

Accelerating growth in our core verticals. We have built a robust set of products and services within our Fleet, Travel, and Health verticals. We will continue to grow our business organically in these core verticals through excellence in our marketing and sales force as well a focus on our revenue management practices. Our acquisition strategy will complement our organic growth by both enhancing scale and adding differentiation to our current offerings. 

&#8226; 

Capturing efficiencies and new scaling opportunities across the organization. We will build new product functionality while rationalizing our technology platforms to enable us to deliver greater customer value and enhanced margins. We are also focused on streamlining our delivery model to ensure we have the flexibility to meet a diversity of customer needs as well as efficiently integrate our acquisitions. 

&#8226; 

Develop and drive market leading offerings globally. Within our Fleet, Travel, and Health verticals, we are focusing on rapidly growing our presence in attractive geographies and enhancing our product suite. Revenue originated from non-US markets increased to 19% of 2015 total revenue, driven largely by our successful entry into Europe and Brazil. We will continue to target new regions such as Asia, where we see the potential for long-term growth. We are also focused on innovating with new products such as data analytics, which harness the power of our proprietary closed loop data network in our Fleet vertical. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

FLEET SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 

Overview 

The Fleet Solutions segment provides customers with fleet vehicle payment processing services specifically designed for the needs of commercial and government fleets. We are a leading provider of fleet vehicle payment processing services with over 9.4 million &#32;vehicles at year end using our fleet payment solutions to purchase fuel and maintenance services. Our competitive advantages in the fleet market include brand strength and product offerings, commitment to customer satisfaction and a unique financing model with attractive credit terms. Our fleet products are based upon proprietary technology with closed-loop networks in the U.S., Australia and Europe, and wide site acceptance domestically and abroad. 

As part of our value proposition, we deliver security through individualized driver identification and real-time transaction updates, purchase controls and sophisticated reporting tools. We collect a broad array of information at the point of sale, including the amount of the expenditure, the identity of the driver and vehicle, the odometer reading, the identity of the fuel or vehicle maintenance provider and the items purchased. We use this information to provide customers with analytical tools to help them effectively manage their vehicle fleets and control costs. We deliver value to our customers by providing customized offerings for accepting merchants, processing payments and providing information management products and services to fleets. 

Our proprietary closed-loop networks allow us to provide our customers with highly detailed, fleet-specific information and customized controls that are not typically available on open-loop networks, such as limiting purchases to fuel only and restricting the time of day and day of the week when fuel is purchased. Our network also enables us to avoid dependence on third-party processors. In addition, our relationships with both fleets and merchants enable us to provide security and controls and provide customizable reporting. 

The following illustrates our proprietary closed-loop network: 

Payment processing transactions represent a majority of the revenue stream in the Fleet Solutions segment. In a payment processing transaction, we extend short-term credit to the fleet customer and pay the purchase price for the fleet customer&#8217;s transaction, less the payment processing fees we retain, to the merchant. &#32; Revenue from our WEX Europe Services operations is primarily generated by transactions where our revenue is derived from the difference between the negotiated price of the fuel from the supplier and the price charged to the fleet customer. We collect the total purchase price from the fleet customer, normally within 30 days from the billing date. 

The following illustration depicts our business process for a typical domestic fuel payment processing transaction: 

Products and Services 

Payment processing fees are based on a percentage of the aggregate dollar amount of the customer&#8217;s purchase, a fixed amount per transaction or a combination of both. Additionally, payment processing revenue related to our WEX Europe Services operations is specifically derived from the difference between the negotiated price of the fuel from the supplier and the agreed upon price paid by the fleets. In 2015 , we processed approximately 343 million &#32;payment processing transactions, compared to 311 million &#32;payment processing transactions in 2014 . Additionally, we receive revenue from account servicing fees, factoring receivables and finance fees. 

We offer the following services: 

&#8226; 

Customer service, account activation and account retention: We offer customer service, account activation and account retention services to fleets and fleet management companies and the fuel and vehicle maintenance providers on our network. Our services include promoting the adoption and use of our products and programs and account retention programs on behalf of our customers and partners. 

&#8226; 

Authorization and billing inquiries and account maintenance: We handle authorization and billing questions, account changes and other issues for fleets through our dedicated customer contact centers, which are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Fleet customers also have self-service options available to them through our websites. 

&#8226; 

Premium fleet services: We assign designated account managers to businesses and government agencies with large fleets. These representatives have in-depth knowledge of both our programs and the operations and objectives of the fleets they service. 

&#8226; 

Credit and collections services: We have developed proprietary account approval, credit management and fraud detection programs. Our underwriting model produces a proprietary score, which we use to predict the likelihood of an account becoming delinquent within 12 months of activation. We also use a credit maintenance model to manage ongoing accounts, which helps us to predict the likelihood of account delinquency over an ongoing 18-month time horizon. We have developed a collections scoring model that we use to rank and prioritize past due accounts for collection activities. We also employ fraud specialists who monitor accounts, alert customers and provide case management expertise to minimize losses and reduce program abuse. 

&#8226; 

Merchant services: Our representatives work with fuel and vehicle maintenance providers to enroll these providers in our network, test all network and terminal software and hardware, and to provide training on our sale, transaction authorization and settlement processes. 

Information Management 

We provide standard and customized information to customers through monthly vehicle analysis reports, custom reports and our websites. We also alert customers of unusual transactions or transactions that fall outside of pre-established parameters. Customers, through our website, can access their account information, including account history and recent transactions, and download the related details. In addition, fleet managers can elect to be notified by email when limits are exceeded in specified purchase categories, including limits on transactions within a time range and gallons per day. 

Marketing Channels 

We market our fleet products and services directly to commercial and government vehicle fleet customers with small, medium and large fleets, and over-the-road, long haul fleets. Our product suite includes payment processing and transaction processing services, WEX branded fleet cards in North America and Motorpass/Motorcharge-branded fleet cards in Australia. Our direct line of business services approximately 3.8 million &#32;vehicles. 

We also market our products and services indirectly through co-branded and private label relationships. With a co-branded relationship product, we market our products and services for, and in collaboration with, both fuel providers and fleet management companies using their brand names and our logo on a co-branded fleet card. These companies seek to offer our payment processing and information management services as a component of their total offering to their fleet customers. Our co-branded marketing channel services approximately 1.8 million &#32;vehicles. 

Our private label programs market our product and services for, and in collaboration with, fuel retailers, using only their brand names. The fuel retailers with which we have formed strategic relationships offer our payment processing and information management products and services to their fleet customers in order to establish and enhance customer loyalty. These fleets use these products and services to purchase fuel at locations of the fuel retailer with whom we have the private label relationship. Our private label marketing channel services approximately 3.8 million &#32;vehicles. 

Fuel Price Derivatives 

Management estimates that approximately 25 percent &#32;of our company-wide revenue in 2015 &#32;resulted from fees paid to us by fuel providers based on a negotiated percentage of the purchase price of fuel purchased by our customers. Accordingly, this revenue is impacted by fuel prices. To address fluctuations in fuel prices, we have previously hedged a portion of our U.S. fuel-price related earnings exposure to improve the management of potential cash flow volatility created by changes in U.S. fuel prices and to enhance the visibility and predictability of our anticipated future cash flows. 

During the fourth quarter of 2014 we suspended purchases under our fuel derivatives program due to unusually low prices in the commodities market. We continue to hold fuel price derivative instruments for the first quarter of 2016 that were executed in the third quarter of 2014 for approximately 20 percent of the anticipated quarterly exposure to domestic earnings based on assumptions at time of purchase. After the first quarter of 2016, we will no longer be hedged for changes in fuel prices. Management will continue to monitor the fuel price market and evaluate our alternatives as it relates to this hedging program. 

Our fuel price derivative instruments are in the form of put and call option contracts with monthly settlement provisions that create a &#8220;costless collar&#8221; based upon both the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s weekly diesel fuel price index and the NYMEX unleaded gasoline contracts. When entering into these options, our intent was to effectively lock in a range of prices during any given quarter on a portion of our U.S. forecasted earnings that are subject to fuel price variations. Differences between the indices underlying the options and actual retail prices could create a disparity between the effects of price changes on the actual revenues we earn and the gains or losses realized on the options. 

Our derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under accounting guidance. Accordingly, gains and losses on our fuel price-sensitive derivative instruments, whether they are realized or unrealized, affect our current period earnings. 

The options are intended to limit the impact fuel price fluctuations have on our cash flows. The options that we have entered into: 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Create a floor price. When the current month put option contract settles, we receive cash payments from the counterparties if the average price for the current month (as defined by the option contract) is below the strike price of the put option. 

&#160; &#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

Create a ceiling price. When the current month call option contract settles, we make cash payments to the counterparties if the average price for the current month (as defined by the option contract) is above the strike price of the call option. 

When the current month put and call option contracts settle and the average price for the current month (as defined by the option contract) is between the strike price of the put option contract and the strike price of the call option contract, no cash is exchanged between the counterparties and us. 

The following table presents information about the options as of December 31, 2015 . The approximate percentage of hedged fuel price-sensitive earnings exposure is based on assumptions at time of purchase and includes the earnings from our U.S. operations only.

TRAVEL AND CORPORATE SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 

Overview 

Our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment is comprised of our virtual and prepaid products with which we provide innovative corporate purchasing and payment capabilities that can be integrated with our customers&#8217; internal systems to streamline their corporate payments, accounts payable and reconciliation processes. 

Products and Services 

The Travel and Corporate Solutions segment allows businesses to centralize purchasing, simplify complex supply chain processes and eliminate the paper check writing associated with traditional purchase order programs. Our product suite includes virtual and prepaid products. 

Our virtual card is used for transactions where no card is presented, including, for example, transactions conducted over the telephone, by mail, by fax or on the Internet. Our virtual card also can be used for transactions that require pre-authorization, such as hotel reservations. Under our virtual card programs, each transaction is assigned a unique account number with a customized credit limit and expiration date. These controls are in place to limit fraud and unauthorized spending. The unique account number limits purchase amounts and tracks, settles and reconciles purchases more easily, creating efficiencies and cost savings for our customers. The virtual card products offer both credit and debit options. 

Our prepaid and gift card products are offered through WEX Prepaid Card Australia and WEX Europe Services to companies throughout Australia and Europe. These products provide secure payment and financial management solutions with single card options, access to open or closed loop redemption, load limits and variable expirations. 

The following illustration depicts our business process for a typical travel virtual card product transaction: 

1 &#32;Guest books a hotel through a travel website owned by an online travel company 

2 &#32;Online travel company reserves room at hotel through reservation system. A WEX virtual card number is used to reserve the room. 

3 &#32; Upon checkout, hotel authorizes WEX virtual card number. The WEX virtual card restricts charge to predetermined cost of room, incidental expenses are paid for by guest. 

4 &#32; Online travel company pays WEX. WEX provides consolidated payment process to multiple hotel franchises. WEX earns fee by retaining percentage of the online travel company reimbursement payment. 

Marketing Channels 

We market our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment products and services directly to new and existing customers. Our products are marketed to commercial and government organizations and we use existing open-loop networks. 

&#160; 

HEALTH AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT 

Overview 

Our Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment is comprised of our healthcare payment products and SaaS platforms with which we provide simplified payment capabilities in a complex healthcare market as well as employee benefit products in Brazil. 

Products and Services 

The Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segment product suite includes our 1Pay and 1Plan payment solution products and our ExchangePoint, 1Cloud and 1Direct SaaS platforms. 

With our healthcare payment products, we provide payments in the complex healthcare market. We partner with health plans, third-party administrators, financial institutions, payroll companies and software providers to provide a software as a service product to support employers' healthcare benefits programs and to administer flexible spending, health saving and reimbursement accounts, and other healthcare related employee and dependent benefits. 

We currently have approximately 500 partners with relationships with 125,000 employers, reaching 12 million customers. Revenue is generated by SaaS based monthly fees to partners and interchange fees from spending on customer debit cards issued under flexible spending, health savings and reimbursement accounts. Cards are branded with either Visa or MasterCard and operate on a restricted open loop network. 

Our paycard products are offered through our wholly-owned subsidiary, UNIK S.A., a provider of employee benefit cards, private label and processing services in Brazil, specializing in the retail, government and transportation sectors. Revenue is generated by card usage fees and interchange fees from spending on the paycard products. 

Marketing Channels 

We market our Health Solutions products and services to consumers through an extensive partner network, that includes employers and healthcare providers. Our employee benefit products are marketed to consumers through employers in Brazil. 

OTHER ITEMS 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2015 , WEX Inc. and its subsidiaries had 2,265 &#32;employees, of which 1,545 &#32;were located in the United States. None of our U.S.-based employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In Europe, certain employees are members of trade unions or works councils. In Brazil, certain employees are members of unions. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are generally satisfactory. 

Competition 

We have a strong competitive position in our Fleet Solutions, Travel and Corporate Solutions and Health and Employee Benefit Solutions segments. Our product features and extensive account management services are key factors behind our position in the fleet industry. We face competition in all of our segments. Our competitors vie with us for prospective direct fleet customers as well as for companies with which to form strategic relationships. We compete with companies that perform payment and transaction processing or similar services. Financial institutions that issue Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit and charge cards currently compete against us primarily in the fleet category of our Fleet Solutions segment and in the corporate purchase card category of our Travel and Corporate Solutions segment. We also compete with other healthcare payment service providers. 

The most significant competitive factors include the breadth of features offered, functionality, servicing capability and price. For more information regarding risks related to competition, see the information in Item 1A, under the heading &#8220;Our industry continues to become increasingly competitive, which makes it more challenging for us to maintain profit margins at historical levels.&#8221; 

Seasonality 

Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. For example fuel prices are typically higher during the summer and online travel sales are typically higher during the third quarter. In addition, we experience seasonality in our healthcare vertical, as the spend is correlated to customers' insurance deductibles with typically higher spend in the early part of the year until employees meet their deductibles. 

Technology 

We believe that investment in technology is a crucial step in maintaining and enhancing our competitive position in the marketplace. Our data center network and infrastructure is supported by secure data centers with redundant locations. We have data centers in various locations in the United States including South Portland, Maine and Aurora, Colorado. We also have data centers and infrastructure located in various locations throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. 

Our fleet fuel-based closed-loop proprietary platforms capture detailed information from the fuel and maintenance locations within our network. Operating a proprietary network not only enhances our value proposition, it enables us to limit dependence on third-party processors and to respond rapidly to changing customer needs with system upgrades, while maintaining a more secure environment than an open-loop network typically allows. Our virtual card open-loop network uses internally developed software and third-party processors. Our infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. At our Evolution1 subsidiary, we maintain an integrated multi-account payment platform, including a mobile application. In Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and the United Kingdom, we use standalone platforms to support operations. 

Our secure networks are designed to isolate our databases from unauthorized access. We use security protocols among all applications, and our employees access critical components on a need-only basis. As of December 31, 2015 , we have not experienced any significant incidents in network, application or data security. We are continually improving our technology to enhance customer relationships and to increase efficiency and security. We also review technologies and services provided by others in order to maintain the high level of service expected by our customers and continue to invest in our infrastructure. 

&#32;For information regarding technology related risks, see the information in Item 1A under the headings &#8220;We may not be able to adequately protect our information systems, including the data we collect about our customers, which could subject us to liability and damage our reputation&#8221;, &#8220;Our failure to effectively implement new technology could jeopardize our position as a leader in our industry&#8221; and &#8220;We are dependent on technology systems and electronic communications networks managed by third parties, which could result in our inability to prevent service disruptions.&#8221; 

Intellectual Property 

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect the proprietary information and technology used in our business. We generally enter into confidentiality, professional services and/or license agreements with our consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite the efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain the use of our products or technology that we consider proprietary and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently. We pursue registration and protection of our trademarks in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate or plan to operate. We market our products and services using the WEX, FleetOne, Benny, 1Cloud, 1Direct, 1Pay, 1Mobile, 1Plan and 1View brand names in the U.S., the Motorpass and Motorcharge brand names in Australia and the UNIK S.A. and FastCred brand names in Brazil. 

Regulation - United States 

The Company and its affiliates are subject to certain state and federal laws and regulations which govern insured depository institutions and their affiliates as well as our operations in the healthcare market. WEX Bank is subject to supervision and examination by both the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the FDIC. The Company and its affiliates are subject to certain limitations on transactions with affiliates set forth in the Federal Reserve Act (&#8220;FRA&#8221;). The Company is subject to anti-tying provisions in the Bank Holding Company Act. State and Federal laws and regulations limit the loans WEX Bank may make to one borrower and the types of investments WEX Bank may make. 

Below is a description of the material elements of the laws, regulations, policies and other regulatory matters affecting the operations of WEX in the United States. 

Exemption from certain requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act 

As an industrial bank organized under the laws of Utah that does not accept demand deposits that may be withdrawn by check or similar means, WEX Bank meets the criteria for exemption from the definition of &#8220;bank&#8221; under the Bank Holding Company Act. As a result, the Company is generally, except as stated above, not subject to the Bank Holding Company Act. 

Restrictions on intercompany borrowings and transactions 

Sections 23A and 23B of the FRA and the implementing regulations limit the extent to which the Company can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other &#8220;covered transactions&#8221; with WEX Bank. &#8220;Covered transactions&#8221; include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright bar on engaging in &#8220;covered transactions,&#8221; they do limit the amount of covered transactions WEX Bank may have with any one affiliate and with all affiliates in the aggregate. The applicable rules also require that the Company engage in such transactions with WEX Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to WEX Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by WEX Bank to the Company or its other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100 percent to 130 percent of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral. 

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 

The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB") to regulate the offering of consumer financial products or services under the federal consumer financial laws. In addition, the CFPB was granted general authority to prevent covered persons or service providers from committing or engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices under federal law in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service. The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws. The legislation also gives the state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws. 

Brokered Deposits 

Under FDIC regulations, depending upon their capital classification, banks may be restricted in their ability to accept brokered deposits. &#8220;Well capitalized&#8221; banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits, but banks that are not &#8220;well capitalized&#8221; are not permitted to accept such deposits. The FDIC may, on a case-by-case basis, permit banks that are &#8220;adequately capitalized&#8221; to accept brokered deposits if the FDIC determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 

Other Financial Regulatory Requirements 

WEX Bank must monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity, as well as transactions involving amounts in excess of prescribed limits, as required by the Bank Secrecy Act and Internal Revenue Service regulations. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 substantially broadened the scope of U.S. anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, identifying new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The United States Treasury Department has proposed and, in some cases, issued a number of implementing regulations which impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or persons. Failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution. 

The U.S. federal government has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the United States Treasury&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (&#8220;OFAC&#8221;), take many different forms but generally include one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on &#8220;U.S. persons&#8221; engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (for example, property and bank 

deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences. 

Under the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also referred to as the &#8220;Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act" (or &#8220;GLBA&#8221;), the Company and WEX Bank are required to maintain a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information. However, this requirement does not generally apply to information about companies or about individuals who obtain financial products or services for business, commercial, or agricultural purposes. The GLBA also requires the Company and WEX Bank to provide initial and annual privacy notices to customers that describe in general terms their information sharing practices. If the Company and WEX Bank intend to share nonpublic personal information about customers with affiliates and/or nonaffiliated third parties, they must provide customers with a notice and a reasonable period of time for each consumer to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of any such disclosure. In addition to U.S. federal privacy laws, states also have adopted statutes, regulations and other measures governing the collection and distribution of nonpublic personal information about customers. In some cases these state measures are preempted by federal law, but if not, the Company and WEX Bank must monitor and comply with such laws in the conduct of its business. 

Restrictions on dividends 

WEX Bank is subject to various regulatory requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital above regulatory minimums. A banking regulator may determine that the payment of dividends would be inappropriate and could prohibit payment. Further, WEX Bank may not pay a dividend if it is undercapitalized or would become undercapitalized as a result of paying the dividend. Utah law permits WEX Bank to pay dividends out of the net profits of the industrial bank after providing for all expenses, losses, interest, and taxes accrued or due, but if WEX Bank&#8217;s surplus account is less than 100 percent of its capital stock, WEX Bank must transfer up to 10 percent of its net profits to the surplus account prior to the payment of any dividends. 

&#160; 

Company obligations to WEX Bank 

Any non-deposit obligation of WEX Bank to the Company is subordinate, in right of payment, to deposits and other indebtedness of WEX Bank. In the event of the Company&#8217;s bankruptcy, any commitment by the Company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of WEX Bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 

Restrictions on ownership of WEX Inc. common stock 

WEX Bank, and therefore the Company, is subject to bank regulations that impose requirements on entities that might control WEX Bank through control of the Company. These requirements are discussed in Item 1A under the heading &#8220;If any entity controls 10 percent or more of our common stock and such entity has caused a violation of applicable banking laws by its failure to obtain any required approvals prior to acquiring that common stock, we have the power to, and may be required to, restrict such entity&#8217;s ability to vote shares held by it.&#8221; 

Healthcare Regulation 

The federal and state governments in the U.S. continue to enact and consider many broad-based legislative and regulatory proposals that could materially impact various aspects of our health-related business. 

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively referred to as "Health Care Reform") mandates broad changes affecting insured and self-insured health benefit plans that impact our current business model, including our relationship with current and future customers, producers and health care providers, products, services, processes and technology. Health Care Reform left many details to be established through regulations. While federal agencies have published proposed and final regulations with respect to most provisions, some issues remain uncertain. 

In connection with the processing of data, we frequently undertake or are subject to specific compliance obligations under privacy and data security-related laws, including HIPAA, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and similar state and federal laws governing the collection, use, protection and disclosure of nonpublic personally identifiable information, including individually identifiable health information. 

HIPAA and its implementing regulations, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, subjects us to regulations and contractual obligations that impose privacy and security standards and breach notification and reporting requirements. 

In addition to federal data privacy and security laws and regulations, we are subject to state laws governing confidentiality and security of personally identifiable information and additional state-imposed breach notification and reporting requirements. 

Regulation - Foreign 

The conduct of our businesses, and the use of our products and services, are subject to various foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies where we operate. It is our policy to abide by the applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions around the world in which we do business. 

Australia 

The Company&#8217;s Australian operations are subject to laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of Australia governing banking and payment systems, financial services, consumer credit and money laundering. Because neither WEX Fuel Cards Australia nor WEX Prepaid Cards Australia holds an Australian Financial Services License or credit license or is an authorized deposit-taking institution, they operate within a framework of regulatory relief and exemptions afforded them on the basis that they satisfy the requisite conditions. 

Europe 

The Company&#8217;s European operations are subject to laws and regulations of the European Union and the countries in which we operate including, among others, those governing payment services, data protection and information security, consumer credit and anti-money laundering. 

Brazil 

The Company&#8217;s Brazilian operations are subject to laws and regulations of the Brazilian government. Brazil&#8217;s labor systems are governed by the Consolidation of Brazilian Labor Laws. Brazil is a signatory of the World Trade Organization&#8217;s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement. This agreement establishes a minimum protection standard to property rights and requires signatory countries to review and adapt national laws that meet that standard.
