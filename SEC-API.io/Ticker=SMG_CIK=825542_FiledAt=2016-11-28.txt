Company Description and Development of the Business 

The discussion below provides a brief description of the business conducted by The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (&#8220;Scotts Miracle-Gro&#8221; and, together with its subsidiaries, the &#8220;Company,&#8221; &#8220;we&#8221; or &#8220;us&#8221;), including general developments in the Company&#8217;s business during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 &#32;(&#8220;fiscal 2016 &#8221;). For additional information on recent business developments, see &#8220;ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT&#8217;S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We are a leading manufacturer and marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden products. Our products are marketed under some of the most recognized brand names in the industry. In North America, key brands include Scotts &#174; &#32;and Turf Builder &#174; &#32;lawn and grass seed products; Miracle-Gro &#174; , Nature&#8217;s Care &#174; , Scotts &#174; , LiquaFeed &#174; &#32;and Osmocote &#174;1 &#32;gardening and landscape products; and Ortho &#174; , Roundup &#174;2 , &#32;Home Defense &#174; &#32;and Tomcat &#174; &#32;branded insect control, weed control and rodent control products. In the United Kingdom, key brands include Miracle-Gro &#174; &#32;plant fertilizers; Roundup &#174;2 , Weedol &#174; &#32;and Pathclear &#174; &#32;herbicides; EverGreen &#174; &#32;lawn fertilizers; and Levington &#174; &#32;gardening and landscape products. Other significant brands in Europe include Roundup &#174;2 , KB &#174; &#32;and Fertilig&#232;ne &#174; &#32;in France; Roundup &#174;2 , Celaflor &#174; , Nexa Lotte &#174; &#32;and Substral &#174; &#32;in Germany and Austria; and Roundup &#174;2 , ASEF &#174; , KB &#174; &#32;and Substral &#174; &#32;in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. We are the exclusive agent of the Monsanto Company (&#8220;Monsanto&#8221;) for the marketing and distribution of consumer Roundup &#174; &#32;non-selective herbicide products within the United States and other contractually specified countries. We have a presence in similar consumer branded products in Australia, the Far East and Latin America. In addition, with our recent acquisitions of Gavita Holdings B.V. (&#8220;Gavita&#8221;), General Hydroponics, Inc. (&#8220;General Hydroponics&#8221;) and Bio-Organic Solutions, Inc. (&#8220;Vermicrop&#8221;), and control of AeroGrow International, Inc. (&#8220;AeroGrow&#8221;), we are a leading producer of liquid plant food products, growing media, advanced indoor garden and lighting systems and accessories for hydroponic gardening. Prior to April 13, 2016, we operated the Scotts LawnService &#174; &#32;business (the &#8220;SLS Business&#8221;), which provided residential and commercial lawn care, tree and shrub care and pest control services in the United States. On April 13, 2016, pursuant to the terms of the Contribution and Distribution Agreement (the &#8220;Contribution Agreement&#8221;) between the Company and TruGreen Holding Corporation (&#8220;TruGreen Holdings&#8221;), we completed the contribution of the SLS Business to a newly formed subsidiary of TruGreen Holdings (the &#8220;TruGreen Joint Venture&#8221;) in exchange for a minority equity interest of approximately 30% in the TruGreen Joint Venture. We now participate in the residential and commercial lawn care, tree and shrub care and pest control services segment in the United States and Canada through our interest in the TruGreen Joint Venture. 

Scotts Miracle-Gro, an Ohio corporation, traces its heritage back to a company founded by O.M. Scott in Marysville, Ohio in 1868. In the mid-1900s, we became widely known for the development of quality lawn fertilizers and grass seeds that led to the creation of a new industry-consumer lawn care. In the 1990s, we significantly expanded our product offering with three powerful leading brands in the U.S. home lawn and garden industry. First, in fiscal 1995, through a merger with Stern&#8217;s Miracle-Gro Products, Inc., which was founded by Horace Hagedorn and Otto Stern in Long Island, New York in 1951, we acquired the Miracle-Gro &#174; &#32;brand, the industry leader in water-soluble garden plant foods. Second and third, in 1998, we acquired the Ortho &#174; &#32;brand in the United States and obtained exclusive rights to market the consumer Roundup &#174; &#32;brand within the United States and other contractually specified countries, thereby adding industry-leading weed, pest and disease control products to our portfolio. Today, we believe that Scotts &#174; , Turf Builder &#174; , Miracle-Gro &#174; , Ortho &#174; &#32;and Roundup &#174; &#32;are the most widely recognized brands in the consumer lawn and garden industry in the United States. 

Our strategy is focused on (i) growing our core branded business, primarily in North America where we can leverage our competitive advantages in emerging areas of growth including organics, hydroponics, live goods, water positive landscapes, and internet-enabled technology, (ii) maximizing the value of non-core-assets including the divestiture of Scotts LawnService &#174; &#32;and exploring alternatives in Europe, and (iii) cash flow including near-term investments that will drive long-term growth, a natural mid-term shift to integration of acquired businesses, and a long-term plan to return increasing amounts of cash to shareholders.

As a result of the completion of the Company&#8217;s contribution of the SLS Business to the TruGreen Joint Venture on April 13, 2016, effective in its second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company classified its results of operations for all periods presented to reflect the SLS Business as a discontinued operation and classified the assets and liabilities of the SLS Business as held for sale. See &#8220;NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS&#8221; for further discussion. Prior to being reported as discontinued operations, the SLS Business was included as its own reportable segment.

Since 1998, we have served as Monsanto&#8217;s exclusive agent for the marketing and distribution of consumer Roundup &#174; &#32;products in the consumer lawn and garden market within the United States and other specified countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In 2015, the territories were expanded to include all countries other than Japan and those subject to a comprehensive U.S. trade embargo or certain other embargoes and trade restrictions. Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Exclusive Agency and Marketing Agreement (the &#8220;Marketing Agreement&#8221;) between the Company and Monsanto, we are jointly responsible with Monsanto for developing global consumer and trade marketing programs for consumer Roundup &#174; . &#32;We provide manufacturing conversion services (in North America), distribution and logistics, and selling and marketing support for consumer Roundup &#174; . We also entered into a lawn and garden brand extension agreement during 2015, providing us the ability to extend the Roundup &#174; &#32;brand globally into other categories of lawn and garden beyond non-selective weed control. Monsanto continues to own the consumer Roundup &#174; &#32;business and provides significant oversight of the brand. In addition, Monsanto continues to own and operate the agricultural Roundup &#174; &#32;business. For additional details regarding the Marketing Agreement, see &#8220;ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS &#8212; In the event of termination of the Marketing Agreement for consumer Roundup &#174; &#32;products, we would lose a substantial source of future earnings and overhead expense absorption&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and &#8220;NOTE 6. MARKETING AGREEMENT&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Acquisitions and Divestitures 

On October 3, 2016, the Company, through its subsidiary The Hawthorne Gardening Company, completed the acquisition of American Agritech, L.L.C., d/b/a Botanicare, an Arizona-based leading producer of plant nutrients, plant supplements and growing systems used for hydroponic gardening for an estimated purchase price of $90.0 million . 

On May 26, 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Hawthorne Gardening Company, acquired majority control and a 75% economic interest in Gavita for $136.2 million . Gavita&#8217;s former ownership group retained a 25% noncontrolling interest in Gavita consisting of ownership of 5% of the outstanding shares of Gavita and a loan with interest payable based on distributions by Gavita. Gavita, which is based in the Netherlands, is a leading producer and marketer of indoor lighting used in the greenhouse and hydroponic markets, predominately in the United States and Europe. This transaction provides the Company&#8217;s Other segment with a presence in the lighting category of indoor and urban gardening, which is a part of the Company&#8217;s long-term growth strategy. 

In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company completed an acquisition to expand its Canadian growing media operations for an estimated purchase price of $33.9 million . 

In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company entered into the Services Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement with Bonnie and AFC providing for the Company&#8217;s participation in the Bonnie Business. The Term Loan Agreement provides a loan from the Company to AFC, with Bonnie as guarantor, in the amount of $72.0 million with a fixed coupon rate of 6.95% (the &#8220;Term Loan&#8221;). Under the Services Agreement, the Company provides marketing, research and development and certain ancillary services to the Bonnie Business for a commission fee based on the profits of the Bonnie Business and the reimbursement of certain costs. 

On May 15, 2015, we amended our Marketing Agreement with Monsanto and entered into a lawn and garden brand extension agreement, and a commercialization and technology agreement with Monsanto. We paid Monsanto $300.0 million in consideration for these agreements on August 14, 2015, using borrowings under our credit facility. These agreements provide us with the following significant rights: 

&#8226; 

The ability to extend the Roundup &#174; &#32;brand globally into other categories of lawn and garden beyond non-selective weed control; 

&#8226; 

The opportunity to introduce the consumer Roundup &#174; &#32;brand into territories not included in the original Marketing Agreement, including China and Latin America. Only Japan and countries with U.S. trade embargoes are excluded from the Marketing Agreement; 

&#8226; 

The opportunity to propose changes to product formulations if deemed necessary to grow and/or protect the Roundup &#174; &#32;brand; 

&#8226; 

A right of first offer and a right of last look in the event Monsanto were to sell the consumer Roundup &#174; &#32;business and a credit to the purchase price in an amount equal to the then applicable termination fee in the event we make a bid in connection with such a sale; 

&#8226; 

A &#8220;first look&#8221; related to Monsanto&#8217;s innovation pipeline that would provide Scotts Miracle-Gro with access to new technology and products that may be commercialized in the residential lawn and garden marketplace; 

&#8226; 

The enhancements of our rights in connection with the termination of the Marketing Agreement, including increasing the termination fee payable thereunder, eliminating certain of Monsanto&#8217;s termination rights and delaying the effectiveness of a termination in connection with a change of control of Monsanto or a sale of the consumer Roundup &#174; &#32;business for five years after the notice of termination; and 

&#8226; 

The expanded ability for us to transfer, and thereby monetize, our rights as marketing agent to a third party (1) with respect to (a) the North America territories and (b) one or more other included markets for up to three other assignments and (2) in connection with a change of control of Scotts Miracle-Gro. 

On March 30, 2015, the Company acquired the assets of General Hydroponics and Vermicrop for $120.0 million &#32;and $15.0 million , respectively. The Vermicrop purchase price was paid in common shares of Scotts Miracle-Gro (&#8220;Common Shares&#8221;) based on the average share price at the time of payment. This transaction provides the Company&#8217;s Other segment with an additional entry in the indoor and urban gardening category, which is a part of the Company&#8217;s long-term growth strategy. General Hydroponics and Vermicrop are leading producers of liquid plant food products, growing media and accessories for hydroponic gardening. 

On September 30, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Scotts Canada Ltd., acquired Fafard &#38; Brothers Ltd. (&#8220;Fafard&#8221;) for $59.8 million . In continuous operation since 1940 and based in Saint-Bonaventure, Quebec, Canada, Fafard is a producer of peat moss and growing media products for consumer and professional markets including peat-based and bark-based mixes, composts and premium soils. Fafard serves customers primarily across Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and the eastern United States. 

During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014 (&#8220;fiscal 2014&#8221;), as a reflection of our increased control of the operations of AeroGrow gained through a working capital loan made by the Company, we consolidated AeroGrow&#8217;s financial results into that of the Company. AeroGrow is a developer, marketer, direct-seller, and wholesaler of advanced indoor garden systems designed for consumer use in gardening, and home and office d&#233;cor markets. AeroGrow operates primarily in the United States and Canada, as well as select countries in Europe, Asia and Australia. 

On October 14, 2013, we acquired the Tomcat &#174; &#32;consumer rodent control business from Bell Laboratories, Inc., located in Madison, Wisconsin, for $60.0 million &#32;in an all-cash transaction. The acquisition included the Tomcat &#174; &#32;brand and other intellectual property, as well as a long-term partnership to bring innovative technologies to the consumer rodent control market. Tomcat &#174; &#32;consumer products are sold at home centers, mass retailers, and grocery, drug and general merchandise stores across the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia. 

In addition, over the past five years, we have completed several smaller acquisitions within our controls and growing media businesses. 

During the past five years, we have completed several divestitures, the largest of which was our April 13, 2016 contribution of the SLS Business to the TruGreen Joint Venture in exchange for a minority equity interest of 30% in the TruGreen Joint Venture. In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2012 (&#8220;fiscal 2012&#8221;), we completed the wind down of our professional grass seed business. In the second quarter of fiscal 2014, we completed the sale of our wild bird food business in the United States and Canada for $4.1 million &#32;in cash and $1.0 million &#32;in earn-out payments. We have classified our results of operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations during the applicable periods. See &#8220;NOTE 2. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 

Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution 

We sell our consumer products primarily to home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, garden centers, food and drug stores, and indoor gardening and hydroponic stores through both a direct sales force and our network of brokers and distributors. In addition, during fiscal 2016 , we employed approximately 3,300 full-time and seasonal in-store associates within the United States to help our retail partners merchandise their lawn and garden departments directly to consumers of our products. 

The majority of shipments to customers are made via common carriers or through distributors in the United States and through a network of public warehouses and distributors in Europe. We primarily utilize third parties to manage the key distribution centers for our consumer business in North America, which are strategically located across the United States and Canada. The 

distribution centers for our consumer business internationally are located in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria and Australia and are also managed by third-party logistics providers. Growing media products are generally shipped direct-to-store without passing through a distribution center. 

Raw Materials 

We purchase raw materials for our products from various sources. We are subject to market risk as a result of the fluctuating prices of raw materials such as urea and other fertilizer inputs, resins, diesel, gasoline, natural gas, sphagnum peat, bark and grass seed. Our objectives surrounding the procurement of these materials are to ensure continuous supply, minimize costs and improve predictability. We seek to achieve these objectives through negotiation of contracts with favorable terms directly with vendors. When appropriate, we commit to purchase a certain percentage of our needs in advance of the season to secure pre-determined prices. We also hedge certain commodities, particularly diesel, gasoline and urea, to improve cost predictability and control. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal 2016 . 

Trademarks, Patents and Licenses 

We consider our trademarks, patents and licenses to be key competitive advantages. We pursue a vigorous trademark protection strategy consisting of registration, renewal and maintenance of key trademarks and proactive monitoring and enforcement activities to protect against infringement. The Scotts &#174; , Miracle-Gro &#174; , Ortho &#174; , Tomcat &#174; , Hyponex &#174; , Earthgro &#174; , General Hydroponics &#174; , Vermicrop &#174; &#32;and Gavita &#174; &#32;brand names and logos, as well as a number of product trademarks, including Turf Builder &#174; , EZ Seed &#174; , Snap &#174; , Organic Choice &#174; , Nature&#8217;s Care &#174; , Home Defense Max &#174; , Nature Scapes &#174; and Weed B Gon Max &#174; , are registered in the United States and/or internationally and are considered material to our business. 

In addition, we actively develop and maintain an extensive portfolio of utility and design patents covering subject matters such as fertilizer, chemical and growing media compositions and processes; grass seed varieties; and mechanical dispensing devices such as applicators, spreaders and sprayers. Our utility patents provide protection generally extending to 20 years from the date of filing, and many of our patents will continue well into the next decade. We also hold exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses and supply arrangements, permitting the use and sale of additional patented fertilizers, pesticides and mechanical devices. Although our portfolio of patents and patent licenses is important to our success, no single patent or group of related patents is considered significant to either of our business segments or the business as a whole. 

Seasonality and Backlog 

Our business is highly seasonal, with more than 75% &#32;of our annual net sales occurring in our second and third fiscal quarters combined. Our annual sales are further concentrated in our second and third fiscal quarters by retailers who rely on our ability to deliver products closer to when consumers buy our products, thereby reducing retailers&#8217; pre-season inventories. 

We anticipate significant orders for the upcoming spring season will start to be received late in the winter and continue through the spring season. Historically, substantially all orders have been received and shipped within the same fiscal year with minimal carryover of open orders at the end of the fiscal year. 

Significant Customers 

We sell our consumer products primarily to home centers, mass merchandisers, warehouse clubs, large hardware chains, independent hardware stores, nurseries, garden centers, food and drug stores, and indoor gardening and hydroponic stores. Our three largest customers are Home Depot, Lowe&#8217;s and Walmart, which are reported within the U.S. Consumer segment and are the only customers that individually represent more than 10% of reported consolidated net sales. For additional details regarding significant customers, see &#8220;ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS &#8212; Because of the concentration of our sales to a small number of retail customers, the loss of one or more of, or a significant reduction in orders from, our top customers could adversely affect our financial results&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and &#8220;NOTE 20. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK&#8221; of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Competitive Marketplace 

The markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of product innovation, product quality, product performance, value, brand strength, supply chain competency, field sales support, in-store sales support, the strength of our relationships with major retailers and advertising. 

In the U.S. lawn and garden, pest control and indoor gardening and hydroponic markets, our products compete against private-label as well as branded products. Primary competitors include Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc., Bayer AG, Central Garden &#38; Pet Company, Enforcer Products, Inc., Kellogg Garden Products, Oldcastle Retail, Inc., Lebanon Seaboard Corporation, Reckitt Benckiser, FoxFarm and Advanced Nutrients. In addition, we face competition from smaller regional competitors who operate in many of the areas where we compete. 

Internationally, we face strong competition in the lawn and garden market, particularly in Europe, Australia and Canada. Our competitors include Compo AcquiCo SARL, Bayer AG, Westland Horticulture Ltd, Neudorff, Yates, Premier Tech and a variety of local companies including private label brands. 

Research and Development 

We continually invest in research and development, both in the laboratory and at the consumer level, to improve our products, manufacturing processes, packaging and delivery systems. Spending on research and development was $45.5 million , $44.4 million &#32;and $46.0 million &#32;in fiscal 2016 , fiscal 2015 &#32;and fiscal 2014 , respectively, including product registration costs of $14.3 million , $13.0 million &#32;and $12.5 million , respectively. In addition to the benefits of our own research and development, we actively seek ways to leverage the research and development activities of our suppliers and other business partners. 

Regulatory Considerations 

Local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations affect the manufacture, sale, distribution and application of our products in several ways. For example, in the United States, all products containing pesticides must comply with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947, as amended (&#8220;FIFRA&#8221;), and most require registration with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the &#8220;U.S. EPA&#8221;) and similar state agencies before they can be sold or distributed. Fertilizer and growing media products are subject to state and foreign labeling regulations. In addition to the regulations already described, federal, state and foreign agencies regulate the disposal, transport, handling and storage of waste, remediation of contaminated sites, air and water discharges from our facilities, and workplace health and safety. Our grass seed products are regulated by the Federal Seed Act and various state regulations. 

In addition, the use of certain pesticide and fertilizer products is regulated by various local, state, federal and foreign environmental and public health agencies. These regulations may include requirements that only certified or professional users apply the product or that certain products be used only on certain types of locations (such as &#8220;not for use on sod farms or golf courses&#8221;), may require users to post notices on properties to which products have been or will be applied, may require notification to individuals in the vicinity that products will be applied in the future or may ban the use of certain ingredients. 

State, federal and foreign authorities generally require growing media facilities to obtain permits (sometimes on an annual basis) in order to harvest peat and to discharge storm water run-off or water pumped from peat deposits. The permits typically specify the condition in which the property must be left after the peat is fully harvested, with the residual use typically being natural wetland habitats combined with open water areas. We are generally required by these permits to limit our harvesting and to restore the property consistent with the intended residual use. In some locations, these facilities have been required to create water retention ponds to control the sediment content of discharged water. 

For more information regarding how compliance with local, state, federal and foreign laws and regulations may affect us, see &#8220;ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS &#8212; Compliance with environmental and other public health regulations or changes in such regulations or regulatory enforcement priorities could increase our costs of doing business or limit our ability to market all of our products&#8221; of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Regulatory Matters
