 Item 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

General 

&#160; 

Hurco Companies, Inc. is an industrial technology company. We design, manufacture and sell computerized (i.e., Computer Numeric Control) machine tools, consisting primarily of vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes), to companies in the metal cutting industry through a worldwide sales, service and distribution network. Although our computer control systems and software products are proprietary, they predominantly use industry standard personal computer components. Our computer control systems and software products are primarily sold as integral components of our computerized machine tool products. As used in this report, the words &#8220;we&#8221;, &#8220;us&#8221;, &#8220;our&#8221;, &#8220;Hurco&#8221; and the &#8220;Company&#8221; refer to Hurco Companies, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

&#160;

During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we acquired the assets of the machine tool business of Milltronics Manufacturing Company, Inc. and we are operating this U.S. business through our newly-formed subsidiary, Milltronics USA, Inc. (&#8220;Milltronics&#8221;). Milltronics manufactures and sells Computer Numerical Control (&#8220;CNC&#8221;) knee mills, tool room bed mills, vertical machining centers, combination lathes, slant-bed lathes, horizontal machining centers, and bed mills. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we also acquired the assets of the machine tool business of Takumi Machinery Co., Ltd. (&#8220;Takumi&#8221;), a Taiwanese company that designs and manufactures CNC vertical machining centers, double column machining centers, high speed bridge machines and other machine tools, with sales primarily in Taiwan, China and Europe. Takumi machines are equipped with industrial controls from Fanuc &#174; , Siemens &#174; , Mitsubishi &#174; or Heidenhain &#174;* , which can be used in high-volume parts manufacturing. We are operating this Taiwanese business through our subsidiary, Hurco Manufacturing Limited (&#8220;HML&#8221;). These acquisitions contribute to our efforts to expand our consolidated product range, customer base and global platform, and we believe may accelerate emerging market penetration, particularly in strategic markets such as China and South America. The combined Hurco, Milltronics and Takumi businesses represent a comprehensive product portfolio with more than 150 different models. The combined machine tool product lines also provide benefits related to the development of product enhancements, technologies and models due to leverage of shared resources and cross-utilization of proven engineering designs that allow us to achieve manufacturing cost reductions from economies of scale and manufacturing efficiencies.

&#160;

&#160; 1 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we acquired the machine tool components business of an Italian designer and manufacturer of electro-mechanical components and accessories for machine tools. We are operating this business through our wholly-owned subsidiary, LCM Precision Technology S.r.l. (&#8220;LCM&#8221;). This acquisition supports our mission to develop advanced machine tool technologies to support our customers who need increasingly sophisticated and versatile CNC machine tools to stay competitive and to grow profitability.

&#160;

Our executive offices and principal design and engineering operations are headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Sales, application engineering and service subsidiaries are located in China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. We have manufacturing and assembly operations in Taiwan, the U.S., Italy and China, and distribution facilities in the U.S., the Netherlands, and Taiwan.

&#160;

Since our founding in 1968, we have been a leader in the introduction of interactive computer control systems that automate manufacturing processes and improve productivity in the metal parts manufacturing industry. We pioneered the application of microprocessor technology and conversational programming software for use in machine tools. Our computer control systems can be operated by both skilled and unskilled machine tool operators and yet are capable of instructing a machine to perform complex tasks. The combination of microprocessor technology and patented interactive, conversational programming software in our computer control systems enables operators on the production floor to quickly and easily create a program for machining a particular part from a blueprint or computer aided design file and immediately begin machining that part. With the addition of the Takumi brand, we have expanded our customer base to include manufacturers who opt for industrial controls. Generally, manufacturers who use industrial controls have production-oriented operations where they run medium to large batches of just a few different types of parts. Therefore, the amount of time the manufacturer spends programming and setting up the part is inconsequential to the part&#8217;s profit margin. Conversely, manufacturers who have high-mix/small batch operations (i.e., they run small batches of many different types of parts) must program and set up multiple parts each day. Therefore, the amount of time dedicated to programming and setting up these parts has a significant impact on profit margin, which is why these manufacturers opt for our machine tools equipped with our proprietary controls and interactive software that allows them to minimize programming and setup time.

&#160;

Our strategy is to design, manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of computerized machine tools that help customers in the worldwide metal cutting market increase productivity and profitability. The majority of our machine tools employ proprietary, interactive, computer control technology that increases productivity through ease of operation via interactive conversational and graphical programming software. All of our machines tools deliver high levels of machine performance (speed, accuracy and surface finish quality) that increases productivity. We routinely expand our product offerings to meet customer needs, which has led us to design and manufacture more complex machining centers with advanced capabilities. We bring a disciplined approach to strategically enter new geographic markets, as appropriate.

&#160;

Industry 

&#160;

Machine tool products are considered capital goods, which makes them part of an industry that has historically been highly cyclical. 

&#160;

Although industry association data for the U.S. machine tool market is available, that market only accounts for approximately 14% of worldwide consumption. Reports available for the U.S. machine tool market include:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; United States Machine Tool Consumption &#8211; generated by the Association for Manufacturing Technology, this report includes metal cutting machines of all types and sizes, including segments in which we do not compete &#160; &#8226; Purchasing Manager&#8217;s Index - developed by the Institute for Supply Management, this report includes activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that purchase machine tools &#160; &#8226; Capacity Utilization of Manufacturing Companies &#8211; issued by the Federal Reserve Board &#160;

&#160; 2 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

A limited amount of information is available for foreign markets, and different reporting methodologies are used by various countries. Machine tool consumption data published by Gardner Publications, Inc., calculates machine tool consumption annually by country. It is important to note that data for foreign countries are based on government reports that may lag 6 to 12 months and, therefore, are unreliable for forecasting purposes. 

&#160;

Demand for capital equipment can fluctuate significantly during periods of changing economic conditions. Manufacturers and suppliers of capital goods, such as our company, are often the first to experience these changes in demand. Additionally, since our typical order backlog is approximately 45 days, it is difficult to estimate demand with any reasonable certainty. Therefore, we do not have the benefit of relying on the common leading indicators that other industries use for market analysis and forecasting purposes.

&#160;

Products 

&#160;

Our core products consist of general purpose computerized machine tools for the metal cutting industry, principally, vertical machining centers (mills) and turning centers (lathes). The majority of our machine tools are equipped and integrated fully with our proprietary software and computer control systems, while a small percentage are equipped with industry standard controls. Additionally, we produce and distribute software options, control upgrades, hardware accessories and replacement parts for our machine tool product lines, and we provide operator training and support services to our customers. We also produce computer control systems and related software for press brake applications that are sold as retrofit units for installation on existing or new press brake machines.

&#160; 

The Hurco Companies Brand Portfolio 

&#160; 

With the addition of the Milltronics and Takumi businesses, we now have three brands of CNC machine tools in our product portfolio: Hurco is the premium brand focused on sophisticated technology. Milltronics is the entry level brand with a simplified control and straightforward feature sets. Takumi is an industry standard brand with machines that are equipped with industry standard controls instead of the proprietary controls found on Hurco and Milltronics machines. Typically, manufacturing facilities that use industry standard controls focus on medium to high production, wherein they run large batches of a few types of parts instead of small batches of many different types of parts. In addition, through LCM, we produce machine tool components and accessories. The main product categories of each brand are outlined below.

&#160;

Hurco Brand of CNC Machine Tools 

&#160; 

We design, manufacture and sell computerized machine tools equipped with a fully integrated interactive computer control system that features our proprietary WinMax &#174; software. Our computer control system enables a machine tool operator to create complex two-dimensional or three-dimensional machining programs directly from an engineering drawing or computer-aided design geometry file. An operator with little or no machine tool programming experience can successfully create a program with minimal training and begin machining the part in a short period of time. The control features an operator console with a liquid crystal display (LCD), and incorporates an upgradeable personal computer (PC) platform using a high speed processor with solid rendering graphical programming. In addition, WinMax &#174; has a Windows &#174; &#8224; based operating system that enables users to improve shop floor flexibility and software productivity. Companies using computer controlled machine tools are better able to:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; maximize the efficiency of their human resources; &#160; &#8226; make more advanced and complex parts from a wide range of materials using multiple processes; &#160; &#8226; incorporate fast moving changes in technology into their operations to keep their competitive edge; and &#160; &#8226; integrate their business into the global supply chain of their customers by supporting small to medium lot sizes for &#8220;just in time&#8221; initiatives. &#160;

Our Windows &#174; based control facilitates our ability to meet these customer needs. The familiar Windows &#174; operating system coupled with our intuitive conversational style of program creation allows our customers&#8217; operators to create and edit part-making programs without incurring the incremental overhead of specialized computer aided design and computer aided manufacturing programmers. With the ability to transfer most computer aided design data directly into a Hurco program, programming time can be significantly reduced.

&#160;

Machine tool products today are being designed to meet the demand for machining complex parts with greater part accuracies. Our proprietary controls with WinMax &#174; software and high speed processors efficiently handle the large amounts of data these complex part-making programs require, which enable our customers to create parts with higher accuracy at faster speeds. We continue to add technology to our control design as it becomes available. For example, UltiMotion, our patented motion control system, provides significant cycle time reductions and increases the quality of a part&#8217;s surface finish. This technology differentiates us in the marketplace and is incorporated into our control.

&#160; 

&#160; 7 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Software Products 

&#160;

In addition to our standard computer control features, we offer software option products for part programming. These products are sold to users of our Hurco computerized machine tools equipped with our twin touch-screen or single touch-screen consoles featuring WinMax &#174; control software. Each international division packages the options as appropriate for its market. The most common options include: Swept Surface, DXF Transfer, UltiMonitor, UltiPocket with Helical Ramp Entry and Insert Pockets, Conversational Part and Tool Probing, Tool and Material Library, NC/Conversational Merge, Job List, Stream Load, Linear Thermal Compensation, Thread Repair, and Simultaneous Five-Axis Contouring.

&#160;

Our Swept Surface software option simplifies programming of 3D contours and significantly reduces programming time.

&#160;

The DXF Transfer software option increases operator productivity because it eliminates manual data entry of part features by transferring AutoCAD &#174; * drawing files directly into our computer control or into our desktop programming software, WinMax &#174; Desktop.

&#160;

UltiMonitor is a web-based productivity, management and service tool that enables customers to monitor, inspect and receive notifications about their Hurco machines from any location where they can access the internet. Customers can transfer part designs, receive event notifications via email or text, access diagnostic data, monitor the machine via webcam and communicate with the machine operator.

&#160;

UltiPocket with Helical Ramp Entry and Insert Pockets automatically calculates the tool path around islands, eliminating the arduous task of plotting these shapes. Islands can also be rotated, scaled and repeated.

&#160;

Conversational Part and Tool Probing options permit the computerized dimensional measurement of machined parts and the associated cutting tools. This &#8220;on-machine&#8221; technique improves the throughput of the measurement process when compared to traditional &#8220;off-machine&#8221; approaches.

&#160;

The Tool and Material Library option stores the tool and material information with the machine instead of storing it with each individual part program. The user enters the tool data and geometry one time and chooses the particular tool from the list when it is needed. Additionally, the library reads the part program and automatically locates the tool or displays an alert if the tool does not exist. In addition to saving time, the Tool and Material Library eliminates the need to enter information repeatedly, and can prevent common tool crash conditions.

&#160;

NC/Conversational Merge lets the user incorporate conversational features, such as tool probing, pattern operations, and scaling into existing G-Code programs.

&#160;

Job List provides an intuitive way to group files together and run them sequentially without operator intervention, which promotes automation, lights-out machining, program stitching, file bundling, and adaptive processes.

&#160;

Stream Load allows the user to run very large NC files without the need to upload the entire file into the control&#8217;s memory to avoid exceeding memory limits. 

&#160;

Linear Thermal Compensation is a feature that allows the user to specify corrections to compensate for the effects of thermal growth in high speed machining applications.

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Thread Repair is a feature for turning applications that provides an efficient way to repair existing threads, which is especially beneficial for large pipes and other parts manufactured for the oil/energy sector.

&#160;

Simultaneous Five-Axis Contouring software enables a five-axis machine to command motion concurrently on all axes. This allows the user to create continuous tool-paths along complex geometries with only a single machine/part setup, providing increased productivity along with the performance benefits of using shorter cutting tools. The sale of simultaneous five-axis contouring software is subject to government export licensing requirements.

Our facility in Ningbo, China, focuses on the machining of castings to support HML&#8217;s production in Taiwan. The LCM line of electro-mechanical components and accessories for machine tools are designed and manufactured in Italy. Our facility in Indianapolis, Indiana also conducts final assembly operations for certain Hurco VMX machines for the North American market and manufactures certain electro-spindle components for LCM.

&#160;

We have a contract manufacturing agreement for computer control systems with Hurco Automation, Ltd. (&#8220;HAL&#8221;), a Taiwanese company in which we have a 35% ownership interest. This company produces all of our computer control systems to our specifications, sources industry standard computer components and our proprietary parts, performs final assembly and conducts test operations.

&#160;

We work closely with our subsidiaries, key component suppliers and HAL to ensure that their production capacity will be sufficient to meet the projected demand for our machine tool products. Many of the key components used in our machines can be sourced from multiple suppliers. However, any prolonged interruption of operations or significant reduction in the capacity or performance capability at any of our manufacturing facilities, or at any of our key component suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

&#160; 

Marketing and Distribution 

&#160;

We sell our products through more than 170 independent agents and distributors throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Although some distributors carry competitive products, we are the primary line for the majority of our distributors globally. We also have direct sales personnel in China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and certain parts of the United States, which are among the world's principal machine tool consuming markets.

&#160;

Approximately 82% of the worldwide demand for computerized machine tools and computer control systems is outside of North America. In fiscal 2015, approximately 68% of our revenues were from overseas customers. No single end-user or distributor of our products accounted for more than 5% of our total sales and service fees. The end-users of our products are precision tool, die and mold manufacturers, independent job shops, and specialized short-run production applications within large manufacturing operations. Industries served include aerospace, defense, medical equipment, energy, automotive/transportation, electronics and computer industries.

&#160;

We also sell our Autobend &#174; computer control systems to original equipment manufacturers of new metal fabrication machine tools that integrate them with their own products prior to the sale of those products to their own customers, to retrofitters of used metal fabrication machine tools that integrate them with those machines as part of the retrofitting operation, and to end-users that have an installed base of metal fabrication machine tools, either with or without related computer control systems.

&#160;

Demand 

&#160;

We believe demand for our products is driven by advances in industrial technology and the related demand for automated process improvements. Other factors affecting demand include:

&#160;

&#160; &#8226; the need to continuously improve productivity and shorten cycle time; &#160; &#160; &#8226; an aging machine tool installed base that will require replacement with more advanced technology;

&#160; &#8226; the industrial development of emerging markets in Asia and Eastern Europe; and &#160; &#160; &#8226; the declining supply of skilled machinists. &#160; &#160;

Demand for our products is also highly dependent upon economic conditions and the general level of business confidence, as well as such factors as production capacity utilization and changes in governmental policies regarding tariffs, corporate taxation, fluctuations in foreign currencies, and other investment incentives.

&#160;

Competition 

&#160;

We compete with many other machine tool producers in the United States and foreign countries. Most of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than our company. Major worldwide competitors include Deckel Maho Gildemeister Group (DMG), Mori Seiki Co., Ltd., Mazak, Haas Automation, Inc., Hardinge Inc., Doosan, and Okuma Machinery Works Ltd. 

&#160;

&#160; 10 &#160; 

&#160;

&#160;

Through our subsidiary LCM, we compete with manufacturers of machine tool components and accessories such as IBAG, Kessler, Peron Speed, GSA Technology Co., LTD and Duplomatic Automation.

&#160;

We strive to compete effectively by developing patentable software and other proprietary features that offer enhanced productivity, technological capabilities and ease of use. We offer our products in a range of prices and capabilities to target a broad potential market. We also believe that our competitiveness is aided by our reputation for reliability and quality, our strong international sales and distribution organization, and our extensive customer service organization.

&#160; 

Intellectual Property 

&#160;

We consider the majority of our products to be proprietary. Various features of our control systems and machine tools employ technologies covered by patents and trademarks that are material to our business. We also own additional patents covering new technologies that we have acquired or developed, and that we are planning to incorporate into our control systems in the future.

&#160;

Employees 

&#160;

We had approximately 769 full-time employees at the end of fiscal 2015, none of whom are covered by a collective-bargaining agreement or represented by a union. We have experienced no employee-generated work stoppages or disruptions and we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory.
