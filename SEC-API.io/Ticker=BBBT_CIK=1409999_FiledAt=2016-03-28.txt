 ITEM 1. BUSINESS &#160; 

The Company was incorporated in December 2006.

&#160;

On February 18, 2010 the Company&#8217;s directors approved an agreement between the Company and EFT Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;EFT&#8221;), whereby EFT agreed to assign its worldwide distribution and servicing rights to a product known as the &#8220;EFT-Phone&#8221; in exchange for 79,265,000 shares of the Company&#8217;s common stock.

&#160;

Aside from its &#8220;EFT-Phone&#8221;, EFT distributes 25 nutritional products, 18 personal care products, an environmentally friendly automotive product, an environmentally friendly house cleaner and a portable drinking container which contains a filter to remove impurities. 

&#160;

EFT markets its products through a direct sales organization. Once a customer of EFT&#8217;s makes a minimum purchase of $600 (plus $60 for shipping and handling fees), the customer becomes an &#8220;Affiliate&#8221;.

&#160;

The EFT-Phone consists of a cell phone which uses the Microsoft Operating System. The EFT-Phone has an application that will allow EFT&#8217;s affiliate base to access all of their back office sites including their Funds Management Account where the affiliate will be able to deposit, withdraw and transfer money to another EFT account or to another EFT Affiliate at no cost for the transfer.

&#160;

The worldwide distribution and servicing rights to the EFT-Phone include the right to sell the EFT-Phone to EFT&#8217;s affiliates and others. Servicing includes the collection of service fees for all EFT-Phones worldwide, including monthly fees, usage fees, as well as call forwarding, call waiting, text messaging and video fees. The Company also acquired the rights to distribute all EFT-Phone accessories.

&#160;

In connection with the agreement between the Company and EFT:

&#160;

&#183; The former officers and directors of the Company resigned; and &#160;

&#183; Jack Jie Qin was appointed as the Company&#8217;s sole director. &#160;

The Company did not receive any orders for the EFT phone during the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company has been advised by EFT that due to a significant drop in demand for the EFT phone, EFT has not placed any new orders with the Company. It is the Company&#8217;s understanding that EFT has inventory previously purchased from the Company and until sales increase, EFT will not be placing any new orders from the Company.

&#160;
