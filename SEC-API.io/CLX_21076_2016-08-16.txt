 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview of Business 

The Clorox Company is a leading multinational manufacturer and marketer of consumer and professional products with fiscal year 2016 net sales of $5.8 billion and approximately 8,000 employees worldwide as of June 30, 2016. Clorox sells its products primarily through grocery and mass retail outlets, e-commerce channels, wholesale distributors and medical supply distributors. Clorox markets some of the most trusted and recognized consumer brand names, including its namesake bleach and cleaning products, Pine-Sol &#174; cleaners, Liquid-Plumr &#174; clog removers, Poett &#174; home care products, Fresh Step &#174; cat litter, Glad &#174; bags, wraps and container products, Kingsford &#174; charcoal, Renew Life &#174; digestive health products, Hidden Valley &#174; dressings and sauces, Brita &#174; water-filtration products, and Burt&#146;s Bees &#174; natural personal care products. The Company also markets brands through professional services channels, including infection control products for the healthcare industry under Clorox Healthcare &#174; and Clorox Commercial Solutions &#174; . More than 80% of the Company&#146;s sales are generated from brands that hold the No. 1 or No. 2 market share positions in their categories. The Company was founded in Oakland, California in 1913 and is incorporated in Delaware. 

The Company&#146;s 2020 strategy focuses on delivering long-term, profitable growth and total shareholder return. The Company&#146;s long-term financial goals include annual net sales growth of 3-5%, annual EBIT margin growth of 25-50 basis points and annual free cash flow of 10-12% of net sales. 

On May 2, 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the digestive health company Renew Life for $290 million. The purchase of the Renew Life business aligns with the Company&#146;s acquisition strategy to target leading brands with attractive margins in high-growth categories, particularly in health and wellness. Results for Renew Life&#146;s domestic business are reflected in the Household reportable segment and results for Renew Life&#146;s international business are reflected in the International reportable segment. Included in the Company&#146;s results for fiscal year 2016 was $21 million of Renew Life&#146;s global net sales. 

In fiscal year 2016, the Company delivered strong results including 2% net sales growth and an 8% increase in diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations, despite a highly competitive environment in the U.S. and a difficult macro-environment, including unfavorable foreign exchange rates and challenging economies in International markets. 

The Company focused on driving sales growth in its U.S. business, leveraging incremental demand building investments and innovation, to drive category growth and market share improvements. In particular, the Company launched new products in many categories in fiscal year 2016, including the Brita &#174; Infinity pitcher, Burt's Bees &#174; lipsticks, Clorox Healthcare &#174; nasal antiseptic swabs, Clorox Healthcare &#174; Optimum-UV Enlight, Fresh Step &#174; with Febreze &#153; , Glad &#174; DualDefense &#153; trash bags, Hidden Valley &#174; Greek yogurt dressing. 

In international markets, the Company focused on a number of measures to address economic challenges experienced in fiscal year 2016. Significant currency declines across the majority of countries and high inflation in several markets were partially offset by price increases and cost savings initiatives. Despite these challenges, the Company&#146;s international business continued to play an important strategic role, with No. 1 and No. 2 brands in multiple countries and strong growth of the Burt&#146;s Bees &#174; brand internationally. 

In fiscal year 2016, the Company repurchased approximately 2 million shares of its common stock for $254 million, paid $398 million in dividends to stockholders and announced a 4% increase in its quarterly dividend from prior year, payable in August 2016. 

Finally, the Company continued its commitment to corporate responsibility by maintaining strong and transparent environmental, social and governance practices. The Company remained committed to lowering water and energy use, solid waste to landfill and greenhouse gas emissions as part of its 2020 operational footprint reduction goals. The Company was recognized as one of the top corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility magazine and named as one of the greenest companies in the 2016 Newsweek Green Rankings. In fiscal year 2016, together The Clorox Company Foundation and The Burt&#146;s Bees Greater Good Foundation awarded approximately $5 million in cash grants, and the Company made product donations with a fair market value of approximately $8 million and contributed more than $1 million to deserving nonprofits through cause marketing programs for social and charitable causes. 

In fiscal year 2017, Clorox anticipates ongoing challenges that may impact its sales and margins, including unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in Argentina, and a continuation of challenging international economies. In addition, the Company is monitoring anticipated slower U.S. category growth, driven primarily by expected competitive activity and changes to commodity costs and manufacturing and logistics costs.

In the United States, most of the Company&#146;s products are nationally advertised and sold to mass retail-outlets, warehouse clubs, and dollar, military and other types of retail stores primarily through a direct sales force, and to grocery stores and grocery wholesalers primarily through a combination of direct sales teams and a network of brokers. The Company sells institutional, janitorial, and food-service versions of many of its products through distributors using a network of brokers, and sells healthcare products through a direct sales force and medical supply distributors.

Financial Information About Foreign and Domestic Operations 

For detailed financial information about the Company&#146;s foreign and domestic operations, including net sales and property, plant and equipment, net, by geographic area, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

The Company purchases raw materials from numerous unaffiliated domestic and international suppliers, some of which are sole-source or single-source suppliers. Interruptions in the delivery of these materials could adversely impact the Company. Key raw materials used by the Company include resin, diesel, sodium hypochlorite, corrugated cardboard and agricultural commodities. Sufficient raw materials were available during fiscal year 2016. Costs for resin and diesel decreased in fiscal year 2016. However, costs for many materials continued to increase amid volatility and inflation in some key geographic and commodity markets, which the Company expects to continue in fiscal year 2017. The Company generally utilizes supply and forward-purchase contracts to help ensure availability and help manage the volatility of the pricing of raw materials needed in its operations. However, the Company is nonetheless highly exposed to changes in the prices of commodities used as raw materials in the manufacturing of its products. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; in Exhibit 99.1 and &#147;Risk Factors &#150; Volatility and increases in the costs of raw materials, energy, transportation, labor and other necessary supplies or services have harmed, and in the future may harm, the Company&#146;s net earnings and cash flow&#148; in Item 1.A. 

Patents and Trademarks 

Most of the Company&#146;s brand name consumer products are protected by registered trademarks. The Company&#146;s brand names and trademarks are highly important to its business, and the Company vigorously protects its trademarks from apparent infringements. Maintenance of brand equity value is critical to the Company&#146;s success. The Company&#146;s patent rights are also material to its business and are asserted, where appropriate, against apparent infringements. 

Seasonality 

Most sales of the Company&#146;s charcoal products occur in the first six months of each calendar year. A moderate seasonality trend also occurs in the net sales of the Company&#146;s Burt&#146;s Bees &#174; natural personal care products, with slightly more than half of the annual net sales occurring during the months of October through March. Short-term borrowings may be used to fund inventories of those products in the off season. 

Customers 

Net sales to the Company&#146;s largest customer, Walmart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, were 27%, 26% and 27% of consolidated net sales for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and occurred in each of the Company&#146;s reportable segments. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of consolidated net sales in any of these fiscal years. During fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company&#146;s five largest customers accounted for 46%, 45%, and 45% of its consolidated net sales for each of the three fiscal years, respectively. 

Competition 

The markets for consumer products are highly competitive. The Company&#146;s products compete with other nationally advertised brands and with &#147;private label&#148; brands within each category. Competition comes from similar and alternative products, some of which are produced and marketed by major multinational or national companies having financial resources greater than those of the Company. The Company&#146;s products generally compete on the basis of product performance, brand recognition, and price. A newly introduced consumer product (whether improved or newly developed) usually encounters intense competition requiring substantial expenditures for advertising, sales promotion and trade merchandising support. If a product gains consumer acceptance, it typically requires continued advertising and promotional support and ongoing product improvements to maintain its relative market position. For further information regarding the intense competition the Company faces, see &#147;Risk Factors &#150; The Company faces intense competition in its markets, which could lead to reduced net sales, net earnings and cash flow&#148; in Item 1.A. 

Research and Development 

The Company conducts research and development primarily at its facility located in Pleasanton, CA, which the Company has leased since 2011. The Pleasanton facility consists of approximately 357,000 square feet of leased space, utilizing state-of-the-art labs and open work spaces to encourage creativity, collaboration and innovation. In addition to the leased facility in Pleasanton, CA, the Company conducts research and development activities in Meriden, CT; Willowbrook, IL; Durham, NC; Cincinnati, OH; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

The Company devotes significant resources and attention to product development, process technology and consumer insight research to develop commercially viable consumer-preferred products with innovative and distinctive features. The Company incurred expenses of $141 million, $136 million and $125 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, on direct research activities relating to the development of new products and/or the improvement of existing products. In addition, the Company obtains technologies from third parties for use in its products. Royalties relating to such technologies are reflected in the Company&#146;s Cost of products sold. For further information regarding the Company&#146;s research and development costs, see &#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#148; in Exhibit 99.1.
