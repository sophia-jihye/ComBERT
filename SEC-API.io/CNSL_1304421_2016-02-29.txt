 Item 1. Business. 

&#160; 

Consolidated Communications Holdings, Inc. is a Delaware holding company with operating subsidiaries th at provide integrated communications services in consumer, commercial and carrier channels in California, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin . We were founded in 1894 as the Mattoon Telephone Company by the great-grandfather of one of the members of our Board of Directors, Richard A. Lumpkin. After several acquisitions, the Mattoon Telephone Company was incorporated as the Illinois Consolidated Telephone Company on April 10, 1924. We were incorporated under the laws of Delaware in 2002, and through our predecessors we have provided telecommunications services for more than a century. 

&#160; 

In addition to our focus on organic growth in our commercial and carrier channels, our acquisitions over the last decade have achieved business growth and the diversification of revenue and cash flow streams, and they have created a strong platform for future growth. Our strategic approach to evaluating potential transactions includes analysis of the market opportunity, the quality of the network, our ability to integrate the acquired company efficiently and the potential for creating significant operating synergies and generating positive cash flow at the inception of each acquisition. Operating synergies are created through the use of consistent platforms, convergence of processes and functional management of the combined entities. We measure our synergies during the first two years following an acquisition. For example, the acquisition of our Texas properties in 2004 tripled the size of our business and gave us the requisite scale to make system and platform decisions that would facilitate future acquisitions. The acquisition of our Pennsylvania properties in 2007 achieved synergies in excess of $12.0 million in annualized savings, which at the time, represented approximately 20% of their operating expense. The acquisition of SureWest Communications in 2012 achieved synergies of $29.5 million during the two years subsequent to the acquisition date. As a result of the acquisition of Enventis Corporation, a Minnesota corporation (&#8220;Enventis&#8221;), in October 2014, as described below, we expect to generate annual operating synergies of approximately $1 7 .0 million, which will be phased in over the first two years subsequent to the acquisition date as integration projects are completed. Through these acquisitions, we have positioned our business to provide services in rural, suburban and metropolitan markets, with service territories spanning the country. 

&#160; 

We provide a wide range of services and products that include local and long-distance service, high-speed broadband Internet access, video services, Voice over Internet Protocol (&#8220;VoIP&#8221;) , private line services, carrier grade access services, network capacity services over our regional fiber optic networks, c loud data services, data center and managed services, directory publishing and equipment sales.

Recent Business Developments 

&#160; 

Enventis Merger 

&#160; 

On October 16, 2014, we completed our merger with Enventis and acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of Enventis in exchange for shares of our common stock. As a result, Enventis became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Enventis is an advanced communications provider, which services consumer, commercial and wholesale carrier customer channels primarily in the upper Midwest. The acquisition reflects our strategy to diversify revenue and cash flows amongst multiple products and to expand our network to new markets. The financial results for Enventis have been included in our consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report in Part II &#8211; Item 8 &#8211; &#8220;Financial Statements and Supplementary Data&#8221; for a more detailed discussion of the transaction.

&#160; 

Description of Our Business 

&#160; 

We are an integrated communications services company that operates as both an Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (&#8220;ILEC&#8221;) and a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier (&#8220;CLEC&#8221;) dependent upon the territory served. We provide an array of services in consumer, commercial and carrier channels in 11 states, including local and long-distance service, high-speed broadband Internet access, video services, VoIP, custom calling features, private line services, carrier grade access services, network capacity services over our regional fiber optic networks, data center and managed services, directory publishing, equipment sales and cloud data services. The geographic areas we serve are characterized by a balanced mix of growing suburban areas and stable, rural territories. The acquisition of Enventis in 2014 further diversifie d our operating revenues and cash flows across multiple business lines and markets. 

&#160; 

We generate the majority of our consolidated operating revenue primarily from subscriptions to our video and data services (collectively &#8220;broadband services&#8221;) and transport services to business and residential customers. Revenues increased $140.0 million during 2015 compared to 2014, primarily from growth in commercial services, total data connections and the acquisition of Enventis in 2014. We expect our broadband services revenue to continue to grow as consumer and commercial demands for data based services increase. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We continue to focus on commercial and broadband growth opportunities and are continually expanding our commercial product offerings for both small and large businesses to capitalize on industry technological advances. We can leverage our fiber optic networks and tailor our services for business customers by developing solutions to fit their specific needs. We gained strategic advantage through the acquisition of Enventis in 2014, which recently launched a suite of cloud data services that increases efficiency and reduces IT costs for our customers. In addition, we recently launched an enhanced hosted voice product, which enables greater scalability and reliability for businesses. We anticipate future momentum in new commercial services as these new products gain traction. 

&#160; 

We market services to our residential customers either individually or as a bundled package. Our &#8220;triple play&#8221; bundle includes our voice, video and data services. Data connections continue to increase as a result of consumer trends toward increased Internet usage and our enhanced product and service offerings, such as our progressively increasing consumer data speeds. We introduced data speeds of up to 1 Gbps to approximately 20,000 of our fiber-to-the-home customers in our Kansas market and a limited portion of our Pennsylvania market in December 2014 and in our Texas market in the first quarter of 2015, with our California market to follow in 2016. Where 1 Gbps speeds are not yet offered, the maximum broadband speed is 100 Mbps, depending on the geographic market availability. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 29% of the homes in the areas we serve subscribe to our data service. 

&#160; 

Our exceptional consumer broadband speed allows us to continue to meet the needs of our customers and the demand for higher speed resulting from the growing trend of over-the-top (&#8220;OTT&#8221;) content viewing. The availability of 1 Gbps data speed also complements our wireless home networking (&#8220;Wi-Fi&#8221;) that supports our TV Everywhere service and allows our subscribers to watch their favorite programs at home or away on a computer, smartphone or tablet. 

&#160; 

We tailor our services to commercial and carrier customers by developing solutions to fit their specific needs. We provide services to a wide range of commercial customers from sole proprietors and other small businesses to multi-location corporations and telecommunications carriers. Our business suite of services includes local and long-distance calling plans, hosted voice services using C loud network servers, the added capacity for multiple phone lines, scalable broadband Internet, online back-up and business directory listings. 

&#160; 

For larger businesses, we offer data services including dedicated Internet access through our Metro Ethernet network. Wide Area Network (&#8220;WAN&#8221;) products include point-to-point and multi-point deployments from 2.5 Mbps to 10 Gbps, accommodating the growth patterns of our business customers. Our data centers provide redundant, scalable bandwidth over a self-healing fiber-optic backbone that is protected by uninterrupted power supplies and generator back-ups with direct connection to broadband. We also offer wholesale services to regional and national interexchange and wireless carriers, including cellular backhaul , &#160; dark fiber and other fiber -based transport solutions with speeds up to 100 Gbps . 

&#160; 

A discussion of factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in Part I &#8211; Item 1A &#8211; &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;, which is incorporated herein by reference.

All telecommunications providers continue to face increased competition as a result of technology changes and legislative and regulatory developments in the industry. We continue to focus on commercial growth opportunities and are continually expanding our commercial product offerings for both small and large businesses to capitalize on industry technological advances. In addition, we expect our broadband services revenue to continue to grow as consumer and commercial demands for data based services increase, which will offset the anticipated decline in traditional voice services impacted by the ongoing industry-wide reduction in residential access lines. 

&#160; 

Commercial and Carrier 

&#160; 

Data and Transport Services &#160; 

&#160; 

We provide a variety of business communication services to small, medium and large business customers, including many services over our advanced fiber network. The services we offer include scalable high speed broadband Internet access and VoIP phone services , which range from basic service plans to virtual hosted systems. Our hosted VoIP package utilizes our soft switching technology and enables our customers to have the flexibility of employing new telephone advances and features without investing in a new telephone system. The package bundles local service, calling features, Internet protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) business telephones and unified messaging, which integrates multiple messaging technologies into a single system and allows the customer to receive and listen to voice messages through email. 

&#160; 

In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we also offer a variety of commercial data connectivity services in select markets including private line , WAN &#160; and Ethernet services to provide high bandwidth connectivity across point-to-point and multiple site networks. Networking services are available at a variety of speeds up to 10 Gbps. Data center and disaster recovery solutions also provide a reliable and local colocation option for commercial customers. We have also recently launched a suite of Cloud-based services which includes a hosted unified communications solution that replaces the customer&#8217;s on-site phone systems and data networks, managed network security services and data protection services. 

&#160; 

We also offer wholesale services to regional and national interexchange and wireless carriers, including cellular backhaul , dark fiber and other fiber transport solutions with speeds up to 100 Gbps . The demand for backhaul services continues to grow as wireless carriers are faced with escalating consumer and commercial demands for wireless data. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Voice Services &#160; 

&#160; 

Voice services include basic local phone and long-distance service packages for business customers. The plans include options for voicemail, conference calling, linking multiple office locations and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding, speed dialing and call waiting. Services can be charged at a fixed monthly rate, a measured rate or can be bundled with selected services at a discounted rate. 

&#160; 

Consumer 

&#160; 

Broadband Services &#160; 

&#160; 

Broadband services include revenue from residential customers for subscriptions to our VoIP, data and video products. We offer high speed Internet access at speeds of up to 1 Gbps, depending on the nature of the network facilities that are available, the level of service selected and the lo cation. Our data service plans also include wireless internet access, email and internet security and protection. Our VoIP digital phone service is also available in certain markets as an alternative to the traditional telephone line. We offer multiple voice service plans with customizable calling features and voicemail. Depending on geographic market availability, our video services range from limited basic service to advanced digital television, which includes several plans each with hundreds of local, national and music channels including premium and pay-per-view channels as well as video on-demand service. Certain customers may also subscribe to our advanced video services, which consist of high-definition television, digital video recorders (&#8220;DVR&#8221;) and/or a whole home DVR. Our Whole Home DVR allows customers the ability to watch recorded shows on any television in the house, record multiple shows at one time and utilize an intuitive on-screen guide and user interface. Video subscribers also have access to our TV Everywhere service which allows subscriber access to full episodes of available shows, movies and live streams using a computer or mobile device. 

&#160; 

Voice Services &#160; 

&#160; 

We offer several different basic local phone service packages and long-distance calling plans, including unlimited flat-rate calling plans. The plans include options for voicemail and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding and call waiting. The number of local access lines in service directly affects the recurring revenue we generate from end users and continues to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in access lines. We expect to continue to experience modest erosion in voice connections due to competition from alternative technologies, including our own competing VoIP product. &#160; 

&#160; 

Equipment Sales and Service 

&#160; 

As an equipment integrator, we offer network design, implementation and support services, including maintenance contracts, in order to provide integrated communication solutions for our customers. We sell telecommunications equipment, such as key, Private Branch Exchange (&#8220;PBX&#8221;), IP-based telephone systems and other sophisticated hardware solutions, and offer support services to medium and large business customers. Through our acquisition of Enventis in 2014, we obtained a leading market relationship with Cisco Systems, Inc. and, as a result, are an accredited Master Level Unified Communications and Gold Certified Cisco Partner providing equipment solutions and support for business customers. Our strategic relationship with Cisco as the supplier allows us to deploy a wide range of collaboration, data center and network technology solutions. We earned Cisco&#8217;s Master Cloud Builder Specialization and received the Data Center Interconnect designation. We maintain numerous Cisco specializations and authorizations, as well as partner relationships with EMC, NetApp, VMware and other industry-leading vendors in order to provide integrated communication solutions that best fit our customers&#8217; needs. 

&#160; 

Subsidies &#160; 

&#160; 

Subsidies consist of both federal and state subsidies, which are designed to promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas. Subsidies are funded by end user surcharges to which telecommunications providers, including local, long-distance and wireless carriers, contribute on a monthly basis. Subsidies are allocated and distributed to participating carriers monthly based upon their respective costs for providing local service. Similar to access charges, subsidies are regulated by federal and state regulatory commissions. See Part I &#8211; Item 1 &#8211; &#8220;Regulatory Environment&#8221; below and Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; &#8220;Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business&#8221; for further discussion regarding the subsidies we receive. 

&#160;

&#160; 

Network Access Services &#160; 

&#160; 

Network access services include interstate and intrastate switched access revenue, network special access services and end user access. Switched access revenue includes access services to other communications carriers to terminate or originate long-distance calls on our network. Special access circuits provide dedicated lines and trunks to business customers and interexchange carriers. Certain of our network access revenues are based on rates set or approved by federal and state regulatory commissions or as directed by law that are subject to change at any time. 

&#160; 

Other Products and Services 

&#160; 

Other products and services include revenues from telephone directory publishing, video advertising and billing and support services. 

&#160; 

No customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. 

&#160; 

Wireless partnerships 

&#160; 

In addition to our core business, we also derive a significant portion of our cash flow and earnings from investments in five wireless partnerships. Wireless partnership investment income is included as a component of other income in the consolidated statements of income. Our wireless partnership investment consists of five cellular partnerships: GTE Mobilnet of South Texas Limited Partnership (&#8220;Mobilnet South Partnership&#8221;), GTE Mobilnet of Texas RSA #17 Limited Partnership (&#8220;RSA #17&#8221;) , Pittsburgh SMSA Limited Partnership (&#8220;Pittsburgh SMSA&#8221;) , Pennsylvania RSA No. 6(I) Limited Partnership (&#8220;RSA 6(I)&#8221;) and Pennsylvania RSA No. 6(II) Limited Partnership (&#8220;RSA 6(II)&#8221;) . 

&#160; 

We own 2.34% of the Mobilnet South Partnership. The principal activity of the Mobilnet South Partnership is providing cellular service in the Houston, Galveston and Beaumont, Texas metropolitan areas. Because we have a minor ownership interest and cannot influence operations, we account for this investment using the cost method. Income is recognized only upon cash distributions of our proportionate earnings in the partnership. 

&#160; 

We own 20.51% of RSA #17, which serves areas in and around Conroe, Texas. Because we have some influence over the operating and financial policies of this partnership, we account for the investment under the equity method, recognizing income on our proportionate share of earnings. Cash distributions are recorded as a reduction in our investment. 

&#160; 

San Antonio MTA, L.P., a wholly owned partnership of Cellco Partnership (doing business as Verizon Wireless), is the general partner for both the Mobilnet South Partnership and RSA #17 . 

&#160; 

We own 3.60% of Pittsburgh SMSA, 16.67% of RSA 6(I) and 23.67% of RSA 6(II), all of which are majority owned and operated by Verizon Wireless. These partnerships cover territories that almost entirely overlap the markets served by our Pennsylvania ILEC and CLEC operations. Because of our limited influence over Pittsburgh SMSA, we account for the investment using the cost method. RSA 6(I) and RSA 6(II) are accounted for under the equity method. 

&#160; 

For the years ended December 31, 201 5 , 201 4 and 201 3 , we recognized income of $ 37.0 million, $3 4 . 4 million and $3 7 . 5 million, respectively, and received cash distributions of $ 45.3 million, $34. 6 million and $ 34 . 8 million, respectively, from these wireless partnerships. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 1,783 employees, including part-time employees. We also use temporary employees in the normal course of our business. 

&#160; 

Approximately 28% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2015. For a more detailed discussion regarding how the collective bargaining agreements could affect our business, see Part I - Item 1A &#8211; Risk Factors &#8211; &#8220;Risks Relating to Our Business&#8221;. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Sales and Marketing 

&#160; 

The key components of our overall marketing strategy include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Organizing our sales and marketing activities around our consumer, commercial and carrier customers; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Positioning ourselves as a single point of contact for our customers&#8217; communications needs; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Providing customers with a broad array of voice, data and video services and bundling these services whenever possible; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Identifying and broadening our commercial customer needs by developing solutions and providing integrated service offerings; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Providing excellent customer service, including 24/7 centralized customer support to coordinate installation of new services, repair and maintenance functions; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Developing and delivering new services to meet evolving customer needs and market demands; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Leveraging history and brand recognition across all market areas. 

&#160; 

We currently offer our services through call centers, our website, communication centers and commissioned sales representatives. Our customer service call centers and dedicated sales teams serve as the primary sales channels for consumer, business and carrier services. Our sales efforts are supported by direct mail, bill inserts, newspaper, radio and television advertising, public relations activities, community events and website promotions. 

&#160; 

We market our services both individually and as bundled services, including our triple-play offering of voice, data and video services. By bundling our service offerings, we are able to offer and sell a more complete and competitive package of services, which we believe simultaneously increases our average revenue per user (&#8220;ARPU&#8221;) and adds value for the consumer. We also believe that bundling leads to increased customer loyalty and retention. 

&#160; 

Network Architecture and Technology 

&#160; 

We have made significant investments in our technologically advanced telecommunications networks and continue to enhance and expand our network by deploying technologies to provide additional capacity to our customers. As a result, we are able to deliver high-quality, reliable data, video and voice services in the markets we serve. Our wide-ranging network and extensive use of fiber provide an easy reach into existing and new areas. By bringing the fiber network closer to the customer premises, we can increase our service offerings, quality and bandwidth services. Our existing network enables us to efficiently respond and adapt to changes in technology and is capable of supporting the rising customer demand for bandwidth in order to support the growing amount of wireless data devices in our customers&#8217; home s and businesses . 

&#160; 

Our networks are supported by advanced 100% digital switches, with a fiber network connecting in all but one of our exchanges. We continue to enhance our copper network to increase bandwidth in order to provide additional products and services to our marketable homes. In addition to our copper plant enhancements, we have deployed fiber-optic cable extensively throughout our network, resulting in a 100% fiber backbone network that supports all of the inter-office and host-remote links, as well as the majority of business parks within our service areas. &#160; In addition, this fiber infrastructure provides the connectivity required to provide video service, Internet and long-distance services to all Consolidated residential and commercial customers. Our fiber network utilizes fiber-to-the-home (&#8220;FTTH&#8221;) and fiber-to-the-node (&#8220;FTTN&#8221;) networks to offer bundled residential and commercial services. 

&#160; 

W e operate fiber networks which we own or have entered into long-term leases for fiber network access. At December 31, 2015, our fiber-optic network consisted of approximately 13,720 route-miles , which includes approximately 4, 7 00 miles of fiber network in Minnesota and surrounding areas, 4 , 180 miles of fiber network in Texas, approximately 1,690 route-miles of fiber-optic facilities in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, &#160; 1,050 miles of fiber network in Illinois, approximately 1,080 route-miles of fiber optic facilities in California that cover large parts of the greater Sacramento metropolitan area and over 1,020 route-miles of fiber optic facilities in Kansas City that service the greater Kansas City 

&#160;

area including both Kansas and &#160; Missouri . In 2014, we expanded our commercial services into the greater Dallas/Fort Worth market utilizing our existing carrier-class fiber network in this area. This network previously was used to serve our wholesale and carrier customers. In 2014, we began offering fiber based services including dedicated Internet access, wide area network services and hosted private branch exchange &#160; ( iPBX ) to commercial customers in this market. 

&#160; 

Through our extensive fiber network, we are also able to support the increased demand on wireless carriers for data bandwidth. In all the markets we serve, we have launched initiatives to support fiber backhaul services to cell sites. As of December 31, 201 5 , we had 1,224 cell sites under contract with 1,065 connected and 159 scheduled for completion in 201 6 . 

&#160; 

Business Strategies 

&#160; 

Diversify revenues and increase revenues per customer 

&#160; 

We continue to transform our business and diversify our revenue streams as we adapt to changes in the regulatory environment and advances in technology. As a result of acquisitions, our wireless partnerships and increases in the consumer and commercial demand for data services, we continue to reduce our reliance on subsidies and access revenue. Utilizing our existing network and strategic network expansion initiatives, we are able to acquire and serve a more diversified business customer base and create new long-term revenue streams such as wireless carrier backhaul services. We will continue to focus on growing our broadband and commercial services through the expansion and extension of our fiber network to communities and corridors near our primary fiber routes where we believe we can offer competitive services and increase market share. 

&#160; 

We also continue to focus on increasing our revenue per customer, primarily by improving our data market penetration, by increasing the sale of other value-added services and by encouraging customers to subscribe to our service bundles. 

&#160; 

Improve operating efficiency 

&#160; 

We continue to seek to improve operating efficiency through technology, better practices and procedures and through cost containment measures. Our current focus is on the continued integration of Enventis into our existing operations and creating operating synergies for the combined company. In recent years, we have made significant operational improvements in our business through the centralization of work groups, processes and systems, which has resulted in significant cost savings and reductions in headcount. Because of these efficiencies, we are better able to deliver a consistent customer experience, service our customers in a more cost-effective manner and lower our cost structure. We continue to evaluate our operations in order to align our cost structure with operating revenues while continuing to launch new products and improve the overall customer experience. 

&#160; 

Maintain capital expenditure discipline 

&#160; 

Across all of our service territories, we have successfully managed capital expenditures to optimize returns through disciplined planning and targeted investment of capital. For example, investments in our networks allows significant flexibility to expand our commercial footprint, offer new service offerings and provide services in a cost-efficient manner while maintaining our reputation as a high-quality service provider. We will continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives to expand our fiber network to new markets and customers in order to optimize new business, backhaul and wholesale opportunities. 

&#160; 

Pursue selective acquisitions 

&#160; 

We have in the past taken, and expect to continue to take in the future, a disciplined approach in pursuing company acquisitions. When we evaluate potential transactions, important factors include: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The market; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The quality of the network; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The ability to integrate the acquired company efficiently; 

&#160; 

&#160;

&#183; 

Significant potential operating synergies exist; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

The transaction will be cash flow accretive from day one. 

&#160; 

We believe all of the above criteria were met in connection with our acquisition of Enventis in 2014. In the long term, we believe that this transaction gives us additional scale and better positions us financially, strategically and competitively to pursue additional acquisitions. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

The telecommunications industry is subject to extensive competition, which has increased significantly in recent years. Technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available. In addition, differences in the regulatory environment applicable to comparable alternative services have lowered costs for these competitors. As a result, we face heightened competition but also have new opportunities to grow our broadband business. Our competitors vary by market and may include other incumbent and competitive local telephone companies; cable operators offering video, data and VoIP products; wireless carriers; long distance providers; satellite companies; Internet service providers and in some cases new forms of providers who are able to offer a broad range of competitive services. We expect competition to remain a significant factor affecting our operating results and that the nature and extent of that competition will continue to increase. See Part I - Item 1A &#8211; &#8220;Risk Factors &#8211; Risks Relating to Our Business&#8221;. 

&#160; 

In recent years, competition in our incumbent service areas has increased significantly. Except for the traditional multichannel video delivery business, which requires significant capital investment to serve customers, the barriers to entry are not high and technology changes force rapid competitive adjustments. Depending on the market area, we compete against AT&#38;T and a number of other carriers, as well as Comcast, Time Warner, Mediacom, Armstrong, Suddenlink and NewWave communications, in both the commercial and consumer markets. Google also recently launched data and video services in a limited, but growing, number of service areas including the Kansas City market. Our competitors offer traditional telecommunications services as well as IP-based services and other emerging data-based services. Our competitors continue to add features and adopt aggressive pricing and packaging for services comparable to the services we offer. 

&#160; 

We continue to face significant competition from wireless and other fiber data providers as the demand for substitute communication services, such as wireless phones and data devices, continues to increase. Customers are increasingly foregoing traditional telephone services and land-based Internet service and relying exclusively on wireless service. In addition, the expanded availability for free or lower cost services, such as video over the Internet, complimentary Wi-Fi service and other streaming devices has increased competition among other providers including online digital distributors for our video and data services. 

&#160; 

In most cases, we have entered the cable television service markets as the operator of a second (or subsequent) cable system. Therefore, we face the challenge of drawing customers away from the incumbent cable service provider. Similarly, the possession of comparatively greater size and scale can give an incumbent cable competitor an advantage in both access to and pricing of the program content needed to operate a cable television business. Our competitors, in some cases, possess significantly greater size and scale than we do. In order to meet the competition, we have responded in part by introducing new services and service bundles, offering services in convenient groupings with package discounts and billing advantages, providing excellent customer service and by continuing to invest in our network and business operations. 

&#160; 

In our rural markets, services are more costly to provide than service in urban areas as a lower customer density necessitates higher capital expenditures on a per-customer basis. As a result, it generally is not economically viable for new entrants to overlap existing networks in rural territories. Despite the barriers to entry, rural telephone companies still face significant competition from wireless and video providers and, to a lesser extent, competitive telephone companies. 

&#160; 

Our other lines of business are subject to substantial competition from local, regional and national competitors. In particular, our wholesale and transport business serves other interexchange carriers and we compete with a variety of service providers including incumbent and competitive local telephone companies and other fiber data companies. For our business systems products, we compete with other equipment providers or value added resellers, network providers, incumbent and competitive local telephone companies and with cloud and data hosting service providers. 

&#160; 

&#160;

We expect that competition in all of our businesses will continue to intensify as new technologies and changes in consumer behavior continue to emerge. 

&#160; 

Regulatory Environment 

&#160; 

The following summary does not describe all existing and proposed legislation and regulations affecting the telecommunications industry. Regulation can change rapidly, and ongoing proceedings and hearings could alter the manner in which the telecommunications industry operates. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these developments, nor their potential impact on us. See Part I &#8212;Item 1A&#8212;&#8220;Risk Factors&#8212;Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Business&#8221;. 

&#160; 

Overview 

&#160; 

Our revenues, which include revenues from such telecommunications services as local telephone service, network access service and toll service , are subject to broad federal and/or state regulation are derived from various sources, including: 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#61623; &#160; 

business and residential subscribers of basic exchange services; 

&#160; 

&#61623; &#160; 

surcharges mandated by state commissions; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#61623; &#160; 

long-distance carriers for network access service; 

&#160; 

&#61623; &#160; 

competitive access providers and commercial customers for network access service; and 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#160; 

&#61623; &#160; 

support payments from federal or state programs. 

&#160; 

&#160; 

The telecommunications industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the &#8220;Telecommunications Act&#8221;) , federal and state regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing statutes and regulations designed to encourage competition and to preserve and advance widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices. 

&#160; 

At the federal level, the Federal Communications Commission (&#8220;FCC&#8221;) generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of local exchange carriers, such as our rural telephone companies, to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international communications. The FCC has the authority to condition, modify, cancel, terminate or revoke our operating authority for failure to comply with applicable federal laws or FCC rules, regulations and policies. Fines or penalties also may be imposed for any of these violations. 

&#160; 

State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over carriers&#8217; facilities and services to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate intrastate communications. In particular, state regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over interconnection and network access by competitors of our rural telephone companies. In addition, municipalities and other local government agencies regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks. State regulators can sanction our rural telephone companies or revoke our certifications if we violate relevant laws or regulations. 

&#160; 

Federal Regulation 

&#160; 

Our rural telephone companies and competitive local exchange companies must comply with the Communications Act of 1934, which requires, among other things, that telecommunications carriers offer services at just and reasonable rates and on non-discriminatory terms and conditions. The 1996 amendments to the Communications Act (contained in the Telecommunications Act discussed below) dramatically changed, and likely will continue to change, the landscape of the industry. 

&#160; 

Removal of Entry Barriers 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Telecommunications Act imposes a number of interconnection and other requirements on all local communications providers. All telecommunications carriers have a duty to interconnect directly or indirectly with the facilities and equipment of other telecommunications carriers. Local exchange carriers, including our rural telephone companies, are required to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Allow other carriers to resell their services; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Provide number portability where feasible; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Ensure dialing parity, meaning that consumers can choose their default local or long-distance telephone company without having to dial additional digits; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Ensure that competitors&#8217; customers receive non-discriminatory access to telephone numbers, operator service, directory assistance and directory listings; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Afford competitors access to telephone poles, ducts, conduits and rights-of-way; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Establish reciprocal compensation arrangements with other carriers for the transport and termination of telecommunications traffic. 

&#160; 

Furthermore, the Telecommunications Act imposes on incumbent telephone companies (other than rural telephone companies that maintain their so-called &#8220;rural exemption&#8221; as our subsidiaries do) additional obligations to: 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Negotiate interconnection agreements with other carriers in good faith; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Interconnect their facilities and equipment with any requesting telecommunications carrier, at any technically feasible point, at non-discriminatory rates and on non-discriminatory terms and conditions; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Offer their retail services to other carriers for resale at discounted wholesale rates; 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Provide reasonable notice of changes in the information necessary for transmission and routing of services over the incumbent telephone company&#8217;s facilities or in the information necessary for interoperability; and 

&#160; 

&#183; 

Provide, at rates, terms and conditions that are just, reasonable and non-discriminatory, for the physical collocation of other carriers&#8217; equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements (&#8220;UNEs&#8221;) at the premises of the incumbent telephone company. 

&#160; 

Access Charges 

&#160; 

On November 18, 2011, the FCC released its comprehensive order on intercarrier compensation and universal service reform. See &#8220; FCC Access Charge and Universal Service Reform Order &#8221; below for detailed discussion on the FCC order. 

&#160; 

A significant portion of our rural telephone companies&#8217; revenues come from network access charges paid by long-distance and other carriers for using our companies&#8217; local telephone facilities for originating or terminating calls within our service areas. The amount of network access revenues our rural telephone companies receive is based on rates set or approved by federal and state regulatory commissions, and these rates are subject to change at any time. 

&#160; 

Intrastate network access charges are regulated by state commissions. The FCC order on intercarrier compensation and universal service reform required state access charges to mirror interstate access charges, and as of July 1, 2013, all switched intrastate access charges mirror interstate access charges. 

&#160; 

The FCC regulates the prices we may charge for the use of our local telephone facilities to originate or terminate interstate and international calls. The FCC has structured these prices as a combination of flat monthly charges paid by customers and both usage-sensitive (per-minute) charges and flat monthly charges paid by long-distance or other carriers. 

&#160; 

The FCC regulates interstate network access charges by imposing price caps on Regional Bell Operating Companies and other large incumbent telephone companies. These price caps can be adjusted based on various formulas, such as inflation 

&#160;

and productivity, and otherwise through regulatory proceedings. Incumbent telephone companies, such as our local telephone companies, may elect to base network access charges on price caps, but are not required to do so. All of our incumbent telephone companies have elected for price cap regulation. 

&#160; 

We believe that price cap regulation gives us greater pricing flexibility for interstate services, especially in the increasingly competitive special access segment. It also provides us with the potential to increase our net earnings by becoming more productive and introducing new services. As we have acquired new properties we have converted them to federal price cap regulation. 

&#160; 

Traditionally, regulators have allowed network access rates for rural areas to be set higher than the actual cost of terminating or originating long-distance calls as an implicit means of subsidizing the high cost of providing local service in rural areas. Following a series of federal court decisions ruling that subsidies must be explicit rather than implicit, the FCC adopted reforms in 2001 that reduced per-minute network access charges and shifted a portion of cost recovery, which historically was imposed on long-distance carriers, to flat-rate, monthly subscriber line charges imposed on end-user customers. While the FCC also increased explicit subsidies to rural telephone companies through the Universal Service Fund, the aggregate amount of interstate network access charges paid by long-distance carriers to access providers, such as our rural telephone companies, has decreased and may continue to decrease. 

&#160; 

Unlike the federal system, California , Illinois , Iowa and Minnesota do not provide an explicit subsidy in the form of a universal service fund for companies of our size. Therefore, while subsidies from the Federal Universal Service Fund offset the decrease in revenues resulting from the reduction in interstate network access rates, there was no corresponding offset for the decrease in revenues from the reduction in California and Illinois intrastate network access rates. In Iowa, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Texas, the intrastate network access rate regime applicable to our rural telephone companies does not mirror the FCC regime, so the impact of the reforms was revenue neutral. 

&#160; 

In recent years, carriers have become more aggressive in disputing the FCC&#8217;s interstate access charge rates and the application of access charges to their telecommunications traffic. We believe these disputes have increased, in part, because advances in technology have made it more difficult to determine the identity and jurisdiction of traffic, giving carriers an increased opportunity to challenge access costs for their traffic. For example, in September 2003, Vonage Holdings Corporation filed a petition with the FCC to preempt an order of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission asserting jurisdiction over Vonage. The FCC determined that it was impossible to divide Vonage&#8217;s VoIP service into interstate and intrastate components without negating federal rules and policies. Accordingly, the FCC found it was an interstate service not subject to traditional state telephone regulation. While the FCC order did not specifically address whether intrastate access charges were applicable to Vonage&#8217;s VoIP service, the fact that the service was found to be solely interstate raises that concern. We cannot predict what other actions other long-distance carriers may take before the FCC or with their local exchange carriers, including our rural telephone companies, to challenge the applicability of access charges. Due to the increasing deployment of VoIP services and other technological changes, we believe these types of disputes and claims are likely to increase. 

&#160; 

Unbundled Network Element Rules 

&#160; 

The unbundling requirements have been some of the most controversial provisions of the Telecommunications Act. In its initial implementation of the law, the FCC generally required incumbent telephone companies to lease a wide range of UNE&#8217;s to CLECs. Those rules were designed to enable competitors to deliver services to their customers in combination with their existing networks or as recombined service offerings on a UNE platform (&#8220;UNE-P&#8221;), which allowed competitors with no facilities of their own to purchase all the elements of local telephone service from the incumbent and resell them to custo mers. These unbundling requirements, and the duty to offer UNEs to competitors, imposed substantial costs on the incumbent telephone companies and made it easier for customers to shift their business to other carriers. After a court challenge and a decision vacating portions of the UNE rules, the FCC issued revised rules in February 2005 that reinstated some unbundling requirements for incumbent telephone companies that are not protected by the rural exemption, but eliminated the UNE-P option and certain other unbundling requirements. 

&#160; 

Each of the subsidiaries through which we operate our local telephone businesses is an incumbent telephone company and provides service in rural areas. As discussed above, the Telecommunications Act exempts rural telephone companies from certain of the more burdensome interconnection requirements. However, the Telecommunications Act provides that the rural exemption will cease to apply to competing cable companies if and when the rural carrier introduces video services in a service area, in which case, a competing cable operator providing video programming and seeking to provide 

&#160;

telecommunications services in the area may interconnect. Since each of our subsidiaries now provides video services in their major service areas, the rural exemption no longer applies to cable company competitors in those service areas. Additionally, in Texas, the Public Utilities Commission of Texas (&#8220;PUCT&#8221;) has removed the rural exemption for our Texas subsidiaries with respect to telecommunications services furnished by Sprint Communications, L.P. on behalf of cable companies. Our ILEC subsidiaries in California, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Pennsylvania still have the rural exemption in place. We believe the benefits of providing video services outweigh the loss of the rural exemptions to cable operators. 

&#160; 

Under its current rules, the FCC has eliminated unbundling requirements for ILECs providing broadband services over fiber facilities, but continues to require unbundled access to mass-market narrowband loops. ILECs are no longer required to unbundle packet switching services. In addition, the FCC found that CLECs generally are not at a disadvantage at certain wire center locations in regard to high bandwidth (DS-1 and DS-3) loops, dark fiber loops and dedicated interoffice transport facilities. However, where a disadvantage persists, ILECs continue to be required to unbundle loops and transport facilities. 

&#160; 

The FCC rules regarding the unbundling of network elements did not have an impact on our Illinois and Pennsylvania ILEC operations because these ILECs have rural exemptions. Our CLEC operations were not significantly affected by the 2005 changes to the UNE rules because they use their own switching for business customers that are served by high capacity loops. Our Pennsylvania CLEC has a commercial agreement with Verizon that sets the terms of the pricing and provisioning of lines previously served utilizing UNE-P, including Verizon switching service. Less than 5% of our Pennsylvania CLEC access lines are provisioned utilizing this commercial arrangement. Although the costs for this arrangement will increase over time pursuant to the terms of the agreement, our relatively low use of Verizon&#8217;s switching and our ability to migrate some of the lines to alternative provisioning sources will limit the overall impact on our current cost structure. The CLEC has experienced moderate increases in the overall cost to provision high-capacity loops, interoffice transport facilities and dark fiber as a result of the FCC&#8217;s changes to unbundling requirements for those facilities. In December 2012, our subsidiary Consolidated Communications Enterprise Services. Inc. (&#8220;CCES&#8221;), entered into a 5-year wholesale special access agreement with AT&#38;T, which moved us off of the UNE platform, reduced costs and gave us greater flexibility. This agreement applies to our CLEC operations in California, Illinois, Kansas, Missouri and Texas. 

&#160; 

In 2006, Verizon filed a petition requesting that the FCC refrain from applying a number of regulations to the Verizon operations in six major metropolitan markets, including the Pittsburgh market area. Among other things, Verizon urged the FCC to forbear from applying loop and transport unbundling regulations, claiming there was sufficient competition in the Pittsburgh market to mitigate the need for these rules. The FCC denied Verizon&#8217;s petition in December 2007, but a federal court of appeals remanded this decision to the FCC for further analysis in 2009. If the FCC grants this remanded petition or any similar forbearance petitions in markets in which our CLEC operates, our cost to obtain access to loop and transport facilities would increase substantially for the 5%, or less, of the lines provisioned under the commercial agreement discussed above. In 2013, AT&#38;T filed to amend its interstate access tariff with the FCC to eliminate the 5-year term discounts on its special access services. We filed a petition to reject AT&#38;T&#8217;s filing, and on December 9, 2013, the FCC suspended AT&#38;T&#8217;s filing pending investigation. The FCC has not yet issued a ruling in this matter. 

&#160; 

Promotion of Universal Service 

&#160; 

In general, telecommunications service in rural areas is more costly to provide than service in urban areas. The lower customer density means that switching and other facilities serve fewer customers and loops are typically longer, requiring greater expenditures per customer to build and maintain. By supporting the high cost of operations in rural markets, Universal Service Fund (&#8220;USF&#8221;) subsidies promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas. Revenues from federal and certain states&#8217; USFs totaled $56.3 million, $53.2 million and $52.0 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

&#160; 

In order for an eligible telecommunications carrier (&#8220;ETC&#8221;) to receive high-cost support, the USF/Intercarrier Compensation (&#8220;ICC&#8221;) Transformation Order requires states to certify annually that USF support is used only for the provision, maintenance and upgrading of facilities and services for which the support is intended. States, in turn, require that ETCs file certifications with them as the basis for the state filings with the FCC. Failure to meet the annual data and certification deadlines can result in reduced support to the ETC based on the length of the delay in certification. Each of our rural telephone companies has been designated as an ETC. For calendar year 2013, the California state certification was due to be filed with the FCC on or before October 1, 2012. We were notified in January 2013 that SureWest Communications (&#8220;SureWest&#8221;) did not submit the required certification to the California Public Utilities Commission 

&#160;

(&#8220;CPUC&#8221;) in time to be included in its October 1, 2012 submission to the FCC. In January 2013, we filed a certification with the CPUC and filed a petition with the FCC for a waiver of the filing deadline for the annual state certification. In February 2013, the CPUC filed a certification with the FCC with respect to SureWest. In October 2013, the Wireline Competition Bureau of the FCC denied our petition for a waiver of the annual certification deadline. In November 2013, we applied for a review of the decision made by the FCC staff by the full Commission. Management is optimistic that the Company may prevail in its application to the Commission and receive USF funding for the period January 1, 2013 through June 30, 2013 based on the change in SureWest&#8217;s USF filing status caused by the change in the ownership of SureWest, the lack of formal notice by the FCC regarding this change in filing status, the fact that SureWest had a previously filed certification of compliance in effect with the FCC for the two quarters for which USF was withheld and the FCC&#8217;s past practice of granting waivers to accept late filings in similar situations. However, due to the denial of our petition by the Wireline Competition Bureau and the uncertainty of the collectability of previously recognized revenues, in December 2013 we reversed $3.0 million of previously recognized revenues until such time that the Commission has the opportunity to reach a decision on our application for review. 

&#160; 

FCC Access Charge and Universal Service Reform Order 

&#160; 

In November 2011, the FCC released a comprehensive order on access charge and universal service reform (the &#8220;Order&#8221;). The access charge portion of the Order systematically reduces minute-of-use-based interstate access, intrastate access and reciprocal compensation rates over a six to nine year period to an end state of bill-and-keep, in which each carrier recovers the costs of its network through charges to its own subscribers, not through intercarrier compensation. The reductions apply to terminating access rates and usage, with originating access to be addressed by the FCC in a later proceeding. To help with the transition to bill-and-keep, the FCC created two mechanisms. The first is an Access Recovery Mechanism (&#8220;ARM&#8221;) which is funded from the Connect America Fund (&#8220;CAF&#8221;), and the second is an Access Recovery Charge (&#8220;ARC&#8221;) which is recovered from end users. The universal service portion of the Order redirects support from voice services to broadband services, and is now called the CAF. The initial release of the Order mandated that, in order to receive CAF funding, carriers must agree to provide broadband capability to 100% of their customer base at a minimum speed of 4 Mbps downstream and 1Mbps upstream. 

&#160; 

In the Order, holding companies with price cap study areas and rate of return study areas are mandated to move each of their interstate rate of return study areas to price cap for universal service purposes only. The intercarrier compensation rules will keep rate of return study areas under the rate of return intercarrier compensation transitions plan and the price cap study areas under the price cap intercarrier compensation transition. 

&#160; 

In 2012, CAF Phase I was implemented, which froze USF support to price cap carriers until the FCC implemented a broadband cost model to shift support from voice services to broadband services. The Order also modified the methodology used for ICC traffic exchanged between carriers. The initial phase of ICC reform was effective on July 1, 2012, beginning the transition of our terminating switched access rates to bill-and-keep over a seven year period, and as a result, our network access revenue decreased approximately $1.3 million during 2015. 

&#160; 

In December 2014, the FCC released a report and order that addressed, among other things, the transition to CAF Phase II funding for price cap carriers, the acceptance criteria for CAF Phase II funding and the annual reporting requirements, and it also introduced CAF Phase III. For companies that accept the CAF Phase II funding, there is a three year transition period in instances in which their current CAF Phase I funding exceeds the CAF Phase II funding. If CAF Phase II funding exceeds CAF Phase I funding, the transitional support is waived and CAF Phase II funding begins immediately. Companies are required to commit to a statewide build out requirement to 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream in funded locations. We accepted the CAF Phase II funding in August 2015. The annual funding under CAF Phase I of $36.6 million will be replaced by annual funding under CAF Phase II of $13.9 million through 2020. In the state of Iowa, where CAF Phase II funding is greater than the CAF Phase I funding, the CAF Phase II funding will be received with a retroactive payment back to January 1, 2015. For all other states, funding under CAF Phase II is less than funding under CAF Phase I. The acceptance of funding at the lower level will transition over a three year period , beginning in August 2015, &#160; at the rates of 75% of the CAF Phase I funding level in the first year, 50% in the second year and 25% in the third year. 

&#160; 

The annual reporting requirements include (i) filings of annual certifications that the carrier is both meeting its public interest obligations and is offering comparable broadband rates and (ii) the filing of a Service Quality Improvement plan. The initial plan must be filed by July 1, 2016, with progress reports filed every year thereafter. The plan must include, among other things, the total amount of CAF Phase II funding used to fund capital expenditures in the previous year and certification that the carrier is meeting the required interim deployment milestones. 

&#160;

&#160; 

State Regulation 

&#160; 

California 

&#160; 

The CPUC has the power, among other things, to establish rates, terms and conditions for intrastate service, to prescribe uniform systems of accounts and to regulate the mortgaging or disposition of public utility properties. 

&#160; 

In an ongoing proceeding relating to the New Regulatory Framework, the CPUC adopted Decision 06-08-030 in 2006, which grants carriers broader pricing freedom in the provision of telecommunications services, bundling of services, promotions and customer contracts. This decision adopted a new regulatory framework, the Uniform Regulatory Framework (&#8220;URF&#8221;), which among other things (i) eliminates price regulation and allows full pricing flexibility for all new and retail services, (ii) allows new forms of bundles and promotional packages of telecommunication services, (iii) allocates all gains and losses from the sale of assets to shareholders and (iv) eliminates almost all elements of rate of return regulation, including the calculation of shareable earnings. In December 2010, the CPUC issued a ruling to initiate a new proceeding to assess whether, or to what extent, the level of competition in the telecommunications industry is sufficient to control prices for the four largest ILECs in the state. Subsequently, the CPUC issued a ruling temporarily deferring the proceeding. When the CPUC may open this proceeding is unclear and on hold at this time. The CPUC&#8217;s actions in this and future proceedings could lead to new rules and an increase in government regulation. The Company will continue to monitor this matter. 

&#160; 

Illinois 

&#160; 

Our Illinois rural telephone company holds the necessary certifications in Illinois to provide long-distance and payphone services. We are required to file tariffs with the Illinois Commerce Commission (&#8220; ILCC &#8221;) or post written service offerings on its website, but generally can change the prices, terms and conditions stated in its tariffs on one day&#8217;s notice, with prior notice of price increases to affected customers. Our CLEC services are not subject to any significant state regulations in Illinois. 

&#160; 

Our Illinois rural telephone company is certified by the ILCC to provide local telephone services. This entity operates as a distinct company from a regulatory standpoint. As described below, Consolidated Communications of Illinois Company (formerly known as Illinois Consolidated &#160; Telephone Company) (&#8220;CCIC&#8221;) has elected the option under Illinois law to have its rates, terms and conditions of servi ce subject to market regulation that is regulated by competition in the market . Although, as explained above, the FCC has preempted certain state regulations pursuant to the Telecommunications Act, Illinois retains the authority to impose requirements on our Illinois rural telephone company to preserve universal service, protect public safety and welfare, ensure quality of service and protect consumers. Our Illinois rural telephone company has not had a general rate proceeding before the ILCC since 1983. 

&#160; 

The Illinois General Assembly has made major revisions and added significant new provisions to the portions of the Illinois Public Utilities Act governing the regulation and obligations of telecommunications carriers on a number of occasions since 1985. In 2007, the Illinois legislature addressed competition for cable and video services and authorized statewide licensing by the ILCC to replace the existing system of individual town franchises. This legislation also imposed substantial state-mandated consumer service and consumer protection requirements on providers of cable and video services. The requirements generally became applicable to us on January 1, 2008, and we are operating in compliance with the law. Although we have franchise agreements for cable and video services in all the towns we serve, this statewide franchising authority will simplify the process in the future. In 2010, the Illinois General Assembly passed Public Act 96-0927, which updates the telecommunications statute, allowing ILECs, beginning January 1, 2011, to elect deregulation of local services. CCIC elected this option effective April 1, 2014. Under this option, CCI C&#8217;s rates for local services became &#8220;competitive&#8221; and no longer subject to rate of return regulation, and certain other service quality obligations are reduced. CCIC is obligated to make certain basic local exchange service packages available to customers. Public Act 96-0927 also specified that local exchange carriers may not charge intrastate access rates at levels higher than their interstate access rates. The Governor of Illinois signed the bill into law on June 15, 2010. In June 2013, the Illinois legislature approved additional amendments to the telecommunications statute. The new telecommunications legislation made minor changes to the telecommunications statute. The current telecommunications statute is currently scheduled to sunset July 1, 2017. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Texas 

&#160; 

Our Texas rural telephone companies are each certified by the PUCT to provide local telephone services in their respective territories. In addition, our Texas long-distance and transport subsidiaries are registered with the PUCT as interexchange carriers. The transport subsidiary has also obtained a service provider certificate of operating authority (&#8220;SPCOA&#8221;) to better assist the transport subsidiary with its operations in municipal areas. Recently, to assist with expanding services offerings, CCES also obtained a SPCOA from the PUCT. While our Texas rural telephone company services are extensively regulated, our other services, such as long-distance and transport services, are not subject to any significant state regulation. 

&#160; 

Our Texas rural telephone companies operate as distinct companies from a regulatory standpoint. Each is separately regulated by the PUCT in order to preserve universal service, protect public safety and welfare, ensure quality of service and protect consumers. Each Texas rural telephone company must file and maintain tariffs setting forth the terms, conditions and prices for its intrastate services. 

&#160; 

Currently, both of our Texas rural telephone companies have immunity from adjustments to their rates, including their intrastate network access rates, because they elected &#8220;incentive regulation&#8221; under the Texas Public Utilities Regulatory Act (&#8220;PURA&#8221;). In order to qualify for incentive regulation, our rural telephone companies agreed to fulfill certain infrastructure requirements. In exchange, they are not subject to challenge by the PUCT regarding their rates, overall revenues, return on invested capital or net income. 

&#160; 

PURA prescribes two different forms of incentive regulation in Chapter 58 and Chapter 59. Under either election, the rates, including network access rates, an incumbent telephone company may charge for basic local services generally cannot be increased from the amount(s) on the date of election without PUCT approval. Even with PUCT approval, increases can only occur in very specific situations. Pricing flexibility under Chapter 59 is extremely limited. In contrast, Chapter 58 allows greater pricing flexibility on non-basic network services, customer-specific contracts and new services. 

&#160; 

Initially, both of our Texas rural telephone companies elected incentive regulation under Chapter 59 and fulfilled the applicable infrastructure requirements, but they changed their election status to Chapter 58 in 2003, which gives them some pricing flexibility for basic services, subject to PUCT approval. The PUCT could impose additional infrastructure requirements or other restrictions in the future. Any requirements or restrictions could limit the amount of cash that is available to be transferred from our rural telephone companies to the parent entities and could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt service requirements and repayment obligations. 

&#160; 

In September 2005, the Texas legislature adopted significant additional telecommunications legislation. Among other things, this legislation created a statewide video franchise for telecommunications carriers, established a framework to deregulate the retail telecommunications services offered by incumbent local telecommunications carriers, imposed concurrent requirements to reduce intrastate access charges and directed the PUCT to initiate a study of the Texas Universal Service Fund. 

&#160; 

Texas Universal Service 

&#160; 

The Texas Universal Service Fund is administered by the National Exchange Carrier Association. PURA, the governing law, directs the PUCT to adopt and enforce rules requiring local exchange carriers to contribute to a state universal service fund that helps telecommunications providers offer basic local telecommunications service at reasonable rates in high-cost rural areas. The Texas Universal Service Fund is also used to reimburse telecommunications providers for revenues lost for providing lifeline service. Our Texas rural telephone companies receive disbursements from this fund. Our Texas ILECs receive two state funds, the small and rural incumbent local exchange company plan High Cost Fund (&#8220;HCF&#8221;) and the high cost assistance fund (&#8220;HCAF&#8221;). The HCF is a line-based fund used to keep local rates low. The rate is applied on all residential lines and up to five single business lines. The amount we receive from the HCAF is a frozen monthly amount that was originally developed to offset high intrastate toll rates. 

&#160; 

In September 2011, the Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill No. 980/House Bill No. 2603 which, among other things, mandated the PUCT to review the Universal Service Fund and issue recommendations by January 1, 2013 with the intent to effectively reduce the size of the Universal Service Fund. This would be accomplished by implementing an urban floor to offset state funding reductions with a phase-in period of four years. The PUCT recommended that (i) frozen line counts be lifted effective September 1, 2013 and (ii) rural and urban local rate benchmarks be developed. The large company 

&#160;

fund review was completed in September 2012 and the PUCT addressed the small fund participants in Docket 41097 Rate Rebalancing (&#8220;Docket 41097&#8221;), as discussed below. 

&#160; 

In June 2013, the Texas state legislature passed Senate Bill No. 583 (&#8220;SB 583&#8221;). The provisions of SB 583 were effective September 1, 2013 and froze HCF and HCAF support for the remainder of 2013. As of January 1, 2014, our annual $1.4 million HCAF support was eliminated and the frozen HCF support returned to funding on a per line basis. In July 2013, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the PUCT on Docket 41097, which was approved by the PUCT in August 2013. In accordance with the provisions of the settlement agreement, the HCF draw will be reduced by approximately $1.2 million annually over a four year period beginning June 1, 2014 through 2018. However, we have the ability to fully offset this reduction with increases to residential rates where market conditions allow, which the Company filed for and implemented in 2014 and 2015. 

&#160; 

In addition, the PUCT is required to develop a needs test for post-2017 funding and has held workshops on various proposals. The PUCT issued its recommendation to the Texas state commissioners in May 2014, which was approved in December 2014. The needs test allows for a one-time disaggregation of line rates from a per line flat rate, then a competitive test must be met to receive funding. The deadline for submission of the needs test is December 31, 2016. We expect to complete the needs test as required and file for continued funding by the 2016 deadline. 

&#160; 

Pennsylvania 

&#160; 

The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (&#8220;PAPUC&#8221;) regulates the rates, the system of financial accounts for reporting purposes and certain aspects of service quality, billing procedures and universal service funding, among other things, related to our rural telephone company and CLEC&#8217;s provision of intrastate services. In addition, the PAPUC sets the rates and terms for interconnection between carriers within the guidelines ordered by the FCC. Pennsylvania intrastate rates are regulated under a statutory framework referred to as Act 183. Under this statute, rates for non-competitive intrastate services are allowed to increase based on an index that measures economy-wide price increases. In return, we committed to continue to upgrade our network to ensure that all our customers would have access to broadband services, and to deploy a ubiquitous broadband (defined as 1.544 Mbps) network throughout our entire service area by December 31, 2008, which we did. 

&#160; 

Pennsylvania Universal Service and Access Charges 

&#160; 

In 2011, the PAPUC issued an intrastate access reform order reducing intrastate access rates to interstate levels in a three-step process, which began in March 2012. With the release of the FCC order in November 2011, the PAPUC temporarily issued a stay. A final stay was issued in 2012 to implement the FCC ordered intrastate access rate changes. The PAPUC had indicated that it would address state universal funding in 2013, but delayed conducting a proceeding pending any state legislative activity that may occur in the 2015 legislative session. The Company will continue to monitor this matter. 

&#160; 

Minnesota, Iowa and North Dakota 

&#160; 

Our subsidiaries, Crystal Communications, Inc., Enventis Telecom, Inc. and IdeaOne Telecom, Inc. are CLECs. A company must file for CLEC or interexchange authority to operate with the appropriate public utility commission in each state it serves. Our CLECs provide a variety of services to both residential and business customers in multiple jurisdictions for local and interexchange services. Our CLECs provide services with less regulatory oversight than our ILEC companies. 

&#160; 

Our subsidiaries Consolidated Communications of Minnesota Company (formerly Mankato Citizens Telephone Company ) (&#8220; CCMN &#8221;), Consolidated Communications of Mid-Communications Company (formerly Mid-Communications, Inc. ) (&#8220; CCMC &#8221;) and Consolidated Communications of Iowa Company (formerly Heartland Telecommunications Company of Iowa ) (&#8220; CCIA &#8221;) are ILECs. CCMN and CCMC are public utilities operating pursuant to indeterminate permits issued by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (&#8220;MPUC&#8221;). CCIA is also a public utility, which operates pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Iowa Utilities Board (&#8220;IUB&#8221;). Due to the size of our ILEC companies, neither the MPUC nor the IUB regulates our rates of return or profits. In Minnesota, regulators monitor CCMN and CCMC price and service levels. In Iowa, CCIA is not rate-regulated. Our companies can change local rates by evaluating various factors including economic and competitive circumstances. 

&#160; 

&#160;

Local Government Authorizations 

&#160; 

In Illinois, we historically have been required to obtain franchises from each incorporated municipality in which our rural telephone company operates. An Illinois state statute prescribes the fees that a municipality may impose for the privilege of originating and terminating messages and placing facilities within the municipality. Our Illinois telephone operations may also be required to obtain permits for street opening and construction, or for operating franchises to install and expand fiber optic facilities. These permits or other licenses or agreements typically require the payment of fees. 

&#160; 

Similarly, Texas incumbent telephone companies had historically been required to obtain franchises from each incorporated municipality in which they operated. Texas law now provides that incumbent telephone companies do not need to obtain franchises or other licenses to use municipal rights-of-way for delivering services. Instead, payments to municipalities for rights-of-way are administered through the PUCT and through a reporting process by each telecommunications provider. Incumbent telephone companies are still required to obtain permits from municipal authorities for street opening and construction, but most burdens of obtaining municipal authorizations for access to rights-of-way have been streamlined or removed. 

&#160; 

Our Texas rural telephone companies still operate pursuant to the terms of municipal franchise agreements in some territories served by Consolidated Communications of Fort Bend Company. As the franchises expire, they are not being renewed. 

&#160; 

California, Iowa, Minnesota and Pennsylvania operate under a structure in which each municipality may impose various fees. 

&#160; 

Regulation of Broadband and Internet Services 

&#160; 

Video Services 

&#160; 

Our cable television subsidiaries each require a state or local franchise or other authorization in order to provide cable service to customers. Each of these subsidiaries is subject to regulation under a framework that exists in Title VI of the Communications Act. 

&#160; 

Under this framework, the responsibilities and obligations of franchising bodies and cable operators have been carefully defined. The law addresses such issues as the use of local streets and rights of way; the carriage of public, educational and governmental channels; the provision of channel space for leased commercial access; the amount and payment of franchise fees; consumer protection; and similar issues. In addition, Federal laws place limits on the common ownership of cable systems and competing multichannel video distribution systems, and on the common ownership of cable systems and local telephone systems in the same geographic area. Many provisions of the federal law have been implemented through FCC regulations. The FCC has expanded its oversight and regulation of the cable television-related matters recently. In some cases, it has acted to assure that new competitors in the cable television business are able to gain access to potential customers and can also obtain licenses to carry certain types of video programming. 

&#160; 

The Communications Act also authorizes the licensing and operation of open video systems (&#8220;OVS&#8221;). An OVS is a form of multichannel video delivery that was initially intended to accommodate unaffiliated providers of video programming on the same network. The OVS regulatory structure also offered a means for a single provider to serve less than an entire community. Our Kansas City operations in Missouri utilize an OVS that allows us to operate in only a part of Kansas City. 

&#160; 

A number of state and local provisions also affect the operation of our cable systems. The California legislature adopted the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 (&#8220;DIVCA&#8221;) to encourage further entrance of telephone companies and other new cable operators to compete against the large incumbent cable operators. DIVCA changed preexisting California law to require new franchise applicants to obtain franchise authorizations on the state level. In addition, DIVCA established a general set of state-defined terms and conditions to replace numerous terms and conditions that had applied uniquely in local municipalities, and it repealed a state law that had prohibited local governments from adopting terms for new competitive franchises that differed in any material way from the incumbent&#8217;s franchise, even if competitive circumstances were very different. Some portions of this law are also available to incumbent cable operators with existing local franchises who compete against us. 

&#160; 

&#160;

A state franchising law has also been enacted in Kansas. While these laws have reduced franchise burdens on our subsidiaries and have made it easier for them to seek out and enter new markets, they also have reduced the entry barriers for others who may want to enter our cable television markets. 

&#160; 

Federal law and regulation also affects numerous issues related to video programming and other content. 

&#160; 

Under federal law, certain local television broadcast stations (both commercial and non-commercial) can elect, every three years, to take advantage of rules that require a cable operator to distribute the station&#8217;s content to the cable system&#8217;s customers without charge, or to forego this &#8220;must-carry&#8221; obligation and to negotiate for carriage on an arm&#8217;s length contractual basis, which typically involves the payment of a fee by the cable operator, and sometimes involves other consideration as well. The current three year cycle began on January 1, 2012. The Company has successfully negotiated agreements with all of the local television broadcast stations that would have been eligible for &#8220;must carry&#8221; treatment in each of its markets. As anticipated, fees under retransmission consent agreements generally underwent marked increases for the 2012 through 201 5 period. 

&#160; 

Federal law and regulations regulate access to certain programming content that is delivered by satellite. The FCC has provisions in place that ban certain discriminatory practices and unfair acts, and include a presumption that the withholding of regional sports programming by content affiliates of incumbent cable operators is presumptively unlawful. The existing FCC complaint process for program access for both satellite and terrestrially-delivered content is governed on a case-by-case basis. The FCC currently is considering adopting rules that could make it less burdensome for competing multichannel video programming providers who are denied access to cable-affiliated satellite programming on reasonable terms and conditions to pursue and meet evidentiary standards with respect to program access complaints. That proceeding remains pending before the FCC. 

&#160; 

The FCC adopted an order banning exclusive contracts between affiliates where the programming is sent via terrestrial media, and banning certain other unfair acts, making it clear that the withholding of regional sports programming and high definition television programming by content affiliates of incumbent cable operators would receive special attention. Unlike the satellite provisions, the new rules will not expire. The FCC&#8217;s order was upheld in an appeals court decision issued on March 12, 2010. 

&#160; 

In connection with the FCC&#8217;s approval of a cable transaction involving Comcast and Time Warner in July 2006, the parties&#8217; regional sports networks were subject to certain program access rules until July 2012. The FCC did not extend these obligations beyond July 2012. This does not change the existing Comcast/NBC Universal merger conditions which expire in 2018, as described below. It is unknown what, if any, impact this decision will have on us. 

&#160; 

In early 2010, Comcast proposed to enter into a joint venture with NBC Universal, through which it would acquire control of numerous NBC properties, including both broadcast and cable television programming operations of NBC. In early 2011, the FCC and the Department of Justice (&#8220;DOJ&#8221;) approved the transaction, with a significant number of conditions designed to promote programming diversity, to limit the ability of the combined entity to affect competition adversely, and to protect newly emerging markets such as independent OTT video. These conditions include requirements for program access and carriage, non-discrimination in making programming available, limits on bundling that would affect competition and the relationship of the joint venture to emerging on-line competition. In addition, conditions were imposed to maintain independence within the NBC unit in dealing with competing cable operators. The parties agreed to the conditions and the transaction was completed during 2011. Most of the conditions will have a duration of seven years. 

&#160; 

The contractual relationships between cable operators and most providers of content who are not television broadcast stations generally are not subject to FCC oversight or other regulation. The majority of providers of content to our subsidiaries, including content providers affiliated with incumbent cable operators such as Comcast, but who are not subject to any FCC or DOJ conditions, do so through arm&#8217;s length contracts where the parties have mutually agreed upon the terms of carriage and the applicable fees. 

&#160; 

The transition to digital television (&#8220;DTV&#8221;) has led the FCC to adopt and implement new rules designed to ease the shift. These rules also can be expected to make broadcast content more accessible over the air to smartphones, personal computers and other non-television devices. Local television broadcast stations will also be able to offer more content over their assigned digital spectrum after the DTV transition, including additional channels. 

&#160; 

&#160;

The Company continues to monitor the emergence of video content options for customers that have become available over the Internet, and that may be made available for free, by individual subscription or in conjunction with a separate cable service agreement. In some cases, this involves the ability to watch episodes of desirable network television programming and to procure additional content related to programs carried on linear cable channels. These options have increased significantly, and can lead cable television customers to terminate or reduce their level of services. At this time, OTT programming options cannot duplicate the nature or extent of desirable programming carried by cable systems, and the market is still comparatively nascent, but in light of changing technology and events such as the Comcast-NBC transaction, the OTT market will continue to grow and evolve rapidly. 

&#160; 

Cable operators depend, to some degree, upon their ability to utilize the poles (and conduit) of electric and telephone utilities. The terms and conditions under which such attachments can be made were established in the federal Pole Attachment Act of 1978, as amended. The Pole Attachment Act outlined the formula for calculating the fee to be charged for the use of utility poles, a formula that assesses fees based on the proportionate amount of space assigned for use and an allocation of certain qualified costs of the pole owner. The FCC has put a structure in place for pole attachment regulation that has covered cable operators and other types of providers. The FCC has adopted new rules that apply a single rate to all providers who use poles, whether they are cable operators, telecommunications providers, or Internet providers, even if they use the attachment to offer more than one service. These rules only affect attachments in states where the federal rules apply. States have the option to opt out of the federal formula and to regulate pole attachments independently. Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Pennsylvania and Texas follow the FCC pole attachment framework. California has elected to separately regulate pole attachments and pole attachment rates. The FCC decision has been appealed, and the ultimate outcome of the appeal cannot be predicted. 

&#160; 

Cable operators are subject to longstanding cable copyright obligations where they pay copyright fees for some types of programming that are considered secondary retransmissions. The copyright fees are updated from time to time, and are paid into a pool administered by the United States Copyright Office for distribution to qualifying recipients. 

&#160; 

The FCC has so far declined to require that cable operators allow unaffiliated Internet service providers to gain access to customers by using the network of the operator&#8217;s cable system. The FCC also has considered the benefits of a requirement that cable operators offer programming on their systems on an a la carte or themed basis, but to date has not adopted regulations requiring such action. These matters may resurface in the future, particularly as the OTT market grows. In light of the fact that programming is increasingly being made available through Internet connections, some cable operators have considered their own a la carte alternatives. Content owners with linear channels also are moving toward greater &#8220;on demand&#8221; programming, offerings that maintain the value of their linear channels for customers. 

&#160; 

The outcome of pending matters cannot be determined at this time but can lead to increased costs for the Company in connection with our provision of cable services and can affect our ability to compete in the markets we serve. 

&#160; 

Internet Services 

&#160; 

The provision of Internet access services is not significantly regulated by either the FCC or the state commissions. However, the FCC has been moving toward the imposition of some controls on the provision of Internet access. In 2002, in part to place cable modem service and Digital Subscriber Line (&#8220;DSL&#8221;) service on an equal competitive footing, the FCC asserted jurisdiction over these services as &#8220;information services&#8221; under Title I of the Communications Act, and removed them from treatment under Title II of the Act, but to date it has not determined what regulatory framework, if any, is appropriate for Internet services under Title I. 

&#160; 

The FCC has also adopted policy principles to signal its objectives with respect to high-speed Internet and related services. These principles are intended to encourage broad customer access to the content and applications of their choice, to promote the unrestricted use of lawful equipment by users of Internet services and to promote competition among providers. 

&#160; 

In 2009, the FCC proposed to enact rules related to Internet access services, relying in part on the policy principles that it had earlier adopted, but expanding their reach and adding additional provisions. The adoption of the rules as they have been proposed would prohibit discrimination with respect to applications providers, among other things, subject to reasonable network management by an Internet access service provider. 

&#160; 

&#160;

While this initiative was getting underway, a Federal appeals court decision in April 2010 assessed the FCC&#8217;s authority over Internet services under the Communications Act, and invalidated action taken by the FCC that was based on authority that the FCC thought it possessed. The FCC asserted that it has jurisdictional authority in some areas related to the promotion of an &#8220;open Internet&#8221; or &#8220;net neutrality&#8221;. Notwithstanding the court setback, the FCC elected to adopt rules in this regard in December 2010. That action was appealed to a Federal appeals court, and in January 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit found that the FCC does have the authority to implement regulation of the Internet if those rules reasonably advance the promotion of broadband deployment and do not violate other statutory requirements. 

&#160; 

As a result of the ruling, the FCC intends to reclassify broadband Internet services as a telecommunications service subject to regulation under Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and in March 2015, the FCC released its net neutrality order, which applies to all wireline and wireless providers of broadband Internet services. The net neutrality order addresses several areas that will be regulated and others that are subject to forbearance. The regulations disallow blocking, throttling and paid prioritization by Internet service providers. The net neutrality order also requires providers to disclose certain information to consumers regarding rates, fees, data allowances and packet loss. Finally, it gives the FCC codified enforcement authority and it forbears on certain Title II regulations. We do not believe the net neutrality order will result in significant changes to the services we provide our customers, nor do we believe it will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 

&#160; 

The Federal Trade Commission (&#8220;FTC&#8221;) is currently assessing certain advertising and marketing practices of Internet-related companies, as well as the use of the Internet in connection with other businesses. FTC action can affect the manner of operation of some of our businesses. The outcome of pending matters cannot be determined at this time but can lead to increased costs for the Company in connection with our provision of Internet services, and can affect our ability to compete in the markets we serve . 

&#160;
