 ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

&#160; 

Our Company 

&#160; 

We are a management firm which creates, cultivates, and operates innovative and healthy lifestyle brands within the restaurant and retail industries. We focus on consumer food service concepts that is founded on a franchised and multi-unit business model in the retail, fast-casual, and casual restaurant sector. As the creator and current advisor organization of the all-natural and organic pizza franchise, Pizza Fusion, we are seeking to expand our innovative food service with an emphasis on sustainability and community impact. Currently with locations in selected markets in the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, we are poised to rollout new concepts we plan to develop and manage. 

&#160; 

Following the completion of our merger with PF Hospitality Group and the sale of a $1.3 million principal amount of convertible debentures we are now in a position to make an impact on the food and hospitality industry this coming year for critical growth and smart expansion. We believe successful investing begins with providing a compelling value proposition to the consumer combined with a unique and innovative concept, to all business constituencies. With that in mind, on a daily basis we strive to consistently deliver passion, innovation, creativity, and financial growth to all of our stakeholders who make this possible. 

&#160; 

In 2014 and the early part of 2015, we franchised two new Pizza Fusion locations in Dubai, UAE. Continuing to follow progress of our Pizza Fusion expansion of units within the Middle East, we plan to narrow our focus on the rebranding of the Pizza Fusion concept. Part of this effort will be building strong sales growth of existing restaurants with the introduction of new and innovative menu offerings. We are also looking into physical refurbishments to individual Pizza Fusion establishments, and assessing key investments in mobile technology designed to engage the brand&#8217;s growing, savvy audience. Pizza Fusion is a fast-casual pizza restaurant that utilizes primarily organic and all-natural ingredients. In addition to pizza, Pizza Fusion establishments serve appetizers, salads, sandwiches, desserts, natural sodas, teas, juices, beer and wine. Restaurants are typically 1,200 to 2,400 square feet. The average lunch check is $8.00 per person and the average dinner check is $11.00 per person. 

&#160; 

Shaker &#38; Pie 

&#160; 

Our newest concept, Shaker &#38; Pie, is a new interactive restaurant concept combining wood-fired pizzas with healthy, hearty Italian-influenced street food. An &#8220;interactive restaurant&#8221; expands upon the traditional restaurant concept by incorporating an interactive experience that might include the use of tablets to place orders, and social interaction on social media, including the use of on-line reservations or on-line ordering. We expect Shaker &#38; Pie will provide a lasting impression on the South Florida restaurant arena, where the flagship location is slated to open in the second fiscal quarter of 2016 in the Mizner Park area of affluent, Boca Raton, Florida. Boca Raton&#8217;s Mizner Park is a pioneering downtown mixed-use project that includes 236,000 square feet of retail space, 267,000 square feet of office space, luxury retail apartments, town homes and cultural arts space, as well as a 5,000-person-capacity open-air amphitheater and was named one of America&#8217;s Top Public Places in 2010 by the American Planning Association. In addition, Boca Raton has been rated among the best places to start a new restaurant by the personal finance website NerdWallet.com. We are in the final stages of entering into a joint venture agreement with Sub-Culture Restaurant Group, an unrelated third party familiar with the operations of similar restaurant concepts for our initial Shaker &#38; Pie location to utilize our executive management and marketing know-how and utilize our planned joint venture partner&#8217;s restaurant operating experience. It is expected that we will own a controlling interest in the joint venture and that we will be responsible for all conceptual design and brand direction, as well as share in the operating and marketing responsibilities of the restaurant. The flagship Shaker &#38; Pie is expected to occupy approximately 3,638 square feet and, based on the currently proposed menu, the expected average cost for lunch will be $12.00 per person and $15.00 per person for dinner. 

&#160; 

In addition, we are exploring ways to broaden our reach into the hospitality space as we seek to add and develop brands from the natural and organic space into our current and planned locations and are respond to the changing demographics driven by millennials. As part of this effort, we granted Aramark Food and Support Services Group, Inc. (&#8220;Aramark&#8221;) the non-exclusive right to operate Pizza Fusion restaurants within Aramark&#8217;s U.S. network of colleges, universities, sports complexes, healthcare facilities and entertainment venues at locations to be agreed on by us and Aramark pursuant to a Test License Agreement. No locations to be operated under this agreement have been identified as of the date of this report. 

&#160; 

In addition, we are expanding our presence in the health and fitness space following our acquisition of EXO:EXO, Inc., (&#8220;EXO&#8221;), a designer and producer of active wear brands offered in national fitness retailers in the U.S. We acquired EXO pursuant to the terms of a stock exchange agreement (the &#8220;Stock Exchange Agreement&#8221;) we entered into and closed on with EXO and Sloane McComb (EXO&#8217;s sole shareholder) on December 16, 2015. Pursuant to the Stock Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of EXO common stock from Ms. McComb in exchange for (i) the issuance to Ms. McComb of 500,000 shares of our unregistered common stock, (ii) a payment of $25,000 to Ms. McComb, (iii) the payment of up to $20,000 to a third party for the payment of certain debts of EXO, and (iv) contingent consideration of up to 700,000 shares of our unregistered common stock in the following amounts upon attainment of EXO gross sales targets in any calendar year following the closing: 100,000 shares if EXO attains gross sales of at least $250,000 but less than $500,000, an additional 150,000 shares if EXO attains gross sales of at least $500,000 but less than $750,000, an additional 200,000 shares if EXO attains gross sales of at least $750,000 but less than $1,000,000 and an additional 250,000 shares if EXO attains gross sales of at least $1,000,000 (the &#8220;Contingent Consideration&#8221;). In order earn the Contingent Consideration, Ms. McComb must be employed by us for the full calendar year during which the annual performance target has been achieved unless such target has been met prior to her separation. In addition to the purchase price, we agreed to invest $50,000 into EXO for inventory, marketing and working capital purposes. Pursuant to the Stock Exchange Agreement, EXO will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company upon the closing of the Stock Exchange. 

&#160;

2&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

In connection with the closing under the Stock Exchange Agreement, EXO entered into an employment agreement with Ms. McComb, pursuant to which Ms. McComb has been engaged as the President of EXO for a term commencing on the closing and ending on December 21, 2019, subject to automatic extensions if neither party has given the other notice that it does not wish to extend the agreement. Ms. McComb will receive an initial salary based on an annual rate to $40,000 for the balance of 2015, $45,000 for 2016 and $50,000 for 2017, and will receive a quarterly bonus equal to 20% EXO&#8217;s EBITDA in the prior quarter, and other benefits as determined by the company&#8217;s board of directors. 

&#160; 

We expect that this group will drive solid opportunities for expansion. We believe that leveraging our infrastructure and operations team will lead to potential acquisitions of undervalued brands in need of our managerial talent and cost control procedures. 

&#160; 

Markets 

&#160; 

We currently have Pizza Fusion franchises in 6 locations in the United States and 9 in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Within the United States, we have franchisees in Florida, New Jersey, and Virginia. We anticipate opening the first Shaker &#38; Pie restaurant Boca Raton, Florida in the second fiscal quarter of 2016. 

&#160; 

Franchise and Development Agreements 

&#160; 

In connection with its franchising operations, we receive initial franchise fee (typically $30,000), area development fees ( historically $250,000 to $300,000 per territory and a reduced franchise fee per location of $5,000 to $7,500 per location depending on the territory), franchise deposits and royalties of 5% of gross revenues of sales at franchised restaurants as defined in the franchise agreement. The term of the franchise agreement is generally for 10 years and may be renewed for two additional terms of 10 years subject to certain conditions, including the payment of a discounted franchise fee. We are currently operating six stores under franchise agreements. 

&#160; 

Under the terms of our franchise agreement, we provide training, opening assistance and an operating manual, have the right to require franchisees source food items, equipment, supplies and certain services from approved suppliers, the right to approve any new menu items and make available to our franchisees information about new developments, techniques, and improvements in the areas of operations, management, and marketing. We also maintain a website for the benefit of ourselves and our franchisees. We have the right, but not the obligation, to establish, maintain, and administer a fund for the marketing of the &#8220;Pizza Fusion&#8221; brand and restaurants. If we establish a marketing fund, a franchisee is obligated to contribute an amount equal to 3% of its gross revenue for a local marketing fund plus an additional 2% of gross revenue if we establish a regional fund to cover a geographical area we have the right to designate. Further, franchisee&#8217;s are obligated to spend an amount equal to 3% of their gross revenues on their own local marketing. We have the right at any time prior to six months before the end of the term of any franchise agreement to inspect a franchised business and require the franchisee to maintain, refurbish, renovate, and upgrade (including purchasing one or more new delivery vehicles). 

&#160; 

An area development agreement grants the developer exclusive right to open a specified number of restaurants in the development area within a specified time period or the agreements may be cancelled by us. Each location must be approved by us and will operate under a separate franchise agreement to be entered into upon selection of a location. A developer generally has a right to use the Pizza Fusion marks and grant sub-franchises within the development area. A developer is obligated to pay us an upfront fully earned fee upon execution of the agreement. We are obligated to provide initial training, on-going support and register the Pizza Fusion trademark in the development area. Furthermore, the developer is subject to certain non-solicitation and non-compete clauses during the term of the agreement and for a two year period after its expiration or termination. The area development agreements may not be assigned without our prior written consent, subject to certain limitations. 

&#160; 

In January 2009, we entered into a ten year area development agreement with a third party to open a total of 10 Pizza Fusion locations in Saudi Arabia in return for a $250,000 development fee. Seven locations have been opened under the terms of this agreement. 

&#160; 

In March 2011, we entered into a restaurant development agreement with a third party to open a total of 38 Pizza Fusion locations by 2019 in the countries of Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. Two locations have been opened under the terms of this agreement and we have agreed to defer the development schedule under this agreement indefinitely. This development agreement expires on December 31, 2023. 

&#160; 

3&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

During the preceding three years, the number of operating franchised restaurants has fluctuated from 11 restaurants in 2013 to a low of seven as of September 30, 2015. There are currently 15 operating Pizza Fusion franchises. As with any franchise system, the number of operating franchises fluctuates over time, and a reduction in the number of franchises may be due to factors outside of the franchisor&#8217;s control. Several Pizza Fusion franchises that were in developing markets in 2008 were forced to cease operations due to the worldwide economic downturn. We also terminated or severed ties with certain franchises due to their non-compliance with our standards so as to negatively affect the image of our brand. Given the early stage of our development and our limited resources, we were not in a position to assume operations of these franchised locations pending identification of replacement operators. We will likely continue to experience fluctuations in the number of franchisees for these and other reasons. 

&#160; 

The natural and organic food industry has grown significantly since we created the concept in 2006. A majority of the products needed to provide natural and organic offerings are readily available through national distribution partners as well as regional and local distribution sources. Fluctuations in commodity costs are expected, are present in all restaurant concepts, and are not unique to operators of natural and organic restaurant concepts. We endeavor to monitor the market pricing of our major commodity items, such as tomatoes, cheese and flour, and seek to secure long-term contracts based on futures pricing. Notwithstanding these efforts, fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly when prices increase precipitously, could adversely affect the operations of our franchisees. 

&#160; 

Research and Development 

&#160; 

We do not engage in any material research and development activities. However, we do engage in ongoing studies to assist with food and menu development. Additionally, we conduct consumer research to determine customers&#8217; preferences, trends, and opinions, as well as to better understand other competitive brands. 

&#160; 

Government Regulation 

&#160; 

We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local laws affecting our business. 

&#160; 

Franchise Regulations 

&#160; 

We are subject to a variety of federal, state, and international laws governing franchise sales and the franchise relationship. In general, these laws and regulations impose certain disclosure and registration requirements prior to the offer and sale of franchises. Rulings of several state and federal courts and existing or proposed federal and state laws demonstrate a trend toward increased protection of the rights and interests of franchisees against franchisors. Such decisions and laws may limit the ability of franchisors to enforce certain provisions of franchise agreements or to alter or terminate franchise agreements. Due to the scope of our business and the complexity of franchise regulations, we may encounter minor compliance issues from time to time. We do not believe, however, that any of these issues will have a material adverse effect on our business. 

&#160; 

Regulations Affecting the Restaurant Industry 

&#160; 

Each of our franchisees&#8217; restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The development and operation of restaurants depends on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, alcoholic beverage control, traffic and other regulations. We have not encountered significant difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses or approvals that could delay the opening of a new restaurant or the operation of an existing restaurant nor do we presently anticipate the occurrence of any such difficulties in the future. 

&#160; 

Our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and various other laws in the United States governing such matters as minimum-wage requirements, overtime, tip credits, other working conditions, safety standards, and hiring and employment practices. Any increases in labor costs might result in our franchisees inadequately staffing stores. Such increases in labor costs and other changes in labor laws could affect store performance and quality of service, decrease royalty revenues and adversely affect our brand. 

&#160; 

Our franchisees&#8217; facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the &#8220;ADA&#8221;) and related state accessibility statutes. Under the ADA and related state laws, our franchisees must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of restaurants, those facilities must be accessible. 

&#160; 

Our franchisees are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. Our franchisees are or may become subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the &#8220;Affordable Care Act&#8221;) requires restaurants, such as our franchisees, to disclose calorie information on their menus. The Food and Drug Administration has proposed rules to implement this provision of the Affordable Care Act that would require restaurants to post the number of calories for most items on menus or menu boards and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request. 

&#160; 

4&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Our franchisees are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. 

&#160; 

Competition 

&#160; 

We believe that our direct competitors, pizza restaurants using natural and organic ingredients, constitute a small minority of operators within the pizza industry. We consider anyone in the fast-casual pizza space as competition and consider operators such as Blaze, Pie Five, Modmarket and Zpizza as our direct competitors within the natural and organic market. 

&#160; 

In addition, the restaurant industry generally is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, brand, attractiveness of facilities, and effectiveness of advertising and marketing. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers&#8217; discretionary purchasing power. Our franchisees compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. We and our franchisees also face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers &#8220;convenient meals&#8221; in the form of improved entr&#233;es and side dishes from the deli section. In addition, improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quick-service restaurants, together with negative economic conditions, could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas. 

&#160; 

Seasonality 

&#160; 

We expect that our sales volumes will fluctuate seasonally. We expect that our average sales will be highest in the spring and winter, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall, and that holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some regions. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 

&#160; 

Trademarks and Service Marks 

&#160; 

We own the service marks for &#8220;Pizza Fusion&#8221; and &#8220;Pizza Fusion Fresh, Organic Earth Friendly&#8221;. These service marks are registered in the United States. We granted our area franchisee in the Middle East the right to register the Pizza Fusion trademark for the term of its franchise agreement with us in certain countries in the Middle East where the franchisee has the right to open Pizza Fusion restaurants. We expect that the service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses will have significant value and be important to our marketing efforts. Registration of the Pizza Fusion and Pizza Fusion Fresh, Organic Earth Friendly service marks expire in our 2018 and 2019 fiscal years, respectively, unless renewed. We expect to renew these registrations at the appropriate time. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of December 24, 2015, we had four full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. 

&#160; 

Former Business Operations and Corporate Information 

&#160; 

We were incorporated in Nevada on April 5, 2005 under the name Tomi Holdings, Inc. In October 2005, we changed our name to InfraBlue (US), Inc., and in October 2007, we changed our name to NextGen Bioscience, Inc. In December 2008, we changed our name to Kalahari Greentech, Inc. In May 2015, we changed our name to PF Hospitality Group, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 399 NW 2 nd Avenue, Suite 216, Boca Raton, Florida 33432. Our telephone number is (561) 939-2520 and our fiscal year end is September 30. Prior to our merger with PF Hospitality Group discussed below, we were a U.S.-based exploration company with a primary focus on projects with prior exploration and production history. 

&#160; 

Effective July 1, 2015, we merged with Pizza Fusion Holdings, Inc. (&#8220;Pizza Fusion&#8221;), a franchisor of organic fare pizza restaurants. As a result of the merger, PF Hospitality Group has become a franchisor of pizza restaurants specializing in organic fare free of artificial additives, such as preservatives, growth hormones, pesticides, nitrates and trans fats. Pursuant to the terms of the May 26, 2015 merger agreement, we acquired 100% of the Pizza Fusion common shares and warrants in exchange for 17,117,268 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 11,411,512 shares of our common stock at $0.25 per share for a period of three years. In addition, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,385,730 warrants to acquire the Company&#8217;s common stock at $0.25 per share for a period of three years in exchange for previously issued and outstanding warrants to purchase Pizza Fusion Holdings, Inc. common stock. Also, Pizza Fusion&#8217;s founders, Vaughan Dugan and Randy Romano, each purchased 21,441,366 shares of our common stock and 1,000,000 shares of our Series A preferred stock at a price of $.0001 per share. The shares are restricted and subject to the conditions set forth in Rule 144. Holders of convertible debt in the original principal amount of $65,600 agreed as part of the merger to limit the number of shares issuable upon conversion of to such debt to 40,000,000 shares of our common stock. Upon completion of the merger, Vaughan Dugan was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and Randy Romano was appointed as President. Messrs. Dugan and Romano were also appointed to the Company&#8217;s board of directors. David Kugelman resigned from his position as Chief Executive Officer and Director. 

&#160; 

5&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

Financings 

&#160; 

Under the terms of the securities purchase agreement dated July 27, 2015, we issued and sold a $1,333,334 principal amount of convertible debentures due July 27, 2020 for a price of $1,200,000. Proceeds from this debenture will be paid to the company as follows: $140,000 upon signing with the balance payable in five consecutive monthly installments of $212,000 commencing on September 1, 2015. The company agreed to pay interest for the first 12 months at the rate of 10% per annum on the amounts advanced payable in cash in six equal tranches, the first of which is due on date the company closed on the financing and remainder will be due on each of the first five monthly anniversaries of such date. 

&#160; 

Under the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement entered into as part of the offering, the company agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 60 days of the closing date covering the public resale of the shares of common stock underlying the debentures, and to use its best efforts to cause the registration statement to be declared effective within 180 days from the closing date. Should the number of shares of common stock the company is permitted to include in the initial registration statement be limited pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, the company further agreed to file additional registration statements with the SEC to register any remaining shares. We will pay all costs associated with the registration statements, other than underwriting commissions and discounts. The parties to the Registration Rights Agreement have agreed to defer the Company&#8217;s obligation to file a registration statement until further notice by the holders of the convertible debt. 

&#160; 

The terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement contain certain negative covenants by the company, unless consent of purchasers holding at least 75% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding debentures, including prohibitions on: incurrence of certain indebtedness and liens, amendment to our articles of incorporation or bylaws, repayment or repurchase of the company&#8217;s common stock or debts, sell substantially all of its assets or merger with another entity, pay cash dividends or enter into any related party transactions. We granted investors certain pro-rata rights of first refusal on future offerings by the company for as long as the investor(s) beneficially own any of the debentures. 

&#160; 

The debentures are convertible into shares of the company&#8217;s common stock at a conversion price equal to 65% of the lowest traded price of its common stock for the twenty trading days prior to each conversion date subject to adjustment. The conversion price of the debentures is subject to proportional adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock dividends and similar corporate events. In addition, the conversion price is subject to adjustment if the company issues or sells shares of its common stock for a consideration per share less than the conversion price then in effect, or issue options, warrants or other securities convertible or exchange for shares of its common stock at a conversion or exercise price less than the conversion price of the debentures then in effect. If either of these events should occur, the conversion price is reduced to the lowest price at which these securities were issued or are exercisable. The debentures shares are not convertible to the extent that (a) the number of shares of the company&#8217;s common stock beneficially owned by the holder and (b) the number of shares of the company&#8217;s common stock issuable upon the conversion of the debentures or otherwise would result in the beneficial ownership by holder of more than 4.99% of the company&#8217;s then outstanding common stock. This ownership limitation can be increased or decreased to any percentage not exceeding 9.99% by the holder upon 61 days&#8217; notice to the company. 

&#160; 

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

&#160; 

Emerging Growth Company 

&#160; 

We are an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the &#8220;JOBS Act&#8221;). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not &#8220;emerging growth companies&#8221; including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &#8220;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&#8221;), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions. 

&#160; 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an &#8220;emerging growth company&#8221; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

&#160; 

6&#160; 

&#160;

&#160; 

We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a &#8220;large accelerated filer&#8221; as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. 

&#160; 

Smaller Reporting Company 

&#160; 

We also qualify as a &#8220;smaller reporting company&#8221; under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. 

&#160;
