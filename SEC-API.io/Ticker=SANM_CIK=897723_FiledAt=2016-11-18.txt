Industry Overview 

&#160; 

EMS companies are the principal beneficiaries of the increased use of outsourced manufacturing services by the electronics and other industries. Outsourced manufacturing refers to an OEM's use of EMS companies to manufacture their products, rather than using internal manufacturing resources. As the EMS industry has evolved, OEMs have increased their reliance on EMS companies for design services, core technology development and additional, more complex manufacturing services. Today, EMS companies manufacture and test complete systems and manage their customers' entire supply chains. Industry-leading EMS companies offer end-to-end services including product design and engineering, manufacturing, final system assembly and test, direct-order-fulfillment and logistics services, after-market product service and support, and global supply chain management. 

&#160; 

We believe OEMs will continue to outsource manufacturing because it allows them to: 

&#160; 

&#8226; 

focus on core competencies; 

&#8226; 

access leading design and engineering capabilities; 

&#8226; 

improve supply chain management and purchasing power; 

&#8226; 

reduce operating costs and capital investment; 

&#8226; 

access global manufacturing services; and 

&#8226; 

accelerate time to market. 

&#160; Our Business Strategy 

&#160; 

Our objective is to enhance our leadership position in the technology industry. Key elements of our strategy include: 

Capitalizing on Our Comprehensive Solutions. We intend to capitalize on our end-to-end solutions which we believe will allow us to sell additional solutions to our existing customers and attract new customers. Our end-to-end solutions include product design and engineering, manufacturing, final system assembly and test, direct order fulfillment and logistics services, after-market product service and support, and global supply chain management. Our vertically integrated manufacturing solutions enable us to manufacture additional system components and subassemblies for our customers. When we provide a customer with a number of services, such as component manufacturing or higher value-added solutions, we are often able to improve our margins and profitability. Consequently, our goal is to increase the number of manufacturing programs for which we provide multiple solutions. To achieve this goal, our sales and marketing organization seeks to cross-sell our solutions to customers. 

&#160; 

Extending Our Technology Capabilities. We rely on advanced processes and technologies to provide our products, components and vertically integrated manufacturing solutions. We continually improve our manufacturing processes and develop more advanced technologies, providing competitive advantage to our customers. We work with our customers to anticipate their future product and manufacturing requirements and align our technology investment activities with their needs. We use our design expertise to develop product technology platforms that we can customize by incorporating other components and subassemblies to meet the needs of particular OEMs. These technologies enhance our ability to manufacture complex, high-value added products, enhancing our ability to continue to win business from existing and new customers. 

Attracting and Retaining Long-Term Customer Partnerships. &#32;A core component of our strategy is to attract, build and retain long-term partnerships with companies in growth industries that will benefit from our global footprint and unique value proposition in advanced electronics manufacturing. As a result of this customer-centric approach, we have experienced business growth from both existing and new customers and will continue to cultivate these partnerships with additional products and value-added solutions. 

Promoting New Product Introduction (NPI) and Joint Design Manufacturing (JDM) Solutions. As a result of customer feedback, and our customers' desire to manage research and development expenses, we offer product design services to develop systems and components jointly with our customers. Our NPI services include quick-turn prototyping, supply chain readiness, functional test development and release-to-volume production. In a JDM model, our customers bring market knowledge and product requirements and we bring complete design engineering and NPI services. Our design engineering offerings include product architecture development, detailed design, simulation, test and validation, system integration, regulatory and qualification services. 

&#160; 

Continuing to Penetrate Diverse End Markets. We focus our marketing and sales efforts on major end markets within the electronics technology industry. We target markets we believe offer significant growth opportunities and for which OEMs sell complex products that are subject to rapid technological change because the manufacturing of these products requires higher value-added services. We intend to continue to diversify our business across market segments and customers to reduce our dependence on any particular market or customer. 

&#160; 

Pursuing Strategic Transactions. We seek to undertake strategic transactions that give us the opportunity to access new customers' products, manufacturing solutions, repair service capabilities, intellectual property, technologies and geographic markets. In addition, we plan to continue to pursue OEM divestiture transactions that will augment existing strategic customer relationships or build new relationships with customers in attractive end markets. In an OEM divestiture transaction, we purchase manufacturing assets from a customer and enter into a long-term supply agreement with such customer to provide products previously manufactured by them. Potential future transactions may include a variety of different business arrangements, including acquisitions, asset purchases, spin-offs, strategic partnerships, restructurings and divestitures. 

&#160; 

Continuing to Seek Cost Savings and Efficiency Improvements. We seek to optimize our facilities to provide cost-effective services for our customers. We maintain extensive operations in lower cost locations, including Latin America, Eastern Europe, China, Southeast Asia and India, and we plan to expand our presence in these lower cost locations as appropriate to meet the needs of our customers. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of future opportunities on a global basis as a result of our existing manufacturing footprint in 23 countries on six continents. 

Our Competitive Strengths 

We believe our competitive strengths differentiate us from our competitors and enable us to better serve the needs of OEMs. Our competitive strengths include: 

&#160;

System solutions for these industry segments are supported by our vertically integrated component technologies, namely printed circuit boards, backplanes, enclosures, cable assemblies, precision machining, plastics, memory modules, and optical, RF and microelectronics modules. 

&#160; 

In these engagement models, our customers bring market knowledge and product requirements. We provide complete design engineering and new product introductions (NPI) services. For JDM products, typically the intellectual property is jointly owned by us and the customer and we perform manufacturing and logistics services. For CDM projects, customers pay for all services and own the intellectual property. 

&#160; 

Vertically Integrated Manufacturing Solutions. We provide a range of vertically integrated manufacturing solutions including high-technology components, new product introduction and test development services. These solutions are provided in every major region worldwide, with design and prototyping close to our customer&#8217;s product development centers. Our customers benefit significantly from our experience in these areas, including product cost reduction, minimization of assets deployed for manufacturing, accelerated time-to-market and a simplified supply chain. Key system components we 

manufacture include high-technology printed circuit boards and printed circuit board assemblies, backplanes and backplane assemblies, enclosures, cable assemblies, precision machined components, optical and RF modules and memory modules. These components and sub-assemblies are integrated into a final product or system, configured and tested to our customer&#8217;s or the end-customer&#8217;s specifications and delivered to the final point of use, with Sanmina managing the entire supply chain. By manufacturing system components and subassemblies ourselves, we enhance continuity of supply and reduce costs for our customers. In addition, we are able to have greater control over the supply chain of our customers' products. 

Customers also benefit from our combined design, technology and manufacturing experience with specific products and markets. For example, in communications networks, we have over 30 years of experience in developing high-speed printed circuit boards ("PCBs") and backplanes. Examples of products for which our experience and vertically integrated model provide competitive advantage include wireless base stations, network switches, routers and gateways, optical switches, servers and storage appliances, set-top boxes, avionics and satellite systems, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computer tomography (CT) scanners, and equipment used in semiconductor manufacturing processes, including equipment for photolithography, chemical mechanical polishing, vapor deposition and robotics for wafer transfer. For these and many other products, customers can gain competitive advantage with our manufacturing technology, while reducing the capital requirements associated with manufacturing and global supply chain management. 

&#160; 

Advanced Component Technologies. We provide advanced component technologies which we believe allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. These advanced technologies include the fabrication of complex printed circuit boards, backplanes, enclosures, precision machining and plastic components. For example, we produce some of the most advanced printed circuit boards and backplanes in the world, with up to 70 layers and process capabilities including a range of low signal loss, high performance materials, buried capacitance and thin-film resistors, high-density interconnects and micro via technology. We also manufacture high-density flex and rigid-flex printed circuit boards with up to 32 layers and 8 transition layers in support of defense and aerospace markets and high-end medical electronics.

We have also developed build-to-order (BTO) and configure-to-order (CTO) systems and processes that enable us to manufacture and ship finished systems in as little as 8 hours after receipt of an order. We utilize a centralized Technology Council to coordinate the development and introduction of new technologies to meet our customers' needs in various locations and to increase technical collaboration among our facilities and divisions. 

&#160; 

Global Manufacturing Capabilities. Most of our customers compete and sell their products on a global basis. As such, they require global solutions that include regional manufacturing for selected end markets, especially when time to market, local manufacturing or content and low cost solutions are critical objectives. Our global network of manufacturing facilities in 23 countries provides our customers a combination of sites to maximize both the benefits of regional and low cost manufacturing solutions and repair services. Our repair partners are located in an additional 23 countries. 

We offer customers five regions in which all of our technology and components, integrated manufacturing and logistics solutions can be implemented and can serve both regional and global business needs. To manage and coordinate our global operations, we employ an enterprise-wide ERP system at substantially all of our manufacturing locations that operates on a single IT platform and provides us with company-wide information regarding component inventories and orders. This system enables us to standardize planning and purchasing at the facility level and to optimize inventory management and utilization worldwide. Our systems also enable our customers to receive key information regarding the status of their programs. 

&#160; 

We purchase large quantities of electronic components and other materials from a wide range of suppliers. Our primary supply chain goal is to consolidate our global spend to create the synergy and leverage to drive our supply base for better cost competitiveness, more favorable terms and leading-edge supply chain solutions. As a result, we often receive more favorable terms and supply chain solutions from suppliers, which generally enables us to provide our customers with greater total cost reductions than they could obtain themselves. Our strong supplier relationships often enable us to obtain electronic components and other materials that are in short supply and provide us the necessary support to optimize the use of our inventories. 

&#160; 

Supply chain management also involves the planning, purchasing and warehousing of product components. A key objective of our supply chain management services is to reduce excess component inventory in the supply chain by scheduling deliveries of components at a competitive price and on a just-in-time basis. We use sophisticated production management systems to manage our procurement and manufacturing processes in an efficient and cost effective manner. We collaborate with our customers to enable us to respond to their changing component requirements and to reflect any changes in these requirements in our production management systems. These systems enable us to forecast future supply and demand imbalances and develop strategies to help our customers manage their component requirements. Our enterprise-wide ERP systems provide us with company-wide information regarding component inventories and orders to optimize inventories, planning and purchasing at the facility level. 

Customer-Focused Organization. We believe customer relationships are critical to our success and we are focused on providing a high level of customer service. Our key customer accounts are managed by dedicated account teams including a global account manager directly responsible for account management. Global account managers coordinate activities across divisions to effectively satisfy our customers' requirements and have direct access to our senior management to quickly address customer opportunities and needs. Local customer account teams further support the global teams. 

&#160; 

Expertise in Serving Diverse End Markets. We have experience in serving our customers in the communications networks, embedded computing, storage, industrial, defense and aerospace, medical, and energy markets. Our diversification across end markets reduces our dependence upon any one customer or segment.

Integrated Manufacturing Solutions includes: 

&#160; &#160; 

Printed Circuit Board Assembly and Test. Printed circuit board assembly involves attaching electronic components, such as integrated circuits, capacitors, microprocessors, resistors and memory modules, to printed circuit boards. The most common technologies used to attach components to printed circuit boards employ surface mount technology (SMT) and pin-through-hole assembly (PTH). SMT is an automated assembly system that places and solders components to the printed circuit board. In PTH, components are inserted into holes punched in the circuit board. Another method is press-fit-technology, in which components are pressed into holes on the printed circuit board. We use SMT, PTH, press-fit and other attachment technologies that are focused on miniaturization and increasing the density of component placement on printed circuit boards. These technologies, which support the needs of our customers to provide greater functionality in smaller products, include chip-scale packaging, ball grid array, direct chip attach and high density interconnect. We perform in-circuit and functional testing of printed circuit board assemblies. In-circuit testing verifies that all components are properly inserted and attached, and that electrical circuits are complete. We perform functional tests to confirm the board or assembly operates in accordance with its final design and manufacturing specifications. We either design and procure test fixtures and develop our own test software, or we use our customers' test fixtures and test software. In addition, we provide environmental stress tests of the board or assembly that are designed to confirm that the board or assembly will meet the environmental stresses, such as heat, to which it will be subjected. 

Final System Assembly and Test. We provide final system assembly and test in which assemblies and modules are combined to form complete, finished products. Products for which we currently provide final system assembly and test include wireless base stations, wireline communications switches, optical networking products, high-end servers, industrial and automotive products, LED lighting fixtures, diagnostic medical equipment, point of sale devices, set-top boxes and storage. We often integrate Sanmina-manufactured printed circuit board assemblies with enclosures, cables and memory modules. Our final assembly activities may also involve integrating components and modules that others manufacture. The complex, finished products we produce typically require extensive test protocols. We offer both 

functional and environmental test services. We also test products for conformity to applicable industry, product integrity and regulatory standards. Our test engineering expertise enables us to design functional test processes that assess critical performance elements including hardware, software and reliability. By incorporating rigorous test processes into the manufacturing process, we can help assure our customers that their products will function as designed. 

Direct-Order-Fulfillment. We provide direct-order-fulfillment for our OEM customers. Direct-order-fulfillment involves receiving customer orders, configuring products to quickly fill the orders and delivering the products either to the OEM, a distribution channel such as a retail outlet, or directly to the end customer. We manage our direct-order-fulfillment processes using a core set of common systems and processes that receive order information from the customer and provide comprehensive supply chain management including procurement and production planning. These systems and processes enable us to process orders for multiple system configurations and varying production quantities including single units. Our direct-order-fulfillment services include BTO and CTO capabilities: in BTO, we build a system with the particular configuration ordered by the OEM customer; in CTO, we configure systems to an end customer's order, for example by installing software desired by the end customer. The end customer typically places this order by choosing from a variety of possible system configurations and options. Using advanced manufacturing processes and a real-time warehouse management and data control system on the manufacturing floor, we can meet a 48 to 72 hour turn-around-time for BTO and CTO requests. We support our direct-order-fulfillment services with logistics that include delivery of parts and assemblies to the final assembly site, distribution and shipment of finished systems and processing of customer returns. Our systems support direct-order-fulfillment for a variety of products, such as servers, workstations, set-top boxes and medical devices.

Our engineering teams are available on a worldwide basis to support designers in Design for Manufacturability (DFM) analysis and assemblers with field applications support. 

&#160; 

Printed circuit boards are made of fiberglass/resin-laminated material layers and contain copper circuits which interconnect and transmit electrical signals among the components that make up electronic devices. Increasing the density of the circuitry in each layer is accomplished by reducing the width of the circuit traces and placing them closer together in the printed circuit board along with adding layers and via hole structures. We are currently capable of efficiently producing printed circuit boards with up to 70 layers and circuit trace widths as narrow as two mils (50 micron) in production volumes. Specialized production equipment along with an in-depth understanding of high performance laminate materials allow us to fabricate some of the largest form factor and highest speed (frequencies in excess of 25 gigahertz or GHz) backplanes available in the industry. 

&#160; 

Backplanes and Backplane Assemblies. Backplanes are very large printed circuit boards that serve as the backbones of sophisticated electronics products, such as internet routers. Backplanes provide interconnections for printed circuit board assemblies, integrated circuits and other electronic components. We fabricate backplanes in our printed circuit board plants. Backplane fabrication is significantly more complex than printed circuit board fabrication 

due to the large size and thickness of the backplanes. We manufacture backplane assemblies by press-fitting high density connectors into plated through-holes in the bare backplane. In addition, many of the newer, advanced technology backplanes require SMT attachment of passive discrete components as well as high-pin count ball grid array packages. These advanced assembly processes require specialized equipment and a strong focus on quality and process control. We also perform in-circuit and functional tests on backplane assemblies. We have developed proprietary technology and &#8220;know-how&#8221; which enable backplanes to run at data rates in excess of 25 Gbps. We currently have capabilities to manufacture backplanes with greater than 60 layers in sizes up to 26x40 and 22x52 inches and up to 0.425 inches in thickness, using a wide variety of high performance laminate materials. These are among the largest and most complex commercially manufactured backplanes. We are one of a limited number of manufacturers with these capabilities. 

&#160; 

Cable Assemblies. Cable assemblies are used to connect modules, assemblies and subassemblies in electronic devices. We provide a broad range of cable assembly products and services, from cable assemblies and harnesses for automobiles, to complex harnesses for industrial products and semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

&#160; Customers 

&#160; 

A small number of customers have historically generated a significant portion of our net sales. Sales to our ten largest customers typically represent approximately 50% of our net sales. In 2016, Nokia represented more than 10% of our net sales (inclusive of Alcatel-Lucent, which Nokia acquired in 2016). No single customer represented more than 10% of our net sales in 2015 or 2014. 

&#160; 

We seek to establish and maintain long-term relationships with our customers. Historically, we have had substantial recurring sales from existing customers. We seek to expand our customer base through our marketing and sales efforts as well as acquisitions. We have been successful in broadening relationships with customers by providing vertically integrated products and services as well as multiple products and services in multiple locations. 

&#160; 

We typically enter into supply agreements with our major OEM customers with terms ranging from three to five years. Our supply agreements generally do not obligate the customer to purchase minimum quantities of products. However, the customer is typically liable for the cost of the materials and components we have ordered to meet their production forecast but which are not used, provided that the material was ordered in accordance with an agreed-upon procurement plan. In some cases, the procurement plan contains provisions regarding the types of materials for which our customers will assume responsibility. Our supply agreements generally contain provisions permitting cancellation and rescheduling of orders upon notice and, in some cases, are subject to cancellation and rescheduling charges. Order cancellation charges vary by product 

type, depending how far in advance of shipment a customer notifies us of an order cancellation. In some circumstances, our supply agreements with customers include provisions for cost reduction objectives during the term of the agreement, which can have the effect of reducing revenue and profitability from these arrangements. 

We generally do not obtain firm, long-term commitments from our customers under supply agreements. As a result, customers can cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay orders. Even in those cases in which customers are contractually obligated to purchase products from us or purchase unused inventory from us that we have ordered for them, we may elect not to immediately enforce our contractual rights because of the long-term nature of our customer relationships or for other business reasons and may instead negotiate accommodations with customers regarding particular situations. 

Seasonality 

With the continued diversification of our customer base, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality in our business in recent years. 

Backlog 

&#160; 

We generally do not obtain firm, long-term commitments from our customers. Instead, our procurement of inventory and our manufacturing activities are based primarily on forecasts provided by our customers. This enables us to minimize the time lapse between receipt of a customer's order and delivery of product to the customer. Customers usually do not make firm orders for product delivery more than thirty to ninety days in advance. Additionally, customers may cancel or postpone scheduled deliveries, generally without significant penalty. Therefore, we do not believe the backlog of expected product sales covered by firm orders is a meaningful measure of future sales. 

Marketing and Sales 

&#160; 

Our sales efforts are organized and managed on a regional basis with regional sales managers in geographic regions throughout the world. 

&#160; 

We develop relationships with our customers and market our vertically integrated manufacturing solutions through our direct sales force and marketing and sales staff. Our sales resources are directed at multiple management and staff levels within target accounts. Our direct sales personnel work closely with the customers' engineering and technical personnel to better understand their requirements. Our marketing and sales staff supports our business strategy of providing end-to-end solutions by encouraging cross-selling of vertically integrated manufacturing solutions and component manufacturing across a broad range of major OEM products. To achieve this objective, our marketing and sales staff works closely with our various manufacturing and design and engineering groups and engages in marketing and sales activities targeted at key customer opportunities. 

&#160; 

Each of our key customer accounts is managed by a dedicated account team including a global account manager directly responsible for account management. Global account managers coordinate activities across divisions to effectively satisfy customer requirements and have direct access to our senior management to quickly address customer concerns. Local customer account teams further support the global teams. 

Business Segment Data and our Foreign Operations 

We have one reportable segment - Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (IMS). Financial information for segments can be found in Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Information concerning revenues, results of operations, assets and revenues by geographic area is set forth in Item 7, &#8220;Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations&#8221; and in Note 13, &#8220;Business Segment, Geographic and Customer Information&#8221;, to our consolidated financial statements. Risks attendant to our foreign operations can be found in Item 1A. &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221;. 

Competition 

&#160; 

For our integrated manufacturing solutions business, we face competition from other major global EMS companies such as Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Celestica, Inc., Flextronics International Ltd., Jabil Circuits, Inc., and Plexus Corp. Our components, products and services business faces competition from EMS and non-EMS companies that often have a regional product, service or industry-specific focus. In addition, our potential customers may also compare the benefits of outsourcing their manufacturing to us with the merits of manufacturing products themselves. 

We compete with different companies depending on the type of solution or geographic area. We believe the primary competitive factors in our industry include manufacturing technology, quality, global footprint, delivery, responsiveness, provision of value-added solutions and price. We believe our primary competitive strengths include our ability to provide global end-to-end solutions, product design and engineering resources, vertically integrated manufacturing solutions, advanced technologies, global manufacturing capabilities, global supplier base, customer focus and responsiveness, and expertise in serving diverse end markets. 

Intellectual Property 

&#160; 

We hold U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications relating to, among other things, printed circuit board manufacturing technology, enclosures, cables, memory modules, optical technology and computing and storage. For other proprietary processes, we rely primarily on trade secret protection. A number of our patents have expired or will expire in the near term. The expiration and abandonment of patents reduces our ability to assert claims against competitors or others who use similar technologies and to license such patents to third parties. We have registered certain trademarks and pending trademark applications in both the U.S. and internationally. 

Environmental Matters 

&#160; 

We are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage and use of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes, as well as the storage, treatment, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous waste that are by-products of these processes. We are also subject to occupational safety and health laws, product labeling and product content requirements, either directly or as required by our customers. Proper waste disposal is a major consideration for printed circuit board manufacturers due to the metals and chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Water used in the printed circuit board manufacturing process must be treated to remove metal particles and other contaminants before it can be discharged into municipal sanitary sewer systems. We operate on-site wastewater treatment systems at our printed circuit board manufacturing plants in order to treat wastewater generated in the fabrication process. 

&#160; 

Additionally, the electronics assembly process can generate lead dust. Upon vacating a facility, we are responsible for remediating lead dust from the interior of the manufacturing facility. Although there are no applicable standards for lead dust remediation in manufacturing facilities, we endeavor to remove the residues. To date, lead dust remediation costs have not been material to our results of operations. We also monitor for airborne concentrations of lead in our buildings and are unaware of any significant lead concentrations in excess of the applicable OSHA or other local standards. 

We have a range of corporate programs that aim to reduce the use of hazardous materials in manufacturing. We developed corporate-wide standardized environmental management systems, auditing programs and policies to enable better management of environmental compliance activities. For example, almost all of our manufacturing facilities are also certified under ISO 14001, a set of standards and procedures relating to environmental compliance management. In addition, the electronics industry must adhere to the European Union's Restrictions of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Parallel initiatives have been adopted in other jurisdictions throughout the world, including several states in the U.S. and the Peoples' Republic of China. RoHS limits the use of lead, mercury and other specified substances in electronics products. WEEE requires producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components. We implemented procedures intended to ensure our manufacturing processes are compliant with RoHS and the European Union's Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) legislation, when required. WEEE compliance is primarily the responsibility of OEMs. 

Asbestos containing materials, or ACM, are present at several of our manufacturing facilities. Although ACM is being managed and controls have been put in place pursuant to ACM operations and maintenance plans, the presence of ACM could give rise to remediation obligations and other liabilities. 

&#160; 

Our facilities generally operate under environmental permits issued by governmental authorities. For the most part, these permits must be renewed periodically and are subject to revocation in the event of violations of environmental laws. Any such revocation may require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, adversely affecting our results of operations. 

In connection with certain acquisitions, we have incurred liabilities associated with environmental contamination. These include ongoing investigation and remediation activities at a number of current and former sites, including those located in Owego, New York; Derry, New Hampshire; and Brockville, Ontario. In addition, we have been named in a lawsuit alleging operations at our current and former facilities in Orange County, California contributed to groundwater contamination and also 

have ongoing investigation and remediation activities at other sites in Orange County, California. There are some sites, including our acquired facility in Gunzenhausen, Germany, that are known to have groundwater contamination caused by a third-party, and that third-party has provided indemnification to us for the related liability. However, in certain situations, third-party indemnities may not be effective to reduce our liability for environmental contamination. 

We use environmental consultants primarily for risk assessments and remediation, including remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial action planning and design and site remediation. Our consultants provide information regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, acceptable remediation alternatives and estimated costs associated with each remediation alternative. We consider their recommendations together with other information when determining the appropriate amount to accrue for environmental liabilities. 

&#160; 

Employees 

&#160; 

As of October 1, 2016 , we had approximately 45,397 &#32; employees, including approximately 10,439 temporary employees. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. In some international locations, our employees are represented by labor unions on either a national or plant level or are subject to collective bargaining agreements.
